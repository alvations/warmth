What is to do it, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither VOL the place, nor the "confectionery."
The new councilmen of the capital from the numbers of the ČSSD will have to overcome obviously certain language barriers, in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prager advice and in the city agency at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz "knocked off" members of the new advice from the ČSSD times a little, how they control the notorious Slang, which nationalized itself in the last years, in which the today's coalition partners in Prague at the rudder were.
The coded vocabulary, which was introduced in the verflossenen era by mayor Pavel Bém by the Prager political elite, is unites the most well-known participants, situations and Causae taken.
Surprisingly it showed up that the new advice grope regarding these new terms somewhat in the dark.
They maintain that at least.
"Who is VOL the place?"
"No notion."
"I am rather a beginner in the Prager politics," reacted Lukáš Kaucký, the new councilman for culture, on the test of the "godfather vocabulary."
In addition, the councilman Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example on the term "gulf hole."
"That is the only expression of those, which submit here you to me, which I use now and then."
"Otherwise do not hold I much of Slang."
From the vocabulary, which the day sheet Aktuálně.cz had published in June of this year before the congress of choice of the ODS, pickte the editorship of six terms, out above all such, which are notoriously with the Prager municipal authorities connected.
The Social Democrats should the terms "VOL the place," "largest Prager gulf hole," "into the confectionery go," "bull necks," "betrayal of the capital" and "sheet metals" defining.
Three Prager councilmen agreed the test, fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future boss of the Prager of public education - promised first its participation in the discussion, did not remove then however not times the listener.
The fifth councilman, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the beginning.
"These things are me all the same and like the civil democrats among themselves maintained, about it judge themselves I not."
"For me is important, like we within the framework of our programs understand themselves," countered it.
As already suggested, Lukáš Kaucký in the headline mentioned above would allegedly not have recognized that of the influential entrepreneur and friend of the ex mayor Bém, novel Janoušek is the speech.
The term "VOL the place" does not say nothing at all to Kaucky and the only term, which it guessed with the test correctly, was purely "the largest Prager gulf hole."
"That is the tunnel Blanka," says Kaucký, however still added for security: "However I know rather from the newspaper."
And jokeful: "I will probably have to occupy a language course."
The "gulf hole" is then deciphered correctly not only of Matador Karel Březina, but also of the advice gentleman for environmental questions Lukáš Plachý as tunnel Blanka.
Both in addition, Social Democrats know, for whom the term VOL the place stands and suspects Lukáš Plachý even, where this figure is to be found and thus also, what it is called, "into the confectionery to go."
"I believe, i.e., into any Prager catering trade enterprise to go," is Plachý quite close on to the mystery solution, if one knows that it concerns here the seat of Janoušeks companies.
Agreeing with Březina it protests however these knowledge rather from the newspaper to have drawn that this vocabulary would be own to it.
By the test participants to judge, it seems to actually give no similarly nationalized Slang among the Social Democrats.
"I asked also my colleagues, but obviously it does not give such a thing with us really."
"We calls ourselves with the name, now and then use we also contractions or nicknames," say the chairman of the Prager ČSSD Petr Hulínský - of its party comrades casually "Hulda" mentioned.
"At school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I do not know whether also my colleagues in such a way call, betray me" us Karel Březina its nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz tried out and sees the name there - it functions.
Councilman Weinert is friendly for the party comrades friendly the "Grandpa" or less the "old person," who representative Miroslav pounds, which made attentive before the elections by machinations with party sponsoring on itself, from some colleagues "Igráček" (well-known Czech Lego figure) called.
Nicknames are so the only one, which the Social Democrats in the within the party linguistic usage permit.
Hulínský does not like it allegedly, if one calls him "Hulda," but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered still another another nickname of the Prager chairman.
His nickname "doctor of the rubber club rights" it has to do allegedly with the fact that Petr Hulínský acquired its title Doctor juris at the Bratislaver police academy.
The government wants to prevent the torture of "witches" and published a brochure
Women, who are stamped in Burkina Faso to witches, usually exhibit some common social characteristics.
They do not belong rather to the older generation, them find a work - for example for health reasons, they are not single and have children.
If one of these women isolated it to the witch "," strictly, so that it can become not dangerous the remainder of the village.
"Men are quite rarely affected by this fate."
To "also this remains saved young and healthy women, since they help with the work and children bear, describes" a medal sister the situation, which worries in the capital of the West African State of Burkina Faso in a special home about more than one hundred women, who were discharged by their communities.
The local government decided now to proceed against this abnorme "social measure."
And a brochure gave change for this reason, which was to prevent "witch pursuit."
The thing has however a hook.
"Can more than 70 per cent of all adults in Burkina Faso not read," referred the newspaper "that standard" to the dilemma of the written clearing-up.
In addition, the Hexerei to be accused is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-jährige Ammy Hemmahová of three women and two men was tortured to death - they poured over her with petroleum and ignited them simply.
On this incident among other things also the server BBC reported.
The authors stated however, the thing would have been only a meeting of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version oil inflamed, which is used for ritual Salbungen.
, After the group tried, "a bad spirit" from the woman "to drive out."
Humans support the isolation of "witches" here without consideration for their education.
"The standard" for this entrepreneur from Burkina Faso quoted a 42-jährigen: "Eating gutters of human souls are in former times like today a danger," said he.
While itself the government in Burkina Faso endeavors at least to defuse the witch hunt the Gambia niche president mixed together properly last year the president.
"President Yahya Jammeh kindled a monströse witch hunt, since these had allegedly portion to their death and now would try, for the death of his aunt also the president by black magic to kill."
"To it he called Schamane from close Guinea to assistance, those accompanied by policemen, soldiers and the body guard of the president indiscriminately arrested women and men by force from Gambia niches villages kidnapped and on the farm of the president in Kanilai brought," stated the organization Amnesty International in their report.
On the farm eingekerkerten humans were forced to drink a Absud from plants with halluzinogener effect which caused in addition, intestine and kidney problems.
Two of locked humans did not survive the stay on the farm.
Only due to the international pressure those were again released almost thousand prisoners.
A tenant of Bakala: It heats in the furnace - nevertheless higher rent pays
An older untersetzter man leaves the straight client center of the society RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest owner of private of flat lets for rent in Czech Republic.
Under the arm a briefcase with three new leases to three dwellings: for the own and the dwellings of its daughters and its son, who serve a straight detention.
All three in the context of the so-called "deregulation" the straight rent was increased.
Instead of of 3500 crowns monthly rent is to shell out the son in the next year for a 2-Zimmer-Wohnung with kitchen of the second category 4100 crowns.
"And there there is warm water to heat flowing in the dwelling not times and must one in a simple coal furnace," does not tap it annoyed with the finger on the new lease of the son, to its signing it an authority has.
"However which - signed I," explains it half detuned and half resigned.
The citizen combination BytyOKD.cz, which called the new renting conditions "inkorrekt and immorally," guesses/advises the tenants not to sign and by 7 December wait the new contracts simply, on which it intends to publish a guidance, as one proceeds against such contracts.
But the man only declines.
"One says this, the other one," makes it a dark face.
The region Ostrava becomes in such a way the large "Deregulierungslabor."
After New Year this deregulation is approaching for most flat lets for rent in Czech Republic, whose tenant pays so far no rent corresponding to real market conditions.
Aktuálně.cz decided to visit this "laboratory" personally.
The RPG waiting area in Havířov is one of four in the region Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday breaking fully.
Directly beside the door the bodyguards of a safety agency stand and with it call equipment.
"Rent 2011," then shines a special palpation field on the Touchscreen.
Briefly touched lightly and already the equipment spits a number note out.
We have the number "157" deciphered and already hardly beep them on the large display at the cover of the waiting area.
Is a half second later one in turn.
An older married couple enters the waiting area somewhat later, in order to ask for the rent, but the attack in the waiting area is not valid for the new rent obviously at all.
Most people are here, in order to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance affairs and the like.
Starting from in the middle of November flutter in the region Ostrava the covers with the new leases most tenants that altogether 44,000 dwellings of the portfolio of the RPG into the mail boxes.
The RPG Byty proposes in the letters a rent increase from approx. 15 to 38 per cent.
The special switch for the new rents in the client center is opened since 18 November.
"The action runs somewhat over one week, i.e., that is only the beginning," answers the ladies behind the switch after one moment hesitating, when the "client" emerges as a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakalas former mountain worker's dwellings are an explosive topic.
Before the elections the parliament vice-president Lubomír Zaorálek originating from Ostrava had taken up this topic by the ČSSD quite loud neck, no miracle that today the newspapers are full of it.
" I want twenty years from them a new Fußboden."
" Not times ne besch. They knew WC-eyeglasses auswechseln" , the initially mentioned man makes himself air.
Up to now above all pensioners at the switch line up according to the woman employees, in order to convince itself whether they keep the promised tenant moderation, which promises real them RPG, if they sign the special offer in time.
Into the benefit of one to the half reduced February rent also the other tenants are to come, who sign the new lease by 15 December.
Up to now is " Deregulierungsschalter" in Havířov however everything else, as if overloads from demands.
" From the 360 clients of yesterday only about 40 to 50 of the rent was in the year 2011 because of hier" , the switch woman officials estimate.
RPG offers thereby both on its web pages, and blackboards individual renting agreements, where it appears necessary.
If the renting parties should not agree however on the new rent, them of an independent court one specify.
" That should be no threat, but is too verstehen" as information over the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach; , RPG explains on its web pages.
" Here nobody goes before Gericht" , one of the woman employees of RPG Byty and a man on the road before the client center means gives it at least partly quite.
" I have 13,000 (crowns) pension, of it remain for me 5,000 for the meal, where I should the money for a court controversy hernehmen" , it means.
Then the employee becomes nevertheless uncertain.
" Times sehen."
" Mr. Zaorálek says to them about the media, it is not to sign and so not wait the people still ab" , it gives to consider.
The adjusted rent ends in the largest part of Czech Republic to New Year 2011 and RPG Byty according to is the rent increase an economic necessity.
" The existing height of the rents is not enough times for the maintenance of the apartment fund aus" , Pavel Klimeš, the director of the housing portfolio of the society RPG Byty argues and - the straight neglect of the housing fund criticized by the applied tenants is according to opinion of the home-owners the principal reason for the rent increase.
While RPG could invest four billion in the years between 2005 and 2010 from the taken rents into the dwellings, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it should be 5.2 billion.
On the large sized LCD at the cover opposite the upholstered chairs in the waiting area of Havířov occasionally always emerge few red shining information.
" The rent increases in the year 2011 around 15% and less concern 31,200 dwellings, i.e. more than 90% of the dwellings of RPG."
" This always means at the most 7.50 CZK per square meters and Monat" , is to be read on the LCD monitor.
Only with 400 dwellings from the portfolio of RPG the rent increases by 38 per cent.
" In these cases it goes around the increase of extremely small rents from 19,66 CZK per Quadratmeter" , RPG argues.
During 2600 dwellings the rent remains in the next year on same height.
RPG Byty promises the fact that the deregulation does not drive the rents precipitously up but gradually within four and eight years takes place.
Which more - the enterprise imposes upon itself a further obligation: The enterprise wants to put all incomes from the rent increase (see diagram) again into the dwellings, particularly into heat savings - into new windows and into the thermal insulation.
But - with priority these are to benefit that people, which sign the agreements over the rent increase.
The architects saw in belonged to the office also a kindergarten
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new seat of the enterprise Arch.Design.
But who here already a mini kindergarten to expect, belonged which with everything to it: color-glad walls, creative furniture, a quantity toy and even a mini playground on the external terrace.
This kindergarten is to the coworkers of Arch.Design since past year at the disposal.
Project engineering and architect's office Arch.Design, from whose studios a whole number of considerable Brünner buildings originate, counted of the first drafts for the new building Avriopoint on on the premises for its firm mini kindergarten.
In wise foresight, because most of its 90 coworkers (inside) are in the baby boom age and the company are been because of the fact that the Projektantinnen returns and architect inside as fast as possible to its job.
Together with the possibility of working shortened the kindergarten is a further bonus, which Arch.Design has to offer to its person employed in the concept of its social program.
Civil engineer inside and - architect inside have it so more easily to bring their fastidious occupation and the child welfare service under a hat.
The mini kindergarten is an original idea of the coworkers (inside) of Arch.Design and with the support of the management succeeded it them development funds of the European union and the Ministry for work and social for their project to win.
The operational mini kindergarten is financed by the operation program human resources and employment policy from means of the European social fund and from the state budget of the Czech republic.
Owing to this financing (subsidies at a value of 2, 8 millions CZK) the necessary mechanisms and the equipment could be procured and for the duration of 2 years are provided for qualified personnel and for the enterprise.
After the exhaustion of the conveyances (2 years) the society Arch.Design is obligated to operate the mini kindergarten 3 further years at the own expense further.
The preparation of this project took a whole year up, whereby the society Economy rating rendered energetic help during the request completion.
About the children completeactively qualified personnel worries - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can children without agemoderate restrictions visit, although most of them are old over three years.
And there it here around a mini kindergarten goes, may be present at the same time only 5 children, however alternate the day over several children mutually.
The kindergarten enterprise is flexibly with the need of parents co-ordinated the same rights, the children of all coworkers have regarding the use of the kindergarten - without consideration for the firm hierarchy and its respective position.
Although it concerns individual education and care, program contents are nevertheless comparable in the mini kindergarten with the master program of the Vorschulbildung.
The children do not only play here, above all them excellent instruction are ordered - from fundamental realizations up to the Vorschulunterricht, besides they learn also still English.
The classroom is equipped not only with toy and creative plays, but also with a computer, which is to the children at the disposal.
Which more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive firm environment.
Parents can at any time throw a view of the children and are void in such a way the stress with late fetching of the children from a kindergarten removed far.
Parents use therefore their work time more productively.
No miracle that here also natural and loyale employer employee relations develops.
Arch.Design incorporated itself in such a way among the Czech companies, which offer clear Benefits, which is family friendly and encourages by such programs its personal marketing during the recruitment of new coworkers.
A bone house also still fascinates after 100 years. Look at yourselves the Interieure of Gaudi
The roof seems like the back of a prähistorischen Echse, the stairs like the spinal column of a dinosaur and the balconies is broken fish muzzles.
That is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants the house with its organic forms got the nickname " Knochenhaus."
Organic forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile fragments and mosaic, those at sheds reminding fronts and pervasive soft lines, all this are typical characteristics for art nouveau of Antonio Gaudi.
The front of the house plays with fantastic lines, tender colors and textures, which remind of nature and organism.
Only when exact looking one notices that everything of geometry, rhythm and durchdachter order is controlled.
At the night the whole front works still more vividly, dramatically and the special Anleuchtung strengthens the gloss of the colors still.
The same momentumful lines and devoured forms control also the inside of the house.
Wavelike formed wood copies the window frameworks, railing, Zierelemente of doors, even looking holes and borders.
The house Batlló in the quarter of Eixample at the encouraged shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 resulted from the change of a house from the year 1877, which Emilio Sala Cortese implemented architects.
The reconstruction took two years and to 1906 up was locked.
The investor, the wealthy manufacturer Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the outline of the old and the building of a completely new building, but finally it agreed the idea Gaudís on an unusual and also cheaper change.
The dwelling house Casa Batlló did not sketch Antoni Gaudí however alone.
He co-operated thereby with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
Straight ones on its drawing board developed the decorations for the representative dwelling of the owner of reality and also the use of mosaics at the front were its idea.
In the organization of the front however also numerous further Bildner and artist cooperated.
The common work on the drafts for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful co-operation of Jujola and Gaudí.
Thus Jujol took part also in the building of Gaudís house Casa Milá in the park Güell, in which also further works of Antoni Gaudí are.
Already shortly after its completion the house of the local inhabitants of its organic forms got because of the nicknames " Knochenhaus."
Others again called it the special window opening mechanism because of " yawning Haus."
One says also, right at the top on the building is represented to holy George, the patron the sword by Catalonia.
In addition, further bildhauerische elements symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí sketched for the time at that time a singular central heating system with vent holes and typical fire-places for the house.
Somewhat more bizarre their 45-Grad-Neigung already seems.
With its work Gaudí ignored consistently all construction specifications at that time and let themselves by no means from these confuse.
Before commencement of construction it got the appropriate building permit the reconstruction, planned given by him, by the city however the data concerning was so vague that the city fathers were frightened two years later with the completion so by the result that they required remedy.
The councilmen pushed among other things also to the fact that the building with its columns intervened even in the public sidewalk.
To changes it did not come however any longer, quite the reverse - Josep Batlló a request placed only fifteen days after the relevant request of the city quarter to the permission of the letting of the two high-altitude floors of the house - and she was promptly given to him.
The home-owner drew into the lower floors.
In the gallery in the 2nd stick a society salon was, in the third stick was the bedrooms and private areas of the dwelling.
The ground floor was leased to a Juweliergeschäft.
The entire sechsstöckige building goes through stairs to up to the roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were eliminated and replaced by the fundamental elements of the change by curved and swung walls.
In addition, Gaudí worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of areas.
The social part can be connected by opening the salon doors completely and so could a larger society comfortably plaudern, without having to do with more confidential discussions without a certain Intimität.
The house received a quite unusual roof and two further floors by Gaudís change except a new front also.
Also Gaudís play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles is impressive, with those the inner court is disguised and the halations.
The play of these two colors lends a maximum of light to all floors of the house.
It made simply the principle too uses oneself that white reflects the light better, as if dark colors, which absorb the sunlight on the contrary in addition.
The house Casa Batlló, which was taken up 2005 to the world inheritance list of the Unesco, can visit today everyone.
In the first stick the roomiest and most magnificent dwelling of the public is made accessible.
The home-owners decided only in the year to this step and this from cause of the 150.Geburtstags of the famous creator.
When one stated that this is a quite lucrative business, one maintained the inspections, one expanded her even on further common and the attic areas, including the roof terrace.
The price for the inspection of the architectural monument is however no pasteboard handle, it amounts to 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and owners of tourist documents of identification gets 20 per cent of reduction.
This amount exceeds the admission fees to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
Who would like to learn the genuine atmosphere of the house with its Drachentürmchen to know, should try, to close friendship with one the house inhabitant and visit it at home.
The correct mattress and the correct bed rust? Women have other desires than men
The maddest bed framework, do not separate the quality of the couch surface - thus mattress and rust constitute the good bed.
These must complement each other however harmoniously, in order to become fair the desires of the concrete user.
With the selection many things play a role - the weight, the size of, the state of health and not least also the sex of the Schläfers.
Just as importantly is also the Interieur, in which mattress and rust have to subordinate themselves.
Typical example?
In a weekend house, in which not regularly one heats, Latexmatratzen are not well suitably, since they need much longer, over " warmly too werden."
Beyond that they are clearly heavier than usual PU mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
If they do not have still enough exhaust small channels in the core and in addition on a firm plate to lie, humidity dams itself up: It is thus impossible that under its mould forms.
With the choice naturally also a role plays, at which one is accustomed.
Who longer time was abroad, where very high mattresses with soft layer are usual will be able itself to accustom, heavily to a low mattress with hard surface.
" Probably all ice hockey players, who returned from the NHL, weighted with me that they do not sleep correctly here any longer können."
" For their abgeschundenen shoulders, heels and hips they need simply a soft layer from Visco foam (MEMORY Foam - a form memory polymer). "
" These recommend I among other things also sugar-ill humans, who suffer from a disturbance of the nervous system, so that them " Informationen" from the joints and the skin badly received können" , explains Sylva Hadamcziková, which specializes in pad furniture.
Therefore I have already years ago many ice hockey players, in addition, other customer these mattresses with Visco foam (MEMORY Foam) procures.
" Today is this no more problem, because such mattresses offer among other things the manufacturer Tempur, which Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico an."
And one does not have to be necessarily a famous ice hockey player, in order to learn to estimate the advantages of the Visco foam.
This " Wunder" functioned actually completely simply.
The foam optimalisiert its hardness and form according to the absorbed warmth, differently said, it schmiegt itself proper at the warm body on.
Anywhere it does not press, in the night rolls one not around as after a heavy fight.
One sleeps simply much better.
The viscoelastic foam offers beyond that also protection from Dekubitus (Wundbrand).
With the choice of the mattress size one should include the length of the soles to the body size still, thus approx. 21 to 34 cm.
Man such as woman, which are large to the 180 cm, need such 210 to 220 cm long a bed.
Everyone should at least 90 cm couch width for the order, together thus 180 cm.
With single beds, for example with Singles, is attached 120 to 140 cm.
For the sake of the comfort and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise the following rule of thumb is valid for the ideal bed width: " If one lies on the back, still enough place for the easily bended arms should sein" , engineer Helena Prokopová, the Zunftmeisterin of the Polsterer and Raumausstatter, guesses who dedicate themselves already for many years to the problem of the healthy Schlafes and the ergonomics of furniture and speak this topic also on technical schools.
With a double bed everyone needs its own rust and its own mattress, but watches out with the purchase, so that the mattresses are also equivalent high.
Otherwise nothing else remains to install as rust in different height and that is long not with each bed framework possible.
Foam mattresses should be high at least 14 cm, mattresses with feather/spring skeleton 15 cm, of it should at least three centimeters to the form layer and the fine pad be allotted.
" With the hand or when putting one may do the feathers/springs in no case spüren" , Helena Prokopová warns.
Each mattress makes a special type of rust necessary.
Completepadded beds with mattress and document like grown together Siamzwillinge do not have to look for anything in the bedroom.
These mattresses do not leave themselves and the purchase to air can one wash, which today is already common.
And there one at only one night between 0,2 to 0.75 l sweat loses, is clear the fact that the mattress becomes slow after five to seven years an enormous (and clogged filter).
Also therefore specialists advertising slogans reject, which promise one life span of up to 25 years, even lifelong warranty with mattresses.
Each thing has it if and however.
And therefore a practical advice of the dealers: With mattresses of 120 or 140 cm broad one should not shrink from the hygiene of the washable, removable purchases, yet it is advisable to use a Matratzenschoner which one can take off and wash easily.
Even if today mattress purchases with round outlining catch are usually manufactured, so that one gets two halves after opening (immensely importantly for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, above all alone implemented, seems often like the unequal fight between David and Goliath.
Do they have a firm plate in bed instead of a rust?
Raus thereby!
Or at the most for a bed for unloved guests and for only one night.
Also so they should rather use the plate provided with ventilation holes (if already none in it are) and mattresses with feather/spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called bag feather/spring core and fine pad.
PU mattresses do not belong on such a document.
For not adjustable slat rust with 14 to 18 multipole sockets (lamellas) Latex or sand yielding mattresses suitably (if necessary also combinations of Latex and Kokos) are, always pay off thereby rust with a larger number of slats, thus of 28 and more multipole sockets to adjust with Lordosenstütze in the Lendenwirbelbereich and the possibility, the slat hardness.
On adjustable no mattresses with feather/spring skeleton belong to lamella rust, since they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
Apart from the attitude the rigid one of the multipole sockets also special flexible shoulder modules are ordered.
Here it concerns a special attachment of the multipole sockets, which it makes possible to imprint or bend the multipole sockets in such a way that they make punctual sinking for the shoulder possible of the Schläfers.
In particular for men with broad shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers, that began, with " Herrenmatratzen" To use soft zones for the shoulder range.
Also to the ladies is meant - one grants these soft zones to them in the Hüftgegend.
For most fastidious customers scoring reading tables are wing feather/spring systems (Lattoflex) or rust with scoring reading tables contact Pads with so-called multi-torsion suspension determines.
The pressure is distributed on several points, whereby the tension is reduced.
But - if one to the correct mattress and correct rust a bad (too large and fülliges) pillow used, is lost most advantages again.
Also here a rule of thumb: the pillow is to support the head, its points should only up to the shoulders reach, so that the Schultermuskeln can relax.
From there 50 x 60 cm a large cushion appears ideal, how for example the Skandinavier likes it.
In the side situation the pillow (together with the shoulder discharge zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should adjust the Schulterhöhe.
Our modern mattresses have something in common to have with the former (with hay filled) straw bags nevertheless.
Modern manufacturers use ever more frequently natural materials or at least their admixtures.
Also with mattresses the new magic word is called " Bio."
Instead of oil raw materials uses one for the production of PU foams ever more frequently natureal oils - for example rizinus and Sojaöl.
Soy is probably used by all well-known manufacturers.
" Bio is called with mattresses, which besteht" their core from materials of purely natural origin; , Petr Vašíček of the company Tropico plus explains.
In addition, natural substances are used with the production of mattress purchases - one first was thereby aloe Vera.
One can grant oneself in addition, micro caps, which blow forest or Lavendelduft when sleeping spread.
One makes a difference between man and woman also here.
While with the men " kühlender" Plant extract from Birkenblättern is used, so that the mattress purchase the warmth absorb and can the body cooling, the purchases for women " wärmende" Effect.
Excerpts from red Paprikaschoten suggest the blood circulation, the weaker sex become thus wohlig warm when sleeping.
And the today's favorites?
Mattresses from cold foam (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is from there more breathe-actively than commercial PU and also many more flexible).
From the combination the different rigid one (hardness) of cold foams and Visco foams result multi-zone mattresses, which know exactly, where head, hip and heels are.
For a high-quality mattress one has to shell out however 7000 crowns and more.
Health mattresses are however usually burdening with smaller value added tax, since they are considered as medical aids.
As the first Czech enterprise Gumotex became this advantage assigns.
One does not see, at the mattress and at the rust to save is so easily.
Now and then there are special offers of manufacturers and dealers, that offer two mattresses for the price of one.
Thus the mark Magniflex offers the mattress Duofreeze also in the purchase to verstepptem Visco foam MEMORY for 11.990 CZK.
One gets second free of charge in addition.
It was the material Tempur, which introduced the era of the viscoelastic foam materials with open cell structure and high density in almost cosmic speed.
A miracle, they were not developed nevertheless for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads with the starts.
Tempur with warmth softly, in cool environment solidifies itself it again.
Thus it adapts to the human body perfectly and distributes themselves on optimal way the body printing.
It is general from there not only ideally for the prevention of printing fire, but increased the sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foam materials do not however only become with mattresses, but also with other health products, how uses e.g. with special foot padding, which are to provide relief for the legs and the containers.
Native manufacturers use for example the foam materials Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
Ever more parents want people control instruments, in order to have the Kids under control
The fear around the own children grows and considers in such a way ever more parents to supervise it by GPS.
The system, which was originally invented for search after cars, can locate just as well humans, which also in such cases would be helpful, as recently with the without trace disappearance of the Anička of nine years Janatková.
The equipment is not at present about as largely as a cigarette box however already soon might it be larger, than a wrist-watch.
The case of the disappeared Anička has many humans shifted in fear and fright and in such a way to hold it after means and ways look out to protect their children better.
Also for the price of an impairment of their privacy.
" We strive to say all that it does not concern to reduce the probability here under any circumstances Herumspionieren, but around an effective means that it kommt" to the tragedy; , Petr Pilin of the society macro leads because on, one of the suppliers of GPS datum locators on the Czech market.
" I admit that it can come in individual cases to the abuse of such devices, for example if one it someone into the bag am, without he knows of it, but we had so far no such case too verzeichnen."
" Most customers really buy it from Sicherheitsgründen" , Pilin adds.
According to its opinion the child should however always know, which purpose " Schachtel" and like one serves her in emergency used.
The Kinderpsychologin Dana Bočková points out however that a child, if it may not carry such a thing gets rid of it of its simply.
" Also very small children show large creativity, if it concerns to lose certain things intentionally if they are not controlled wollen."
" Already the mobile phones created at first with parents large expectations, but they can be switched off just as easily, as this new Überwachungsgeräte" , Mrs. Bočková means.
According to their opinion it is also disputed whether such actually helps a mechanism in case of an attack.
" With planned kidnappings the kidnapper controls practically always, whether the child has any electronics with itself, with which it is located könnte."
" Today it is the Handy."
" If such control instruments found broader use, they would likewise look for these, since their sale wäre." reliably accompanied by solid advertisement;
" In these cases the criminals of the police are always voraus" a step; , the psychologist means.
It grants however that similar devices can be quite helpful with a sudden attack by paedophile.
Roberta Čech of the society RC according to monitoring, which offers detection services both for automobiles, and for persons, can help the existence such of equipment also if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
" The equipment can be adjusted in such a way that it meldet." the respective position in certain intervals;
" Even if it were destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned stands to the Verfügung."
" With more expensive devices even an inclination measurer is integrated, i.e., if one falls down and remains motionlessly lying, the equipment sends immediately a warning under indication of the Position" , Mr. Čech states.
According to its opinion similar services could perform also intelligent mobile phones with navigation, one need only a special software to bring in.
The problem of the present datum locators consists of it that it concerns here either devices into matchbox size, supporters resembles or around smaller mobile phones.
So the danger always exists that one loses it.
Mr. Pilin of that macro because according to one tests from there in the presence of devices, which look like normal digital clocks.
" That has the advantage that the possible aggressor does not have to recognize at all that it concerns a monitoring and/or a datum locator.
" Or it notices only after certain time, which gibt" the police a time projection/lead; , it adds.
No matter, into which direction the development goes - to bracelets or supporters, always thereby used the same technology, as during the vehicle detection.
Thus around the combination of detection function assistance of the GPS system (exactly the same as with the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone, which announces the current position.
The army has so many igniter cords that one could tape completely Czech Republic you to hold however only two years
The Czech army has 445 kilometers of igniter cords to be bought, with explosive devices ignited.
In the year before the Ministry of Defense had produced already 224 kilometers of igniter cord to the army camps.
It is already reassuring to know that the armed forces out-ensured for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the igniter cords - two, at the most however four years.
The army bought the igniter cords of the corporation STV Group, A.S. for läppische 40 million crowns.
In its reason for the purchase the general staff MF DNES, which would use soldiers annually to the 60 kilometers of igniter cord, answered this enormous quantity of igniter cord.
The searches of Armeepyrotechnikern according to, which addressed MF DNES on it, it comes out from this indication that the whole army would have to complete annually extremely intensive pyrotechnic training - from all generals and officers of the army command, up to the secretaries and charwomen.
Secretary of Defense Alexandr Vondra and army general Vlastimil Picek not exceptionally.
The considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometers igniter cords would only thus let itself justify halfway.
This length by the way corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
In addition, these army existence became in such a way for more than ten years are enough.
If however still the old rule of experts is valid that for the training of each new career soldier two meters of igniter cord are sufficient completely, then the army created itself a reassuring supply by these new purchases - also under the criterion of the increased need of the pioneer and special-purpose forces - for the 225 years already mentioned.
Soldiers of the sentence brigade weighted recently with the Secretary of Defense Vondra, it would have nearly no cartridges for hand-held weapons more, so that firing exercises of the missing means are because of strongly reduced.
To be silent from the lack of pant completely.
" Me it is not received why she kaufen." from us such enormous amounts of igniter cords;
But that is its decision, it already will finally know, to which she brauchen." her;
" For us the army is a good customer, who we come as dealers as far as possible against möchten" , the sales manager of the STV Group says January Děcký.
January Pejšek, which justifies speakers of the Ministry of Defense the purchase hundred of kilometers of igniter cord thereby, which would have itself army so at least for ten years with this " Munition" covered up.
January Děcký of the STV Group speaks however only of a four years old life of the igniter cords and police and Armeepyrotechniker only of two years.
" With perfect storage are probably the four mentioned years möglich" , one of them does not grant, which wants to remain however anonymous, in order as a soldier to the criticism at the army to be accused.
At expiration of the life any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and the life of the soldiers does not endanger.
These tests are however not in vain, but cost further money.
A further argument of the Ministry of Defense is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometers of igniter cord.
" They cost us sixty per cent less, than the last year supply of 244 Kilometern" , speaker Pejšek communicates the point of view of the buyers of the Ministry of Defense to us.
Only to the comparison: The annual consumption of igniter cords of Pyrotechnikern of the police, already some years liquidate, exceed the ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet brother army long hardly 1,500 meters.
And the police orders in each case such quantities of this ammunition, which can use it still before expiration of the life.
Already the security of the Pyrotechniker because of, in addition one keeps oneself so the possibility open for flexible purchases of more modern and thus also reliable igniter cords.
The Ministry of Defense has anyway enormous problems with the liquidation Zehntausender tons of ammunition from times Warsaw Treaty, when the zweihunderttausendköpfige Czechoslovakian People's Army prepared for its campaign to the Rhine.
According to the Pyrotechnikern, whom MF DNES addressed, in a few years the same problem expects the Czech armed forces with the liquidation hundred of kilometers of old igniter cords, which it " in such a way today; günstig" bought.
Until today me the contacts come convenient, which I won owing to the competition
The victorious placement in the competition " Little businessman of the Jahres" Lukáš Pytloun helped with the sale of the franchise of its hotel.
Winner of the past class of the competition " Little businessman of the Jahres" became Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The history of its success seems like a film scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun traveled gladly.
Only abroad it became conscious it that it is missing in Liberec at good overnight accomodations at reasonable prices.
From the savings of its holidays work abroad and he purchased a ramshackle house with five dwellings for assistance of a bank credit.
If one considers the fact that he was a university student at that time in the sixth term was safe this a courageous venture.
" The price quality relationship at that time annoyed me and in such a way tried I, somewhat against it too unternehmen" , Lukáš Pytloun says.
He rented the first reconstructed dwelling foreign workers.
It invested the whole profit immediately again in the house, which it converted afterwards step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
It succeeded to it since then in only seven years of business activity in Liberec four pensions to open two style-fair restaurants and two hotels with an overall capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was " to recently the four-star hotel; Pytloun Design Hotel."
In this year a further first-class hotel was added.
" Straight ones we signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we sold our Franchise concept and further prospective customers to franchise of the Pytloun hotels already gemeldet" itself to have; , the entrepreneur says number unity from the past year.
" Large portion of this license sale to the operation of hotels the straight victory in the competition had " Entrepreneur of the Jahres" , Mr. Pytloun adds appreciative.
The victory brought larger fame to it, popularity into Liberec and environment.
" The people recognized me on the road, often even later congratulated them to me and I must say, that did correctly gut" , it remembers.
I really recommend all, which want to create something, to participate in this competition.
One needs to win also not directly, each Sichtbarmachung is good.
He says that he pulls until today from the contacts and acquaintances use, to which it would not otherwise at all have come.
" With some people, which I met owing to the competition, maintenance I to today regular Geschäftsbeziehungen."
The fame connected with success settles according to its opinion also a little on everyone its coworker.
And there it has to the seventy.
" I notice larger loyalty and pride with them on the fact that they are part of something, which general acknowledgment assign wird."
I regard this also really not only as personal success, no, am allen." the result of the good work of us;
" My name is gerückt" only something into the foreground; , Lukáš Pytloun means modest.
I wish a calmer year to my successors, than we had it in Farmet
The victory euphoria was replaced fast from the consequences of the crisis.
Owing to its determination Farmet has the worst behind itself.
Karel Žďárský, the company owner of Farmet received the price for the first rank of the competition Vodafone company of the yearly in the past class.
The jury appreciated at that time the efforts, with which it stamped an enterprise from the ground from the small tool construction in Česká Skalice, which makes hundreds of millions conversions.
" I can say that this appreciation not only me, but also all my coworkers encouraged and our self-confidence hat" encouraged in the fight with the competition; , the previous year winner says.
At the beginning of the company history of Farmet the effort stood to do something useful.
And as then the state to its father Karel Žďárský as compensation for the property seized of the communists a small workshop to the lease, hesitated he offered not for a long time, let his career in the company, in which he was busy up to then, rushes and based also a few comrades of its father his own company for the production of Plastikwannen.
Short time after they began to concentrate on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years they ascended to largest manufacturers of automatic presses in all of Central Europe.
But only by success in the mentioned competition and its Medialisierung entered it also the consciousness of the non--specialized public.
" Not only that our customers notice the mark Farmet clearly more intensively now, also our foreign partners began the circumstance to be able to co-operate with a company which achieved greatest possible success in its country, larger value beizumessen" , Karel Žďárský says.
The past year did not however only stand with Farmet in the indication of the victory euphoria.
The appreciation proceeded from the economic results of the enterprise in the year 2008 and a part of 2009.
And straight 2009 were the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, which vibrated the citizens, but above all enterprises at that time still less, achieved straight its high point - many companies were compelling to stop their investment projects and to limit the purchase of new mechanisms and technologies.
" This situation could not we naturally also entgehen."
" The conversions decreased/went back by 40 per cent, we had production to limit and even to dismissals greifen" , Karel Žďárský explains
A capable of surviving enterprise must seize every now and then also such unpopular measures.
It succeeded however to hold the situation into the grasp too gotten and the company in the black numbers even if with smaller profits, than before the crisis.
With one the enterprise was not determined to make reductions - during the investments in the research and development.
" From the subsidy we built a research and a training center, we encouraged our presentation on international fairs and acquired main prices with domestic Ausstellungen" , Žďárský says.
Everything witnesses of the fact that we overcame the crisis.
The conversions grow again and with them also the number of new coworkers.
" I wish much joy in the victory to the new winner - however in calmer Atmosphäre" , Karel Žďárský lets align.
A public opinion poll, which clears up with unreasonable regulations
The public opinion poll around " Absurdity of the Jahres" part of the entrepreneur competition is for the fourth time.
Some unreasonable regulations already succeeded it to create from the world.
To the doubtful winner of the next class of the public opinion poll " Absurdity of the Jahres" was promoted the obligation to create documents on authorities on-line one to the order stands.
Thus more than one third of not completely four thousand votingdelivering entrepreneurs decided.
Thus the social security administration required a paper excerpt from the Register of Companies, even if the official had been able to call it up by two of mouse click.
Owing to the public opinion poll this changes now.
" The Czech social security administration is more verlangen" in the future with controls of social security payers no excerpts from the Register of Companies; , the spokeswoman of ČSSZ Jana Buraňová stated.
Sense and purpose of the public opinion poll " Absurdity of the Jahres" it is to take all regulations and arrangements under the magnifying glass to fulfill the entrepreneurs in Czech Republic has and the unreasonable to waive.
This is in this year already for the fourth time part of an entrepreneur competition, of tsch. Trade journal (HN) organized enjoys and in the public of increasing popularity.
If last year to the three thousand persons in the vote took part, there in this year already four thousand.
No miracle, because still gives it a quantity of legal obligations, which serve simply for it, to obstruct the enterprise activity.
" Which concerns for example the number of forms for income tax, we take a front rank in the world ein" , Karel Havlíček of the combination of small and centralconstant enterprises and tradesman of the Czech republic notices.
The simplification of the business activity is in the last years the proclaimed goal of all governments.
In the comparison to the world the situation in Czech Republic however hardly improved.
According to data of the World Bank Czech Republic takes to the 74 regarding the enterprise conditions. In, in the comparison to the previous year a placement worse around eight places struggled.
The competition absurdity of the yearly was proclaimed for the first time in the year and takes place each year after same scenario.
Everyone can announce administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the editorship conclusion of the competition at the end of of Septembers.
For the registration the Web address serves www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards the organizer of the competition looks for seven candidates for " Antipreis" out and the public lets co-ordinate over the Internet on the web pages www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It triumphs that absurdity, which gets most voices.
To the public opinion poll of this year already more than hundred, more exactly said 105 senseless regulations and arrangements were announced.
The hints come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Under the nominated " Finalisten" the competition are so for example also regulations that maintenance vehicles for motorways and motorways duty to pay to have or that entrepreneurs with twenty coworkers, two offices and two toilets must pre-adjust every two years.
The listing of the of this year " Sieben" is published on the sides of the competition.
Proclaiming the competition at the beginning of November on the Prager Wenzelsplatz is part of a happening in each case, in which regularly also personalities of the political and public life participate.
In this year for example EH Svobodová were, the directress of the federation of small or centralconstant enterprises and tradesman of the Tsch. Republic as well as Petr Kužel, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Tsch. Republic with the high point of the competition also of the portion.
" Where the state throws to the entrepreneurs clubs between the legs, there cannot be genuine economic upswing, therefore it is my goal of waiving each year at least thirty Paragrafen which erschweren" still unnecessarily today the entrepreneurs their enterprises; , Martin Kocourek, the Minister for industry and trade communicated.
The efforts to create unreasonable arrangements from the world show effect.
In the year 2007 entrepreneurs the imposed obligation disturbed the people at most to have to announce to the office for trade at the place of its constant business premises three days in advance the intention of wanting to drive with a booth to an exhibition or a Kirmes.
This obligation was waived strength of a novella of the industrial law.
The obligation, the 2007 the second largest number of voices received - the obligation to have to announce to that labour office official travel of persons employed to the extent up to 30 days - by the law over it so-called was " Becomes green Karte" abolished.
And - all good things are three:
To have to be located selected for the absurdity of the yearly 2009 the regulation, which imposed upon it to Physiotherapeuten, in the consulting rooms mirror, one refrigerator and two Personenwaagen.
This regulation was to some extent moderated by the Ministry of Health in this year - the refrigerator obligation was omitted.
A new category appreciates socially reliable companies
Valuation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, education or sport projects
A novelty in already fifth the class of this year of the competition of the trade journal (HN) is " the category; Reliable company of the yearly 2010."
Basic idea of this competition is it to promote reasonable and fair enterprises.
" We would like to support such companies, which are aware of the consequences of your business activity on the environment and socially reliable initiatives unterstützen" , says Patrik Bartholdy, which regional managers of the portable radio enterprise Vodafon, which Ausrufer and guarantor of this competition ," exactly the same as well as the competition; Rebel of the Jahres" is.
For the first class of this year of these special Unterkategorie of the main competition companies registered Vodafon company of the yearly, for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The history of everyone of them is extremely inspirativ and would offer enough material for an independent article.
Although they differ regarding the subject of their activity diametrically, its efforts have nevertheless a common denominator - support and consideration.
Here it concerns for example gehandicapte humans, there around personal problems or the health of the own coworkers.
Under the fourteen finalists from completely Czech Republic emerged so for example also the Prager software enterprise Et Netera, which does not promote the emergence formal sport teams among their coworkers, who participate then in numerous tournaments in most diverse kinds of sport.
Another example of a reliable company from the region Pardubice is the society Isolit Bravo, which is already seventeen years long main sponsor of a foundation fund for gehandicapte children.
Also a paper factory from Poděbrady worries exemplary about its healthwise obstructed persons employed, who constitute 70 per cent of their staff, for which them " with the title; Reliable company of the region Mittelböhmen" one appreciated; in the competition Vodafone company of the yearly occupied it in the context of this region third rank.
In the region Olomouc triumphed the bookkeeping company MiRyz soft, those among other things a flowing and in addition on on the average 35 hours per week reduced work time introduced and this without relative wage reduction.
The jury honored the circumstance during the conferment of a title also that the company predominantly buys works citizens' initiatives in its environment supported and according to pollution free principles with Czech manufacturers.
" We strive, as much as possible too recyceln, around the consequences of our business activity and administration for the environment as small as possible too halten" , their manager explains Miluše Ryznarová.
To the reliable IT-enterprise Enlogit from the region Ústí nad Labem again been and therefore it is them to all notebooks ergonomic armchair and keyboards purchased because of the health of its coworkers, in addition it promotes Cartering services, which are ordered from a domestic protected workshop with its persons employed outwork and with firm actions uses it.
" Beyond that we support the foundation " Humans in Not" , the local Roma Kommunität the concrete assistance leistet" , Ondřej Suchý, the representative of the company says.
Not least also the activity of the Reinigungsfirma is " Praní A čištění" from that Carlsbad region worth mentioning, which contributes its person employed in the form of extra bonuses to their old age pension insurance.
" We grant our persons employed of contributions to the food supply, for the way to work, for the increase of their qualification and for the Urlaub" , Josef Strapáč says to the winner in the Mährisch Schlesi region of the building firm Czasch from Bruntál.
To the category all district finalists of the competition Vodafon company of the yearly was automatically announced reliable company of the yearly, which the questions to the registration of settled questionnaire answered and it at the latest up to the 15.August the organizer dispatched.
Wrongly or incompletely filled out answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the organizer from the evaluation.
" If the representatives of the competing companies let the questions unanswered, they were " by the competition; Reliable company of the Jahres" impossible, in the main competition Vodafone company of the yearly were however not disqualifiziert." them therefore;
" A separate registration only to this competition is not possible, since it only a Unterkategorie of the main competition company of the yearly ist" , Karel Goldman of the organizing agency explains Bison & Rose.
Pilsner ground fund - arrests of the police during a public advertisement
In the building of the ground fund in Pilsen the anti-corruption police made arrests in the last days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. were exhausted from the detectives in handcuffs.
This had allegedly tried to manipulate a straight taking place public competition in such a way for the completion of requirements for restitution that properties offered in the competition were assigned to a concrete prospective customer.
This is to have paid Luboš G. for it one half million.
" At this time I can only confirm that the police a person verfolgt" because of the crime of fraudulent machinations with a public competition; , said Antonie Zelená, which " boss of the Pilsner public prosecutor's office of the newspaper; Právo" , it cannot grant further details regarding the current investigations.
24 hours later the 46-jährige became an entrepreneur of the police again to dismiss.
In which way it could manipulate the public competition, upon it one can only speculate in view of the meager official information.
The spokeswoman of the ground fund Lubomír Černá stated the police on the relevant question of Právo, in the Pilsner branch of the ground fund actually arrests made and this during a public competition.
" Our Mitarbeiter" went not at all around a client and around one; , it made concrete.
The public competition had " Mrs. according to Černá the correct designation; Request to the lodging of tenders from requirements to the transfer of properties in accordance with the Bodengesetz" and in cases, in those several applicants interest in offered property bezeigen would take place.
" These persons offer requirements for restitution which can be settled to the request a higher value of their in the framework by the transmission, than the proclaimed Grundstückswert."
" According to the offered requirements the sequence of the potenziellen Erwerber specified, afterwards transfers the ground funds property to the person with the highest Angebot" , the spokeswoman of the fund explains.
Luboš G. were obviously to information at the disposal, which had registered on the request and since he entitled person was, since it had bought a set of requirements for restitution, offered he interests of property that he withdraws himself from the competition.
Obviously against a fat compensation.
That would be also a sufficient explanation for why he had a large money with its arrest such with itself.
Luboš G. had already in the past all too good contacts to the Pilsner ground fund.
Thus it played a role, which criminally one pursued, because it gave change in spare restitutions properties also in the Causa of the former boss of the ground fund Václav Sankota, to which already location decisions to building projects pleases were.
At that time Luboš G. acquired of ground fund for example also properties, which were intended for the building of public roads, more exactly said, in the place, where the building of the Zufahrtsmagistrale polarized Borské to the trade area was planned.
Later it exchanged these very favorably with municipal authorities against a house directly in the historical center of the city, which exceeded the value of properties far.
The city hall had at that time with a heavy heart small adding, in order not to endanger the building project by the blocking of properties.
The apartment costs of the households rise around some hundreds monthly
The households must count the rents starting from January not only on higher costs of all kinds of energy, but also on higher water and waste water fees and of long-distance heating and at some places grow also.
Families will have in such a way to pull starting from January several hundred crowns monthly to more from the purse than so far.
River will have to pay gas up to around 4,6 per cent more expensively, around 2 per cent and more, in some cities one up to a tenth more for water supplies and at some places will raise the price of also the long-distance heating supplies.
However the current price increase costs the housing budget annually some hundred crowns more.
The heavy current prices were lowered thereby by all main suppliers, debt are thus the clear promotion of the generation of current from renewable sources, in particular from Fotovoltaikanlagen.
Gas becomes only moderately more expensively, this however exactly if the people at most must to heat and have highest consumption.
Also here is to be counted thus on some hundred crowns more per year.
While river and gas in completely Czech Republic become expensive, the prices for long-distance heating from city are different to city.
Above all larger places plan price increases.
Thus for example the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové must pay starting from January for long-distance heating monthly up to 50 crowns more, more to than 1000 crowns more per year pay families in Liberec.
Again threaten the inhabitants of Prague 9 per cent higher water and waste water fees and this if the city the infrastructure rent increased.
If the rent does not change, there is only 6.8 per cent.
The price in Prague belongs compared with completely Czech Republic however also further to the lowest.
In the Nordböhmen, where the prices belong already to the highest, water and waste water fees are to rise around 7,4 per cent.
Enormous rent increases are to be expected for example in 140.000 flat lets for rent, with which starting from January the so-called renting adjustment is omitted.
Thus for example the housing enterprise plans CPI Byty, which possesses Labem 2500 dwellings in Ústí nad, to increase the rents starting from January equal around one hundred per cent.
Who with this rent increase does not agree, which the enterprise wants to sue judicially.
The adjusted rents, which one pays today still in approximately 300,000 dwellings, might rise next year around more than 10 per cent.
Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum beer are out - it works simply too slowly
Fernet, rum and vodka, exceptionally also times a good whisky, which one stole from the father from the house bar.
Those are the beverages, according to whose benefit drunk Czech teenagers under fifteen must be most frequently emergency-treated.
An exception are not children, who must out-sleep their tomcats repetitive in the hospital.
This comes out from the experiences of physicians, who are confronted with similar cases in the admission of the child departments of hospitals.
" Beer or wine is complete from the mode, because it lasts simply to for a long time, until one ist." drunk;
" The today's trend is clearly hard Alkohol" , Právo Luděk Pelikán, the head physician of the child department in the mittelböhmischen hospital Hořovice said.
" Whisky, if succeeds stealing to the father a bottle from the house bar and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
" Vodka has the advantage that one can mix it with Juice, then smells it not in such a way stark" , the head physician explains.
The spokeswoman of the faculty hospital Motol EH Jurinová gives it quite.
" Most frequently it concerns Fernet or Rum."
" That is the today's alcohol trend, in particular at Grundschulen."
" Isolated it concerned also Slibowitz, which one mitnimmt" from at home; , Mrs. Jurinová stated.
Head physician according to Pelikán are thirteen or fourteen-year old drunkards in the hospital admission long no exception feature.
Before the hospital in Hořovice, on which he works for this year, it was ten years long in the Pädiatrie department hospital of the Motol active, where the ambulances delivered slightly drunk person pupil from close and far.
" A girl had four times hospitalized werden."
" Their career began it with 12 years, when it still " the first time with 3,5 parts per thousand alcohol in the blood and in addition in combination with; Ekstase" admitted wurde" , the physician described a particularly heavy case.
" It was in the exhibition sites in Holešovice on any Tanzparty."
" The interesting with the fact was that it did not seem to its mother strangely at all that their daughter does not kam" 48 hours home; , the head physician is surprised.
The straight missing interest of parents or their unbelievable tolerance when knocking against with the own Sprösslingen is considered as one of the main causes for the increasing alcoholism of children.
A genuine dependence in the true sense of the word it does not concern to experts according to with children.
" By alcoholism a chronic dependence of many years on the alcohol is to be understood including all phenomenon which is connected with it and that is with these children not the Fall."
With those, which repeats alcohol enjoys, mostly a negative family-social Background is charakteristisch" , head physician explains Pelikán.
The spokeswoman of the hospital Motol, Mrs. according to Jurinová, to in the middle of November about forty drunk children were instructed into the local department for child and youth medicine.
However only the cases with heavy alcoholic poisoning, which made a hospitalization necessary, enter statistics.
Drunk children, who are home brought if necessary after ambulatory treatment by parents or by the police, are not registered.
Except the cases, in which children drink up only times so a bottle liquor in the school bench give it in the opinion of Mr. Pelikán three seasonal amplitudes, relying is hundred percent on whom: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end from the school year.
" The latter for two reasons - either from grief because of the bad certification or from joy on the Ferien."
" In the Walpurgisnacht I erlebt" at one time already seven drunk children in the admission; , doctor stresses Pelikán.
A drunk child, who spends the night under medical supervision, is paradoxically better to, than a child, who has to fight on the next day only with an unpleasant tomcat.
, One can drive the headache out in the morning after, which is due to the Dehydration and to lack of glucose in the hospital with a liquid-donating infusion with glucose and nutrients, which are missing to the organism.
" They are clearly better to, because " after; herrlichen" In the evening, they wake experience up with in a good mood, without something tut." somewhere pain;
" They are only something confused over it where them sind" , doctor grants Pelikán, whereby he spoils the patient every now and then at least thereby the good mood, by enumerating them the costs, which she will cost the treatment.
Because transport with the ambulance and the night in an acute bed come well and gladly on a few zig thousand crowns.
" Now and then I as the education means used, if I enumerated directly the children with the round, which cost its drunkennessness and that it can happen quite that they must work times whole holidays over, around the money for only one such Fete too verdienen" , doctor added Pelikán.
According to its opinion the health insurance companies do not reach however for recourse procedures, around which for the healing of the trunkenen children necessary costs of parents call in.
Two a training flight witness L-159 for the first time in strange hand - in Spain
Two light combat aircraft L-159 of altogether five, which exchanged the Czech Ministry of Defense against the transport aircraft Casa C-295M, flew on Tuesday to the Spanish city Sevilla, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS settles.
It is the first time that machines of this type are in possession of a strange army.
Abroad they were to be only seen so far with maneuvers or Flugshows.
It concerns here the airworthy two-seater version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three airplanes are single-seat L-159.
These stand at present still in-conserved in the aero Vodochody, the mediator of this business - the company Omnipol - it past week took over.
When it expediert the airplanes physically from Vodochody, January is Pejšek, which speakers of the Ministry of Defense according to not yet well-known.
The single-seat combat aircraft L-159 again from airplanes stored on a long-term basis and this without further inserts and investments were selected on the part of department of the Ministry.
" The doppelsitzigen L-159T1 was ausgetauscht" in present condition and appearance; , Pejšek of the newspaper said Právo.
It added, the army not without two-seat combat aircraft to get along will have, since in May 2009 with aero Vodochody a 200-Millionen-Vertrag over the change of four redundant L-159 signed the Ministry of Defense to the two-seat version.
A new airplane transferred the army in July, which wants to take over second it to end of this yearly.
According to Pejšek EADS committed itself to intersperse the combat aircraft into the equipment one of the Nato-countries.
" In the contract it is clearly aforementioned klipp and that the enterprise is EADS customer of the airplanes L-159 and that these are to serve for the training of pilots of the Nato-countries.
" It is from there thing of the customer, in who way it realisiert" the thing; , Pejšek stated.
The trade journal (HN) had reported heretofore that the Spanish government does not have interest to the L-159.
The bartering of five L-159 against a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of further airplanes for 3.5 billion crowns had been approved of last year still by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defense had written but addressed no bidding procedure out at that time to the purchase, EADS directly.
The office for defense at that time argued, this exchange the future export of the L-159 abroad will support.
The Czech army bought 72 machines, from which it uses only 24 from aero, the remainder wanted it to sell.
The purchase of the airplanes Casa might by the way have also still another judicial sequel.
The European commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defense at the European Court of Justice. The reason? It would have had to select the airplanes due to a completeEuropean advertisement and not at all by responding only one manufacturer.
The army took over already three airplanes Casa, which is to land the latter within fourteen days on the airport Kbely.
A longer index finger than Ringfinger means a lower risk to get sick with cancer
Men, whose index finger is longer, as the Ringfinger, are obviously exposed to a smaller risk to get sick with Prostatakrebs.
That is the surprising result of a study, which was published on Wednesday by British the journal OF CAN cerium.
That is to be connected with the mirror of the male hormone Testosteron.
" Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as simple test for the risk of Prostatakrebs and this sechzig" in particular with men to; , the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, explained Professorin at Krebsforschungsinstitut at the university in Warwick.
The finger could thus determine help, which men should absolutely undergo to a Prostatakrebs test, above all, if genetic risks or other factors of risk are present, like for example family health loads, Mrs. Eeles added.
In the period of 1994-2009 she pursued than 1500 patients with Prostatakrebs with her colleagues in Britain more, at the same time in addition, 3000 healthy men.
With more as half of the participants of the study the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the Ringfinger.
For these men the same probability of Prostatakrebs, as for 19 per cent of those men, was valid whose ring and index finger were equivalent long.
With men, whose index finger was longer than the Ringfinger, this risk sank however by 33 per cent, with men to sixty by 87 per cent.
The relationship of the length of the two mentioned fingers, which already form at the pränatalen age, reflects obviously the different mirrors of sex hormones, the child was exposed to which in the Gebärmutter.
Less Testosteron corresponds to a longer index finger.
Earlier research resulted in that the straight Testosteron accelerates the growth of Prostatakrebs.
Václav Pačes, prominent Czech Genetiker and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK, him this study was volatilely well-known, yet do not consider it the relationship between the finger length and the cancer risk so far " completely erwiesen."
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Exactly the same as that the largest part of Europe is also Czech Republic because of the Thursday morning under a Schneedecke.
On the roads and sidewalks mostly stuck snow, the Winterdienstler lies was in many places the whole night on axle.
The motorway D5 between kilometers of 89 and 90 toward Rozvadov is some accidents of Lkws and car because of closed and also the D1 with Brno toward Prague " steht."
This said Novinky.CZ of the dispatchers centers of the car Moto club (ÚAMK).
With kilometer of 91 a truck had an accident, with kilometer of 93 collided to two Lkws, in this accident gives it injured.
Also a few car lies in the ditch.
There are problems also with kilometer of 185 the motorway D1 toward Prague.
Two Lkws collided also here.
The drivers should drive off directly behind Brno with kilometer 190 or drive over Brno and drive with kilometer 182 with the place Kývalka.
There kilometer-long of back-up forms.
Also on the D11 an accident happened and directly with the approach road to Prague.
In Prague lies several centimeters a thick Schneedecke and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Autocolumns form for example in city-hurry pro sec., also the road Štěrboholská are completely clogged.
The safest means of transport are there in any case the Metro.
The streetcars drive with delays, for example on the line between Karl place and peace place.
At eight o'clock meets in the morning the Prager crisis committee.
Also on the railway and on the airfield there are problems.
The Czech state railway had to cancel seven express train connections because of snow banks.
There are problems for example on the distance Prague - Kralupy or also Prague - Beroun.
The travelers should absolutely inform about the current situation.
The airport Ruzyně is at night closed to 5 o'clock in the morning since Wednesday 11 o'clock.
Most roads in Südmähren are passable only with increased caution.
In order Vyškov are three side streets completely impassable, in the environment of Brno form snow banks in parts and in the environment by Blansko are one in a forced manner, on some roads snow milling lain more highly to be used.
One to most areas concerned is Výškov.
There three roads are still completely closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
One will have also here to evacuation of snow snow milling to use.
When they become again passable, cannot be measured up to now.
In the region Hodonín is announced in the area of the Weißkarpaten caution.
On the roads, which may be only strewn for nature protection reasons with inert strewing means, lies a Schneedecke thick up to five centimeter, stated ČTK.
In Czech Republic fell from two to ten centimeters new-fallen snow, at most in Nordböhmen - in parts up to 18 centimeters.
In the Mährisch Schlesi region fell up to 15 centimeters new-fallen snow.
In Czech Republic it hears to snow however slowly on.
American soldiers " a new; intelligent Waffe."
The American troops " for the first time in Afghanistan a new; intelligente" Weapon assigned, which admits so far only under its code name XM-25 is.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon affects the there conflict with the Taliban and shifts the balance of power to its favour.
The new weapon is like that something, like an super+exact cannon.
Their projectiles are steered by lasers with an accuracy by only to unite few meters in the goal.
The special projectiles of caliber of 25 mm, which were developed for this rifle and highly explosive explosive contain, function practically like small shells.
The projectiles can be programmed in such a way that them not only in the case of the impact on the goal, but at any point of their ballistic flight path to explode to be able.
That is, one can use it against an enemy, who itself behind an obstacle - hides to a wall or in the contactor ditch.
From above it is usually not protected, which can put murderous steel fragment rains from above it thus easily out of action.
Richard Audett according to, which took part in the development of the XM-25, is the new combat rifle the first infantry weapon, which " itself; intelligente" Technologies too use makes.
" The soldier proceeds strictly speaking in such a way: it visiert the goal on and sends a laser beam, which the distance certainly, then it wins an exact point of visor, after which it the quadrant elevation corrected, then it needs to only force away.
" We say times, one 543 m gemessen."
" If one forces away, the weapon loads itself up and shoots the projectile on the distance 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are shifted
The company Fujitsu shifts its address in bath Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next yearly will move 400 coworkers their job of the past office building at the Marienbader place in bath Homburg in the astro park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu shifts its address in bath Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant specialized in computers and their maintenance communicated on Wednesday, next yearly become 400 women in July and men their job of the past office building at the Marienbader place in bath Homburg in the astro park to move, that is a large Bürokomplex at the Lyoner road in Frankfurt quarters the Niederrad.
A spokeswoman von Fujitsu described, in the medium term should there still further 100 jobs of the company be accommodated, which were distributed on the region so far.
The renting offer was extremely attractive, besides the open-plan offices in the astro park of the function of the coworkers would come to meet better.
Also in bath Homburg had only been Fujitsu tenant.
Responsible managing director Bernd Wagner said, " with Frankfurt down wheel we gefunden" a central location with outstanding infrastructure;.
The excellent binding to the airport is straight of great importance for a global enterprise such as Fujitsu.
The recent removal of an important enterprise within the region caused yesterday joy with the winners and disappointment with the losers.
The Frankfurt restaurant departmental head Markus franc (CDU) said, thus is again " Global Player" won.
That is " great Standortbekenntnis."
Fujitsu fits the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The baths the decision of Fujitsu regretted Homburger mayor Michael Korwisi (the Greens).
The city was informed early by the management about the intention.
" We angeboten" the enterprise naturally our assistance; , Korwisi said.
The friendly contacts could have changed however nothing in the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the real estate in the Marienbader place.
In the long run economic reasons would have given the excursion.
Now go it around preventing a long emptying and in such a prominent place.
" I hope, which owners and landlord of the building show up kooperativ."
The house at the town hall square, used by Fujitsu, and the neighbouring " Small Vertikale" belonged to place with the remaining buildings at the Marienbader before ten years to the most disputed building projects of the cure city.
As common project of the city and a private project developer a new Stadtentree between station and city hall, which provided both because of the substantial land development that before partly as parking lot used surfaces and the height of the buildings for criticism, developed.
2001 referred the investment advice and Ratingunternehmen Feri, the software producer for travel marketing systems, start Amadeus, as well as at that time still the computer manufacturer Fujitsu the houses connected with Siemens.
The buildings used by Fujitsu 2006 of the Frankfurt German group of real estate chances as well as Morgan Stanley material the Estate find were acquired and one year was resold later to the Spanish Falcon material Estate of investment SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Konuzern resident in Tokyo calls itself as third biggest IT-provider of the world.
It makes for example computers and servers to enterprises available and carries out also the necessary service.
The address in the Rhine Main area is one the largest in Germany, by far more person employed counts Fujitsu however in Munich.
From bath Homburg draws in the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt down wheel, the further subsidiaries at this location should Fujitsu services and an enterprise named TDS be.
But in the office building astro park of 7000 square meters were rented.
In that twenty years old complex - the name plays its seat carrier on its star shaped sketch on has among other things the central association electro-technology and electronic industry.
Amazon closes servers - threats against Assange
Wikileaks comes increasingly into distress.
The Internet supplier Amazon banished the exposure platform of its servers.
Possibly behind it political pressure puts hundred-one hundred of secret diplomat telegrams after the publication.
Wikileaks founder Assange is allegedly in England.
The exposure platform Wikileaks comes in the United States ever more strongly under bombardment.
The Internet activists lost the entrance to its past American server and now looks for an Internet homeland in Europe.
The prominent American senator Joe Lieberman called meanwhile different countries and enterprises to the boycott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, which stands on the wanted persons lists of Interpol, is to be according to a newspaper report in Great Britain.
" Wikileaks of Amazon server verdrängt."
" Free speech in the country of the Freien" , the exposure activists communicated Twitter by short message service on Wednesday (local time).
The internet company Amazon had briefly before banished the Wikileaks documents of its servers.
The Internet activists had fallen back with the publication of the secret diplomatic telegrams to the Amazon Web service (AWS), in order to be able to master the high access numbers to the documents.
By Twitter Wikileaks continued to explain as the step: " Prima one - our dollars are now spent, beschäftigen." around people in Europe too;
If Amazon has such problem with the free speech, " they should stop, books too verkaufen."
Amazon has the use of its servers by Wikileaks stopped, after coworkers of senator would have employed Joe Lieberman investigations, reported the television station CNN with reference to the office Liebermans.
The chairman of the senate committee for homeland security had threatened Amazon with a boycott, reported the British " Guardian."
" I would have wished myself that Amazon seizes this measure in former times in view of the previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks" , the senator said.
Lieberman called meanwhile to refuse the platform also into other countries the use to servers.
" Wikileaks' illegal, enormous and inconsiderate procedure risks our national security and endangers approximately around the globe Leben" , were called it in a report of the non-party senator.
" No reliable enterprise - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks with its efforts, stolen material too verbreiten."
Wikileaks founder Assange, which is looked for because of rape suspicion by the authorities in Sweden, stands on the wanted persons list of Interpol.
According to a report of the Londoner newspaper " The Independent" the 39-jährige is Australian in Great Britain, who is exact place Scotland Yard well-known.
The Internet activist always called the investigations in Sweden plot of its opponents.
Wikileaks speaker Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London, it threats had given.
" There were even calls after a murder of Julian Assange."
Therefore be afraid Assange by right for his security, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder therefore to keep further hidden.
Hrafnsson reacted obviously to statements from North America.
In America the former republican governor von Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the responsible person for the Wikileaks exposures was to be accused and executed of betrayal.
In Canada an advisor said of head of government Stephen Harper - obviously ironical - on the television, Assange should " killed werden" and Obama could " a drone nutzen."
Between the white house and Assange meanwhile a hostile exchange was inflamed.
The speaker of the American president Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it " ridiculously and absurd" that Assange had demanded the resignation from Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton, if she is responsible for recently become known requests for espionage of diplomats.
" I am not completely safe, why we around the opinion types with a web page kümmern" ourselves; , so Gibbs.
" Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its a Webseite."
The American government sets now the protection of its data bases comprehensively to the test stand.
As a particular agent the Vize-Direktor of the center for anti-terror measures, Russell Travers, was appointed communicated the white house.
Travers is responsible for it, " necessary Strukturreformen" to develop, which became necessary by Wikileaks after the disclosure of the message reports.
The white house wants to let the ways examine also, how the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The American government announced besides, for the security of dissidents and most active ones should to ensure to want, them by the Wikileaks publication in danger advisablely.
" We undertook everything, treten" with them in contact too; , Foreign Office spokesperson said Philip Crowley.
" We are available to protect it if that become necessary sollte."
The ice university
To " Gelato University" with Bologna Eiskonditoren are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day-long basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest inlet and visitor from the whole world.
From where does the whole ice actually come?
Of the Gelatiere and of the Gelataio.
The Gelatiere, on German somewhat anciently the Eiskonditor, manufactures the cream according to all rules of the Italian Eismacherkunst.
The Gelataio gets the ice cream from the cooling counter with a putty, paints it into the Waffel and sells it then.
In order to know, one does not have after Anzola dell' Emilia in the province Bologna drive.
But who would like to know still more about ice, that does not come to " Gelato University" the Italian company Carpigiani past.
The ice university furnished the manufacturer of ice machines in the year 2003, so that the ice cream becomes fair from its machines everywhere the high Italian ideals.
The three-day-long basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest inlet and visitor from all over the world.
In addition, there are special courses of several days approximately around the chocolate ice and practical courses in the internal ice-cream parlor.
Some dreams others in the Midlife Crisis about a new career, dares itself simply times on the smooth ice of its vague longings.
This mark are there 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil over Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the Slow Food movement and wants in the country of the industrial Ice Cream in the future a European quality product to offer.
Anke from Berlin is a management consultant and wants after years in a nerve-racking job something own in bags.
Two young Egyptian inside dream to open in Cairo an ice-cream parlor.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil would like to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bar - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes, because its children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari explains first the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream to the participants.
Are crucial not only good taste, but also the seidige suppleness and the good consistency.
Luciano does not forget the Sahnehäubchen of the national and at all südländischen building of over with its training in addition: " Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then still each quantity of romance is dabei."
The first step for production seems completely simple.
Luciano tilts to basicadd the milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender, which heats up and then on four degrees cools everything down immediately with an electronic program on 85 degrees.
Then it untwists a cock at the machine, and a pasteurisierte white basis cream, basis for all milk ice sorts comes out.
The lecturer with questions is stormed immediately: Can one manufacture ice cream only with natural materials without stabilizer?
How can one leave free run to the own experimentation desire?
Luciano warns of it, from the spirit of the time in errs lead to let.
Who of ice cream " only from natural Zutaten" talks, possibly nevertheless stabilizers used - usually a natural product, about Guarkernmehl from the Guarbohne.
Naturally one can manufacture ice also without stabilizer, only it must be sold then within a daily, otherwise it sags in itself together, and the customer bites on loud ice grains.
Certain variations at the basic dimension are permitted.
It becomes more exciting with the flavours.
For the taste in the ice Maestro Luciano differentiates between added, which one buys in the Obst-Abteilung or with the sweets of the supermarket.
Besides gives it gives powders and pastes.
" The suppliers are anzudrehen." all to try, you dozens of aromatized additives;
" But you should simply times experimentieren."
Either with the Fruchtsorbets with sugar and blow fruits.
Or with the ice cream from the white basic dimension, those with eggs to the yellow cream becomes even and with cocoa powder the basis for all possible chocolate seductions.
Now the class participants may to the ice machines.
Luciano leaves it in each case four to different kinds of vanilla, chocolate, Mokka and Haselnuss ice manufactures - with or without eggs in the basic dimension, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural additives.
Also the fruit ice sorts are submitted to the same experiment.
More flavour material, more fruit Püree - geschmacklich that is not necessarily better.
Haselnuss ice does not taste more nussiger necessarily, if it contains more Haselnüsse.
The most popular Kiwi ice manufactures the working group, which uses more fruits, fewer waters and somewhat less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture emphasizes the taste of a Gelato correctly, says Luciano.
Ice production is an arithmetic problem: If peach Püree with much sugar is used, the sugar portion in the basic prescription must be reduced.
For lemon ice an extra portion of sugar is necessary.
Luciano pulls equipment out, with which he the sugar content of the fruit sorts certainly (winegrowers measure thereby the Oechsle in the Traubenmost).
Fortunately tables facilitate the Rechnerei.
Ice to make requires no longer as much physical employment as in former times.
Not only the equipment for the automatic production of the basic dimensions helps.
There is also equipment, in which the finished ice mixture is cremig struck at the same time and cooled on temperatures below freezing.
All automation to the defiance small breakdowns are not missing.
The Brazilian Gustavo bekleckert itself and its course colleagues from top to bottom with Fruchtpüree, when the oversize staff mixer gets to him out of control.
" In each Kurs" , Maestro Luciano means " it is only one question of the time, until passiert." such a thing;
Testers in the twilight
The European food authority Efsa is infiltrated of the industry experimenting with gene plants.
Now the team of experts Testbiotech, which understands itself as independent Institut for the subsequent estimation of the biotechnology, formulates this reproach.
" Like a conspiracy theory sounds, but we dokumentiert" it well; , Testbiotech boss said Christian OF Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The director/conductor of the Efsa team of experts for genetically changed plants, Harry Kuiper, and a further Efsa expert are for years also with the Lobbyistenverband Ilsi under contract.
That is paid by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper cooperated considerably in the Efsa test provisions for gene plants and stands thereby in a clear clash of interests, criticizes Then.
The Efsa regulations are by paragraphs with position papers of the Ilsi and would carry thereby the handwriting of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech criticizes an interest collision.
Like that a high-ranking Efsa Managerin is recently without editions or transition period to the Swiss agrarian company Syngenta - and thereby the sides changed.
Also the Central German broadcast (MDR) had revealed recently personnel connections between controlling EU department and industrial lobby, what made the Federal Office for Environment Protection hellhörig just like European Union parliamentarians.
The Efsa can recognize meanwhile no clash of interests.
One falls back to all respectable data, also to such the industry, as long as they are from high technical quality, is called it in a statement.
Of the experts, who work for Efsa, one does not require that they do not have contacts to the industry.
They would have to reveal these however.
Kuiper grants its work for internationally the Life Sciences of institutes (Ilsi) in the USA.
This calls itself as neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things for Risikoabschätzung for biotechnology without order for lobby.
In the thing independent experts criticize such as Then that genetically changed plants at present become certified without each feeding attempt with animals and are not tested the reaction by gene plants on environmental influences.
" We want to know, what for example genetically changed corn on the field macht" , Then says.
Present practice is it, only insulating proteins to test but not the whole gene plant which does not supply reliable results.
" If one does not look for the risks, how one is to then find her? " , Then asks accusing.
That sees also Angelika Hilbeck in such a way.
The female scientist researches since 1994 in the genetic engineering and is at present active at the technical university Zurich.
The industry tries in this area as in the USA now also in Europe ever more to affect or discredit critical scientists.
It gives therefore hardly still researchers, who are not intertwined with companies.
For enterprises critical studies were not published usually.
" The industry controls the Sicherheitsforschung" , Hilbeck states.
The trace of the stones
Uli Gsell also which procured itself, altogether to about 400 Kilos.
On Monday evening it stood vorm Stuttgart station, the tuba on the back.
It was demo.
It snowed.
History is well-known: In September the excavators were moved forward and had begun to break a large piece off of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no more the same: Zigtausende demonstrated billions-worth setting of the station lower against S21.
When it came to the building stop, a majority of the wing lay in rubble.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer shelly limestone, a soft rough stone, between 1914 and 1920 blocks.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
It has itself few that breaking into secured.
" These stones are Reliquien."
" They may not verschwinden."
It swarms: " A cheap and poor stone, simply and erdenhaft."
When it sawed one, after cigarette smoke had smelled.
Which it will make with breaking into, it does not know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell also.
The trace of the Stuttgart stones leads into a forest with T5ubingen on a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen its loaded established.
The 44-Jährige acts with old stones.
He bought all, which resulted with the outline in Stuttgart.
" It would be a dishonor, it to crushed stone husbands or in the dump was verschwinden" , it says to a Holzbüdchen, which was once an awake little house in its office.
Insulted and if one threatened it, he tells, when in September in the newspapers it stood that he had bought the remainders of the north wing of the abort entrepreneur.
But it talked with the S-21-Gegnern, for days.
And it explained to them that it cannot do nevertheless now nothing at all for the outline.
And if it happens now, then it is the most reasonable nevertheless, if the stones were re-used.
About 200 S-21-Gegner took themselves thereupon one on average 80 Kilos heavy right parallelepiped also, unit price 6.50 to 14 euros.
As memories, some in addition, in hope to be able to return it in a reconstruction.
500 tons Rongen had bought, to 25 large truck loads.
About half still stores in the forest, which is remainder long sold.
Owner of garden, landscape gardner, Häuslebauer.
From everywhere they came and away-dragged, which trunk and supporters could carry.
Stuttgart stones of the impact long in " themselves; Mäuerle" transformed or into delimitations of herb patches.
" Actually this stone is not anything Besonderes" , Rongen says.
" Would not be the political Komponente."
It rises in its jeeps, makes a route by its 20 hectare large realm.
It studied and broke law off, late biology, then it interested in computers and finally stone dealers became.
And stone lovers.
It stores 40000 tons of stones.
From all of Germany it karrt its treasures together.
He says, he is a largest old stone dealer of the republic.
It brakes.
In the snow ornate behauene sandstones lie.
" They belonged once to Dresdens the Marienbrücke" , it tells.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warmly, it swarms.
" My Lieblingsstein."
It goes the way highly through the forest.
It points to a heap: red sandstone, early part Karlsruhe of the station.
And further.
" Beautiful Travertin."
Once the right parallelepipeds belonged to the grandstand of the Stuttgart Neckarstadions.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the cathedral sank Blasien, tuff of the Heilbronner hospital.
Which work, which troubles, which sweat.
If Rongen remembers, how the stones were gehauen in former times by hand and moved with simple pulley-blocks and ox trucks, it becomes completely ehrfürchtig.
" It would be nevertheless a scandal, if one würde." such a thing schreddern;
It is not become, loaded already not at all rich.
But the stone dealer employs 14 people today, in addition stone-cutters, have themselves a sculptor, forge above, a Glasbläser and a garden farmer established in the forest.
" We work hard, but it is befriedigend" , says the remainder-worth.
Shortly it must to Cologne.
There are stones also there to save.
Talent fight over High potential
It prevails active crush at the Buffet.
16 students urge itself around salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweet.
The technical University of Braunschweig and the car maker Volkswagen invited mechanical engineering and Design students to a Workshop.
In a kind they are to talk shop to design competition together with Volkswagen developers over the car of the future - and become acquainted completely besides Volkswagen.
In the contest around the most intelligent heads meanwhile many enterprises go setting into close combat and, like VOLKSWAGEN, on co-operation with the universities.
Their mission: To recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the lecture-rooms, before they are wooed on the job market to come and by others.
And because the universities do not publish lists over the achievements of their students, one tries to erspähen the exception talents in practice projects and actually bind.
On the second day of the Workshops to DO Braunschweig recruits the car company the talents.
A young lady from the personnel department distributes ball-point pens, Gummibärchen and briefcases with Volkswagen logo.
It tells the hopeful young talents of practical course programs and student jobs and points to them out ways into the company.
To Nico Selle of DO Braunschweig cares for the project with VOLKSWAGEN.
He sees the advantages for both sides: " The students step into contact to the industry and collect Erfahrungen."
" VOLKSWAGEN can become acquainted with students at the same time, look at itself and consider itself interesting candidates more near, who käme." as a coworker in question;
Such co-operation, so Selle, are not unusual.
It is new that so offensively around the students one court.
" Otherwise the emphasis lay rather on the technical Projekt" , Selle says.
The fight for graduated ones the freshly will become still harder probably.
In many industries the enterprises cannot select themselves their coworkers no more from a large crowd of applicants.
Separate they must anpreisen themselves and particularly over highly qualified workers balzen.
Above all graduates from the engineer disciplines are thereby in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the federation of German engineers VDI remained vacant in October over 40.000 engineer places.
And the so-called engineer gap will become still larger according to VDI prognoses.
For the audit and consulting firm KPMG novel Dykta goes on the talent hunt.
It organizes complex Recruiting events as for instance the KPMG Race, a kind modern shred hunt, with which the participants must find their way on the basis of GPS coordinates.
The enterprise wants to send eight promising students in such a way in the next year straight through the USA.
Completely besides the participants can regard KPMG branches and become acquainted with the enterprise.
Who may with, decides in two selection rounds before.
Only the Crème de la Crème of the many applicants flies to the USA.
When striking and stinging around the High of potential at the universities the cannons continue to increase according to Dykta.
" We want us with the Race from the mass abheben."
" Only a simple Segeltörn was too wenig." us;
For talent hunters Dykta seems to come up the calculation.
" We have Kontakt." until today with all participants of a similar action in the last year;
" Some stand themselves shortly before their conclusion and want soon with us bewerben" , it says.
Apart from direct courting at the campus above all small and medium-size enterprises go also completely classically with occupation fairs on the Pirsch.
" We try graduates at trade fairs too erreichen."
" Approximately on the Intersolar" , Sitha Stübe, personnel chief reports with the solar technique manufacturer Solarworld.
Bonn enterprises employs approximately 1500 coworkers in Germany.
Stübe knows around the new generation problem.
At present are publicized on the Unternehmenswebsite 35 places.
" It is straight very heavily, vakante positions too besetzen."
" That costs much time and Geld" , it says.
A further way is the contact over the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates to the university in Freiberg with different universities, for instance.
" The professors give references that one writes its thesis (diploma) to practical courses with us to make or kann."
Expensive publicity campaigns are not announced with the solar specialist.
For it the enterprise with other advantages tries to recruit for itself: Personal atmosphere, flattens hierarchies and easy communication.
" That often cannot a large concern bieten" , personnel chief says Stübe.
Money does not play no more with the job search long the leading role.
Flexible work times, care of children or good opportunities for advancement are further crucial factors.
Solarworld occupied with a study of the Great Place ton of Work of institute the 55. Place among the 100 best employers of Germany.
Institut provides an annual good list of German employers.
In addition it asks coworkers it with its work and its job surrounding field is as content and looks on the basic conditions for the persons employed.
Personnel chief Stübe expects from the placement also pluses with the job-looking for.
" I think that applicant particularly schauen" after external evaluations over a potenziellen employer; , it says.
Wolf of pure Kriegler of the German Employer Branding academy advises enterprises, which want to develop themselves with a long-term strategy a good reputation as employers.
He guesses his customers to more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all internal measures.
" The best way to make itself attractive as employers leads across the own Mitarbeiter" , it says.
In the branch jargon that is called internal Employer Branding, thus employer mark formation within the own staff.
" Content coworkers are the best Botschafter."
If one treats its people well and they identify themselves with the enterprise, then they would recruit completely from alone with friends and acquaintance for their employer.
" That is like a play with Bande" , Kriegler says.
Obama stops new drillings for oil
Before the coast of the US Federal State it will give no new drillings for oil to Florida in the gulf of Mexico in the coming years.
An appropriate prohibition issued the government in Washington - and thus its earlier plans finally recall.
Also before the Atlantic coast new drillings remain for the time being forbidden.
This communicated Ministers of the Interior Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
Cause for the strict prohibition, which is to be valid at least for the coming five years, is " the explosion of the drilling platform; Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the misfortune, which cost and to the largest environment disaster of the USA led eleven workers the life, president Barack Obama had signaled his readiness on pressure of the opposition and the industry to permit new drillings in the eastern part of the gulf of Mexico.
The proponents want to reduce thereby the dependence of the USA von Öllieferungen from the foreign country.
Who carries the responsibility for the devastating oil pollution in the gulf, is not clarified until today finally.
In the center of the criticism is located the British energy group BP, which is confronted with demands for billion.
A commission of inquiry on behalf Obamas is to submit in the course of December their results.
In October Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar had waived the drilling stop imposed after the explosion.
In the connection different oil companies had placed immediately requests for new drilling projects.
With sharper controls and stricter safety regulations Obama and Salazar want to exclude a recent disaster.
At present the responsible board of control, which was guessed/advised after numerous corruption reproaches in disrepute, is reformed fundamentally.
Parallel Obama announced to close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil and gas companies.
The industry warns now publicly of the fact that the delivery in the gulf would fail by a stricter adjustment clearly smaller than so far.
" The plans of the government are the largest brake for the growth of the oil and Gasindustrie" , the result of a current branch inquiry reads by the advisor company BDO - still before the drilling prohibition of Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance deplores besides the uncertainty in the industry: " Nobody knows, what exactly with the adjustment change wird."
Investments into new promotion projects were postponed until further notice - debited to growth.
Ogoniland is burned down
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells as at the gas station: Billions litre run out crude oil destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
Humans live on theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means it good.
" Does not trouble you ab" , the Ökoaktivist calms the journalists down: " You are kriegen." today still enough oil mud before the lens;
The 37-jährige Nigerianer pursued the attempt to make a blueprint a boy with the streaks, surrounding wading up to the chest in the water, it: In the rainbow-colored water gloss the scene works nearly prettily.
The fact that under the surface brown crude oil clouds float is not to be seen.
In former times she collected, tells here eimerweise shrimps Esther Badom on the bank of the Bodo Jetty river.
In the meantime slowly-acting flowing waters is perfectly dead.
Before five years enormous amounts crude oil poured into the enormous humid area from a burst piping.
Fischer from that close convenient small towns Bodo must now six hours rudders, in order to arrive into fischhaltige waters: The Ogoniland lain in the heart of the Nigerdeltas is considered as one of the most badly verpesteten regions of the world.
On the trip by the Mangrovensümpfe durchzogenen of river courses the whole extent of devastation becomes obvious.
Instead of bright water the motorboat turns up brown Brühe, who dips its hand into the water, pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the Mangrovenbäumchen rise up like black Lakritzstangen out of the ground, leave sad isolate palms their whisks which can be found to hang.
Bird-swarm, as they are otherwise usual in humid areas, one searches in vain: As soon as Außenborder is silent, eerie peace spreads in like a gas station the smelling earlier Paradies.
" Which happens here, is ecological Kriegsführung" , Celestine Akpobari says darkly: " We live in constant danger for the Gesundheit."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The settlement area of the Ogoni is for decades a umkämpftes battleground: Here the first Explorateure from Europe penetrated, here organized itself in the 80's-years with late executed writers the Ken Saro Wiwa the first resistance, here had the Shell company 1993 its production to adjust more than 60 years ago, because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
This very day the return after Ogoniland is refused to the enterprise: While from the entire delta region of the three-way size of Switzerland over 5000 drilling sources and 7000 kilometers pipings are also pumped daily more than two million barrel of the black gold, the oil fields are appropriate for the company in the Ogoniland fallow, too unstably are the situation.
Every few hundred meters rise up steel racks like bizarre sculptures out of the water: " Christbäumchen" the heads of the boreholes are much too tenderly called.
They are years old up to 50, which corrode to most to in Marks.
Again and again break apart such a drilling head, mean Akpobari, then gutter a constant river crude oil in the water.
More than two billion litre according to expert estimations in 50 years into the ecological system of the Deltas flowed: Year by year the quantity oil, as it " with the accident of the supertanker; Exxon Valdez" before 21 years in the sea before Alaska penetrated - one of the largest environment disasters in the history of mankind.
Who is to be made responsible for the continuous Öko GAU, over it one argues.
While the Shell company makes sabotage and the organized oil theft responsible for more than 90 per cent of the contamination, environmentalist sees bursting drilling heads and leaking pipelines as main causers.
Shell puts on substantially lower safety standards in Nigeria than otherwise in the world usual, accused the US scientist Richard Steiner the company 2008: However the rate of defects at the lines is " around a multiple more highly than anderswo" one;.
At a place, which looks from the distance like an abandoned, oil-smeared workshop in the open air, shapes emerge from the Mangroven: They are fragment naked and up to the neck oil-smeared.
Under one of the many barrels, which are to be constituted partly connected with tubes, partly arbitrarily scattered on the area, a fire flickers: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel the crude oil over the fire is heated up several hours long, explains Michael, the boss of the group.
First gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the catching pot, later tröpfelt at the end of the line kerosene and finally Diesels out.
Thus Michael and four coworkers produce 300 litres daily up to four barrels of Diesel à: " That brings us 34,000 Naira ein" - approximately 22 dollar.
The delta inhabitants use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state of black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The Diesel price ridiculously low with scarcely 40 euro-cent per litre can the illegal digesters still undercut: Because they get their raw material in vain.
It comes from " Bunkerern" , which tap the pipeline net straight through Ogoniland: In this way are lost to the country according to experts in the entire Niger delta daily at least 16 million litre crude oil.
Only a infinitesimal small part of the provisionally stored temporarily raw material is however illegaly improved: Organized criminal networks, to which also politicians and high-ranking of military are to belong, fill the lion's share into tankers and verscherbeln it on the world market.
The debate, whether the environment disaster is owed rather activities of the population or the laxen production way, holds the activist Akpobari for purely academic.
" If the oil companies were not noticed as intruders and if they would not have so thoroughly destroyed the base of life Fischer, there would be neither to sabotage nor theft and illegal Raffinerien."
In the meantime the relationship of the Ogoni is particularly destroyed to Shell however so that only one departure of the company would be applicable: " Perhaps different nationalities place themselves like the Chinese than better heraus."
There Michael becomes nervously.
" High time that you verschwindet" , the muskulöse oil man says.
" The soldiers know each minute kommen."
Are gotten illegal oil-noble by the special-purpose force of the armed forces, no arrest threatens them, probably however a painful bribe.
Also the soldiers primarily originating from the national north want to profit - like all Nigerianer - from the raw material.
" This condemned things gebracht" our country in each regard to the dog; , Akpobari says.
Investigators discover dangerous building defect in A380-Triebwerken
A380 has obviously a large safety problem.
Investigators discovered a possible building defect, which " to one with the investigation of a made an emergency landing machine; catastrophic Triebwerksausfall" to lead can.
The airline Qantas wants to sue now the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the made an emergency landing Qantas airbus at the beginning of November had obviously many more luck than so far well-known: The Australian air security authority determined and warns a large safety problem with its investigations with the engines of some A380-Maschinen - now of a possible building defect.
The potential defect would have heavy consequences: During an oil hose connector it could produce fatigue cracks and leakages, was called it in one on this Thursday published statement of the authority ATSB.
This would have " too; a catastrophic Triebwerksausfall" to lead can.
Manufactured engines are affected in 20 airplanes of a380-Reihe by Rolls-Royces.
Among them is the Qantas airbus, which had to make an emergency landing on 4 November in Singapore.
The Australian airline introduced now legal steps against the British turbine manufacturer.
It submitted a complaint reason with an Australian Federal court in Sydney, which make further legal measures for it possible against the enterprise.
Qantas boss Alan Joyce said, his airline compensation for the incident at the beginning of November will require.
With the fire of the engine parts had separated and the bearing areas had damaged.
Rolls-Royce constituted an oil fire as a cause for the damage.
After the incident now world-wide engines must be replaced up to 40.
The Australian investigators announced to accomplish further safety tests at the superjumbo jets which are equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation is the result of a co-operation with Rolls-Royces, said ATSB speaker Martin Dolan.
The safety problem was considered sufficiently important, in order to inform all concerning.
After the forced landing of the Qantas machine the airline had kept its A380-Flotte lasting for weeks at the ground.
Singapore airlines let about three of its eleven A380 temporary at the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine with a A380 as precautionary measure.
The doppelstöckige flier is the largest passenger airline of the world.
Country-wide snow releases traffic chaos
Germany completely in white: Over night nearly generally speaking country is snow pleases.
On many roads chaos, courses and flights prevails fails.
With car accidents at least three humans died.
The winter frostet Germany: At icy temperatures almost the whole republic is in the night on Thursday course-snows - which leads in many places to traffic chaos.
In the north and in the east partly 15 centimeters thick Schneedecken lie.
On several motorways and many roads traffic is strongly reduced.
On a7 with Flensburg winter services were in continous use, did not cope with constant the again up-blowing snow however not.
Besides violent gusts swept over the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for seagoing vessel trip and Hydrographie (BSH) expects at the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning at storm tides with water levels of 1.2 meters over the normal conditions.
In Saxonia the snow banks on the motorways and federal highways led to substantial problems.
According to the tempest center Meteomedia was in Saxonian Switzerland therefore uncertainty phase violet announced - the highest stage at all.
Partly fell there 30 centimeters new-fallen snow, blows and strong hoist provided for blowing.
There several trucks and cars remained putting in the night.
Also in Saxonia-Anhalt the police authorities announced large disturbances on the roads.
On a2 snow and wind led to coming to a hold traffic and back-up.
In Thuringia a4 and A9 were affected by the snows.
According to German course it comes into Saxonia, Saxonia-Anhalt, Thuringia and in the north of Bavaria to substantial disturbances.
Snow on the tracks, umgestürzte trees on the rails or destroyed overhead lines and switches is the main problems.
In Saxonia long-distance traffic from Leipzig had to be stopped after Nuremberg.
In the Thuringian hall field a ICE had to stop its trip to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied by firefighters and rescue aides with blankets, meals and beverages in the course.
Snow hoist swept over the roads.
On large German airports lead the snow hoist to numerous flight losses.
In Munich some cancellations are already announced according to a spokeswoman of the flight information center.
In Frankfurt/Main according to a Fraport spokeswoman already 40 flights were painted.
Winter services are in continous use.
Only few stranded passengers at the airport are, nevertheless would be available for them still scarcely 400 camp beds.
On many roads it already came at Wednesday evening to accidents.
In the evening a truck driver died with the collision with a course on a railroad overpass into east Holstein.
The engine driver was easily injured.
In close proximity to Nuremberg it came due to snow-covered roads to a similar accident: A truck on a railroad overpass was seized also here, because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
In the course four passengers were injured - the distance from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed into the morning hours.
Besides a 30-jährige woman died, after it had estimated itself with its car with Aschaffenburg on smooth road.
The Meteoroligists have a good message however nevertheless: The snow still loose and powdery will be and therefore with easy gusts will already whirl up.
But the wind will weaken itself.
Only the Baltic Sea is afflicted by fast and storming hoists.
It remains however very coldly - ortsweise up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank looks for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its landmark: According to a newspaper report the financial institution looks for buyers for the two office towers to their Frankfurt head office.
Up to 500 million euros the real estate could bring in.
Straight one only made the German bank their seat of the group pretty: The twin towers in Frankfurt bank quarters were modernized; in the meantime the bankers were allowed their old job back.
But now the financial group wants to obviously again take the costs out of the renovation - and looks for a buyer for the two multistoried buildings, how " Financial Times Deutschland" with reference to a speaker writes.
The speaker did not call reasons for the planned sale.
" We examine always, whether it is more meaningful, real estate itself to possess or sell and afterwards zurückzumieten" , it said.
Thus of Germany delivers largest Kreditinstitut its company headquarters already after short time again.
The bank had taken over the double towers only in the middle of 2007 for 272 million euros of the investors of an internal fund and had afterwards complex reorganized.
The energetic change devoured the data after approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring much money to the bank.
Industry experts estimate the value in the meantime in " Greentowers" renamed towers of the newspaper according to on approximately 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are sold again at funds in the possession the bank or to an independent investor, are at present still openly, said the speaker.
Thousands mourn dead buddies
More than 10,000 humans thought in New Zealand of the buried miners, who were explained after several explosions in a mine for dead.
Still the corpses could not be saved, because the security situation is further precarious in the misfortune pit.
Scarcely two weeks ago it had come into the Pike River mine close of the city Greymouth to a violent explosion.
29 miners at the age between 17 and 62 years were buried under days.
A probe had been down-let into the misfortune pit, however no trace of survivors had discovered.
Due to the high concentration poisonous gases and further following explosions could for safety reasons no rescue squad descend.
After the second violent explosion the authorities and expert had assumed it gives no more chance of survival for the buddies.
The corpses could not be saved so far.
Now member and friends with a commemoration ceremony reminded of the dead ones.
Ten thousand humans had met in radiating sunshine in Greymouth on the south island of New Zealand.
Two minutes long were silent it.
In honours of the buried miners 29 tables were set up to see on those helmets, lamps and the names of the buddies were.
Also pictures and personal articles, among them articles of clothing and Surfbretter, found here their place.
Before the government buildings of the country the flags on half-mast blew.
New Zealand hoped that the miners " from the depths of the Erde" the surface would come, said the Prime Minister of New Zealand John keys to the participants of the commemoration ceremony.
" But they are never home gekommen."
It cannot lock with the death of its son, as long as it did not see its corpse, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen in the pit was buried.
Beside the Prime Minister and members of the victims several foreign diplomats participated in the commemoration ceremony.
With the first explosion on 19 November also miners of British and South African origin had been buried.
Rescue workers began to delete a fire inside the coal mine on the south island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases are displaced, one begin to down-cool the glowing temperatures inside the mine said chief of the police Gary Knowles to journalists.
To hell, warrior!
Does Splatter fit the art cinema?
The producer Nicolas Winding Refn plumbs with its fighter Epos " Walhalla Rising" old category borders again out.
Of which public the Danish producer Nicolas Winding Refn may have thought, when it " Walhalla Rising" turned?
A caught Wikinger warrior with only one eye (WAD Mikkelsen) frees itself from his torturers and surrounds with almost superhuman forces by the dozen its opponents - ideally bloody Action, straight because our hero sounds gladly rabiater killing methods served and its enemies already times the Gedärme from the alive body tears oneself for young male spectators in the search for, if he has bad mood.
On the other hand a eye says, as it is actually called, the whole film about no word, and also the other figures admit themselves at the most times to or two sentences or a few painful death cries to hinreißen.
Otherwise is silent and one geschwelgt in the gruselig beautiful hill landscape of Scotland, which the Wikingerwelt of before approximately thousand years the backdrop offers.
Ideally rather for adult Cineasten with interest in Existentialismus and very calm camera trips.
, If a film has several target groups, harm beautifully only, if they are mutually exclusive.
Producer Winding Refn is valid since its wild and gestylten Drogendealer trilogy " Pusher" as a kind Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, refuses however stoisch making accessible its works with somewhat more humor the mainstream or somewhat less brutality for the Arthouse.
Most art cinema friends might let themselves be deterred from the brain mass squirting around and the Gedärmen.
The act ion fans die at the latest before boredom if a eye for freely interpretable reasons with a troop of violent Christian mission acres breaks open via ship after Jerusalem and an eternity in calm air and fog feststeckt, before the crew arrives obvious at America and continues to be silent there.
No miracle thus that " Walhalla Rising" in Germany no cinema rental business found and now only on DVD appeared.
That is particularly because of the magnificent pictures a misery, in addition, because behind the prätentiösen to bluttriefenden front a sometimes exciting piece cinema hides itself, which earned something attention.
In this film it does not concern dialogues or a stringer duck action, it is all atmosphere, a film-nascent having a temperature area.
And from there is no escaping for the spectator.
Refn hardly grants one moment of the relaxation to it and ties it with its icy pictures and the dark Trance well-behaved soundtrack completely slowly the throat too, above all however with the incomprehensible hate, which against-strikes him from the hearts of the figures.
Only a small blond boy, a eye faithfully to the side stands, retains themselves as as innocence, all different by anger is floated.
Very most the einäugige hero, whose motives are never explained, who becomes sometime however for enemies and temporarily allied one the warrior from hell, possibly as the Ambassador of the devil.
It means a spoiling, perhaps in addition, only for anyway the spoiling.
" Walhalla Rising" a puzzling film, which one can hate and admire, is for annoying, exciting and being astonished.
An experience.
Puzzling earthwork
The atomic energy authority IAEA has new referring to a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country resists however to take in addition position - still it permits controls.
Against midnight of 5th on 6 September 2007 attacks at least four Israeli F-15 I of combat aircraft a mysterious, würfelförmiges building in Syria.
It stands on the bank Euphrates; the next larger city, 30 kilometers far away, is Dair as-Saur.
Their name emerges in documents of the international atomic energy authority (IAEA), if it concerns the reactor, which Syria built allegedly with the help of from North Korea in the right parallelepiped, hidden in a valley, which goes off the river.
According to a Briefing of the US foreign secret service CIA von Ende April 2008 also the reactor common under the name of the close locality el-Kibar would have been well suitable to produce plutonium - from nuclear weapons to build let themselves.
For other purposes against it the technology from the 50s is hardly suited.
The CIA led a video presentation forwards with indistinct satellite photographs.
By computer animation it faded in, where which components of the reactor before the destruction are to have been, which is a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the atomic center Yongbyon.
Besides it submitted, those to photos the building from the proximity to show or the interior.
The reactor is confessed shortly before start-up, it was said, but equips not yet with fuel rods been.
Today, more as three years after the bombardment, is hardly more well-known than at that time, the mysteries became rather larger with the time.
The former US president George W. Bush revealed recently in his memoirs the fact that the CIA before the attack was quite safe that Syria in el-Kibar built a reactor but hardly saw reference points for it that it " in the country; an active Nuklearwaffenprogramm" gave.
Some secret service agents in Europe are there rather still more careful and speak only of one " alleged Reaktor" , even if it " the CIA presentation for; plausibel" hold.
Hard proofs are missing to them, just like the IAEA.
In demand, as safe he was to have a reactor before itself a high UN-diplomat answered in the summer only lapidary, those IAEA " enough material, around questions too stellen."
The debris of the alleged " unused Militärgebäudes" the Syrians created hasty aside and planed the area thoroughly.
A IAEA team under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of uranium in June 2008, which had been manufactured by humans, found nevertheless.
Besides the IAEA kept satellite photographs of commercial offerers from the time after the attack, who might be more meaningful than of the CIA presented direct over a member state.
However these photographs on the market are not to be gotten, because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot verify from there their authenticity independently.
Syria has always to have protested, a secret nuclear programme to have never operated or a reactor build.
The uranium comes from the Israeli weapons, explained Damascus.
But the IAEA rejected after analysis of the particles as improbable.
Damascus refuses since then discussing - exactly the same as the satellite photographs.
Besides it refuses a second inspection in el-Kibar and the entrance to the rubble of the zerbombten building to the testers.
In addition, Israel is silent iron.
" We are never kommentieren" that; , recently that affirmed at present the attack acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert the official position.
Thus the investigation of the case drags itself since June 2008 without result and " develops increasingly to a serious reliability problem for the Behörde" , how a high western diplomat at the seat of the IAEA in Vienna grants - finally a heavy offence against the Nuclear NONPROLIFERATION Treaty is located in the area, over which the IAEA is awake.
As key to progress with the clearing-up the IAEA sees obviously three further mechanisms, which " in functional Verbindung" with the presumed reactor to stand are to still exist - and differently than these.
The inspectors revealed so far neither, which plants it concerns, still which function it to have or which lets it appear suspicious.
After information of the South German newspaper they are internally called Masyaf and Iskandariayah with the IAEA Marj as-Sultan, derived again from close convenient cities.
Independent institutes for the Science and internationally to Security in Washington (Isis) these places identified and on satellite photographs a building complex with Masyaf made, with which it acts in all probability over one of the suspicious objects.
It is possibly in or directly beside a military base - exactly with this reason Syria of the IAEA refuses the entrance to the three places.
In Vienna is called it, the Syrians was afraid one fishing expedition - that the IAEA is before-sent from the USA, in order to spy military plants.
Because the nuclear detectives had become attentive by an hint of the U.S. secret services on the mechanisms.
The IAEA has references, under the fact satellite photos that between the three places and the right parallelepiped at the Euphrates material and was transported.
A high western diplomat in Vienna said, at least one of the plants could " in connection with the Brennstoffproduktion" stand.
It gives however " no referring to sensitive Aktivitäten" , thus uranium enrichment or reprocessing; Processes, which are necessary for the building of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come and where from it the plutonium for the bomb should be separated later, to these central questions there are if necessary plausible assumptions.
Unclear it is also whether rubble, which could save valuable traces, to which three places were stored.
As if the hundreds of truck loads of the ground would have disappeared, want to have nobody information about where the debris remained.
Only the few kilometers of el-Kibar on the other side Euphrates convenient salt mine Al-Tibni, which examined Syria 1998 for its suitability than camps for radioactive waste, the IAEA than improbable is valid.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had it recently in an analysis of satellite photographs for the renowned magazine Jane' s Intelligence Review brought with the reactor in connection.
Photographs from the orbit show however that Syria at the three suspicious places made earthwork and removed large containers, after the IAEA entrance had required.
That can be coincidence, however hardly contributed to eliminate the suspicion.
Besides it is called some months in diplomat circles, the IAEA after used to develop a plan for inspections there which should permit it to Syria, any military secrets to true - alone the expenditure shows, how large the interest of the inspectors is.
Meanwhile, Damascus ironed also this proposal off.
Still one year ago had appeased western diplomat in Vienna, who was reactor destroyed, therefore the thing does not have high urgency, for instance US Ambassador Glyn Davies brings so-called special inspections since a few months in the play, one of the sharpest means, which have the Viennese atomic energy authority, in order to implement controls.
IAEA boss Yukiya Amano, which would have to suggest these inspections, " of course of; an option, for which I in the future openly bin" spoken, still however he hesitates.
It lies a high risk in this way: On the one hand it needs for it a majority in the board of governors of the IAEA, and some of the 35 countries represented there are everything but erpicht on an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat gives to consider: " What is, if they do not find nothing at all at the end? "
Love in times of the war
Since Angelina Jolie began in the summer with the work on her still nameless direction debut, there is annoyance.
The film script wrote it, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
Much more white one over it non is however already enough for unrest.
Persistent keeps itself the rumor, the woman, Muslim, falls in love during the Yugoslavia war with their Serbian rapist.
Bosnian woman federations protested immediately, whereupon some turning days planned in Sarajevo were moved at short notice to Hungary.
In the meantime the film is turned off in Hungary and in post office production, but it still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote over the UN refugee organization UNHCR Jolie and required a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper now reported - Jolie is even ambassador of the UN refugee organization.
It is diplomatic non it to the women weeks ago already times a meeting in Hungary offered, which rejected however.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, so Hasecic.
Love stories in Vergewaltigungscamps it did not give, and to Jolies attitude the victims in relation to betrayal it enough over the film script.
Their organization recommended according to the UN refugee organization to dismiss Jolie as an ambassador reports the Guardian.
What exactly however wrote Jolie for scenes?
The Bosnian cultural Ministry, which got to read their film script, gave a turning permission for Sarajevo after some back and forth - it is not completely clear, why Jolie did not come then nevertheless.
The young authoress protested, her does not pursue political intentions with her film, with much trouble into the Yugoslavia conflict trained themselves, wants the terrible consequences of the war to show and to all sides involved a voice give.
With contents it remains however vague.
Thus still another second Synopsis circulates to the film in the net, which sounds then nevertheless rather differently: The loving already knew each other therein before outbreak of war and meet again, when them, Bosnian Muslim, are kidnapped in a Serbian Camp, in which it as a guard work.
Which nevertheless substantially differently sounds " than the variant; Rape victim slams himself in Folterknecht."
That Jolies film actually already before the war begins - as much is safe.
The pressure on it, so Jolie, is " unfairly and is based on Fehlinformationen."
Now you can provide probably only the hackers of Hollywood peace: By it the film script, as already so many place before, illegaly in the net.
Nothing like away here
In this evening it runs finally times again correctly approximately for the Irish.
No trace of Betrübnis.
But the home team dominates its guests made of Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans johlen before joy with crashing loud music, it stamp with the feet.
The Bailey pub in the southIrish Cork trembles, because the players Tischtennisbälle throw and meet over a three-meter distance in Bierbecher -.
" Bierpong" bizarre pageant calls itself, to win gives it 500 euros victory premium plus plane tickets after read Vegas for the Bierpong world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm type; this shrill drinking play and the reserved computer scientist, really do not fit.
And the 26-Jährige tries nevertheless to amuse to divert itself from the boring question, which will bring the future.
On its plan fun does not stand in read Vegas, it in January application discussions in New Zealand will lead.
" I dabei" a mulmiges feeling; , it says.
" It is not so far away from at home and still I a work dort."
Nevertheless: Its friend waits in Auckland already for him - " it had jerk, twitches its desire job as Eventmanagerin, perhaps a good Zeichen" , the young man says and smiles.
Because of bad perspectives at home already two from Tanners three brothers and sisters abroad looked for their luck.
Its sister Yvonne, a social female worker, is in Sydney, its brother Colin has now a place as an IT-advisor in London.
The boys go: As is the case for the Tanners it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish will probably leave, forecast the country in next time experts of the economic and social research institute ESRI in Dublin.
To 2015 they count even on 200.000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a violent loss.
If the prognoses prove to be true, it comes to an emigration wave comparably with that one, from which Ireland suffered in the eighties.
After a decade of the upswing, which brought large prosperity for the Irish with itself, now again Tristesse makes itself broad.
The economic crisis disconcerts thereby above all the young, well trained Irish, for whom it went so far only uphill.
Job loss and social descent seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was used, to money gave it in the abundance.
In the meantime however are three of ten women and men under thirty without work.
In that Irish Times gives it zuhauf reader letters of young emigrants, who complain: " Everything goes into Ireland the brook runter."
" There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - however who can, leaves and our country loses thereby a whole Generation."
" The latter makes then please the light aus."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish student union, sees a dark future drawing up, because the government operates only Augenwischerei and to the young people no more future prospects offers.
" They reduce the minimum wages, but they do not have a strategy, as new jobs are created sollen" , the 20-year old says.
She observes herself, like their fellow students from an unpaid practical course to the next hangeln.
Their largest concern, says it, is it, to have to emigrate in four years themselves.
" This thought is sad and deprimierend."
Men try to positively occupy such as Stephen McLarnon the topic.
McLarnon organizes " WorkingAbroadExpo" , a fair, which offers a Rundumservice about work abroad.
" For occupation beginners the work is abroad nevertheless a great chance, the first steps on the career leaders too machen" , the manager says.
On its web page photos surfers in Australia and Snowboarder point to Canada.
The message is clear: Abroad is no Galeerendienst works, but brings also freedom and fun.
How it feels to develop elsewhere something Seán O' knows; Donovan since a half year.
Because there was nothing more to do for the 29-jährigen engineer in Ireland, he works now with 15 Irish colleagues on the building in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they pull up a straight mode house.
In January it continues to go to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
Its homeland sees O' Donovan in the meantime only rarely, because it makes extra layers, in order to be able to at home pay the credit off for its house.
" The situation is already a little verrückt" , it says, when it steps after long time for the first time over the threshold of its house.
" I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, in which I so well never more bin."
He laughs something moves and goes through cooled down areas.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with maintained front gardens, in the entries parks large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister O' has; Donovan the house for before four years for 380,000 euros bought - 100 per cent credit-finances.
" Were crazy times, it gave simple money without many Fragen" , it says.
Does it have fear that it could go wrong with the credit?
O' Donovan considers one while, pours hot tea after and says: " I do not have children, whom I must through-feed and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can again anfangen."
The civil engineer does not like a lamenting, which he often hears at present.
" Nobody must be hungry - our situation is nevertheless by far not as dramatic as here in earlier times on the Insel" , it says.
" One while abroad works, that is not the worst, which can happen - perhaps we feel thereby only as Iren."
He laughs and tells then of his father, who went in the last large economic crisis to England.
" After seven years it was and the life again there continued in Ireland, completely einfach."
Cian Tanner pleases this thought.
The future leave open and simply times look, like it runs with the life elsewhere.
A few years it has work in London already behind itself and why shouldn't it run in New Zealand also well for it and its friend?
A thing is there however still, those it in these days concerned belonging to: the celebration to its 27. Birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He is afraid that it could degenerate into a life well-being party.
" Only not too many Emotionen" , it says and drinks a large sip of its beer.
" Life well-being, which sounds nevertheless beängstigend."
" We call it rather a leaving party, completely loosely, also a few friends, a few drink, a few Spielen."
The demokatrische routine
The democracy movement in Latin America becomes more strongly, as the support of private enterprises.
Crime is a larger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region the influence of Brazil is larger than that of the United States.
To these results came the Latinobarómetro inquiry, which was accomplished in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This inquiry is accomplished since 1995 regularly and points so the opinion change out in this region.
Two facts particularly fall in the inquiry of this year from September and October in' s eye.
First of all the good tendency in Latin America
and secondly the increasing interest in democracy and their most important institutions.
In numerous countries at the South American Pacific coast the democratic movement increased strongly (S. table 1).
In Peru, where the economy grows annually since 2002 by approx. 6%, the number of the democracy proponents of 40% e.g. rose in the year 2005 to 61% in this year.
Also in Mexico, where the economy recovers since the strong break-down in the last year again, such a trend is to be recognized.
But only half of the asked ones in Mexico and Brazil, which is most densely populated countries of the region, convinced democrats, what lowers the regional average (S. diagram 2).
Approx. 44% of the asked ones explained that it with the democratic practice of their country contently its. Those are as many as in the last year, however 25% more than in the year 2001 (diagram 3).
About 34% trust the congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of the latter yearly, show however a clear rise opposite 2003 (17% and/or 24%).
One decade ago of Latin America undermined economic crises the efforts around more democracy.
This also during the world economic crisis persisted, is possibly because of the fact that the countries of Latin America experienced only a short recession phase and fast again recovered.
Beyond that arms by a stronger social net were caught.
(Sound reports of the UN-economic commission for Latin America of this week rose 2009 the poverty rate in Latin America only slightly and is in this year 32% pleases.)
But from country to country there are strong tendency differences (S. diagram 4).
Of Brazil strong economy and the popularity of separating president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva reflects itself in a common progress thinking.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more strongly noticeable and increased force crime, this is less the case.
Only for the second time since beginning of inquiry many asked ones see a larger problem than in Latin America in the crime in their country unemployment (S. diagram 5).
Approx. 31% state that either they or a family member became in the last year victims of a crime. But opposite 38% in the last year sank the values and achieve thus the lowest conditions since 1995.
The rising economic performance reflects itself in the stronger support of the private and of the free-market economy: approx. 71% of the asked ones supraregional indicated that the private sector for the development is indispensable, in the year 2007 were it 56% (S. diagram 6).
Approx. 58% explained that only the free-market economy can bring progress to its country, compared to 47% in the last year.
Interestingly enough 62% of the asked ones maintained this opinion in Venezuela (and 80% are for a private sector), although its left president, nationalisation Hugo Chávez, many private business.
Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed from the United States (9%, according to 19% of the asked ones (18% in the last year) invariably since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% in the last year).
The asked ones in Mexico and most countries of Central America however see the most influential country in the USA, whereby this role is transferred to the Dominican republic and Nicaragua von Venezuela.
An electoral defeat
Nobody had expected that the elections would be perfect on 28 November in Haiti.
But the facts exceeded the fears of the Wahlhelfer, who hurried the shaken country to the assistance, by far.
Overfilled ballot boxes, several times delivered voices, Wahlscheine in the Rinnstein, destroyed polling stations and intimidations were only one part of the problems.
Polling stations opened with delay for hours.
Many Haitianer, of which many had become homeless by the earthquake in January, touched around in the search for an option.
Some gave up finally completely.
A dozen of presidential candidates, among them some presumed front runners, required the abolition of the election results due to an alleged fraud.
Generally speaking country came it too partial protests by force.
Designated nevertheless Edmond Mulet, the director/conductor of the UN-mission in Haiti, which " choice; as quite good in many Belangen."
According to a careful statement of observers of the organization OF American States and the Caribbean Community " if these irregularities make, so seriously they also to be like, the process not necessarily ungültig."
In other words, the show goes on.
The election commission, which allegedly obligated to the unpopular separating president René Préval and its candidate, Jew Célestin is, will announce the provisional results on 7 December.
The expected ballot is fixed for January.
There is still hope to the choice.
The two prominent opposition candidates, the RWS musician Michel Martelly and the former roofridge lady me country Manigat, withdrew their initial invalidity complaint.
If Jew Célestin, which meets only small one or no agreement with the voters, from which Wahlberhörde as the winner of the ballot explains, this could lead to problems.
Due to the Cholera epidemic and the fact that more still in tents live it was feared than 1 million of the earthquake victims, a small election turnout.
From the election day many Haitianer were prevented by organization lacking from the casting of votes.
Shortly before beginning of choice approx. 250,000 documents of identification, which are needed for the choice, were not yet expenditure-divided.
It stands much on the play.
The donor countries regard a legitimate, appreciative government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitianer is the same opinion.
Secretly into the center
In the weeks after the sudden death of your man of Argentina experienced president, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy, which drove its popularity rate upward around 20 points on over 50%. That is the highest value since its choice in the year 2007.
Whether you help this however in the next year to a re-election, depends on it, whether the obviously mourning Cristina Fernández is more ready to compromise than her deceased husband, its predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The indications of it are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, which directed the economic policy also after the choice of its wife, set up frequently budgets, those the tax revenues, which economic growth and the inflation did not consider fully.
This permitted it the pair of presidents to spend the extra incomes after own discretion.
On the paper the Fernández government lost the majority in the congress in the last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchners death after a cardiac infarct on 27 October led to further discords.
Some dissidents from the numbers of the governing Peronisten placed themselves behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (with those a parliamentarian another in the face struck and others the government of the bribery accused) it did not succeed to the congress to discharge the household for 2011.
" I am not diskutieren" over it; , so the president.
The household 2010 is valid now also for the next year, whereby the president has still more opportunity to spend money after own discretion.
The economy runs hot: probably it will grow in this year over up to 9%.
The official inflation rate is at present with 11,1%, but numerous private estimations - and wage demands of the trade unions - drive the value on nearly 30%.
Kirchner, which took over 2003 the office, when Argentina von Wirtschaftskrisen was vibrated, explained growth and fight against poverty as its principal purposes, and not the inflation lowering.
It refused co-operation with the IMF, chicaned the private sector and cleaned national Institut for statistics and census INDEC, which thereupon the official inflation statistics schönte.
Can Fernández hit a more moderate way now?
It called the private sector and the trade union leader6s to discussions.
And according to official statements wage increases are to be limited in the next year on 18%.
The high world market prices for of Argentina agricultural products gave a strong lift to the economy.
But the inflation undermined the growth spurt by a large Devaluation in the year 2002.
Possibly Cristina Fernández for this reason Argentina would like to attach financialeconomically the remainder of the world.
Beginning of this yearly met the government an agreement with security owners, who had rejected the earlier conversion of debts of the country in the year 2001.
Now Fernández seems on an agreement with the backers from of Paris the club to urge, which she owes approx. $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had usually, always rejected an examination by the IMF, as in another place.
But in the last month the minister of economics Amado Boudou announced that the funds with the production new national consumer price index " technical Unterstützung" will carry out. It looks in such a way, as if this would be the first step for the cleaning of the INDEC.
It is not well-known whether Fernández will be politically active after completion of their term of office also without the support by their husband.
If, it needs for it the support of the middle class, those to a large extent enough has from the Kirchnerismus.
If the Argentinier returns in March from its summer vacation, the wave of the Sympatie, which you were brought, will have died down.
If it liked to win a further choice, it must decide whether it waives many political decisions of its man quietly and quietly.
Weak applause for China
Taiwans voters approach slowly a closer connection to the mainland.
What holds Taiwan of its large brother beyond the strait?
On 27 November more than 7.5 millions voters, that made themselves are 70% of all voters, up, in order to select in the five urban districts mayors and town councillors. This is rated as broad evaluation of the president mA Ying jeou.
By the structure of innovative business relations, incl. a partial free trade agreement, mA is a symbolic figure for the relations with the mainland. Its politics changed the relationship to the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949 effectively.
MA has the examination existed, however only scarcely.
Although its Kuomintang party (KMT) places three of the five mayors, it did not receive majority of votes.
Instead the democratic progress party (DPP) received, which a larger independence Taiwans endorses, nearly 50% of the voices, the KMT received 45%.
With a presidential election this would have meant for mA problems.
Since its choice before two years the voice portion of its party is around approx. 8% pleases.
For the first time the DPP drew even together with the KMT into the town councillors.
During the choice it came to the occurrences usual in Taiwan such as truck convoys with Krawallmachern, flag-swivelling mass removals and only meagerly dressed dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious attempted murder.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT gave a speech on eve of the choice a KMT candidate,
as it a man from the quantity in the face lap. Lien was wounded and a standing around spectator was killed.
It is not clear more bizarre-wisely whether the contactors Lien wanted to kill or to settle a controversy with the candidate.
Independently of it the attack has according to Tsai Ing whom, which leaders of the DPP, which impair choice and which DPP into a bad light moved, which the KMT more voices gave.
Possibly China was the largest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably the relations with the mainland one did not bring up for discussion.
Instead the candidates plans to subsidized low-rent housings and the job creation debated.
The Taiwanesen loves its actual independence and rejects of China military threat.
For this reason the KMT does not place its relations with the government in Peking gladly into the foreground.
But this time also the DPP avoided to stir the anti-Chinese feelings up too much.
It reacted with it to new consciousness that Taiwans economics without China cannot survive.
MA for his part would like to be able to be confirmed that the majority of the Taiwanesen endorses its China politics.
The government in Peking will pursue further its strategy to back-lure Taiwan with economic incentives into the community.
China sent immediately a negotiator after Taipeh, in order to prepare a summit to investment security and medical co-operation.
Surely it wishes also a political integration. But the most important first.
It rather waits thereby until the presidential elections 2012.
The DPP again invented itself in the meantime.
Before two years it was strongly weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui bian sat because of corruption in the prison.
During its presidency from 2000 to 2008 it entered vehemently for absolute independence.
But under Tais regency developed a new generation of moderate politicians and the DPP fights for the voices of the working persons and the youth.
Tsai met large agreement as a presidency candidate of the DPP, like CSU Tseng chang under Chen.
Their party does now everything to construct in order to show that also it is able, close relations with Peking.
Tsai plans an idea ideenschmiede as edge contact between the DPP and China. This presupposes however impartial discussions.
Tsai explained publicly that its party one " trustworthy Alternative" offer to Mas of rash approach to China.
Chen seems very annoyed about this change.
Explained it, the candidates of the DPP by its cell from better would have done to insist on Taiwans independence.
He even requested the pragmatist CSU to do without the presidency candidacy.
Also without Chens interference does the DPP heavily, their possible candidates to select.
The KMT will have itself to submit of its own self analysis.
Mas of values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to lead their election campaign without him.
The principal reasons for its unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever further shears between arm and realm.
According to statement of a KMT speaker it will transform its cabinet as well as the local mechanisms.
The strong occurrence of the DPP lets assume that Taiwan endorses a reapproach only reduced.
Most Taiwanesen sees economic co-operation with China simultaneous as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, " there is already none back mehr."
Grammy nominating: The jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was distinguished surprisingly in the category newcomer of the yearly
If you on request of a president of appearance, become the people it to notice.
President Obama asked Esperanza Spalding to arise with the ceremony on the occasion of the Nobelpreisverleihung 2009. Now the 26-jährige jazz Bassistin and singer überrachsenderweise for the Grammy of this year in the category newcomers of the yearly was nominated.
In view of the fact that Spalding " since its album; Esperanza" 2008 in the jazz scene already a celebrated star are, appear nominating a little unusually.

The Secret Societ of the wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue probably received earned attention in the category large's group. It steps thus on against the Billy Childs Emsemble with its chamber jazz and the adventure-merry Dave Holland and its Oktett, whose Life Ablum " Pathways" a good example of a bassists as democratic Bandleader is.

Mosque in Temecula wins agreement of the planning committee
The building of a mosque in Temecula found after a five-hour, often heated public hearing the unanimous promise of the local planning committee.
Critics accused to the project to promote both the terrorism and Verkehrsstaus.
But according to a statement evening, the new religion center corresponds to the commission of Wednesday to the local regulations and an aesthetic eyecatcher will become.
" The project is anderen" one by many good people supported - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many; , Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic center of Temecula Valley explained on Thursday tomorrow.
" As an American makes stolz." me;
" It shows, justice herrscht."
" There are only few Gegner" , it still added.
" They are only very much laut."
" In this valley wonderful Menschen." lives;
The meeting began around 18:00 and the discussions for and against the building of the center lasted nearly to midnight, whereby the voices were rather evenly distributed on both sides according to press Enterprise.
The debate was continued to lead on the web page of the newspaper.
" There is no America mehr" , a comment read.
" It is another planet of the apes, and the freedom statue lies dead in the Sand."

Opponents can insert objection with the town councillor still against the project.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could elsewhere make new ways of life possible on earth or
The discovery of a strange type of bacteria, which can live among other things on arsenic, opens new possibilities for new ways of life on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on earth, it is in their opinion an indication for the fact that a life is possible as vitally necessary judged elements also without those so far.
" This organism has two Möglichkeiten."
" It needs phosphorus or Arsen." for growing either;
" That makes it somewhat completely special one, although it nearly a kind ' fremde' Way of life ist" , Paul C.W explained. Davies of the Arizona State University and CO author of the report, which appears to the magazine on Thursday in the online edition Science.
So far six main elements were vitally necessary regarded as - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But like the scientists, continue to grow Lake found the bacterium out in the California mono also still if it replaces phosphorus by arsenic.
" There one asks oneself nevertheless, what ist" otherwise still possible; , the CO author of the report Ariel D said. Anbar of the Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step with the search for extraterrestial life, since scientists must recognize lives and its forms, like that Anbar.
The study is concerned with microbes, which were found on earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details were announced to the discovery, gave too wide-spread speculations to cause in the Internet that the report could act of the discovery of extraterrestial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery " it shows that in other planet systems organisms can set biochemical processes with the help of other elements on and that the ' Standardelemente' , which are absolutely vitally necessary according to our opinion, not necessarily firmly given sind" , explained Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and space Sciences Research of institutes of the open university the kingdom united by Milton Keynes in.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
" This work is a new fact, because it shows that in fundamental biochemical processes and structures an element by another are replaced kann" , Cockell added.
This discovery was not coincidental.
Felisa wolf Simon of astro+biological Institut of NASA, which led the study, selected the mono Lake due to the high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus resemble themselves chemically, it assumed that microbes, which are exposed to both can replace possibly an element by the other one.
" The toxicity of the arsenic is based above all on the fact that it behaves chemically similarly as Phosphor."
" Thus it falls the organisms heavily, an element from the other one to unterscheiden."
" But the difference is so large that arsenic works differently than phosphorus. It arrives into our biochemical system, where it verschmiert" quasi everything; , Anbar explains.
The researchers exposed the bacterium to GFAJ-1 of a rising arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
The microbe grows in phosphorus better, but that it can survive also in arsenic, it points that a arsenic-based way of life can naturally occur, either on earth or to another planet or moon, on the arsenic more frequently occurs.
According to Jamie S. Foster, Dozentin for microbiology at the University OF Florida, is not new the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic. But so far there was still no functioning example.
Arsenic occurred in the early earth years more frequently, says it, therefore the science assumed early ways of life used it.
" That gives reason to the acceptance that life can have developed also differently than in the early Erdzeitalter" , so Forster, which was not member in wolf Simons research team.
The research work became from NASA, which energy Ministry and the national health authorities support.
Remaining stolen exhibition dogs in Compton found
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs, which were stolen before a Bell flow he motel, were found according to statement of the Los Angeles County sheriff of Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on the Tuesday, when stole unknown quantity from the 2006 Chevrolet express Van, in which the animals before a Bellflower motel 6 were accommodated at night, so the authority statements.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and last both on Wednesday the evening, explain Steve Whitmore, a speaker of the Los Angeles County Sheriff' s department.
" The good message is: the dogs are wohlauf" , so Whitmore.
" They are in good Zustand."
" They were zurückgegeben." to their legal owners;
Whitmore still did not give exact data the discovery site of the dogs the circumstances, which led to their discovery.
" The investigations run noch."
" We would not like in addition no more sagen" , Whitmore explains.
" We pursue some Spuren."
The owners of dog, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were available on Thursday for information not.
They took their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon in a district animal home in Downey in receipt.
Representatives of the sheriff found the delivery vans and to both dogs at different places in Compton.
The Akitas - trace, a 3-jähriger coarse one, and Didi, a 10 months old dog - was uninjured according to authority statement.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, which wanted to present Rickard and Peek this week on behalf its Japanese owners on the competition, remained missed until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, which live in talking thing, were on this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba national Championship in Long Beach in the city, because trace should participate in the competition.
As Peek of the Times communicated on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show in other competitions.
South California is a stop on the route nearly of one month of the pair of dog-looks too dog-looks.
On Monday evening checkten themselves Peek and Rickard in the motel.
They stay overnight frequently in motels and park their delivery van before their room window.
They took three further dogs - a Boxerwelpen, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - also into their motel room.
The dickfelligen Akitas and Corgis remained in the delivery van, because it was cool there.
They left the window open a gap broadly, so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard announced their cars on Tuesday around 6:00 clock as stolen.
Peek promised everyone, which could give a reference to the Corgis, a Finderlohn. The animals microchip for identification were implantiert.
On Thursday it was not certain whether a Finderlohn is paid.
The lion roars again after judicial permission of the MGM restructuring
After 18-monatigen turbulences and uncertainties received MGM now finally green light for a new beginning.
A new Yorker magistrate in bankruptcy blessed on Thursday offiziel " vorbereiten" Gläuberplan off to erase and for the 86-jährigen maintenance enterprise the way smooth around the debts at a value of $5 billion for new films and TV shows.
In accordance with the statements of Thursday the plan fulfills the requirements of the US law of bankruptcy, so that the restart of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger pear tree, which entertainment, nothing more stands to founders of Spyglass in the way. Barber and pear tree will that somewhat abgespeckten studio as managing directors to manage.
The number of employees is lowered of over 400 on approx. 320.
For MGM Chapter 11 comes into force actually only if JPMorgan Chase locked a planned loan from $500 millions to the financing of new MGM productions.
For the moment a consortium of the investment bank, which brings in even $75 millions, leads the enterprise. The financing is to stand to in the middle of December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order to the investment bank Moelis & CO, the management, which fought with interest payments at a value of $300 millions/year to help with the solution of their financial problems.
In August the managing director Harry Sloan was replaced to a former CEO by Stephen Cooper, with Enron and restructuring expert, who admits by its activity with Krispy Kreme Doughnuts became.
The efforts of Moelis & Cooper to solve and more than 140 Gläuber of the studio out-pay the financial concerns MGMs, lasted longer than expected.
After months-long discussions the parties decided at the end of of 2009 to offer the enterprise for the purchase.
But the auction tightened only few bidders and none wanted the $2 billion demanded by the creditors to pay.
In the spring everything began this yearly from the front, when the MGM team began with the restructuring plan, which was finally signed after months-long debates and internal disputes at the end of of Octobers by the creditors.
If MGM got over the bankruptcy in the next weeks officially, Moelis and Cooper for their work receive a bonus at a value of to several millions dollar.
The portion for Moelis & CO., which received already $1.2 millions, amounts to $9,5 millions
Cooper, to which for the line of the enterprise monthly $375,000 one paid, keep one " Erfolgsbonus" of $4 millions
Barber and pear tree plan to take up production with MGM again. In this year the studio brought out only one film and provided a yearly plan with seven or eight films, at the beginning of of 2012 into the cinemas to come is.
Furthermore they plan two films according to " The small Hobbit" in CO production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs for it a separate loan between $265 millions to $275 millions for its financial portion of these two films, which are to develop under the direction of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed approx. 18% of the MGM loan, tried a fusion of the studio with Lions gate entertainment, whose largest shareholder is he.
But the last negotiations between the two enterprises led to no result.
Tech Toys holds your gift budget in the equilibrium
The favorite of this year under the gifts is possibly followed iPad, of Microsoft a Kinect video console. Both Spielereien can tear a considerable hole into your gift budget.
iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect play about 10 corresponds to classical jumping hurrying or approx. 48 doses Play Doh.
But you can preserve your gift budget.
Recently I visited in the search for three electronics toys among $80 three national Spielzeughändler - a whale Mart, a Toys " R" US and a BJ' s Wholesale club.
Me it became immediately clear that moorland law had stepped into force. This year are more efficient the technology toys and cost at the same time somewhat less than in the last year.
And although less new toys with own web page appear, Penguin, a variety is on the most well-known this kind, Webkinz and club.
Ever more button-cell-claimant toys come on the market, and many contain loadable Akkus.
Here some recommendations.
(Case differently indicated, all prices of Toys are not " R" US.)
sing A mA jigs (Mattel, $13, for children starting from 3 years) Plüschfiguren, large as guinea pigs, are as which sing a note, if one presses on its belly.
Once corresponds to a note, by repeated pressing can one presses a song play.
Several sing A mA jigs sing in harmony.

Police employments in China become gentler
Like a training officer seaweed Shenbin walked across an urban place, examined his nervous subordinates and gave thereby with military Authorität and absorbed voice of instructions.
It wanted that its female members of the Chengguan - of China robust guards of the urban order, feared and despised for its arbitrary raids and its tendency to the force - which spectators impress.
" Straight ones stand! "
" View straightforward! "
" Shows ihnen" , it whispered to them too, " how pretty girls like that are! "
Four girls, hardly the tea rodent age entwachsen, with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and trousers stood stramm.
Four pair black pumps were located in straight lines row.
Four tidy hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white touched loops.
" For me they see on the average aus" , Mr. Tang notices geringschätzig.
" Models are hübsch."
Several governments already tried to up-polish the image of of China city inspectors.
In a city all new applicants must have a university conclusion.
The province Guangdong introduced instead of the grey-green bright blue uniform.
Wuhan in central China replaced force by Niederstarren: 2009 circled according to reports 50 officials a duly not set up lunch car and stared the operator on, until this packed up after a half hour and left the place.
Xindu, an urban district in Chengdu with 680.000 inhabitants, would like to change the image fundamentally.
Since 2003 13 women strengthen the urban police patrols. They were selected special due to their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They are to lend a softer, feminine aspect to the grobschlächtigen police.
But also Scarlett Johansson would unfortunately succeed hardly, the bad picture, which the Chinese of these city commands have to improve.
With good reason, so the critics.
Differently than the police these officials may implement the urban laws only assistance of penalties or other administrative punishments.
But the Chinese media show by routine another picture.
In January 2008 officials in the province Hubei flogged a spectator to death, when this filmed her with its mobile phone thereby how they struck down a protest action against a dumping ground.
In the last year a training course manual of the Pekinger officials was stolen and published in the Internet. One describes how offenders without bloodshed can be lambasted.
In this year a Shanghaier suffered water melon dealers after a hand mixture with five an official brain injuries.
A video game strotzendes before force that from the Internet can be downloaded, shows trained officials in China with an attack on street traders.
" Chengguan makes Angst" for the government; , the national newspaper China Daily lamentierte in the last year, after further controversies concerning tactics.
The newspaper required one " really thorough Säuberung."
Sceptics find the current beginning for clearly insufficient.
When the Distrik looked for eight female recruits in October by announcement, a Editorial asked the question into Beijing Evening news whether the Mrs. genuine tasks had been supposed to serve or only as optical diverson.
Probably both.
According to job advertisement women at the age were " from 18 to 22 with good figure and; harmonious Gesichtszügen" searched.
They should be above average large - over 1,5m or 5 foot, 2 1/2 tariff.
Conditions of employment end with the reaching 26. Year of life.
According to the officials is the activity for women over 25 physically too exerting.
" The most important is their Image" , a unnamed district official indicated Rednet.com to government web page for that quasi.
" Whether the candidates get the job, depends first on their outside feature, like size of, weight, features, usw."
Then come temper and " internal Qualitäten."
" Female Chengguan is like Blumenvasen" , it said and added, " but beyond that they have still different Pflichten."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director/conductor of the city administration of the district, would like this description not obligations,
it admitted however that in China size defaults are not uncommon in job advertisements for both kinds of sex.
The same is valid for even features.
Whether with good appearance is to be equated, is disputed in China.
But humans with handicaps or physical distortions do not need to apply.
" We know here unfortunately no lame ones or Buckligen gebrauchen" , so Mr. Zheng.
" Their image would not be gut."
Liu Yi, which patroliert at the Baoguang place close of a monastery, is 22, has Apfelbäckchen and a probably formed mouth.
It empfindetes not as sexistisch that so large value on their appearance one puts.
" Do you, I find look in this uniform sexy? " she asks with ironical view.
Their colleague with the Grübchen, which 21-jährige Xu Yang commentates, " We repräsentieren." the task, the image of the city too;
According to their data they do not regret the short attitude, since they would have more ambitious career plans, as simply only dealers by the lanes to scheuchen, in order to prevent it from the business making.
Each morning is concerned the patrol with approx. twelve street traders, who try, to sell to foot or on the bicycle as much as possible rolls and Tofugerichte before they are away-hunted.
" Mr. Wang, you disappear here bitte."
" We already so often said that to you! " explains Ms Xu to a dealer, who had fled to foot and its fastened on a bicycle cart noodle kitchen in the pass had left temporary.
According to the woman officials is rather monotonous the activity as arduous.
" It is dasselbe" nearly each day; , Huang Jing, explains 20, in the spare time the sales natures studied.
" All Routine."
A reason for it is that the female officials the goods of the dealers may not konfiszieren, like their male colleagues.
They can threaten offenders only to announce it to their male superiors.
That is to protect it against public meeting with hostility, officials are frequently exposed to which in China.
In this year hundreds inhabitant of Kunming, the capital of the province Yunnan, after the rumor circulated, randalierte Chengguan officials a dealer would have killed.
More than one dozen of policemen and Chenguan officials were injured with the night incident, 14 government vehicles were upset or been into fire.
Xindu remained so far spared by such force excesses.
But unrests are not to be excluded.
Only two of block far away from the calm Baonguang place, at which the female officials patroulierten on this morning, met over 50 persons at a street corner.
Officials had konfisziert a motorcycle, which was repaired against the regulations on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop.
The owner cried Zeter and Mordio.
After 15-minütigem the officials with grimmigem face the way to their vehicles cleared and continued a hesitating with the motorcycle and its owner.
Left Xuedong, 40, a co-ordinator of the male patrol, stayed. It turned its white name plate, in order to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues the co-ordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supporting role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
" Sometimes we go verbal vor."
" Sometimes in addition, körperlich" , Mr. Li explains soberly.
" The people with the controversy catch most time an."
Public prosecutor will not accuse senator Ensign
State lawyers of the Ministry of Justice acquitted senator John Ensign of the accusations, those after its affair with a former choice aid and its attempt to provide for their husband a lobby activity against him were raised, publication the lawyers of the senator on Wednesday.
This decision terminates the heaviest right reproach against senator Ensign, the republican from Nevada. Up to the scandal, which provided country-wide for headlines and its career shifted an absorber, it was considered as possible presidential candidate of the republicans for 2012.
As senator announced Ensigns office, it was " over the judgement after the one year's investigation; highly erfreut."
The ethics committee of the senate could impose however still another Disziplarstrafe.
According to statement of Ensigns lawyers they were informed by the Ministry of Justice about the fact that the investigations were stopped against senator Ensign and that in this affair no further accusations to be present.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to express itself to the case.
The judgement was for many ethics lawyers outside of the Ministry of Justice a surprise. According to their opinion there were sufficient proofs for the fact that Ensign ignored the Lobbying prohibition.
Interviews, emails and other documents, which were openly put for the first time in October 2009 in New York Times, gave cause to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, its Wahlhelfer, help one to lucrative orders, in order to buy its silence over an affair with Hamptons wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was active during an election campaign Ensigns as Schatzmeisterin.
Ensign took up contact to some political friends, in order to provide Hampton work. According to the documents and Verhören he took over Hamptons lobbying as soon as the adjustment has been completed for her.
Since Hampton was recently still in Ensigns choice team, was it was allowed he one year long no lobbying for its former employer or the entire senate to take over.
According to statement of ethics experts the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, which were closely friendly before the affair, offended against the prohibition so called of the Drehtür Lobbykratie.
In accordance with the published indications " it concerns to all appearances around an arrangement and the offence against the Drehtür Statuten" , so Stanley fire, Washington a lawyer, who specialized in the defense of clients, in the visor of the government.
While the Ministry of Justice rejected it officially, admits the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case to give, Mr said. Very carefully the accusation seems to let fire and other ethics lawyers, the Ministry fall against the former senator Ted of Stevens because of failure on the part of the public prosecutor in taking up political accusations after a multiplicity of defeats, which were pursued by the media with large interest, including the decision last year.
State lawyers " are obviously schreckhaft" , said Melanie Sloan, which " chairmen of the combination; Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization, a whose goal is the fight against corruption in parliament and government circles of the USA), a group of attorneys, the different accusations against Mr. Ensign before court brought.
" That means in principle the fact that high-standing government officials can assume now the laws for it does not gelten" , it added.
Paul Coggins, Hauptverteidiger von Mr. Ensign, said in an interview, he had received a telephone call of a state lawyer on Monday and a further on the next day, in which it was communicated to him that the Ministry will not raise complaints against its client.
Mr. Ensigns defenders had cooperated with the state lawyers, in order to convince it of the fact that the senator, as its office in an explanation repeated again on Wednesday " in agreement with the law gehandelt" has.
Mr. Coggins rejected it, the legal arguments, which he had stated opposite the state lawyers to explain more exactly.
" Me not probably is about to go into the discussion details between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only as much is said: We believe, the correct decision meet too haben" , it said.
Last month the federal electoral committee decided to stop the investigations because of a separate complaint by the group of ethics after the one payment of $96,000 of Mr. Ensigns parents to the Hamptons offended against the Federal electoral law.
The electoral committee said, it had not given enough proofs that the money was something else as a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, which supported long time the senator, was one of the companies, in those Mr. Hampton owing to the assistance of Mr. Ensign Lobbyisten work found.
An email from December 2008 proves that, after the company Mr. Hampton as lobbyist helped, Mr. Ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, a conversation with Mr. Hampton had, in which he communicated to him that he " at the ministry of the Interior because of a thing; anklopfe."
Mr. In addition Ensign was with Mr. The transport minister, a meeting in the name of the airline arranges and asked Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant air, to the lunch to agree upon, after this Mr. Hampton for lobbying had adjusted.
When last year for the first time information about this affair penetrated to the public, apologize Mr. Ensign with its voters and gave its position up in the senate, where he had confessed in the order of rank of the republicans in fourth place.
After it had been noticeable many months no longer, Mr told. Ensign two weeks ago ago reporters, which it a third term of office in the senate aim at.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign any longer longer the goal of police investigations its, did not explain its press spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, the senator hopes that the ethics commission follows very fast the example of the Ministry of Justice and stops its investigations.
" Senator Ensign looks forward to it, its hard work in the service of humans in Nevada fortzusetzen" , it said.
Cheshire appointment makes attentive on Twitter
A half dozen of them typed themselves in the riots in the court room away.
In the minutes pulse they sent their reports away over Twitter over grausige testimonies.
At the end, so the defense, gave it more to than 140,000 Twitter messages over the process around rape and at beds chained children in a house, which went up in flames.
On Thursday the attentively pursued process of Steven J. Hayes, who were accused, three members a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, to have killed an official end to find, if the court decision falls over the death sentence, which expressed the jury.
But Mr. Hayes of lawyers already submitted requests with court, which will employ reasons for an appointment to state and those the courts on years.
One of the most provoking reasons is that it " by the intensive reporting over the process - also by the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - to one; Zirkusatmosphäre" and a so wide-spread, immediate penetration of aufrührerischer details came, so that the jury was affected excessively by public indignation.
This objection could arrange the Appelationsgerichte to concern itself with the question whether the new technologies new rules in the court room become necessary to let.
" As I experienced it during this process, believe I that it is really a danger, if the introduction of the new technologies beeinflusst" into the court room the right of each particular to a fair process; , Thomas's J. Ullman, Mr said. Hayes leading defence counsel.
The chairman Richter, Jon C. Blue of the highest Court of Appeal, rejected past week the requests by decision briefly and concisely, when he said that the new media " carefully kontrolliert" it would become and that there would be no proof for it that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was with security not yet the last word in this thing.
For decades court objections stated that the reporting lets arise over famous-notorious cases doubts to the Fairness of a process.
In its historical decision of 1966 the highest Court of Justice of the United States waived and said the judgement against Dr. Sam Sheppard, east eop Athens from smart country, which is to have killed its wife, in its decision that it " because of the new media one; Karnevalsatmosphäre in the Gerichtssaal" would have given.
Some one believes that the TV serial and the feature " On the Flucht" on this crime is based.
Some attorneys say, court objections, which Mr. Hayes condemnation a half century later regard, could the argument follow that new rules became necessary, in order the communication ways from the court room, which at present the case Dr. Sheppard were still inconceivable, to regulate.
" There is a good reason, concerned about the influence of the new media during processes, which are pursued by a broad public, too sein" , said John J. Donohue III, professor to the Stanford Law School, which examined the death penalty in Connecticut. According to its report it is arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said, some Appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of immediate communication from the court room could make the processes fairer.
The Twitter affair is only one of many, those the attorneys of Mr. Hayes state, in order to discuss and thus a condemnation out-hesitate on years.
The defenders state for example also that Mr. Hayes to have been already before-condemned could, when judge had not permitted them Blue to test the reactions of potential Juroren by showing them during the Jurorenauswahl grausige scene photos.
Some the Juroren, photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke Petit, 48 years, and its Tüchter, Hayley, said 17 years and Michaela, 11 years, would have fulfilled them with abhorrence.
The defenders say, them also the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution in question would place, and to argue that the judge falsely exchanged a Juror, who was a critic of the public prosecutor's office, and that he would have expenditure-practiced inadmissible way pressure on the judgement, when he had made the uncommon decision to place the jury over the weekend freely.
The Juroren were not insulating.
Perhaps but the largest interest draws its arguments over the influence of the detailed reporting over the process on itself.
In a contest of judgement, which they submitted past month, they stated that the case had dominated the message in Connecticut and during election campaign for the office of the governor and for the American senate by the candidates was discussed.
They argued that the new media would again have kindled continuously the flames of the emotions over the case.
" Such a daily crush of the medium bleepers, cameras and reporters outside of the Gerichtssaals" , the attorneys wrote, " one did not erlebt." before still in new Haven and perhaps even country-wide yet;
Their emphasis on the reporting by Twitter is controversial.
In interviews some journalists said that the statement, this direct messages were aufwieglerischer as reports, which are more slowly refunded a technology-hostile view were, which becomes impoverished the reporting over future processes.
But some attorneys said, Appelationsgerichte with the argument were confronted, social and technical changes would often require the adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayers of attorneys strengthen this statement.
In their objection they referred to the decision highest Court of Justice of 1966, in that the condemnation by Dr. Sheppard due to the reporting waived themselves and made clear that the new media require new rules.
" This Fall" , then they wrote, " represents Sheppard against Maxwell 21. Jahrhunderts."
Can politeness connect the separation?
After a campaign at insult words and Negativität this week broke little politeness off in Washington.
Is it omen of a genuine two-party co-operation or one moment of the illusion, before one returns fast again to the fight of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between president Obama and points of the congress did not bring a break-through in the large questions, with which one " oneself during the so-called; lame duck session" , the meeting at the end of one government period, in which no more decisions are made, to employ had.
After all what one hears, it was to be governed neither a polite discussion between two different sides still another attention of their divided responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a party point collecting.
The public meeting of the deficit commission of the president on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences, which exist between the members further.
It seems to be clearly that a close interaction lets a mutual respect develop during one period of months, that the ideological gap, which separates further the members, masked.
That is hardly enough, in order to state, it is started a new era of co-operation.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in that the one of the other indication of the cooperative and compromise readiness calls in, while one tries to weigh the borders of the public opinion and the patience of the voters after renewed party warfare.
Therefore the meeting limited on Tuesday and its estimate were by the participants to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the republicans are too large and too deep, that one could expect a fast change of the atmosphere, which predominated in the past two years.
All the same whether it concerns taxes, donations, health or claims, which are both sides kilometres away from each other far away.
To good the latter the November choice Washington was correct at least for short time mild.
" No question, which intonation has itself geändert" , said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, which now for " Ethics and Public Policy Center" works.
" That is inevitable after elections.
Elections arouse party passions, which die again.
And that is well so."
In some questions, particularly in those, which " on the agenda; lame duck session" stand, republicans and democrats hardly another choice, than a solution too finden."
Bush's reductions of taxes end of the yearly ends, and nobody endorses that.
Both sides want to find a way, over some or all too receive, are it now passing or permanent.
Likewise a compromise is to be expected concerning the increased unemployment pay, even if only, because the republicans it cannot afford that one believes, the favored reductions of taxes for realms, while they refuse unemployed person workers a support.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the white house the optimism rose that one " oneself in these questions during; lame duck session" to unite and at the same time also the new START contract to ratify can.
But William glass clay/tone of the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful co-operation in urgent questions the lame duck session" not compellingly to a permanent co-operation of the parties to lead must, if new 112. Congress is called up in January.
Instead, then he says, is a phase of the Nichtübereinstimmens more probably perhaps even inevitable.
" After the things, which must be done, are done, this short term psychology in confrontation is umschlagen" , it said.
Wehner is also sceptical - and this skepticism is divided by many - which leads politeness to true co-operation.
" I see much that happens from today on until 2012, as Vorkampf, or shade boxes, for the main event of 2012" , it said.
The reasons for this have to do much with the presentation of the new republican majority in the white house and with the tea party voters, who were helpful to their education.
How it procures the republican leaders over the fact also be may to keep that it too highly pokern, it to know that they must try, their promises, to lower the expenditures of the government and to set the health reform repealed.
These party lines become already clear in the first reactions concerning the recommendations of the deficit commission, which a tax revision and the raising of some taxes as well as the rise of the pensionable age and lowering the public expenditures contain.
The deputy chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles transferred one of the most difficult jobs to Washington and to have to set pushed in accordance with their own estimate, so much on it, the deficit question on the public agenda that these no more cannot be ignored.
But they need within the commission 14 of the 18 voices, in order to make their plan regarding official recommendation and them fight much, in order to come also only into the proximity of this number.
The largest resistance is in the selected representatives of the committee, since in financial questions, at least today, only little clearance or little sympathy for compromises is.
Galston forecasts two phases in the fight between the white house and the republicans in the congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party collisions, if the republicans Obama regarding the national budget, which provokes taxes and the health system, later then followed of a phase of larger two-party co-operation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partyness of the current choice, which wishes itself majority of the Americans still that the two parties work together.
If confrontation leads into a dead end, how it happened 1995, then both parties must pay attention carefully to the public reaction.
Whoever is condemned to losing, the course will change and the compromise to look for will have.
That may be indeed an optimistic aspect.
Partyness and polarization are today larger than in the center of the 1990er years, and they seem to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and the congress republicans than at that time between president Bill Clinton and the republicans.
The activists of both parties sees 2010 simultaneous as pure plays for a choice by far more extensive at consequence 2012.
So seen the politeness, which is carried this week to the exhibition, may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will require more trouble very much on both sides to find a common denominator in the questions which separate the two still.
Oozed US document porträtiert Moscow as port of the corruption
Control of the city lies in the hands " Kleptokratie" and it passes a part on of the bribes and the protection money, which in-collect it, to the Kremlin. Thus the American message in Russia in a note reported in February.
Both police and the public security service extort high protection funds, so that they can hold their expensive standard of living in Moscow, then are called it.
They do not only collect money from legitimized business, but also of organized criminal gangs.
Each layer of the bureaucracy - which " prime minister Vladimir Putin as; The vertical Autorität" designated - takes itself his part of the money, which the ladder walks upward.
The note, which was sent under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle to Washington, was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on its homepage.
The note is based on sources, whose name was drawn up.
It was written, while Yuri Luzhkov still Moscow mayor was, and it accuses him of of the corruption.
It was fired in October von Präsident Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly a proof for the fact that one would have in the meantime cleared up.
Luzhkov and its wife, Yelena Baturina, which possesses a well-known building firm, rejected corruption reproaches again and again over years, and it won numerous libel actions against such accusations.
In September he explained those to a Russian television station, when he was asked for a documentation, suggested, he was corrupt: " It is moved, it is dirty, it is schmutzig."
> It believes an unbelievably large number at Russians that their society is corrupt. Inquiries resulted in that.
But it is unusual the fact that, as in the report of the Ambassador happens individual persons are called, and it is unheard that this is done via a diplomat of a foreign country.
" The direct connection of the government of Moscow with the crime led to the fact that some " it as; gestört" it designates and at the conclusion comes that the government acts rather like a Kleptokrat as a Regierung" , so the note.
" Criminal elements enjoy one " kryshna" (a term from the world of the criminal ones/the mafia, which " word by word; Dach" or protection means itself), that over the police, the public security (FSB), which service supervisory authority (MVD) extends and the office of the public prosecutor likewise as by the entire Muscovites government bureaucracy.
Specialists discovered a three-fold structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
" Luzhkov stands to highest Stelle."
" FSB, MVD and the militia stand on the second Stufe."
" The common criminal ones and the criminal inspectors follow last after the lowest Stufe."
" This is an incompetent system, in which criminal groups within some ranges close a gap, because the city any assistance does not anbietet."
The report continues to say that the FSB money of the largest companies taken the money and that arrests the police small businessmen.
A source, then is called is " explained that Moscow business owner understand that it to best is, who protection from the MVD and FSB to get (and not of the organized crime), since it more weapons, resources and power do not only have than the criminal ones, but also because it by the law protected werden."
" For this reason the protection through criminal of course is no longer in demand as as früher."
The note notices that, while collecting of the funds is comprehensive the protection does not grant much its; even those, which pay, are sometimes arrested.
Those, which do not pay, appear their business very fast closed pre due to or other pretext.
Medvedev spoke several times to fight the corruption however at the same time marked that he made only few progress.
The note of the message contains of descriptions of men, who go also with suit-cases, which were probably full with money, into the Kremlin.
" In its fight against the corruption Medvedev must itself on the bureaucrats verlassen" , Georgy Satarov, director said of as, Muscovites an expert commission, recently in an interview.
" But it is part of these Bürokratie."
" It is not a part of the political class, because a political class in Russia no more does not existiert."
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of the Gewalten, then he says, is corruption inevitably.
Country-wide, then estimates as, costs the corruption Russia more than $ 300 billion per year.
The country ranks at place 154 of a newer investigation for the global perception of the corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparence international (countries of are " to few korrupt" too " at most korrupt" specified).
The exposure of the note of the American message, which after Muscovite time happened latein the evening, will cause displeasure with security within the Russian government, although, since Luzhkov for the errors of Moscow can be accused of, it for the Kremlin also a possibility be can state that one solves the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN stated Putin the fact that the WikiLeaks documents a falsification could be and reacted furiously to the exposure that American diplomats called it Batman and Medvedev Robin.
" The truth is that it concerns our interaction, which an important factor of the home policy in this country ist" , it said.
" But to be over honest, we would not have expected that this would happen with such an arrogance, with such a pressure and in so unethische way, know Sie."
Khmer Rouge veterans in a forced manner to the confrontation with the past
In a weakly lit up, concreted classroom with dirty and peeling walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds of the man, who built him, at the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
" Everyone loves Ta Mok." here;
" He was a good leader and he around his people gekümmert" himself; , Sreng Kor mA said, 42 years.
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule admits as " the Schlachter" , the commander remains popular in these remote former Khmer Rouge center in the northwest Kambodschas, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers to still live.
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge in relation to the government, supporters of many years in Anlong Veng are provoked.
In April local truth and reconciliation forum permitted the public confrontation with humans, who supported once the regime to the victims.
In June the government distributed a school book, which tells for the first time the history of the Khmer Rouge to children of former soldiers.
And in July a community tribunal of the UN and Kambodschas condemned a former member of the Khmer Rouge, when it admits the former boss of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better than Duch, to 35 years prison for the first time condemned.
With each of these developments the fear grew under the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, made its efforts more difficult around reconciliation and Reintegration into the society Kambodschas.
" There is still refusal and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they tun" no power, something too; , Chhang Youk, director/conductor of the documentation centre said an independent organization, which investigates the regime of Kambodschas.
" For it the life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime is geworden." to a symbol of the bad one;
" It splits even Familien."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Kambodscha, between 1975 and 1979, were executed roughly 1.7 million humans or it died at diseases, revision or before hunger.
When the Vietnameses broke in and fell 1979 the pole Pot Ied government, the leftovers of the regime and its military fled to the border Kambodschas to Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary the Guerillakrieg of their basis in the west of the mountains and jungles of Kambodscha led, consulted Ta Mok the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But years, when 1993 to the first democratic elections of the country led a peace agreement promoted by the UN, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began in the middle of the 1990er to overflow for government which led to the surrenders of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu SAM fan 1998.
Pol Pot died 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, which had not given way, was arrested 1999 by government forces with the Dangrek Mountains.
It died 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh, where it waited for its process.
When its sponsors did not protect it any longer longer, most former Khmer Rouge fighter fled into the zermürbende poverty of the rural Kambodschas and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even if some few elitist official ones the Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts, because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers.
" These humans profitiert" only very few from the surrender; , Sok Leang said of the center for justice and reconciliation, which holds public forums in completely Kambodscha, also in Anlong Veng,
" They are embodied into the utopian agrarian ideology of the Regimes."
" They grew without any occupation knowledge auf."
Sor Lim, 55 years, which had followed 1974 as teenager of the Rhmer Rouge, Veng fought, before it to 1998 established itself in the jungle over concerns, in order a life as a poor rice farmer to lead.
" The life under the Khmer Rouge was gut" , it said.
" Ta Mok gegeben." each something to eat;
" But the life is heavy now, because we worry about us müssen."
The current Khmer Rouge tribunal evoked concerns also here.
Beginning of next yearly will try court, Nuon Chea, Khieu SAM-chamfers, Ieng Sary and its wife as well as Ieng the Thirith, another earlier Khmer Rouge Minister to place before court.
The order of the court is it to condemn the old leaders and those, that are mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
That contributed a little to moderate the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current medium speculations concentrated on in the Chaem, 64 years, which had been during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970's district boss in the province Manteay Meanchey.
2007 had it assigned the documentation centre told by Kambodscha, she had led the building of the Trapeang Thma of dam, a project, with which thousands of forced laborers probably died.
In a hot evening returned in the Chaem of the work on the fields to its timber building at a dirty road outside from Anlong Veng.
As the sun rejected in the Chaem it threw long shade on the grass dried up to discuss over their past with the Khmer Rouge.
If the court should cite it, then it would go refusing, said themselves it.
" Kambodscha lives in peace and in Stabilität" , it said.
" There would be no more pursuits, would be here Krieg."
Prime minister Hun Sen, who fled 1878 of the Khmer Rouge, in addition has repetitive before it warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court more suspect would accuse, although experts and historians discuss this.
" Kambodscha must dig a hole and the past begraben" , it said.
But the confrontation with the past is what must do Kambodscha, in order to be able to go forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation centre.
" Reconciliation with the Khmer times means a gathering of the broken Stücke" , it said.
" It is our obligation to set these broken parts together so that like everything understand können."
The center created first of the government approved school book over the Khmer Rouge, which " 75seitige; History of the democratic Kambodscha."
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as appendix to the stories book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four sides over the Khmer Rouge.
How often in Kambodscha the young people in Anlong Veng know only little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the connections of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years, a student to the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps the student to understand an important part of their history.
But its parents reacted sceptically, when it brought the book with home, in order to read it.
" My family leans many parts of the book and the court ab" , it said.
" They are distrustful, because they are not safe, as werden." many humans condemned by the court;
Such a resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicates, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court attain gradually Einfluss" , it said.
Still the Khmer Rouge possesses a powerful attraction here.
Above in the Dangrek mountains by bushes more überwucherter and with plastic garbage verdreckter way to a rectangle leads by black soot, covered with a rusty sheet metal roof.
Pol Pot's body after his death 1998 on a heap of tire one had burned here.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years, a Handyverkäuferin at the roadside, said, she did not know much about the man, who had been burned here.
" But it beten" here a strong spirit and many humans to go to it over too; , it said.
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday later and on the day wanted it to Pol Pot's last Ruhestätte to go, where it becomes shrubs of ripe bananas placing - in hope that it brings its luck.
Belarus agrees to accumulate not far uranium capable of bearing arms
In a surprising victory for president Obamas campaign for the world-wide protection of nuclear material announced the government of Belarus on Wednesday that one will not collect any longer longer highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
That deal was announced to the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Byelorussian minister of foreign affairs Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the safety summit in a common statement after a meeting.
The US Government had for many years tried to convince Belarus to collect highly uranium any longer not enriched and seemed last spring a hurdle to have achieved.
But official ones of the US Government told Washington Post that in the past two months two secret treaties were met with Belarus, in order to remove for 187 Pound uranium capable of bearing arms from a Byelorussian research institute.
The prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the remainder of the material - according to an official coworker, who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, approximately 500 Pound.
The agreement seems one of the most important results of Obamas " Nuclear safety summit of the 47 Nationen" from April to be, the Belarus had excluded.
And it was obviously well enough, in order to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit 2012.
" I was really enthusiastic by the fact that she wollen." a seat in the nuclear safety summit (of 2012);
" That proves to me that it funktioniert" , Ken Luongo, president of the partnership of global security said, a group to the promotion of nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement " a very much meaning, important Schritt" of Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure within four years all precarious nuclear material.
Since then the US Government helped six countries to become loose their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen of countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At present of Obamas the Byelorussian president explained Alexander Lukashenko to nuclear safety summit that the nation will never give its uranium up.
" As keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of Kilos, which is fundamentally capable of bearing arms, and less enriched Uran" , Lukashenko said at that time.
" That is our raw material... We are not verkaufen" from it no dirty bombs to make and we it anybody;.
" We use it exclusively for research purposes, that are alles."
Belarus approached nevertheless few months ago the USA on, when it indicated interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first approach to remove the uranium of white Russia in October was particularly complicated, because the material was easily radioactively contaminated, says official ones.
It was shipped into a special course, more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, says official ones.
The second approach was decided on Monday and accomplished according to the official ones by airplane.
The US Government pays 14 million for these troubles $, whereby a majority of the money flows into the Byelorussian research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
" This was extremely carefully coordinated and co-ordinated, around confidence aufzubauen" , which led to the agreement, which was signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the energy Ministry, which works on the global danger reduction.
The James Martin center for Nichtweiterzugebende studies estimates that as well as Belarus had at least 88 Pound of waffenfähhigen uranium in this year hundreds of Pound at highly enriched uranium.
Belarus wants to dissolve its camp to 2012 according to the common agreement.
The relations between Belarus and the USA was tensely for many years, primarily because of Lukashenkos harsh ignoring of the human rights.
But the statement of Wednesday suggests a possible approach.
" Welcome being called the progress of these global security questions, the United States announce from America and Belarus that a increased respect for the democracy and the human rights in Belarus remains a central topic in the improvement of the bilateral relations and it is essentially for the progress of the country and its Bürger" , it explains.

The Spanish government did not have objections against the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaida prisoners over Spanish national territory after Guantánamo, as comes out from a telegram of the Ambassador of the U.S.A. in Madrid.
From Wikileaks the enhüllten reflects and to the daily paper " El País" (by cables) of passed on documents against. It is added that the former deputy head of government María Teresa Fernández demanded de la Vega, which Spanish government was informed " in order to prove that foreign airplanes, which fly over Spain appropriately supervised it werden."

The public prosecutor Vicente González gave to understand for his part in January 2007 of the message that he the judicial initiative, which would not block Deklassifizierung of the documents of the Spanish secret service center (CNI) and the Secretary of Defense over the CIA flights to request.
" These reports do not contain any loading or sensitive Informationen" , the Ambassador explained after a discussion with the public prosecutor.
Nevertheless the USA were " over; apparent co-ordination between the Spanish public prosecutor and the German Staatsanwälten" more anxiously than over the deklassifizierte information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defense.
" This co-ordination between independent examiners is verkomplizieren" our efforts toward the discrete handling between governments; , Aguirre deplores.

The Ambassador expressed also his concern over the approach of the PP in this affair.
" Despite their generally per-American attitude teaches our experience us that the PP will not doubt, from reference that the government Zapateros actions of the USA, which could be laid out as possible violations of human rights, tolerated or deliberately had ignored will strike capital, even if these exposures affect the government of the USA negatively könnten" , it emphasizes.

Under this surname, which she leads from small on, it holds at least with cousin and one friend contact. Both originate from Noia, a village in the province La Coruña, in which them were born.
The reports are from the year 2008.

With it she lived together long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went on the Balearen, in order to look around on the job market, the small one remained with her partner, which accompanied her even one week long after Palma.
But from contents of their messages it can be closed that their love affair broke and they separated.
In March 2008 it is alone on Menorca and writes: " Alberto is very strange and sour, because I for working come bin."
" When I communicated to it, he found it good, but he notices naturally now, what means it to be and not be free with the boy throughout the day alone, to be able to leave do and, what he möchte."
Later she mentions a report, which received her straight on the mobile phone: " I would like that you return this month or send me an address, to those I you the boy send kann."
It deplores itself: " If it does not please him that I leave the boy with my mother, I fetch him, if I back bin."
In May she speaks of the return to her village: " I drive this week there, but I will remain only up to 19 there., because I must to 20. to a work introduce myself, if I do not lose those will."
She explains that she carries her Erstgeborenen forward, if everything goes well.
" It will be with, with whom it must be, i.e., with me. Never in the life I am left it again with someone except with my mother; , a doubtful intention, if one considers their bad relationship.
In July there is further mail.
When it writes these, is assumed the boy, who came on 1. of the month on the island and allegedly on 10. was murdered is dead.
" On the one hand César is content, on the other hand one nicht."
" On the one hand it with me and the place are please it a little, but on the other hand it must each day into the school gehen."
She speaks of a removal after Mallorca.
" There it (the boy) will attend a summer course, then I have fewer expenditures for the Kindermädchen."
To 17.: Memories and complaints.
" A giant kiss of César, which asks me, when you kommst."
" Alberto says, he sent any videos to me on the email. If you see, if he wants, he finds me, such a Mist."
At 30. still the one: " The boy is well. It goes into a summer course, around Catalan too lernen."
From Víctor, its present partner, there is one: " It shoots me money vor."
In the Internet, in Anime and Mangablogs, there are reports of it.
It had even its own blog in MySpace, which is closed now, and into her " itself; Muki, the Gefängnisentlasserin" called.
" Terror A la gallega (heading) ."
The last man, who lived together with it, a sworn in gamekeeper, explains to have pangs of conscience, because it feel guilty.
It cannot seize that everything happened, because it had not told it that she was alone-educating mother.
Mónica was transferred yesterday by the center for court prisoners to Menorca in the province prison of Palma.
The obligation defender, Carlo Maceda, explained, she could not remember the expiration of circumstances, " and it did not have the intention, which small damage zuzufügen."
Before it had to have however confessed, César in the bath tub to have drowned and its corpse away in a suit-case to have stowed.
Defense and public prosecutor's office requested a psychiatric appraisal.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in the congress to it and PSC lost 9
With the results from 28 November the PP in the cities Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona could play a crucial role
After the important mood and delegate increase with the last regional elections the PP directs its view already toward the parliamentary elections - preferred or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes, which obtains this party with these elections, is normally twice as high as with the elections in Catalonia.
Thus the Catalan people's party received 610,473 voices with the parliamentary elections from 2008, while this number amounted to with the regional elections in the year 2006 only 316,222.
On last Sunday the PPC obtained 384,091 voices.
If this ascending tendency - result of the bypass of the voice portion of the PSC and the connection of the constituency of the PP - should continue, the analysts of the PP that with the parliamentary elections the PPC of 8 to 12 congressional representatives could ascend, prognosticate four (it now 10) have to it-win and the PSC at least 9 delegates (of 25) during also CiU would lose.
These computations occupy the fundamental meaning of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
In accordance with the analysis of the people's party the ERC would lose a delegate - at present it has three -, while ICV or to it-win one could hold its delegate.
If the choice calendar should be maintained however, the next date with the Gemeindewahlen falls into May 2011. Also then the people's party (PP) can be the tongue at the balance, in order to prepare for the socialist supremacy an end, in four province capitals and with its majority in the town councillor Barcelonas, one of the city administrations with the largest household: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both nationalist and people's party agrees will lose therein that the PSC the cities Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the socialists obtain neither a majority nor to its traditional allied ones (ERC and ICV) fall back can.
After republican debacle is it not wrong that this party their agency in the local council of Barcelona, in which it would have to obtain 5% of the voices will lose.
The PP registered however an increase of its voice portion in the four province capitals and could the crucial Kraft in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona become.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the leading role in Tarragonas reversal. There they had Josep Félix Ballesteros before the present mayor, together with which PP governs.
EN Lérida is appropriate the PP for only 500 voices behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
Also in other important places, as for example in Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus the people's party could register an important increase.
At present the PP is represented in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and aims at the formation of lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell procured Al Qaida of thousands of passports
Except the seven arrests in Barcelona there were three further in Thailand
The seven Pakistaner arrested by the policemen of the secret service place of the police of Barcelona and the Nigerianer formed the dschihadistische cell, which " different Al Qaida groups, steered from Thailand, among them; Movement for the freeing from Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and " Laschkar e-Taiba " (Let) - the latter was an authoress of the assassination attempts in Bombay, which demanded 2008 106 dead ones - with passports supplied.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior assigns a great importance, which goes so far that he insures to these investigations, with which " Operation Kampai" the falsification apparatus Al Qaidas is world-wide " geschwächt" and " thus their Handlungsfähigkeit."
Researchers go out of it that in two years, in which the cell was active in Catalonia thousand of passports to Thailand sent, where these were falsified and to it to the groups, of which the criminal galaxy consists Al Qaida, sent, so that of them " Kämpfer" unpunished the borders more European and other western countries to exceed could.
The uncovered cell is not the only one of the dschihadistischen net, which was active in Europe. Therefore except the Thai investigation organs also different European police units participated in the investigations. It is not to be excluded that it will come in the area of the European Union in the next days to similar assassination attempts as that, which was implemented on past Tuesday in Barcelona.
In co-ordination with this operation (the Pakistaner Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerianer Babatunde Agunbiade arrested) in Thailand a further was accomplished, with which the Pakistaner Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt as well as the Thailänder Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung was arrested.
They had led from Bangkok the cell established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan net - some of it had been destroyed made in the year 2009 - stole in particular tourists of passports in accordance with the defaults of the so called " International Islamic Front."
That means that the documents on the names of men had to be in the age of 25 to 45 years issued its and still several years valid; they were not allowed to exhibit visa stamps.
In investigation circles it is underlined that no connections between in Catalonia the arresting and the assassination attempt in Bombay could be proven up to now, although the author of this assassination attempt " Laschkar e-Taiba" , one of the groups of receivers in Spain of the stolen was and thereupon in Thailand of falsified passports.
Nevertheless it should be reminded of it that some days before the assassination attempt had been dispatched from Catalonia by means of a funds transfer enterprise several thousands dollar, into the purchase of Prepaid maps for mobile phones " investiert" , those were " later by the members; Kommandos" , for the life of 106 persons an end prepared, were used.
The police seized an extensive documentation.
PP demands an adjournment of the tax agreement from Mas
The chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez Camacho, noticed yesterday the opportunity, Artur Mas personally their conditions for the support of its assumption of office as an Prime Minister of the Generalitat to submit. These differ not from that already during the election campaign placed and leave themselves with the precedence of the economic resurgence and omitting regionalistic independence adventures, how summarize a financial adjustment agreement, which the regionalistic leader on the high point of its mandate wants to suggest.
The chairman of the Catalan people's party contacted with security Artur Mas, who lent it the 18 delegates, who had won it on last Sunday - a number, which is than sufficient more, in order to feel indispensable. Because the candidate of the civil-regionalistic party CiU is dependent on the fact that at least one of the opposition parties contains with the vote with his assumption of office of the voice.
The future alliances, which want to be received the regionalists with the coming parliamentary elections in the congress, depend on a possible Entente with the PP. The discussions, which Mas leads at present with the remaining party chiefs, turn however around Catalonia.
Which the chairman of the party of the PPC concerns, then this demands that for the support of the assumption of office " all discourses, which the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia betreffen" as well as an agreement over the financial adjustment between state and the autonomous region - similar as in the Basque country - and those the party chief of CiU even a referendum to subject wants to be employed, in the back.
Both political leaders it is common that they want to make blown up the political apparatus of the regional administration slimmer and to abolish the inheritance and gift-expensively.
With the details of the negotiations to the assumption of office of Mas of sides of the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat concern themselves.
Mas has itself already with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - which a hard opposition announced - and Joan Herrera (ICV) met. Today it will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric home affirms that the deaths not on " missing Maßnahmen" to lead back are
The owners of the home for the elderly in Olot do not exclude that their male nurse over eleven killed older humans
The responsible persons of the geriatric home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave yesterday a press conference, in which they put out, which damage the criminal actions Joan Vila Dilmés - which male nurse, who had killed during its work at least eleven old humans, for whom it was responsible, - had caused to the mechanism.
The director/conductor of the geriatric home, Joan Sala, arose in company of its attorney, Joan Cañada, before court and announced, " La Caritat would like the responsible person (for the deaths) anklagen" , but " the right and our adhesion obligation force us to it the process and the civil Haftung" to assume.
The mechanism must accept not only a social reputation loss, because it had not in time determined the criminal actions of the male nurse, but also a high amount of damages to pay now, which is computed by the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime decreases/goes back on August 2009 and that it gemordet since then.
The judge arranged the Exhumierung of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric home -, since he assumed that no physician had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities were completed by telephone due to their age and diseases.
The leader of La Caritat answered this point in the negative round away and explained that " being missing measures no time the reason for the incidents been its könnten."
The attorney von La Caritat added that it " in the law case no indications for negligent actions of another person than the accused one of gäbe."
That already as " Todesengel" Baptized one confessed the day before yesterday eleven murders and explained, the first crime on 29 August 2009 to have committed and one and a half months later the second old lady to have murdered.
In this case it killed insulin, in contrast to the first crime, with an overdose with which it had given a mixture from different tranquilizers.
The leader of La Caritat explained, the entrance of the personnel to the medicines was only difficult to control.
The insulin syringes and tranquilizer cocktail used the male nurse with six of nine committed crimes, in order to free the patients with death from their suffering to.
But the results of the laboratory tests will put out whether Vila lies and actually selected for its first victims a less cruel death or whether it burned these out from the inside, by giving bleaching caustic solution to them, as he had done it according to confession with three women, it between that the 12. and 17 October murdered.
In La Caritat one does not give faith to the statements of the male nurse, not even which concerns the number of stood murders, which could quite be more. This attitude is justified with the fact that Vila had made very different statements before court and that it does not make a sense to suddenly change its approach after eight successful murders.
They say, them placed themselves them for this reason and to the clearing-up of the range of these incidents of the law to the order.
Threatening gestures of the European central bank (EZB)
The investors reacted yesterday sharply to the threat of the EZB president Trichet, which warned, " the markets should not our reactivity unterschätzen."
The risk impacts of the euro Peripheriländer rose dramatically and the shares of the European banks around more than 5%.
Nevertheless we should the possibility that the EZB can be mistaken and the euro hardly did not add at points, which arranges to the concern to underestimate.
Events of yesterday are typical for illiquiden market, which in the measure, in which it breaks down itself again recovered, however due to the locking of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will still for a long time not lose his fear.
Today one month ago the European central bank requested us to cancel our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen according to which the EZB must tomorrow make some marks in the future, a backdown for the fourth time in two years, and probably still.
The Federal Bank demanded the termination of the plan to the purchase of national debt, since these were ineffective, as well as the abolition of all unusual limited liquidity measures. Only an one-week unlimited access is to be maintained.
After the Ireland crisis we expect that the present liquidity measures " at least to März" to be extended and the quarterly advertisements with unlimited access at the quarter end for the guarantee of the liquidity to at least June be maintained.
We expect likewise that the program for the purchase of obligations will spend continued and a strengthening signal.
If creative expectations are not fulfilled, the excellent reaction of the markets from yesterday again are thrown back and if halstarrig in one persists to take back which we our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Not to consider just as with the EZB meeting in May, with which the bank affirmed, the purchase of state debt papers and the markets thereupon broke down, could themselves this history tomorrow repeat.
The EZB must be reliable and persistent.
In May it showed the teeth and on Wednesday said it already much to have bought with which it provoked a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday the auction of one year's state titles was rather weak in Portugal.
The national administration of an estate spent only 500 million to 5.28%, opposite 750 million to 4.81% in the preceding auction.
Nevertheless the interest rates fell in Portugal around 30 base points in the entire curve and reflected thereby a perception change of the markets after the words Trichets.
In Ireland the numbers of the debt hole of Allied and bank OF Irish country were published.
The sum becomes on approximately 10,000 million at short notice and possible further 15,000 estimated. There is time until February, around private capital to constituted or these banks is nationalisation.
Although Ireland lost its reliability completely, after it had not recognized the problem with the stress tests in July, the numbers are acceptable in the context of the rescue plan and to help to reduce the uncertainty.
However the government must receive the parliamentary agreement on coming Tuesday to its new budget. Since it does not have yet the sufficient support, Ireland is also further source of the uncertainty.
Angela Merkel arranged her discourse more moderate regarding the summit of the heads of state and the government on 14 December. There political unit is in demand, in order to show that we play the same score together.
The problem is that Germany Wagner wants to play and the other countries the ninth symphony Beethovens.
The Spanish head of the provincial government presented yesterday the measure plan, which was to be adopted on Friday by the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions as with the financial establishments, dismantling of the state deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and work-providing measures. Measures, which sound in the ears of the investors such as Vivaldis four seasons.
The double effect Zapatero and Trichet explains, why the Spanish stock exchange added by 4,5 per cent, twice as much like the remainder of the European stock exchanges.
In the comparison to February the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was fast and convincingly, and we profit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a relevant auction of a three-year government loan, which will draw use from the Trichet effect. Therefore we set on a strong demand, which will eliminate all doubts about our conversion of debts ability.
For Spain requesting an auxiliary plan would be a self sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity, which we do not need. The Treasury has available 40 billion euros, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are extremely expensive and the entrance to the markets were without notice closed.
Nevertheless our strategy should correspond to the slogan Cäsars woman: " Now counts not only its, but also the Schein."
Only we create courage, that!
The chairman of the board of owls contests the company meeting of Vega Sicilia upon the request of his children
The storm in the open conflict of the family Álvarez, owner of the societies owls and El Enebro, does not abate.
David Álvarez, founder of the Unternehmensgurppe, becomes the company meeting of El Enebro, which will take place on request of five of its seven children to 16., contests, since he " it for; absolutely nichtig" holds. Its children will try to receive a majority in order to control the administrative organs of the company - owner of the wine-growing estate Bodegas Vega Sicilia -.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José prepare the legal measures for a new law chapter in their controversy over control of a part of the entrepreneurial group.
The founder largest holdings for enterprise services does not seem to be ready to give way in its law case around control of the organs of El Enebro.
From the board of directors it was removed of five of its seven children. This appointed itself on the shareholder meeting from 18 January this yearly, that is already in the Register of Companies as contested registered, to board of directors members.
The company meeting of El Enebro, which became to call up from the judge of the commercial court number 2 of Madrid for the 16., released a new clap of thunder in the lap of the family Álvarez.
Calling the judge for fixing the meeting is the only legal way, which ensures the summoning of the company meeting.
The last strategy of Juan Carlo, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is " of David Álvarez as; desperate means of the applicants - its five children - laid out, around by means of legal niceties, fraudulent machinations and misuse of rights for futile explained meeting from 18 January recognize too left; , as official speakers explain.
This argumentation is the basis for the contestation of the meeting afterwards, around it as " absolutely nichtig" to explain.
The same protagonists, which wrapped themselves into discrete silence, tried in June already unsuccessfully to call up on judicial way a meeting.
With El Enebro - fortune company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, apart from other net assets - control David Álvarez' seven children 100 per cent of the capital.
However the founder of the group of services demands the right of use over 51% of the capital according to family minutes.
That is actual background thing, on which the judge in the hearing has to decide for treatment the rescissory action, for which still no date was specified.

Since Red Bull penetrated 2004 into the world of the formula 1, its history is coined/shaped in this erlesenen universe of the speed of surprises and successes.
At first nobody gave attention to the beginner and despite its steeply ascending course during the last seasons set with the final spurt in last November all on the victory of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without wanting to lower the abilities of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the achievement strength of the engine of Renault, is " Geheimwaffe" , which the Multi Siemens Red Bull put into the hands, and thus created a winner team, nascently the legend.
In reality a high performance acts software to simulation of processes around, which the German brought enterprise to 2007 to purposes, which do not have to do with motorraces, on the market.
This as PLM designated computer science program for the development of assembly chains in factories on the whole world, energy works and highly precise instruments was used.
A faithful reproduction and/or simulation of a product or a process is aimed at, before this is actually built, in order to avoid errors and redundant costs in such a way.
PLM has the development of the cameras of Canon, which facilitates airplanes of Sukhoi and the most famous commercial motor vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried soot worm, director/conductor of the industrial department of Siemens, explains that with the employment of this software in the formula 1 - factory Red Bull " in few hours, nearly in Echtzeit" the changes and improvements, which are determined on running and with the tests, sketch and would drive out can.
Soot worm implements that 1992 in the running stables on the average ten technicians worked, who would bring at the most three or four improvements in one season could.
In of Red Bull team today 180 highly-qualified young people are busy. With high performance EDP systems they would drive through analyses and all possible changes at the racing cars.
The Siemens manager explained, the PLM software was able to analyze and improve all components of the racing cars from Red Bull to, with exception of the engine, for which excluding Renault responsible explains itself.
The materials, the fuel, which become aerodynamics and the safety members changed.
The changes can be transferred owing to progressive production plants and Hightech autoclaves within less than 24 hours of the virtual reality of the simulator into the reality.
The only border, which is set to this moved technical perfectionism, are the 40 million dollar, which formula a 1 - team on its races in one season to spend may.
Red Bull developed its Hightech factory for the development and the production of its racing cars in 50 kilometers a place removed from London.
This concerns two buildings, in which visits - particularly of journalists - are strongly limited.
Everything that happens there, is Top Secret.
The staff covers 580 persons, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark of Webber.
But of Red Bull of true formula 1 - hero is doubtless the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind enormous technological resources, which the Energy drink manufacturer places into the services of his participation on the racing courses, hide themselves further protagonists, whose support is inestimably and their fame equal to zero.
The Technologichef of the work, Steve Nevey, stresses that one could still say before five years that the progress within the range F& E for racing cars with 50 per cent to the victory contributed and the pilots were responsible for the remainder.
Today the portion values changed. The technology constitutes 85 per cent of success, while the contribution of the pilots on 15 per cent becomes estimated.
Nevey recognizes on that Vettel and Webber can be never replaced by EDP, because them " is not predictable Gladiatoren."
HP will open twenty own shops with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) dedicated yesterday in Barcelona its first exclusive shop in collaboration with its partner to Ront Reyes.
It is first of sales sale with in each case 80 to 100 square meters, consisting of twenty business, which the Multi intends to open in the next two years in Spain.
The society agrees upon this initiative with the 16 sales ranges in the multi-mark enterprise, as for example PC town center, already existing, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The deputy chairman of HP España, Helena Herrero, called property of Pont Reyes as example the converted shop to the Gran Vía in Barcelona, with which HP co-operates for thirty years.
The North American entrepreneurial group intends to furnish until 2010 in Europe 200 sales offices, of it to 20 addresses in Spain.
First were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera wanted not to betray the coming re-openings, did not exclude however that Madrid could be the next goal.
The deputy chairman, who is also a chief of HP personnel of system, insured, philosophy for shop opening was always alike. It supports itself by a local distributor with experience and branch knowledge.
The North American entrepreneurial group advises these and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products for touching). In Europe all equal shops will look.
In addition HP is responsible for the training of the shop personnel.
Helena Herrero said, it does not concern not a Franchising system and a main header out that with the exclusive sales office net one intend, " the customer service and the consultation of small and Kleinstunternehmen with the purchase and afterwards, even the packing too optimieren."
The shop in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program, which solves the technical problems of the HP devices with warranty.
An on-line service develops a connection to the technical center in Maastricht (Holland).
" In this way we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes nehmen." up to two days in requirement;
" This system was developed in particular for small and Kleinstunternehmen as well as private customers, because the large-scale enterprises to have already their contracts for services for technical Kundendienst" , Helena Herroro explained yesterday.
Sabadell wants its rival in three years millions customer ' klauen'
The acting member of the board of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for the banks, rejects first however a new liquidity crisis and prophesies the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless he foresees a break-down of the interest margins, which the banks try to adjust with increases of the fees and the prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to catch in three years millions private customers - a subject still which can be existed.
Sabadell found the way to exhaust the coming three years to survive and so in a very much complicated economic surrounding field.
The bank becomes 2011 a new three-yearly guidance plan would bring in.
The goal reads not only to survive, without taking the public assistance up from the FROB for increasing but beyond that the market share around millions private customer - will lose 700,000, if one withdraws the customers, the bank -. That is the large challenge, before which this bank stands, because up to now it to its clients more attention dedicated than their private customer.
In this year it has 250,000 private customers and 50,000 enterprises in addition-gets.
Their market share at private customers is with 3,5 per cent, while the clients constitute more than 10 per cent.
A further principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is the increase of the productivity, speaks Austerität, cost reduction. She will present the challenges, which the bank thereby faces, together with end-of-year procedure report.
Only few banks dare to specify and publish it in these difficult times of goals, since by the financial crisis world-wide all plans of the banks are in disorder guessed/advised.
Sabadell will lock their before four years specified guidance plan optima in this year. This was initially appropriate for three years, but due to the market situation he was extended by one financial year.
The customers, who will leave the savings banks, are the principal purpose of the bank.
With one of the APIE stressed Guardiola organized breakfast, 2011 was " schwieriges" Year " with large Reichweite."
The manager assumes that, Spain would come only " langsam" from the crisis.
In addition it would be " much schwierig" , in two or three years " Work too schaffen" - fundamentally for surviving the banks.
Even if it assumes the war around liabilities - which punishes the interest-rate margins - will abate, the risk impacts, which must pay banks and savings banks for their emissions to the receipt of liquidity, become, as reconciliation for shrinking profit margins already shifted upon the price for credits.
" The topics liquidity and financing are structural kind and them pressure on the credits are ausüben."
" We did not turn the cock off, but the Zinsdifferenziale is very much hoch" , Guardiola admitted.
Banesto spent the arrangement on Thursday already to its branch network to limit the assignment of long-term loans and increase the Zinsdifferenziale (see Cinco Días of 22. and 27 November).
The manager confessed likewise, the banks pursued momentarily the Stategie, " the fees too erhöhen" , however " within a framework coined/shaped by the competition ."
Sabadells guidance plan is based on an organic growth, even if the group, as does not exclude always, korporative business.
It insures not in vain that in Spain " larger enterprises necessarily sind."
" In the coming year everything verändern" itself; , it insures.
It stresses that the need of capital " at present; enormously steigt" and it does not exclude that some Spanish financial establishments will slip into red numbers.
It is the opinion, the FROB can with Kaptitalaufstockungen the money market replace.
After it insures that Sabadell can survive also a temporary locking of the markets, he weakens the argument of some bankers, which already prophesy a new liquidity crisis.
It stressed, one cannot bring anything in circulation, but in contrast to the incidents in June, one can obtain short term financing over Repogeschäfte and intercept thus the crisis.
CECA excludes a second fusion wave of the savings banks
The general manager of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility the fact that it could come to a fusion wave of the savings banks and stressed the speed, with which the industry is restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began to participate insisted several savings banks on it in the first phase not. They reserved themselves the second round.
However the general manager of the Spanish association of savings banks (CECA) insured, José Antonio Olavarrieta, this second round would not take place.
" I believe that the largest part of the fusions is final. The inclusion of Cajasol into the group of Banca Cívica cannot be regarded as the second round, it acted rather around Anpassungen."
" The largest part is final. It can be that we have thirteen or fourteen in place of filter toes, but all important processes are already completed. They were kontrolliert." of Banco de España, who supported all procedures strongly;
With one of the federation of the managing directors and manager Aragoniens (ADEA) implemented Olavarrieta organized breakfast that the concentration process " as fast as possible it was carried out and that we to be content to have upon the operational sequence within the prescribed period, which wurde" in earlier times, not now, in the context of the business plans with Banco de España fixed; , it stressed.
" The transition from 45 savings banks with on the average 28,000 million financial status to 17 with 75,500 million each is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial establishments was reduced by 62 per cent and it is now very much larger, with which we the Baseler agreement fulfilled haben" , main header it out.
Olavarrieta explained, " there would be a number of unabgebrachter opinions over the tardiness of the process, the lack of seriousness and Unsinnigkeit" revealed, because " Banco de España admonishes us, within the prescribed period before end of the year abzuschließen."
The general manager of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, insured yesterday that Spain one of the most radical financing systems of Europe " and; vielleicht" the whole world it has and supplemented that those, which anzweifeltenn this " without deeper Kenntnisse" would do.
The manager noticed that we in the present Wirtschaftskonjunktur " ourselves; no Sorgen" over the situation of the financial establishments and the savings banks to make must, the one " much bedeutenden" Concentration process gone through, that " as fast as möglich" one carry out.
It reminded also of the fact that the Spanish banks had existed the stress tests, whom the EZB accomplished in July very well.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has itself for maintains the euro decided, but at the same time for the entire European union set up conditions.
The tensions on the markets released a double answer of the government.
On the one hand José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero submitted, begun new measures of adaption with tax reductions for small and Kleinstunternehmen, the adjustment of time work enterprises or the abolition of the 426 euros support for unemployed persons, who do not refer an unemployment pay, up to the privatisation of 49 per cent of CHANGES, to the administration of the airports Barajas and El Prat as well as 30 per cent of the national lottery.
On the other hand the deputy head of government, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former head of the provincial government Felipe González the criticism at the chancellor Angela Merkel than responsible person, supports who out-swore to the present crisis.
How are these procedures to be understood?
, The Merkels position an error of their public work is not anticipated is.
On the contrary, this concerns a new round during the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro.
Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective for the organization of our future, which collides with the maintenance of the traditional traditions of a majority of its partners.
In view of the resistances in Europe one begins in Germany over three possible ways out of the crisis too spekuliern.
First: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
Second: The re-establishment of the German Marks - although at present rather after Science the Fiction sounds -, supported from a majority of the public opinion, approx. 50 per cent of the population.
Third: A transformation of the euro in accordance with German proposals. That means: more macro-economic control; housekeeping; Punishment of the countries, which cross the defaults; the möglichereweise Zahlungseinstellung of some countries as well as the expansion of the costs of potenzieller measures of adaption on the private sector.
The German position is clear and appears already for some time. Therefore there are no excuses now.
First 2009, when both the IWF as well as incentives for deficits created the European commission and a constitutional reform drew itself the German government from the sleeve, in order to prevent this starting from 2016.
That was the first sign for drifting apart between what considered Germany necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second indication set the Central European country, when Merkel postponed the decision for the rescue of Greece painfully.
At that time that was strongly criticized. But fact is that the political consent in Germany, which was absolute public and the published opinion against a rescue of Greece.
Finally Merkel comes out in the last October days on the new with a clear position. It demands a reform of the agreements of the European union, in order to make the rescue possible of a country and to obligate the private money lenders at the same time to carry a part of the costs.
This position was laid out as anti-European, since it advanced the Ireland crisis and all following.
But their proposal, even if something versüßt, was accepted. In the next months we become at the reform of the European union, which is to make these measures possible starting from 2013, sharings.
Germany drew a red line, which does not intend to exceed it.
It says all that - even if now unpopular measures must be met - it starting from this date the old function mode of the euro will not any longer give.
2013 could be forced to explain themselves the birth year of a new currency area to be, in which the infringers of countries are hard punished, insolvent and in this case the private sector a part of the costs take over must.
Germany shows us that we must hit a hard growth course, with high saving and investment rates, moderation of the consumption, improvement of the productivity and competitive ability as well as positive externaleconomical balances.
The other alternative, which on indebtedness and building industry with enormous holes in the balance of payments is based, was stated as it by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly not to understand it.
It does not only concern to down-drive the state deficit up to the year 2013 on three per cent.
The demands are many harder.
And the worst, which we could do under these conditions, is us too would amount to.
I hope that the present turbulences change into more peace.
And that we will use the possibilities, which are ordered us up to the spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood also in such a way, and its double announcement (the promised reforms after the discussion with the large-scale enterprises on past Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) points out that despite the criticism at Merkel the hypothesis prepared to create order in the own house their way.
There but the red line drawn from Germany is, and it does not look in such a way that in it somewhat would change.
Under the considered possibilities those that we would have to leave the euro area fully plugged with little respectable countries is, to exclude not.
In this case Germany could say to us still, it had warned us.
Sport and rule evasion
Cheat as from Alonso and Ramos in the play against the Ajax show invention spirit, but not the will to go around a sanction.
Allegedly the exclusion in the play from 23 November against the Ajax in Champions League, plotted by two players Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos), led to the fact that much ink was poured over whether it did not concern a unsportliche action or and whether both players should be possibly sanctioned of the UEFA.
As is common knowledge, lost the two players are a few minutes before playing (their team had already clearly won) time and played several Fouls, so that the arbitrator them showed the second yellow map.
In this way, and Real Madrid, would become the two players the prescribed sanction would start his group there with the next league play against the Auxerre to fulfill and without maps into the next play phase enter in such a way.
Finally the Disziplinarkommitee of the UEFA punished the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two plays and the players involved with different money.
The provocation of a yellow map under such or similar circumstances is not new practice, it is rather frequently in the world of the football to be found.
It is so far common the fact that it part of the Ethos - which unwritten obeyed, but in this kind of sport rules - is.
Part the arisen debate about the represented case it decreases/goes back to the fact that a team of the football club Real Madrid (in its hymn the noble courage and honour give and at other opportunities its players for similar incidents had punished) played thereby the leading role, and on the Dramatisierung by Mourinho, which to his long history than theatrical and provoking technician added an episode more.
In any case the debate about it, whether this contradicts the principles of the sport not expressly from the statutes forbidden behavior, turns i.e. whether these actions represent a rule evasion. This approach adheres actual to the statutes of the sport, seem to go around however its sense.
With this affair that should the sport spirit caused damage to be examined.
The sport spirit defends the physical soundness of the opponents, an aspect, which was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive play.
A further aspect of a clean play consists avoiding of the fact that the infringers players draw an unjustified use from the Gegenteam. Also did not happen.
Paradoxes of the action of the players Real Madrid it is that she does not correspond, which we normally understand by wrong play or rule evasion, because the evasion of the rule became not secretly carried out, in order to avoid a sanction, but it should as possible be as remarkable, so that it is punished of the arbitrator.
The players were waiting and accepted the sanction joyfully.
Another question is, which kind of advantage the infringers drew from the intentional Fouls.
Here it should be emphasized that the rival was brought neither into a more unfavorable layer still advantages for the played play was erheischt, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team with fewer players had to further-play.
It is also no useful strategy for the next play, because the club does not have then these players.
The advantage consists obviously of the fact that the players begin the next play phase Champions League without maps, which its participation in a future play could threaten.
But this concerns a long-term advantage uncertain up to a certain degree, since the team could also be ruled out sometime. In addition the players with this approach receive a sanction and change into the second map cycle, in which they are ruled out because of map accumulation with a map less than in the first cycle.
Thus it is not so clear whether it really concerns an advantage.
Finally such approaches are not directed against the sport spirit, to which also strategic decisions belong, in order to draw from the regulations a greatest possible use.
In this case the players a sanction did not want to go around (that would actually be a clear case of rule evasion), it wanted rather to select, when they undergo of these.
They made a strategic decision, without evading to a punishment or flee before it.
Although the border between ingenuity and rule environment is smeared, I believe that it acts with this affair around a clear case of ingenuity.
I have the impression that the polemic developed due to two factors: Because it around two self exclusions went and because of the kind of the provoked rule transmission.
The damage, which was caused to the principles of the sport by these actions, is less more ethicalally than rather aesthetic art.
Offer offensive to the customer catch for group Christamas Eve meals in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar lets this year an avalanche of reservations fall on the days 16. and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves spread. They do not want to spend any more than 20 to 30 euros.
As the Turrón and the Christmas lottery give it in the pre-Christmas period also again to group dinners, which supply the restaurant and leisure trade of Barcelona oxygen. But due to the economic crisis they release a price offensive, in order to catch also the Kundensegment, which represents the large mass: Nearly everything would like to spend between 20 and 30 euros on noon or a dinner, confirms the asked entrepreneurs and federations.
So that the bookkeeping becomes still a little more complicated, the calendar (New Year's Eve falls on one Friday) let all orders fall into the week of 13 December, with the result of an avalanche of reservations of dinners at two Spitzentager (the 16. and 17.) and nearly no orders in the week before it.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, have many enterprises the group dinners for household reasons adjusted.
In order not to have to do without this tradition, many employees pay these from their own bag.
Like the economic situation also always, it is appropriate for Niedrigstpreise is demanded, confirms the chairman of the restaurant committee of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the umbrella organization does not dare itself to predict up to now, how the holidays will look in this month.
" The people consider themselves it ' zig mark, before it reservieren."
" They would like to go out gladly, but them pay attention strongly to the Preise" , it stresses.
The business is " with those well to go; the quality at good prices with a good service anbieten" , it adds, and calls us in the memory the fact that the customers in crisis periods save why prices by 25 euros is most strongly inquired.
With an inquiry in various restaurants lain central it turns out that the evening 17. Of December the offerers to the collapse leads.
The group of Soteras says, the demands for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would boom. The group adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
At another prominent group, Andilana, which maintains 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and other one), has the peculiarness of the calendar to preferred reservations, even starting from at the beginning of November, led.
" We made the impossible possible, aufrechtzuerhalten" at the previous year prices with menus for each taste from 19,95 to 30 euros; , it explains.
With AT Grup, which leads El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and altogether 23 restaurants, one does not lose the optimism, after for the second quarter the incomes flower again and to good, even if on few days concentrated prospects for the Christmas business one expects.
Sources of the entrepreneurial group emphasize that also the 18. an overactive day with groups of friends, which before-celebrate Christmas will be.
To the six group menus a Christmas menu for 30 euros or more than price hit was added. One has the impression that the customers are ready, 10 per cent more than in the previous year to spend and in response more details wish, as for example Cava.
Also in some companies one sees green rungs sprouting, why the employees are again invited. It obtains the impression that the group meals are again in the upswing.
Vonseiten of the umbrella organization Fecasarm (with unions like the tavern, restaurant and leisure federation of Barcelona), trusts the deputy chairman, Enric Gomà, to see on it the end of the tunnel and notices that the reservations altogether quite " lebhaft" are, although the customers " a maximum herausschlagen."
The fun at celebrating did not decrease/go back however, all the same who pays.
The nuclear program of Pakistan excites large concern in the USA
Islamabad places nuclear weapons " faster than every other country her."
Exposures of Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
Contents of the correspondence between the North American message in Pakistan and the US state department, revealed by the internet portal Wikileaks, confirms, the nuclear programme of Pakistan Washington prepares which enormous concerns.
At the edge of the clarifying and juicy details, which offer the documents over contents of the discussions and the way of thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, these that co-operation between both countries in things atomic security is not strengthened, reveal but on the contrary " abnimmt" , and that the unstable Asian country " more atomic weapons; to a faster rhythm than every other Land" manufactures.
In particular the characteristic of the nuclear programme of Pakistan - that the weapons are not compound, but their individual parts to be stored, in order to make with a possible attack their destruction more difficult - prepares sleepless nights for Washington.
The ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of the former director/conductor of the national security council, enumerates the following risks James Jones: " The proximity of some nuclear plants for area attacked by the Taliban, supposed scattering of the nuclear material and the susceptibility of the transport of nuclear Material."
The large number of persons, which are implied in the nuclear arsenals and the rocket programs, no longer only of the USA, but also of Russia than getting out of control and reason to let caution reign regarded.
" Pakistan must adjust strictly gläubiges personnel for the guard of the nuclear plants; due to the low education and cultural levels extremist organizations more possibilities persons, who cooperate in atomic or rocket programs, reklutieren" too; , the expert said Yuri Korolev of the Russian State Department in a discussion with his North American colleagues.
Again to of Julian internet portal ate revealed documentation is that leaves co-operation between the USA and Pakistan in things of nuclear spreading and the increased speed, in which Pakistan manufactures nuclear weapons.
In May becomes from an office of the message, which " communication with Pakistan as; frustrierend" describes, explained: " Frequently there is no transparency; on offers of help we receive no answers or them are abgelehnt."
In another report Peter Lavoy, Beamter of the national secret service confirms for south Asia that " despite the economic disaster Pakistan nuclear weapons as fast as no other country produziert."
The ambassador Patterson asks Washington during a visit of the highest army leader, general Ashfaq Kayani, which responsible persons " klarzustellen" that " Of Pakistan army his tacit over supporting of groups of terror to adjust hat."
On the hunt for Wikileaks boss
Obama appoints a high responsible person for the anti-terrorism fight the prevention of new exposures.
Interpol spends a red warning for the pursuit and location of Assange.
Everything that is connected with Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth, in which the facts can be cleared up only with difficulty.
Yesterday Interpol gave one " red Warnung" to " Location and Verfolgung" from Assange.
However it does not act thereby around a traditional arrangement to the arrest.
In addition it is not new, it comes from 20 November.
She has to do also nothing with the last exposure of documents from the USA, diplomatic over four million, but with the accusations of sexual abuse, to which the Australian must place himself in Sweden.
Furthermore the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, insures Mark Stephens, " the police would know, where and how they take up contact with Mr. eating könne."
Already to 20. the international police authority with seat in Lyon (France) upon the request of Sweden the arrangement spent, but it was not announced to the power until yesterday after receipt by the Swedish authorities.
Thus the things lie. The 188 inter+polling-change are dependent to identify and find Assange, " over it provisionally to arrest and auszuliefern."
Although Interpol cannot arrange the arrest of an individual concerned by a red warning, many member countries regard the red warning according to statements of the organization as charter for a Arrestierung - which must be accomplished by the national police - in particular, if they have a bilateral extradition treaty, how it is the case of Sweden and England, where ate itself probably stops.
The procedure indignant Assanges of lawyers, who published gestures a letter, in which it about the fact it informed that the 39-jährige is ready founder of Wikileaks to answer by videoconference the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They remind also of the fact that Assange requested the departure from Sweden and from the state attorney, who is compared with the sagenumwobenen Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, security head by Stalin, which received appropriate permission.
" That is like a hunt, not like a legal Verfolgung" , in the letter one accuses.
While the world looks for it - and its mother from Australia the innocence of its son protested - stops Assange itself at an unknown place, however not being silent.
On Monday it gave to the director/conductor of the magazine time by Skype from an indefinite place an interview. With the discussion he requested the resignation of the Secretary of State of the USA, Hillary Clinton.
" If it can be proven that she was responsible for the arrangement of North American diplomats, who offended to UN to spy and thus approximately from the USA signed international agreements, would have them zurücktreten" , it said.
Its opinion was condemned Robert Gibbs yesterday by the press secretary of the white house, the request for resignation as was " ridiculously and absurd" designated.
" I am not safe me, why we attach importance to the opinion of a type with website sollten" , it explained CNN to the transmitter.
Obama has a high responsible person for the anti-terrorism fight, Rusell Travers, which prevention of new document exposures assigns.
The attempt of the speaker of the Präsidenden Barack Obama to give to Assange less attention stands contrary to the opinions, which announce conservative politicians and commentators in these days.
The congressional representative Peter King, who will lead the presidency in the national Sicherheitskommitee of the Lower House starting from January, requested the state department to examine the possibility Wikileaks on the list of organizations of terror to set, " around their funds to seize and everyone, it supports or a contribution makes too verfolgen."
Tom Flanagan, advisor of the Canadian president Stephen Harper, had still continued to go, and he had its statement, Assange had " murdered werden" recalled.
" Obama would have to transform it into a target and a not manned airplane or so which benutzen."
Who did not apologize, Mike Huckabee, a baptistischer Minister, was former governor von Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
" Who it was also always, which let ooze in the government information, he is guilty of the betrayal and everything which no execution is, is eiine to mild Strafe" , it explained Fox to the transmitter.
Puigcercós looks for intimate peace with a winking to the Carod in the ERC
The republican leader permits a secret vote to the party over his continuing in the office.
Huguet suggests a pluralistischere government and the end of the plenary assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a prescription, in order to go to the zigsten mark internal riot in the rows to the loss of 11 delegates and half of the votes directionless ERC out of the way.
The chairman of the party is conscious itself that its resignation threat the intimate one of the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod Rovira is not sufficient. But it knows also that the influence of this sector is today as weakened as their Mentor and the same headache will not give to it, like other former currents.
Therefore the leader of Esquerra with a winking tries to win the new critics, which would secure its position up to the next local elections.
For the beginning it announced yesterday that the councillors of ERC, regional over 200, could secretly express themselves over his remaining in the office.
With ballot papers, not with elevated hand.
If the Carodisten wanted to give a punishing note to the Präsidenen, they could do this, without having to fear Repressalien.
Actually the boss would like to avoid both the impression of splitting as well as from subjecting under his person.
In several interviews it, it affirmed to feel not confirmed with half of the voices plus one, and it added a result without indication of percentages, " in the Bulgarian Stil" would not be good also.
The Carod intimate one demands more from the president, than putting only to the party its office at the disposal. An insufficient gesture, since Puigcercós controls the highest organ of the congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority for forcing of resignations, they will agree upon a procedure plan from now with the executive committee to May.
But they, at the elaboration of the document over strategic reorientation expect that the line will submit to 18. the advice for vote, participate to be able.
Their intention is it to vouch for Puigcercós. In response this is to promise to before-move the congress into the autumn 2011 which already regards the party leaders as a fact.
The chairman of the party of the ERC is the view, which " Polyphonie" unfortunate stability and it aims at once and for all bringing the organization into the situation washing their dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense the article, which the acting Conseller Josep Huguet in its blog signed, is symptomatic.
In view of its, which is Puigcercós an ideologist, the owner of Innovació held it for a fact that the chairman of the party " in the exchange against different Ziele" one support.
It counted five up, from those two in the foreground.
First of all, those " Umstrukturierung" the executive committee, so that this represents at least 90 per cent of the party members that is called the inclusion of new faces from Carods surrounding field.
Second could be the large piece of news.

Obama uses itself in Twitter for the law in favor of undokumentierter students
" If you for the adoption of the Dream act - law are, then call your senators on and urge on the adoption of this Gesetzes" , the president of the United States in the popular social net twitterte.
The president Barack Obama supported today the country-wide mobilization for the support of the Dream act - law for the legalization of undokumentierter students with a message on his personal blog in the social net Twitter.
" If you for the adoption of the Dream act - law are, then call your senators on and urge on the adoption of this Gesetzes" , Obama twitterte.
Its short report contains a Cyberlink to a more extensive document, which requests the public to step unterzüglich with its senators into contact since the vote of the law is imminent.
" With your voice, for which we wait, the time came, you anzuhören" , it stresses.
The message was expanded spread, after the 42 republican senators threatened to block all voice for each law except the expansion of the tax reductions from the times of Bush and the financing of the government.
Such a blockade, which was announced on a letter signed by the 42 republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream act - law and other projects like the ratification of the new starting agreement with Russia against the spreading of nuclear weapons.
About the blockade of the republicans of the law asked, the presidency speaker Robert Gibbs, he said Dream act and other projects trusts on the fact that, if the tax topic is solved a schedule for the remaining projects could be set up.
" I believe, we still much time... "
" All we agree in the fact that the tax affair must be completed before end of the year... "
" I believe that we can at any time make over it an agreement and afterwards to be able we the expiration of the remainder planen" , it said.
The chairman of the democratic majority in the senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday, " it became the vote on conclusion of the Debatte" request, so that the Dream act - law, with which the initiative can be co-ordinated for the legalization of undokumentierter students starting from coming Thursday in the senate, although the next week would be more probable.

But the advocates of the law need sixty voices for the adoption of the initiative, why they are dependent on the voices of a handful of republicans. At present the organizations of the advocates of this project organize an intensive influencing control on the adoption of the law.
The democrats, from whom the majority the Dream support act, have 58 seats.
However one of them, the senator said Ben Nelson from Nebraska, it against it to be correct and only one republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, its support of the law announced.
Therefore the defenders of the Dream Acts must get several republicans on their side, if other democrats should decide, the initiative the back to zuzukehren.
To at most wooed the republicans belong from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the senator the George Lemieux from Florida, which took over the mandate of the senator Mel Martínez.
Further republicans, who supported the Dream act in the past, are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they explained not to support it at another opportunity no more.
A further republican, who had expressed itself for the law, John McCain, did not specify his attitude so far yet.
Although the house of representatives has another version, the analysts agree which is located the Dream act in the senate before the largest obstacles.
Put the finger into the wound with literature
The second round of ' The desire to the Sprache' was a walk, with which the participants made themselves strong for the narration
" With the Sex in the language I understand, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected by me? " , the authoress Luisa Valenzuela asked, those the second round of ' Loosely placeres de la lengua' to open, a cycle, that should the spanischsprachige literature celebrated and on this occasion the sub-title of its question used (on another meeting table the Sex was dedicated to the round in the language, explained it).
The finger in the wound... " brings us in Schwierigkeiten" , the Argentine spat Schriftstellein sweetly against the public, which consisted mainly of young people, who met on the international book fair in Guadalajara (FIL), in order to attend this by Marisol Shultz moderated rounds table, at whom Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read out a text, which she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and which Shultz marked thereafter as a great narration. Luisa told in first person and is the Protagonistin, on the search is to be experienced, what " one; Wunde" is, and from physician to physician goes, from which it receives no answer, but notes for the manual of its narration.
It leaves the Infektologen convinced: " Patience is not my strength, perhaps is that my Wunde."
In the end, after a frustrating approach to the Traumatologen, which robbed it in the middle on the course the breath, and which it however explained that wound a scientific term is not, enthült the Psychoanalytiker the secret: " the wound is the really open, the symbolic is the Narbe."
The main figure of the narration sighs relieved and closes, it " from the wound only it experienced that this was really open and does not existiere." But it is convinced that the desire at the language and their traps mix themselves.
Valenzuela, the authoress, played with both.
The Nicaraguaner Sergio Ramírez presented also a entzückende narration, which it ' Praise of the Erfindung' called, and in that the finger in the wound is not mentioned but is not discovered.
With allusions to magic realism it tells of a famous Zauberin, which returned the clouds affected, far traveled men or re-established the virtue lost by a girl. The narration made an about-face and reported of America, for the large novel, to which it was not missing from the outset at its own chroniclers, and it quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the abundance of stories told by the Eroberen.
" Cervantes, which invited us all (the writers), scoffed the pretended witnesses, who emerged in as truely explained stories, but on other way history America would have been never told - with imagination, which even the shame kam." lost;
However he emphasizes, " there is the crazy people and liars, who vorstellen" themselves the things best; , and reality and lie approach there each other on, where one does not know no more, to which side the narration belonged, where the fictitious literature reaches the summit.
It actually calls that the ' Tradition Cervantes'.
" Of him we inherited, to be which, which wird." told;
When Mayra Montero at the row was, and praised the authoress commentated the variety of the interpretations, to those the invitation of the FIl for rounding table ' The finger in the Wunde' had contributed.
The Kubanerin and Puertorikanerin dedicated its contribution to the large wound of the social force, those their country strikes - like completely Latin America - as result of the fights for the drug trade.
" I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs a tacit, deliberately not planned commitment enthalten" , it explained, after it had emphasized that literature is communication and commitment, which " themselves between the author and the readers as with one; chemical Reaktion" construct.
The Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution likewise ," decided the evening; this finger of the engaged writer in the wound of the Schriftstellers" hevorhob.
He noticed that in a schnelllebigen world also the intellectual habits and control of consciousness run out on Dogmatismen, and forgotten, is " that behind each confirmation a small no stands and behind each denial a small Ja."
" In order to be in the possession our thought and the reality, we must nuancieren: And Nuancieren means frequently to put the finger into the wound and trouble those, which feel much better, if they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances for troubling and also the powerful ones which prefer it, the world in black and it noticed dividing white and loaded in addition the sense of the letter to rediscover.
Romano fights for its first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks to Abs in its career on three defeats in final games back, it on and experienced, but three times he played crucial plays.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey with the final game face each other in addition two different styles given by their respective coaches, and of them of contrasts marked meeting reflects itself in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks to Abs in its career on three defeats in final games back, it on and experienced, but three times he had crucial plays, and so far he kept himself good, why this opportunity of completely special importance for him is.
The Argentinier magnified the importance of itself with the medal to second champions, it a step behind the winners stayed and surprisingly it with the same team following each other final games delivered.
The santistische strategist reached the first final game as a coach with the ' Torneo Apertura 2002' , when del Morelia had the reins in the hand, with which he experienced a large defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, with the ' Clausura 2003' reached it the crucial duel, which it lost also with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the ' Torneo Bicentenario 2010' , with which they played against lot Diablo, Rubén had to put again a setback in, since the play with 2-2 against lot Choriceros went out after 210 play minutes undecided, but with the eleven-meter it progressed with 3-1 and got two possibilities of putting its title in but in the long run three its player missed the eleven steps and the play turned to 4-3.
Rubén had lost already two final games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, its large rival. Therefore it would not like to be pursued again from the misfortune and free itself from the bad charm, in order to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although it affirms that for it the most important is the play.
" I would like champions to become, I would like no statistics to break, which is for a club, for my affection, which I give myself, and therefore the title to me will come, but which happens before, is the Wichtigste" , the attendant commentated, when one asks him over the lost final games.
The last final game remained still strong for him in the memory, it insured, much from it to have learned: " The only teachings, which we can draw from it, are that to the arbitrators the end it does not whistle cannot we not celebrate, we at the line are preparatory, the players also, because the last mark were already preparatory we with two eleven-meters to be ruled out and I believed that teachings are not, until the play is not terminated give it a cause for the Feiern."
To know that this series could be decided by penalty shootout, it does not worry it, because it trusts its players: " One wants to never arrive with the penalty shootout, one would like in the regular play time to lock, sometimes but there is no alternative and one must for it be preparatory, in previous tour was preparatory we, but to us the fate unfortunately prepared to sometimes regard a bad play, due to nervousness or the violent tendency, the title in the hands, left us somewhat as this final game, and we to hope that this mark to it do not come wird."
It lies in Romanso power, no longer only second champion to be and the fame cost for the first time, which the titles bring with itself.

In some way the Mikrobie uses the arsenic as survival resources. With consideration of this ability the chances increase that there could be similar life on other planets, which do not have our protecting atmosphere.

" We hope that the delegates really exercise their right to act freely of arrangements between the parties because is usual that they make agreements, with which them their own interests represent, with which she verwandeln." herself in Karnevalskomparsen of the governments and the leaders of the parliamentary parliamentary groups;
He spoke of the fact that they should prove their commitment for the setting up the necessary bridges to the Unterstüztung of the present government.
" We worry about the fact that they would drive a trustworthy work out and itself first of all for the society and their groups begin, because were the inhabitants of Sinaloa, which aussprachen." them with the last elections their confidence;
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, chairman of the hotel federation Tres Islas, means, one of the large challenges, which the 40 representatives of the people face, is the drive and that common working for the economic growth of the state, because nowadays the economic situation extreme is complicated.
" The most important is that they propel economic growth, incentives for investment and infrastructure measures creates, which in possibly a way promotes the job creation wird."
Regarding the tourism industry it demanded it from the new delegates, should for promotion the tourism Ministry the necessary value in the national household assign.
" I understood that it is the Ministry with the few means. That is incompatible with an important economic activity, which brings foreign currency and investments in the country and in direct competition to the Agro industry steht."
To the tourist projects funds must be assigned, national security must support to become and the alcohol law, which was not again seized in preceding legislative periods, must on the newest conditions be brought.

Secret immigration could be pursued problem-free
The bill of the conservative ones, which is to regulate the problem of the ships loaded with secret immigrants according to the government, will in all probability be in-rammed, after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot endorse the proposal.
" I lean with reproduction against this Charter auf."
" I keep with a party, to you chains put hat" by the feet; , explained Michael Ignatieff, boss of the liberals, at expiration of the weekly Caucus meeting before the met delegates.
The liberals stated, the bill, which permitted, to hold each of one as to the transport of illegal immigrants identified seagoing vessel coming person up to one year long injure as suggested the Canadian on the right of and freedom condition.
Gilles Duceppe, boss of the Bloc Québécois, suggested likewise not being able to support the bill since it turned against the wrong target group.
" We are against it and it seem that all opposition parties are against it, therefore we will be waiting, which unternimmt" the government; , M. Duceppe explained.
The criticism regarding the immigration question of Olivia Chow, NDP, has the critics pointed from the hand, who demand, their party would behave not steadfast enough opposite the secret immigrants.
" The Neo democrats agree with the fact that one seizes measures against the blind passengers, and evenly we try this by switching of another bill, the C-35, durchzusetzen" , Chow stated.
We do not endorse the bill of the conservative ones from there because it looks for the debt with the refugees and children at least one year hält" long imprisoned; , Chow explained.
The immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of to play with the policy and to ignore the will of the Canadians.
" The Canadians urgently communicate that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal procedures, which concern Canada to the delegates and which the country like a Fußabtreter behandeln."
" They expect that Canada hard measures ergreift" , so the reaction Minister Kenneys.
" The government did not announce any confidence vote concerning its bill, which could have led the country to elections, which would have rejected the government.
A conservative expressed QMI, which government will a vote call up however in relation to the agency, so that each opposing delegate explains itself immediately opposite his voters.
The new unit does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new, standing unit to the fight against corruption and Kollusion on the part of Jean Charest numerous observers demand further the education of a public committee of inquiry to this topic.
Robert Dutil, Minister of public security, stated, this idea does not come from yesterday: Quebec would have consulted already last January New Yorker departments the OF Investigation concerning this topic.
The metropolis orders since 1870 over a standing unit against the corruption.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday surprised more than only one.
One must say to the fact that this measure was not in the slightest discussed on the occasion of the meeting of the standing committee of the Quebecer of police service on 29 October last yearly despite the presence Robert Dutils.
It was not missing also to the fact that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, this announcement " into punkto public security as; from the hat of gezaubertes Kaninchen" as well as " at a table end by right tinkered Lösung" qualified.
Minister Dutil had turned for his part again to those, which fear that political power has too much influence on, the future unit in question.
" They will see the result, if we announce it werden" , it was content to affirm itself.
" One is bewusst." itself this problem;
In accordance with Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, cannot replace the execution of a public inquiry to anything.
" The more M. Charest persisted to want the more become to prevent the education of this committee of inquiry the people like it and I think that it hat" to hide something; , it explained.
" The only means to be able to educate a committee of inquiry is the resignation from Jean Charest" , then for his part Yves Boisvert, lecturer in ethics and politics systems explained to the ENA (staatl. University for the training of high civil servants).
In order to come out from this dead end, it suggests to the Quebec granting to financial test control a special mandate so that can employ these investigations corresponding over corruption and secret arrangements.
" One should be capably, the mandate of test control auszuweiten" , then he decided.
It holds likewise the opinion that the Quebec of test control could grant the same power as commissioners, what it would also permit to obligate the people to the statement.
The education of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the government Charest.
The Quebec of Ottawa likewise to require to amend the penal law in such a way in order to be better to this kind adjusted by crimes.
This demand comes of the senior public prosecutor of the operation Marteau, which informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier about the fact that the jurisdiction is not clear in this kind of the prosecution.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for public security confirmed for his part, its colleague of the law, Rob Nicholson, argues at present with certain, amendments concerned this dossier.
While the operation Printemps 2001, which concerned the groups of the motorcycle policemen, were, 131 persons arrested, although the penal law had not been amended.
Ottawa implemented the law due to its against Gangstertum.
Rivers under strict monitoring
Several river courses remain due to the high precipitation, which poured for Tuesday in some regions of the province, further under strict guard.
Into Shawinigan, in the administrative region Mauricie, came it on Wednesday afternoon to a landslide.
Two houses were preventively evacuated.
In the evening a further landslide in Saint Lin Laurentides has itself, in which administrative region Lanaudiere occurs.
A road collapsed thereby.
From Tuesday on Wednesday evening strong rainfalls from 40 to 70 millilitres precipitation poured on several regions.
Between 20 to 40 further millimeters precipitation according to the regions until Thursday evening were expected here.
The ranges north the river as well as the valley of the region Outaouais were most strongly concerned.
Here altogether up to 100 millimeters of rainstorms had come down.

Dupont partially reprimanded
The Quebecer broadcast moderator Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian supervisory board for broadcast standards (CCNR) because of its controversies expressions over social welfare and Haitianer just like because of its out-due speech way over radio.
The CCNR holds the opinion, M. Dupont and its CHOI 98.1 FM team would have the right to own expression of opinion, however certain expressions would have " inaccurate information about the social welfare and unauthorized negative representations of the Haitianer as well as likewise an in such a manner ungehobelte speech way contain, which do not ist." appropriately the transmissions radiated during the day;
The supervisory board had likewise conclusion-concluded that a discussion over suicide, which contains the spreading of the names of two persons it committed the suicide, against the Kodex of the broadcasting offends.
The CCNR had received several complaints of reference during the comments made in the period of 2008 and 2010 radiated transmissions.
The first order was " due to a complaint; Front commun the personnes assistées sociales you Québec" inserted.
The Aktivistenorganisation had weighted that the amounts specified in the transmission were inaccurate.
The moderators should give rather solidly than misleading information.
Regarding the topic suicide had represented moderator Stéphane Dupont the opinion, is the suicide an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the supervisory board members had drawn the conclusion, the obtained message is here that suicide not when solution may be regarded of life crises.
" The majority of the supervisory board considers that the consequences of the transmission in question " Dupont le midi" a sensitive topic in family-fair and suitable way begun to cut hätten."
Therefore it was occupied with no blame opposite its person.
The last point at issue concerned the statements, which had referred to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean René Dufort had supplied themselves in this connection an medium-effective dispute that a quantity of reactions had caused.
The CHOI moderator had explained in favor of the Haiti assistance to have donated since one would not know with certainty whether the needy ones would also really receive the cash donations.
The supervisory board is the opinion that these comments an abusive character were not that however its cumulative effect presents an unauthorized negative representation of the Haitianer.
" I already abgebüßt." my three-day-long suspending punishment in this thing;
" My document is jungfräulich" for one and a half years; , the moderator explained.
In all resolutions the supervisory board the spreading of a ungehobelten mode of expression prangert on.
In all cases the CHOI-FM broadcast announcer " beyond its Verpflichtungen" acted.
The consequences for the radio station, which should have communicated among other things its decisions uniquely during the main end time within one period of three days, is slightly.
A king of the Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montrealer of Algerian origin, hit a completely special course.
The athlete, which " in; Sanda" (Full contact Kung Fu), in the Kickboxen as well as in the Thaiboxen brilliert, rises now in the search for new challenges to the Tatami and into the Boxringe of the world.
" I begonnen" before 12 years in Algeria with kinds of combat haven such as Kung Fu and Kickboxen; , Zemmal, which resides since 2008 in the metropolis explained, in order to develop itself further among the professionals.
I personally search fight everywhere, since for those, which do not like the Bodenkampf, how the mixed combat arts present him, matches in North America RSR sind."
Recently that of its indication had given working as well as at the company UPS employee to its rival bad pieces of news as a police officer, in whom he achieved delivered world championship of the amateurs two gold medals with between that the 23. and 30 October in Edinburgh, Schottland, of the World of carats as well as the Kickboxing Association (WKA).
" I errungen" the victory in the categories full contact of the Kickboxens and the Thaiboxens; , it explained.
" At present I prepare on the world cup in the San Shou in China vor."
" Those fighters from each category had been invited, itself with the last world championship under the first four hatten." placed;
" I babe 2009 in Toronto bronze geholt."
" 2005 I am geworden." in Viet Nam figure eight;
" 2007 I terminated the tournament in China at the fifth place, while I 2009 in Toronto third nascently bin" , it added.
" It is worth mentioning that I with each match of progress made habe."
" With this rhythm I will become this mark or in the next year first! "
" San Shou" or " Sanda" coming disciplines are from China, with which punches and kicks are permissible just like ground throws.
The duels take place normally on a platform, more rarely in a Boxring.
The most renowned box fighter, who came out from this kind of the combat haven, is the American of vietnamesischen origin Cung Le, which probably admits in the world of the combat arts is.
If Nacer Zemmal should retain only one event in its career, then it was " here with security its presence with the supertournament; King OF Sanda" , the Super Bowl of the Kung Fu, call.
" This match is angesehenste" the highest-ranking and in China; , the pleasant Pound chap explained.
" It is a little like the equivalent to the stadium Lumpinee (the largest stadium of Thailand). "
" That was a super Erfahrung."
Zemmal had won its first fight in the semi-final of its category (80kg), before he lost then in the final.
" That, which defeated me, was a genuine Profi" , then he analyzed.
" There are four fellow combatants per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg). "
" The winners of the semi-finals meet in each case in the final of their category aufeinander."
" Then the winners of each category the forehead are offered, in order to crown only one champion, the king of the Kung Fu."
450 million in contracts without advertisement
Hydraulic Québec granted in mutual agreement project planning companies 450 million dollar at contracts for the water power project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the middle in this avalanche of more than 100 contracts a consortium, consisting of the companies BPR, stands Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which received the most important portion, i.e. that to the direction of the project, to a sum of 295 million dollar without advertisement.
This consortium, mentioned " Énergie gérance" , 2004 as accompaniment of the decision of hydraulic Québec, the private sector its responsibility, this important, to surrender hydraulicelectrical project at height of a sum from 5 billion dollar to formed.
At the beginning of of 2005 ergatterte the consortium " Énergie gérance" the lucrative contract, without it would have given a public advertisement.
For the Parti Québécois represents a falling back to enterprise consortia a serious ethical problem, which causes the risk of the Wettbewerbsverdrändung as well as a price increase.
" This is a new way of a preconcerted play and weakens the Konkurrenz."
" That means that one durchführt" instead of preconcerted plays instead of in secret way now in open form; , yesterday Sylvain Simard, delegate of the PQ explained, on the press conference.
In the early morning Simard had raised the question before the national assembly, because it seems to him with difficulty understandably, how the interest can be served of the public in this way.
Resources minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted in the afternoon after, by placing vehemently in agreement that it would have concerned with the present Treaty a preconcerted play.
" I remain treu" for my line; , it ranted, by encouraging, which was PQ " unredlich" proceeded and it " be missing to it at Härte."
She said, it " is the Mindeste" that the PQ apologizes.
The model of the consortium is world-wide usual practice.
It concerns usually temporally such a limited alliance, which permits it to two or several enterprises to bundle their expert's assessments regarding a requirement on an advertisement for a complex project.
The project " Eastmain" a high complexity level exhibits concerning its work extent.
The building procedure is under way and should until 2012 be set up.
Nevertheless the contract was assigned, without a competition had been able to take place; it had already given negotiations.
Besides the model of the consortium in the Quebec does not represent an exception with relatively simple projects by any means more.
As the newspaper " Le Devoir" last week noted, is the model of the consortium article of government investigations, used within the range of the civil engineer and consulting nature.
Short flying over of the Quebecer of enterprise register makes it possible to designate more than 200 consortia from which some from steady duration to seem to be.
In this way for example the company Dessau in partnership with the majority of their nuclear competitors, among whom CIMA+, Génivar, SNC Lavalin or also Roche and Tecsult rank, co-operates.
Any linkage, and of it gives it several dozen, attributes to the same legal entity, i.e. to Dessau.
Which the consortium " Énergie gérance" it concerns then minister Normandeau stressed that " the territory of the Baie James of special worker dynamics is subjected and that hydraulic Québec this fact zollt" for the 70's in special way calculation;.
Réal Laporte, the large employer of the Société d' énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), made a declaration, which let the nose turn up the fact that the contract was granted over the direction of the project according to agreement.
" If you an advertisement makes and it only few applicants gives, your prices are schnellen." up;
" You have thus two possibilities: either you take the people, on this Mart are and say yourself: one is aushandeln." a satisfying agreement at a good price;
" The thought is however that not the price is crucial, but the expert knowledge of the Personen" , Laporte affirmed.
This the consortium " Énergie gérance" granted contract is part of a long list dollar received from contracts over more than 50.000 of the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved either of the hydraulic Québec or the SEBJ for the project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
After examination the newspaper counted " Le Devoir" more than 100 engineer and consultant contracts, who were granted companies or their branches, under it in particular to resources laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC Lavalin had gerafft 22 contracts, to Génivar 16 had actually received, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without here their participation had " on; Énergie gérance" to take into account.
All the present Treaties were negotiated.
They amount included in the entire to 449,783,344 $, in it the contract with " Énergie gérance" over 295,131,564 $.
Sylvain Simard to mention that the four companies, which form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) had " Parti libéral you Québec probably bekannt" are.
Minister Normandeau had let the PQ be reminiscent, is equally connected with the companies, which she " finanzierten" , before it specified that it concerns rather their high-level personnel.
Barometers verantworungsbewußten consumption - which " grüne" Label is not trust-arousing
The Green, but plainly sceptically.
The Quebecer consumer has little confidence in the main participants of lasting growth, however just as little in the characterized marks or the Öko markings, which are to steer its choice.
Harms, although it bathes in an medium-effective universe, where it teems only in such a way from information in favor of a more reliable consumption: the barometer of reliable consumption has to deplore a lack of reliable information, an inadequacy, which marks itself as brake of its commitment, how the first reading showed, which was held yesterday.
Although they advanced the consumption of the socially compatible products so called in the year 2010, the Quebecer seems to zollen nevertheless those, which try to sell these, little credit.
Two thirds of the Quebecer population admits, indeed the environmental commitment of the companies likewise little faith to give like the green enterprise advertisement, then betrays the measuring instrument thought out of the responsible person consumer center of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another findings: half of the consumers doubts so the barometer the trustworthiness of the official certificates, in addition, the reliability of the products and marks, added to the allegedly fair products, which define themselves as environmentally conscious.
After same sample the discourse of the politicians is seriously taken to this topic of only 14.6% the Quebecer population.
The information regarding responsible consumption seems nevertheless important for the stimulation of this consumer segment, which is encouraged at present by approximately only one third of the Quebecer consumers.
Indeed absorbed emptiness and a doubtful character of the information the eagerness of 46% of the consumers.
This is after the higher price of the products the second, on the part of the barometer identified brake.
In addition a third of the Quebecer of the indicated efficiency of the green products and services, which one is endeavored them to the hand to put, faces distrustfully.
According to another report over half of the consumers in the year 2010 and had predominantly changed the mark one had already changed its habits or several products, in order to give its conviction expression.
According to barometer they had preferred purchases also to 61% with dealers of their city quarter and had favoured the purchase of food cultivated in their region.
The Green and more reliably - the index of the environmentally conscious consumption had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 in this year - the Homo consumus the Quebec loves it to present itself than king recycling that tried, to reduce its traces left in the environment by worrying about the animal protection.
But social and ecological consciousness seems to make nevertheless before its car stop, so the barometer: straight times 28% the Quebecer have to have indicated, in the year 2010 public means of transport to have used or the agency for arranged lifts prefer, in order to demonstrate their ecological interest.
The Zufußgehen as well as the bicycle driving were likewise endorsed of 39,1% the participant of this comprehensive behavior inquiry, which feeds the plate conceptions.
Government loan for the assumption of eXcentris
The Quebecer government, that was requested of the Société Angus as well as the enterprise Parallèle to take part financially in the assumption of the cinema complex eXcentris explains itself in agreement with a co-operation, however only in form of a competitive loan.
The developer company Angus as well as the enterprise Parallèle, which had expected a donation at a value of seven million dollar of the ministry for education and cultural for the assumption of the Daniel Langlois of belonging cinema complex eXcentris on the boulevard Saint Laurent, in order to surrender these again to its actual cineastischen function, obviously do not receive, which they required.
The government accepted to involve itself in this thing however on its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation the Quebecer government offers rather a loan in smaller than the initially expected height, which could bring an able to exist solution on favourable conditions into being, at least according to opinion of the sources entnehmbaren from the national rumor-mongers.
A first plan of action as well as an inquiry after 12.8 million were rejected already last spring of the Quebec, that request for asking since that were again hum-moderately downward corrected.
A proposal as well as a plan of action of the president were already " Société de développement the entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, at minister St-Pierre transmission, who leads the document eXcentris.
Several days ago it had given to her a last special report.
The counter proposal of the cabinet was conveyed the SODEC however on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus have now by 31 December time to answer to these.
Anyhow the premise of the state donation seems to have been really pushed to the side.
We call ourselves in memory that the Quebecer owner community of the cinemas and cinema complexes had revolted itself against a direct state investment for the support of the assumption of eXcentris, by stating the argument, to carry out the Secretary of cultural affairs has no financial assistance for real estate projects there which he had given not also different cinema halls.
Several other market players of the segment complained however in contrast to it substantial, economic assistance.
Cinema boss Daniel Langlois had presented the author cinema in the premises of his cinema complex after the self-financed construction of the cinema over ten years long under large difficulties, which could justify the exception position on the part of the treasury.
The lack of cinema halls, which show independent films, is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris its clientele knew to hold with the bar.
The Société Angus as well as the enterprise Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the point, heads for their part a privately financed Campagne, from which they expect a sum 700,000 $, in order to set the acquisition in motion.
For the spring 2009 only one canvas continues showing films in eXcentris i.e. Le Parallèle.
A goal of the future Erwerber is " it, the three cinema halls on 27 February next yearly with the demonstration of the film very much succeeded of Xavier Beauvois; The hommes et dieux" again to open.
Christian Yaccarini however " the newspaper; Le Devoir" not recalled and one ignores, what he and its group of the proposals corrected downward hold, which one made for them.
Secret complex-vibrated Canada ventilated
The new, American diplomat lines, which were spread by WikiLeaks, air the secret over what the United Nations under the inferiority complex of the Canadians judge opposite the Americans; they reveal however with the same impact the superiority feeling latter opposite Canada.
Therefore the American diplomats are surprised at the fact that the Canadian voter does not have the Canadian-American relations in the sense with the ballot, and they believe that the visit of president would have Obama the conservative government helped to implement their budget of 2009!
The four new reports between the American message in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly spread yesterday, offer still more spicy details than bare substantial contents, at which one has to nibble.
From 22 September 2008 dating a connection, i.e. in the period, in which the federal choice coming PAGE was present in the full course, reports on it, starting from which point the United Nations do not take part no more in the employments discussed by their political bosses.
To the large astonishment of David Wilkins, the American Ambassador used in Ottawa.
Mr. Wilkins offers different explanation possibilities of this situation.
" The Canadians an almost inherent inferiority complex conditionally compelled possibly the Canadian to push over political high-level personnel much rather to speak about internal points of issue of the everyday life as the United States Peter black with this choice (like 1988 with the campaign over the free trade) " , then he describes.
The United Nations, then he concludes, is thus " the proverbial Goliath of this choice: omnipräsent, but sprechen" potentially too threateningly, over from it to;.
The Ambassador understands these " deafening Stille" the less, since the two countries preserve intensive political and economic relations.
" Logischerweise" , then he evaluates, " it should be the ability of a candidate, a party still much and more a party chief for leading such a essential relationship, which the voter hat." with the going to the polls as key factor in the sense;
The other expression of this feeling of importance reads itself in on 22 January 2009 report sent by Terry Breese, representative in Ottawa, the president Barack Obama for its first visit in Ottawa to prepare is.
" Their journey to help to ensure a continuing of the government with the confidence vote over the Federal Budget at the beginning of of February at which Canada will announce its first deficit after more than one decade, due to a stimulation program at a value of 30 to 40 billion dollar developed ist" , Breese describes.
Anywhere he had not mentioned that the government had had to postpone the sitting of parliament before Christmas, in order to prevent that the parliament was fallen by the coalition and in such a way caused continuing of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the suggested stimulation program.
And on the part of Ambassador Wilkins written report Washington informs, from January 2008 dating further from the ever more negatively becoming picture that, the dramatic series of the United States, radiated over CBC, spread.
The Ambassador is concerned about transmissions such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which one little subtle allusions at Maher Arar, which " NO-Fly-List" or also to removals for the purpose of through muscle-show off the CIA of accomplished hearings to observe can.
Again another report reports in detail how Hillary Clinten asked with its French colleagues Berne pool of broadcasting corporations Kouchner with their first bilateral meeting for it, whether Europe is ready, certain prisoners from Guantanamo to take up.
Mr. Kouchner is to have answered the question with, however on the basis of an individual " Case to Fall" - Decision.
Àm end of the meeting, then descriptive, " he handed a paper to the state secretary out in puncto Omar Khadr, a 15-jährigen Muslims Canadian Ursprungs."
" The Secretary of State assured, the document again durchzusehen."
We finally still mark that the mind heats up regarding the web page WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, an older and Stephen Harper very closely standing advisor, had explained over CBC that for this solid leakage the responsible persons " umgebracht" will should.
It had reported here on Mike Huckabee from the United States.
World-wide plan for the renewal of the lighting
The UN yesterday suggested trade and industry in 100 countries in Cancun a plan for the renewal of the lighting of households, regarding the achievement of a decrease of the greenhouse gas (FCKW), to which almost to a third to the additional reduction corresponds, which must be realized, in order to stabilize the earth climate until 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the step of the concrete large-scale projects, which the UN in Cancun hopes to convert, in order to compensate the absence of compelling reduction obligations of the industrialized countries.
After the plan brought forward yesterday that would be avoided main problem in form of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of the FCKWs delivered due to the lighting on earth, if the white-hot pears, which represent so far still another monopoly from 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better still, by light emitting diodes (LED).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the world-wide emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the world-wide vehicle park.
In Copenhagen last year the large exhaust memo ducks like the United States, China, and others, under what also Canada counted, had committed themselves Europe to voluntary reduction plans, which should down-screw the global FCKW emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
From this balance one would have to take however still 5 Gt off, in order to stabilize today up to the year 2020 the climatic rise around 2 degrees Celsius, in order to prevent that this gets out of control.
In the white-hot pears 95% of the energy escape in the form of warmth, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact phosphor pears the energy consumption reduces by 75%, with the new LED bulbs reduces one this power requirement again by the double.
The compact phosphor pears hold on average between 6000 to 10.000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, as for example those, which the manufacturer Philips brought this week on the market - this society by the way participated in the UN study - to have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and use 80% less energy than a white-hot pear, which obtain a suggestion of the saving possibilities of the replacing plan, which is to be used in 100 countries.
Apart from the fact that iese completely new bulbs deliver only very little warmth, it can function it also with an adjustable resistor.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists pointed out that compact phosphor pears exhibit reserves, since them mercury to contain and that one must dispose of it therefore as special refuse, which is not always possible in the developing countries except the producers makes available an assumption place.
The main source at mercury emissions on the planet does not represent the compact phosphor pear according to the report however, but rather the coal-fired power stations, which discharge substantially more mercury, in order to produce the electricity wasted by the white-hot pears.
However in the United States these coal-fired power stations discharge 25.000 tons mercury annually.
The report states details the profits, which would gain each country owing to this international program.
Indonesia would save so for example a billion dollar annually with the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, that means an equivalent of 3,5 coal-fired power stations, whose building Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion.
The Ivory Coast expects excited the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon " unverzügliche" Publication of the results of the presidential election of the Ivory Coast directly after their expiration demanded.
" The Secretary-General underlines the necessity for the independent electoral committee, their work too received and the provisional results without further delay bekanntzugeben" , then a press spokesman of the UN boss stressed.

About the president of the CEI on the television had confirmed forty minutes before expiration that the commission " with the work fortfahren" will, in order to announce the results.
On Wednesday multiples of calls became loud from the whole world, the separating Laurent Gbagbo nevertheless the CEI may proclaim the name of the winner of the second choice round under from the office finally and its Opponenten Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo camp counts however on the cancellation of " betrügerischen" Castings of votes in the north by the condition advice, which were obtained by the ex rebel camp of the Forces of nouvelles (FN) during in September 2002 the putsch failed.
Pascal Affi N' Guessan, director/conductor of the presidency campaign of the Ivory Coast, had confirmed that the maneuvers practiced on the part of the FN for the intimidation of the voters in the north of the country had deterred the supporters of the president to go to the choice.
The entire choice could be cancelled, if the complaints inserted by Gbagbo are considered by the condition advice.
The Gbagbo contractors are however now more the opinion that the highest Court of Justice of the country is not neutral, there it from Paul Yao N' Dré, one with Gbagbo connected is led politically closely.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the north, which abstreitet jedwede connection to the ex rebels, " the delay with announcing the election results as; unannehmbar" judged and Gbagbo asked to respect these even if it did not go so far to call the victory in.
Its Bündnisparter affirm, Gbagbo block the publication of the results, since it knows that it lost; to submit and a complaint before the constitutional court, after one prevented the electoral committee to publish the results seie illegaly.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday for the coronation/culmination of the combination and reconciliation process of a country were held, which was split into two parts over years.
The United Nations had warned the politicians of the Ivory Coast on Wednesday before it, them could be kept responsible for these in case of of possible excesses.
Laurent Gbagbo had brought the first choice round on 31 October with 38% of the voices opposite the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, which enjoyed the public support of the former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round), as a leading candidate behind itself.

Affair Clotilde tear: the Elysée palace exaggerates its intermediary function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 until May 2010, the fate of Clotilde held tears, for a young French Forscherin, which " in Iran because of; Spionage" , the French public in breath was held, shifted the diplomacy in alert stand-by and accented the degradation of the relations between Paris and Teheran.
All of this under attentive views of the diplomats of the United States.
Of WikiLeaks the received and from the newspaper " Le Monde" examined American documents give some background to this crisis price.
They describe, how the Elysée had explained to the Americans its strategy, who went so far, this pieces of advice as handling their own crisis of " Geiselnahmen" to give in Iran (a small group of ramblers).
They point out, like the French responsible persons tried to convince Washington of the fact that the freeing of the young Frenchwoman does not have the release of Majid Kakavand, in France an imprisoned held and of the American law due to trade with material Iranian looked for in favor of the Iranian nuclear program to the Gegeleistung.
Finally they set the way, with which the French presidency tried to manipulate the media for the purpose to make for these the idea convincing the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad have a central role with the freeing from Clotilde tear played, into a sharp light.
In truth he had done nothing in this regard.
On 12 August 2009 into of Paris drawn up diplomat telegram carries the title " Iran: French comments on the way of handling Geiselnahmen."
François Richier, Elysée advisor in strategy questions, conversed accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director Quai of the d' Orsay for North Africa and the middle Orient with the American Diplomatin Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method to her.
Those guessed/advised the Americans to set everything in order to reconduct their own citizens, who were held by force in Iran.
" Power Lärm" , they said, " articulated loud and clearly and without Unterlass" the words " Grundmenschenrechte" , " Unschuld" , " immediate Freilassung" in the media.
This is necessary, in order to bring the Iranian regime in embarrassment, which pays attention very sensitively to its image.
" This does not operate all the more, particularly since the Iranians ask you, that too tun."
Because " Silence solves nichts" , past the discussion attempts over on inconspicuous way, which is Iranians " Master in Ausweichmanövern."
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners one " common, Iranian Taktik" is: " Taking of hostages for the purpose of political Erpressung."
He announces, the release of Clotilde tears from the prison (on 16 August to come should, on the day, to it into the French message takes refuge) " require the payment of a large sum of money to the Iraner" (230.000 euros bail).
And it lets the Elysée antizipiere further takings of hostages, a phenomenon, which " announce; are intensified wird."
The Iranians could " arrest in the near future another that approximately 1.800 French citizens, who leben" in Iran; , then he said.
28. August 2009.
Clotilde tear is twelve days ago from the prison dismisses, however further in Iran one holds.
Information was in circulation brought: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose distribution the united states demand due to illegal trade with sensitive electronics material to Iran, is after decision of a judge in Paris from the detention dismisses.
The American message places itself, like numerous other observers, questions over this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which pursues the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of for the nuclear program planned material, the release of Majid Khakavand represents a bad piece of news.
Did France accept an horse trade?
The freeing of the Iranian against that the Frenchwoman?
On the occasion of a renewed conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September insures François Richier that this is not the case.
The Elysée, then he says, was not " only; completely surprises from the resolution of the Richters" , but also tried to revolt itself against it.
" It gegeben" one to move exchange between the French presidency and the French Minister of Justice; (at present Michèle Alliot Marie), but " the French government does not know the judicial decision ändern" , it explains.
Mr. Richier would like to also point out that Majid Kakavand " further under; strenger" Supervision of the French secret service stands.
The Elysée advisor selects a telephone number, puts, informed then the American Diplomatin, which " Iranians; would be at present in the buildings led by the Iranian message in Paris."
During the safekeeping of Clotilde do not tear in Iran preserves the Elysée his efforts, by means of announcements and from the media more organized " Fluchtversuche" believe to make, the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad plays one " wichtige" and " influential Mittlerrolle."
The Americans observe this activity not without irony and state that the manipulation carries fruits, since several press articles reflect the official French version.
From 25 August 2009 dating telegram swears to " medium lightning of the French Behörden" up.
On which so much is based " Dankesbezeugung" opposite Mr. Assad, those asks itself Paris message.
" Despite its explanations full praise price the French authorities admit secretly that they have only a vague notion of it, which haben" the Syrier actually done;.
The document is concerned then with the reasons, which brought the Elysée to it, this fiction to purge.
The intensive communication efforts " at it off, Sarkozys politics of the opening aims opposite Syria too bestätigen" , it analyzes.
2008 launched politics, which " at that time; from numerous critic voices in France as well as abroad as premature and undeservedly perception wurde."
" The Syrian role aufbauschend" Paris tries " To lead Syria before eyes, which commendation one can obtain, by spielt" a constructional role in the region;.
A goal is " it in addition; Discord between Syria and Iran too säen."
The American message knows this on good authority.
On 11 August François Richier had entrusted it: " of course we do not know whether the Syrier whatever made haben."
" But we bedankt." ourselves despite everything with them;
" This should at least confusion with the Iranians stiften."
Clotilde tear turns to 16. May 2010 to France back.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in the Elysée.
In a Kommuniqué it thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their " active role in favor of the release of our Landsmännin."
No on-line plays for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government is mentioned " a law; the Aschenbrödel" discharge, which will forbid it to the young person to play after midnight on-line Games by closing them the access, then suggested government responsible person.
A bill, which is to request on-line play operators to refuse to young people under 16 years after midnight the access to these plays is submitted to the parliament in December, described representatives of cult US and family Ministries.
" Many children play this Games the throughout night and then difficulties with learning at school and also thereby, a normal life during the day too führen."
" We are too gewährleisten" the opinion that this law is necessary, around their health and their right to sleep; , Jo Rin explained, with this bill of Ministerialbeauftragter entrusted of the French press agency Agence France Presse.
On-line Games is accessible thereafter again starting from 6 o'clock in the morning.
The manufacturer companies would have one year long time to prepare for the application of the law then it specified.
The government fasser likewise in the eye to ask the manufacturers to down-screw that on daily for the access to these plays granted time limit that young people whose parents ask for it, added the responsible person.
It will put likewise free programs to those persons, who wish it, at the disposal, which make it possible to limit the time spent in the Internet.
South Korea is " one to usually; vernetzten" Countries, and the newspapers report regularly of different events connected with intensive Internet use.
In addition the country is unquestioned champion in world-wide on-line Game competitions.
In November South Korea had achieved four gold medals in the World Cyber Games in relation to 58 further nations.
World championship 2018-2022: the FIFA appoints the sponsor country
In bright excitement due to corruption suspicion the executive committee of the FIFA appoints the sponsor countries of the world championships on Thursday 2018 and 2022, a most political choice, with which the Rangeln around influence as well as the Lobbying the technical criteria threaten into the background to urge.
A thing is however safe: the expenditure 2018 of the king discipline of the FIFA becomes in Europe, their traditional center, takes place (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain Portugal, Netherlands Belgium).
The edition 2022 will then exotically fail somewhat; the international football federation hopes to be able to win after the premiere on the African continent in the year 2010 new territories (Qatar, Australia) for itself or its address in the United States or in the Far East (Japan to pursue South Korea) further.
The list of the personalities, those to the delegation associated (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Netherlands head of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political employment of a world championship.
The machinations behind the scenes threaten to continue thus up to the last minute.
With difficulty otherwise to set up a hierarchy of the candidates.
According to the evaluation report of the FIFA, English, Spanish Portuguese offer (2018) and American (2022) document bessseren arguments as those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so weighty for the 22 members of the Exekutifkommitees for the hour of the choice.
The Sunday Times, which stood with causing suspending two members of the Exekutifkommitees (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the exposures, could have ruined just as well the chances for its own country, cradle of the football, which was allowed to deliver only once the world championship, i.e. 1966.
The BBC had on Monday again the fertile soil given, by having document-workarranged radiated one, the three influential members of the Kommitees, i.e. Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou under bombardment takes.
Reason of enough to annoy the FIFA and to bring the English responsible persons in embarrassment, who had operated an intensive Lobbying primarily with David Cameron in these last weeks.
The head of government hopes for a new edition of the chess move succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, which had obtained the organization of the Olympic Games 2012 in the year 2005 for London.
Would this intensive employment be sufficient, in order to revalue the image of England before the committee again?
Nothing is less safe, because it is not missing to the duo Spain Portugal at Trümpfen with its already finished stages, its expert's assessment (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial negative sides of the two countries could absorb their ambitions.
The possible Repressalien against the Englishmen as well as the doubts about solvency of Spain and Portugal let the chances of Russia, which became despite its gaps in the dossier (stages, hotel, transport) the weighty outsider, rise.
Prime minister Vladimir Putin decided however, the unumwundenen suggestion on the accusing of the English press " an unfair competition in the preparation of the Abstimmung" denounced on the part of the Kommiteemitglieder.
" One throws it with dirt, one tried, her too kompromittieren" , Putin ranted.
For 2022 the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994 seem to be the logical favorites.
First economic world power, seat of the FIFA Hauptsponsoren, the country seems to exhibit a long list of advantages opposite Japan and South Korea, which set up a very beautiful project separately.
But these new candidacies seem premature for two countries, which had along-organized the matches in the year 2002.
Another threat: of the FIFA hot desired grant of the WM 2026 for China, which the Asian chances on 2022 become void to let.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all registers with offering futuristic stages, the FIFA pursues its expansion toward new areas, however these two countries represent a larger risk, because certainty.
Australia could have to suffer just like Japan and South Korea under the weakness of the coverage right (due to the Zeitverschiebung), akquittierten by the European countries, the sensitive nerve of the FIFA.
Second mandate: the obviousness
De Gaulle had really gestutzt.
Center in the middle of had let believe that it stutze.
Valéry Giscard d' Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show smallest hesitating.
And Nicolas Sarkozy still less than these.
A mandate in the Elysée calls for the next.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in the year 2012.
But the obviousness stands for the side of the Mysteriums, which adheres to the presidency function, not well to face.
Thus one must do in such a way, as if the doubt would exist from now on.
In the one, as also in the other sense.
2006 gave the supporters of Jacques Chirac, a third mandate is impossible, without believing even in it.
On 15 November insured Nicolas Sarkozy in serious clay/tone, its decision " sometime in the autumn of the yearly 2011" to meet.
That it on Tuesday evening in the Elysée before UMP parliamentarians the perspective of " two Mandaten" be reminiscent would let, little Fieberhaftigkeit had therefore spread.
Was that the official announcement of its candidacy?
Far been missing.
The president let remind only of the fact that the constitutional amendment limits the number of five-year office periods of 2008 to only two.
It did not make an statement, an announcement.
It is not the first time that it mentions the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous clay/tone.
" You at worst still seven one half year with me, or bestenfalls" , it explained to them in July 2009.
On a new in May 2010: " It does not believe that I over the phase thereafter does not nachdenke."
Its words from the day before yesterday do not make it for no more the candidate than the day before; in addition, not less.
If they should cause comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidacy with HP on a side.
The admission of the competition with Ségolène Royal, whom Nicolas Sarkozy drives to it, is however not to be revealed.
On the contrary, it is its obvious candidacy in the year 2012, which admonishes many members of HP more promptly than accepted to the challenge.
The bad inquiries on the other side.
The first time the voters became that rights a candidacy of François Fillon by Nicolas of the Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to inquiry of the BVA-L' Express) prefer.
" We have a candidate, and it gives with the UMP no discussions darüber" , directly and carefully the surrounding field of the prime minister reacted.
" If it would find a defeat as possible, it would not be Kandidat" , Jean-Pierre Raffarin communicates.
" It in it to always believe, triumph too können" , corrects Alain Juppé, which resigned itself to the obviousness.
Euro: the EZB is compelling to maintain their purchases of government stocks
The last meeting of the central bank council of the EZB last year should offer possibilities to opportunity point out, how one comes out from the crisis, or at least the arrangement of a large number at unorthodox measures of the monetary policy to announce, the end of the yearly to its conclusion to come be supposed.
The crisis of the European national indebtedness obligated, the central bank in Frankfurt can not afford without a doubt, also the today's it to incurr the loss more than strained situation on the European bond markets in order not to cause their aggravation.
The political costs thereby would be by far too high.
The French financial minister Christine Lagarde had yesterday welcomed taken, active role on the occasion of a press conference of the EZB in favor of the solution of the national budget indebtedness of Europe.
She did not dare to say, whether she the opinion is, the central bank can still more do, for example by setting in motion of her program of the purchases in motion of government loans.
" I keep my considerations for my European trade partners before (...) ."
Jean-Claude Trichet, Präsident of the EZB had not pointed himself the day before to Brussels on the occasion of his hearing by the economic and monetary committee of the European parliament very talk-turned concerning his projects, but rather it is content to point out that the program of the purchases of government stocks on the secondary market " weiterbetrieben" and that we at the meeting on Thursday " will see, like the decisions ausfallen."
Only certainty: The EZB will leave its key interest unchanged with 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice the obligation purchases of the vault were doubled of the EZB last week on approximately 1.35 billion euros.
And according to indiscretions of some dealers it is to have transacted new purchases at Irish and Portuguese government stocks yesterday.
Altogether the central banks of the euro system made for May 2010 purchases at a value of 67 billion euros.
Among the dealers the anticipation of further pursuing the buying rate is not under any circumstances doubted (see page 29).
The political economists expect already no more remarkable change of course.
If the loan business of over three months will have disappeared already from the arsenal of the EZB, the latter will create itself still at the unrestricted fund reserves in freigiebige kind will make, during one period of one week up to three months.
The political economists make themselves already today calm on the fact that this measure will expand still by some months.
" I cannot imagine that the EZB amends its program to substantial kind wird."
" Otherwise it was in the short term too provozieren" the risk to be received, new tensions; , then Michael Schubert assumes, Volkswirt of the Commerzbank.
" , A progressive exit intended for the process of the first quarter 2011 seems to me wahrscheinlicher" , for his part Norbert Bräms, political economist antizipiert with Sal.
Oppenheim.
Within the range of its interventions on the market of the national indebtedness " the EZB should upright-hold such a purchase volume by obligations, which belebt" the slow-acting market; , Norbert Bräms adds.
Considering the relevance of the exposed position of the European banks on the markets of the national indebtedness in the Eurozone the central bank does not have other choice to maintain than their presence on the market.
" It must step at each price to the Steller of the investors lacking on the market and in such a manner act, around shoots forward enthusiasm for the net yields paid to the weakest states too verhindern" , yesterday an important debenture holder testified.
Because if the interest rates set to the high-altitude flight, the states were prevented still more to reduce or also only stabilize their indebtedness.
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
The government Berlusconi goes into Italy into covering
After a week beginning worrying for Italy the situation relaxed yesterday with the decrease of the hitting a corner interest on 10 years a little.
A return to deceitful satisfying.
At the end of the meeting with the minister of economics the region chairmen Giulio Tremonti the situation had " as; unentzifferbar" qualify and it with one " unvorhersagbaren" Heard weekend count, what the concerning however immediately disclaimed.
On Tuesday the shears with the German interest rates would anyhow have reached its record of 210 base points, and the prices of the contracts for the covering of the bankruptcy risk had risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain Kopflosigkeit in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out at his Council of Ministers that the discrepancy of Spain is to the German interest rates about 400 base points.
Its right hand, Gianni Letta, had " itself however as; heavily besorgt" of " Marktturbulenzen" and a possible infection danger from direction Ireland expressed.
" The good message is that Italy, which ist." third national economy of the Eurozone, not like Greece or Ireland;
" The bad piece of news is that Italy ist" such as Portugal; , Irwin Stelzer, political economist at the Hudson of institutes explains.
In the plain language is called that, its problem is the absence of economic growth and control inlets exerted by it and the shrink-addicted, which bring the state in danger not to be able to cover its financing need any longer.
The last Brussels prognoses were a cold shower for the government.
In the future an Italian growth of 1,1% in the year 2011 and of 1,4% in the year 2012 expected... although the household budget available with the senate for examination on 1,3% and/or 2% counts.
Under these conditions, then the European Commission calculates, the budgetary deficit in the next year still 4.3% of the Gross Domestic Product will constitute (against of the governments predicted 3.9%) and 3.5% in the year 2012 (instead of 2,7%).
From there also the riot around a new household collective, which could be used after the holidays to a sum of 7 billion euros.
" If necessary, new economy measures must moved werden" , chartered accoutant Olli Rehn means.
To the hour Italy receives the support of international institutions.
" The foundation of of Italy economics are correct and its accounts are regular, that already repeat we since long Zeit" , insures Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, which is entrusted with Italy with the IWF.
" At this moment there are no problems, neither on short term, nor on long-term view, there of Italy despite its high indebtedness (119.2% of the Gross Domestic Product in the year 2011, A.D. R.) smaller Stabilisationsfortschritte to be demanded than of other Ländern" , jetty observes Carlo Padoan, chief political economist of the OECD.
The question about the political unsteadiness remains.
On 14 December Silvio Berlusconi a motion of no confidence of the chamber of deputies to be faced with, due to those preferred the elections at the end of March be already organized could.
It is approaching thus a little favorable period for an adoption of resolutions regarding a heavy crisis.
Europeans think about the development of the anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde had expressly emphasized it still yesterday in the context of a press conference in Paris: " I believe, one it still on Sunday afternoon as well as on evening proved: The Europeans hold clearly, are ready and committedly, their currency as well as their currency area together too verteidigen."
Although perfectly relative - the departure with the interest rates of the European state obligations, registered yesterday, was water on the mills of the governments as well as the EZB.
From a beginning of normalization however yet the speech cannot be.
The Rating agency standard & Poor' s had announced, she knew the debt note of Portugal, which probably most effective target of the speculators nowadays, to lower.
" As in May exists a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which particularly lastet" on the bank systems; , so the opinion of the political economists of the Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, particularly " the political time many more slowly passes than those the Märkte."
The European countries, which are probably conscious both to this gap and the danger, which hide themselves therein, intensify the discussions for the reinforcement of the already existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal consultation between the Ministers of Finance most directly concerned and in the broader sense with their Gegenübern of the G20 precedes well.
And this also in view to the meetings of Eurogroupe and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The EZB meets today.
On the plan the lot of the unorthodox measures stands for the back stabilization of the countries of the Eurozone in the hair cross of the markets (see below).
Which concerns the European Union stability funds, then their Executive Director Klaus Regling already began his Asia route on Tuesday in Singapour, in order to inform the investors in the Far East about the developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If a goal of its visit is not express Fundraising, then it surely prepares to it the terrain for this.
The first expenditures for who paper on the part of the European Union stability fund are intended for next month.

Portugal and Spain, the countries in first row, get ready to for their part, structural reforms, to transfer in particular in the range of the job market organization.
Reforms, which are added to the economy measures, however effects in more near future to show are.
Lisbon and Madrid another way follow, than this Greece and Ireland did.
Both is to the one, and the other one at each price to avoid to have to request international assistance before they set up and over inevitable structural reforms decided their own budget-corrective, which to them in the long term the confidence returns.
The European financial sources again converse about the options the available, in order to accelerate the normalization process of the markets from government loans to.
Axel Weber, which was on 24 November on the through journey in Paris, as the first the idea out had brought that if the 750 did not mobilize billions euros by Europe and the International Monetary Fund enough would be, then the union would not hesitate to reach again into the own bag.
The political economists of Barclays Capital, regarding the market of the European national indebtedness completely in the foreground standing participant, judge, an extension of around the 100 billion euros to be sufficient, were " vorzugsweise" in form of a direct liquidity syringe.

An adviser, which has all chances, attentively in the European capitals to be examined.
Above all, if the market conditions intensify.
Snow and ice: 24 sections in uncertainty phase orange
The snow episodes draw still traffic difficulties, in particular in the secondary transportation network of Brittany and threaten to impair different restaurant activities.
Twenty-four sections are now in uncertainty phase orange due to the threatening snow and ice risk.
The regions your, Eure-et-Loir, Deux Sèvres and Vienne were added themselves already the 20 sections in uncertainty phase orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later at the night.
According to Météo France, affect the intensive snow showers the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows easily on et Ile-de-France.
In the sections concerned Schneedecken are expected from 2 to 5 cm, also in parts from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in that Paris region.
The regions Charente, Charente maritime one, Côtes d' are concerned; Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions bass normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snows are considerably enough, in order to cause and certain restaurant activities impair Verkehrsbehinderungen, forecast Météo France.
In the region Côtes d' Armor are closed several regional roads for the heavy traffic of over 7,5 tons, among them the traffic axles Guingamp Lannion and Saint Brieuc Loudéac.
The traffic conditions of the secondary transportation network in Brittany are very difficult according to the traffic policemen, who advise against to use the own vehicle only in the emergency, and the employment of some TER touring buses was painted the entire day over.
In the Picardie school traffic was waived for Thursday.
For the heavy traffic at Wednesday evening no specific limiting measures were planned.
The prefecture " the drivers demand to highest caution on the roads as well as for the appropriate adjustment of their handling auf."
The central management for civilian aviation (DGAC) requested the airlines to paint on Thursday 25% to their from Paris airport the Roissy and 10% from Orly starting flights due to the expected, strong snows.
The DGAB recommends to the flight passengers to contact their airline.
The airports Gatwick in the south of London as well as the airport in Edinburgh, Schottland, are closed until Thursday mornings.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate is around the modernization of the traffic economy on the Ile-de-France in full course, it rains billions.
At least in the discussions.
One calls oneself here in particular the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris in memory, which by the Société you Grand Paris to be built is.
In order to initiate the commencement of construction of the SGP, the state proclaimed a capital donation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical pattern this is the sum, which the SGP would then make possible to lend on the markets a part the financial sum to their double one.
Today it finally came to first computer forecasts.
The additional budget examined of 2010, this morning of the finance committee of the national assembly, contains the intended measures, in order to apply the first part of these funds.
It concerns here two different measures: the creation of a special tax to Erschließund and a higher taxation of the offices on Ile de France.
First, then one takes article 15 of the bill, goes " in favor of the public institute Société you Grand Paris."
This is numbered: " The product of this tax amounts on 117 million euros per Jahr."
Zweitere is a re-organization of the enterprise taxation already existing: " in order to modernize these to increase by from its product and this increase of the Société you Grand Paris too überantworten" itself;.
How much would that bring in?
A mystery.
This sum is not numbered in the text.
Of the 4 billion one is far.
" It is implemented that fiscal resources are included to the 4 billion euros of the capital donation, by the state are applied and the Société you the Grand Paris gradually for the project performed werden" , then is to be taken from the explaining statement.
With the SGP finds one this system not at all anstößig.
" Since the instant, in which one books incomes (the two taxes, D.), One can cover project engineering for R. over three years long and then only from the 4 billion schöpfen" , then one explains.
" This is noted in the budget and abgezogen" gradually;.
The SGP estimates that 2013 will be begun to note the 4 billion for the budget 2014.
This measure, whose 4 promised billions one will be able to look for still for a long time, runs the risk, a quite induced to cause parliamentary discussion.
The first public meeting takes place on 7 December.
Rachsüchtige hacker and emsige spies
The affair WikiLeaks has a double meaning.
On a side it emerged as obvious scandal, a scandal, which is only a scandal in the Sinner hypocrisy, those the Beziehunge between the states, which citizen and the press govern.
On the other side she announces profound changes on international level, and gives a foretaste on the future dominated by involution.
But we proceed in sequence.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that everyone of a secret service consists provided document (an x-arbitrary nation) exclusively of newspaper cuttings.
" außerordentlichen" , American exposures over the sexual habits Berlusconis throw nothing else off as what one got to anyway read over months in each x-arbitrary journal (except those, whose owner is Berlusconi), and that frightening karikaturierte profile Gaddafis offered Kabarettkünstlern already since long time material for their Sketche.
The rule, according to which the secret dossiers may consist only of already well-known pieces of news, is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go into a library, which dedicates itself to esotherischen publications, you will recognize that each work (over the Gral, which Mysterium of Rennes le Chateau, those Templer or the Rosenkreuzler) accurately repeats, what in previous works were already written.
That comes along not alone that the author of okkulter texts does not want to publish searches (still from there that he would not know, where pieces of news would be over the non--existing thing to be found), but because those, which dedicate themselves to the Okkultismus, believe in nothing differently than, what they already know and confirm, what they already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
Likewise the secret documents.
The informant is lazy, and putridly (or limited spirit) also the boss of the secret service (otherwise it could whatever be, for example editor with Libération) is, which judges only as true, which he recognizes.
The Top Secret information about Berlusconi, which had sent the American message in Rome to the state department, was the same as those, which Newsweek had already published the week before.
Was such why thus made waiving around the exposures of these dossiers?
On a side these that already knows each educated person, mean that the messages - at least since end of the Second World War and since then also the heads of government mutually to call to be able themselves or an airplane to take be able, in order to meet with dinner - their diplomatic function to have lost and, with exception of some small tasks of representation, in espionage centers to have transformed.
Any spectator of investigation films knows this very exactly, and it does not happen from hypocrisy that one does in such a way, this to ignore.
Nevertheless: the fact to repeat it publicly injures the task of the hypocrisy and serves to set the American diplomacy into a bad light.
In second place: The idea that an x-arbitrary hacker can tap the secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world, saves the substantial impact against the prestige of the state department.
Besides the scandal brings the victims less, than rather " Scharfrichter" in distress.
But we dedicate ourselves its that happened to deep nature.
Formerly, to Orwells times, one could bundle all power bread ago like a Big, for each gesture of its subjects controlled.
Orwells prophecy could itself have put since then as perfectly correctly, where one can control each movement owing to the telephone, each transacted transaction, the visited hotel out, the selected motorway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
If one leads oneself however before eyes, which runs off today that even the secret crypts of power cannot escape from no more control of a hacker, then the Kontrollgang stops being on one side arranged and becomes zirkelförmig.
Power controls each citizen, but each citizen, or at least the hacker - chooses as Rächer of the citizen -, can get to know the secrets to power.
How however can a power hold itself, which is not any more able, their own secrets to protect?
It is correct, George Simmel said already that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can be never revealed); it is likewise true that jedwede knowledge of the character Berlusconis or Merkels is free in the reason a secret from Geheimis, since it surrenders the public sphere; but in styles of WikiLeaks to reveal that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means, to rob she of any power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel injustice, however on the other hand to Clinton and Obama.
What will the consequences of this offense be, which was caused to a so enormous power?
It is obvious that the states will place in the future no reserved information more on-line ones - that would equal a notice glued to at the street corner.
But it is just as obvious that it is with the current technologies in vain to hope to be able to keep confidential reports secret over telephone.
Nothing is being found out more simply than whether and when a head of state in an airplane moved and contacted one of its colleagues.
How in the future could private and only relations intended for certain ears be maintained?
I very probably know that my forecast sounds novelful for the moment after Science Fiction and, but I do not see myself forced to present to me the government agents in secret way emsig on uncontrollable routes of march moving, their reports anywhere differently than beyond that in the bare memory with carrying, and the few written information, which got her, in the shoe paragraph hiding.
The information would be stored in only copy in locked drawers: in the reason the espionage attempt of Watergate less success had to register, than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology progresses nowadays like a cancer, i.e. backwards.
One century after the wireless Telegraf communication had revolutionized, reconstructs the Internet a Telegrafen with (telephone) wire.
(Similar) the video cassettes for the film researchers had made possible to explore a film volume for volume by reeling from the rear forward and all secrets of the assembly air knew, while (numeric) the CD make nowadays nothing else possible to jump as from chapter to chapter thus in macro portions.
With the high-speed courses one drives within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this requires three and a half hours by airplane including transferring.
It is not unusual from there that politics and communications technology return to car and horse.
A last observation.
In earlier times the press tried to understand, what for secrets between the messages were forged.
There is present the messages, which demand confidential information of the press.
Climate: as France its financial promises beautiful-talks
One year after the Kopenhagener contract is it time, the adherence to the fast solved financing promises (also " Nearly Start" or came prematurely financings mentioned) to examine, which were realized by the developing countries.
And the rough French Schönredereien is uncovered already.
With the Kopenhagener the developing countries committed themselves to contract to make available 30 billion dollar between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of the COP16 the European Union drew all registers, in order to convince their partners of the fact of their commitment concerning the nearly starting financings: detailfaithful procedure report of its member states, press conference, large Nebenevents, brochure distribution.
The operation transparency is remarkable and degrees for their actual value estimated: the developing countries and the civil society would see it gladly, if all developed countries made the same on the same precision level.
Announced the European Union in the year 2010 2.2 billion euros to have set free which brings it on the correct way to the Respektbezollung of its commitment of 7.2 billion in the year 2012.
If one looks however in the detail, the things lie a little more complicated.
This money should according to the Kopenhagener contract " again and zusätzlich" its to do in order to ensure that an additional employment was brought in, without for the disadvantage of public development assistance.
Unfortunately there is no consent over it, which " again and zusätzlich" meant.
While the European Commission had suggested a harmonization, certain member states, under it France, have which blocks procedures.
Today everyone selects the appoximate value, which it judges as best.
The European Commission has itself for example as appoximate value for that of the yearly 2009 chosen: the international financings are maintained, and give in the context of the financing " Nearly Start" over three years long 150 million in addition.
Other countries selected similar appoximate values, either regarding year or concerning conditions on level of public development assistance.
In response to it was France of the opinion, which " financings; all new Projekte" the yearly 2010 are " again and zusätzlich."
Differently expressed: There are no appoximate values with the expenditures of the preceeding yearly or on global level of public development assistance.
Concretely said the sum total of the French support of the developing countries can remain stable (or to also decrease) - France gives, its obligation regarding " new and zusätzlichen" To keep financings.
Another, crucial element is the classification in donations and loans.
Over it still no rule prevails, and everyone selects its computing mode.
Some, as for example France, find 1 borrowed € as equivalent with 1 donated €.
Obviously this is only with difficulty justifiable: the trouble is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often to the emission containment bound projects, which are based on most effective technology) to be justified can, it is deceitful to present the euros one as equivalent for a donated euro taken in... Besides only the costs of the loan of the financial source country should be taken into account as commitment (i.e. the equivalent of a interest rate).
But France does not have anything differently in the sense than the following consideration: it " respektiert" its obligation of 420 million euro, by taking up 91.5% loan (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% donates) 36.1 million euros) - see also the European Union document, in order to convince itself of it.
France is the only country of the European Union that loan begins in large measure.
Germany demands 46%, during Denmark, which follow to the Netherlands or the Slovakia (among other things) their obligations to 100% with donations.
Differently said, if the predominant majority of the European union spends 1€ for the fulfillment of its obligations, France gives straight once 10 to cent and understands by it a comparable employment.
Beautiful Hokuspokus!
All in all France operates in its nearly starting financing with a double swindle: to a part with a Weiterentwicklkung of the action over the time and on the other hand part with the reality of the financial employment.
France succeeds it, believes to leave that it " 420 million; more again and zusätzlicher" Millions in agreement with his promises spent and saves thereby 36.1 million euro.
The manipulation of the Treasury (it probably seems there that it was Bercy, which accomplished the arbitrage) could pull one doubly negative effect; once European Union-internally (why the other member states continue with donating, if it is sufficient nevertheless to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries do not let be deceptive completely...
The chapter of the financings only a small question on relatively short time compared with the whole of discussions over the climate, come prematurely.
But it could be too much the drop in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
We hope that this will not be the case.
As also always is, it is indispensable to learn its lesson from this first year of premature financings.
Primarily France could announce a change in its kind of posting for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of the respect for its obligations and the compensatory justice with the other countries of the European union.
Above all however France could bring the discussions forward over the contention of the long-term financings (another, crucial and momentarily discussed topic): one escapes from the question " Verrechenbarkeit" or the kind of posting of its loans not.
France could change its position, in order to be just as progressive regarding the points of issue, as it is with other things.
Hope is based thus on the new Secretary of the Environment Kosciusko Morizet, which will arrive next week in Cancun.
A surprising announcement over the nearly start of France and its vision " Verrechenbarkeit" as well as the use of loans by nature the international confidence basis would raise, which is necessary for resuming discussions.
Alarm - of children taken pesticides
A child of 10 years takes 81 different chemical substances over the day, thus this Wednesday study published by the combination Générations Futures (former movement for the protection of the rights and the respect of coming generations).
The combination, which explains that its results " in view of the small number of analyzed samples show no statistically significant value, but an illustration character of the treated problem darstellen" , between July and September usually the food consumed within four from a about ten-year child to the meals plus an intermediate meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris had bought.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five blew fruit and fruit parts, three milk products and 1.5 litres water per day - were examined just like Naschereien by laboratories in the search for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is striking down: 81 chemical substances, under it 42 as possibly or probably carcinogenically classified and five as surely karziogen classified, just like 37 substances with Endokrinin interference factor, according to studies of several institutions as for example the international cancer research center.
" Even if in approximate whole cases legal limit for each chemical, individually taken substance not exceeded, then infers one this collection nevertheless very much well that the reality, in which the consumer is possibly exposed to carcinogenic materials or substances with Endokrinin interference factor ist" concern exciting; , the combination notices.
Already with the breakfast contained alone the butter and the tea with milk already more as ten of the possibly carcinogenic arrears and three reliably than karzinogen proven, just like more than twenty arrears, which can impair the hormone system.
From Brazil imported the apple, as intermediate meal for the study intended, exhibits traces of six chemical substances, among them in France a forbidden fungicide.
The same is valid for the green beans from Kenya, in the lunch enclosed, with which the study traces of an insecticide forbidden strictly in the European Union determined.
Furthermore was also the chopping steak, which Thunfisch from the can, even the Baguette and the chewing rubber of pesticides and other chemical materials gespickt.
With the tap water the analyses brought the presence of nitrates and chloroform to the light.
During dinner was the salmon steak with 34 determined, chemical arrears to " reichhaltigsten" , and even the plastic plate used for warming the meal up in the microwave was not unloaded.
The conclusion-finite risk of this " Schadstoffcocktails" for the consumer " probably one unterbewertet" , so the study.
" Alliance Europe Ecologie Les Verts" (EE-LV) " for its part; in view of the urgency of the Lage" suggested introducing a moratorium over the use of pesticides around which " Increase in Zivilisationskrankheiten" to stop.
In July a study of the European authority for food security (EFSA) had identified reference to the presence of arrears 365 more differently, in fruit and vegetable identified pesticides, which are consumed in Europe, among them 76 in Getreiden.
