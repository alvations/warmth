A Republican strategy to block Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy on the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Centre Brennan considers this a myth and says that electoral fraud is less prevalent in the United States that the number of people who die because of the fall of lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have not found more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the rate of participation.
In that sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, American states are responsible for the organisation of the federal election in the United States.
And in the same vein from 2009, a majority of American governments passed new laws that hamper the process of registration or voting.
This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections, which saw the rise of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 States.
Accordingly, during the course of 2011, there were 180 draft laws that restricted the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require that voters present an identity card with a photograph, in addition to a test of American citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws reduced early-voting periods, weaken the right to register as voters on polling day and call their right to vote to citizens with criminal records.
Before the 2006 election, no American state required voters to present an identity card with photograph.
The state of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law in Indiana in 2008.
Therefore, the Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years they have supported draft laws in 34 states to force voters to present an identity card with photograph.
It is important to bear in mind that, contrary to what happens in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the social security card.
In fact, 11% of the American people, 21 million people of voting age, have no identity card with photo issued by a government agency of their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
But, often, the search for identity document required costs more than $100.
With the new restrictions, which disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of african-americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000 a year, 18% of people over 65 and 20% of voters aged between 18 and 29 years do not have an identity card with photograph.
And there are still more.
In many States, voters who vote for democratic candidates, most students cannot use the identity card with photograph issued by his institution.
On the other hand, those same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs who tend to vote in the Republican Party for using documents issued by these clubs.
Before 2004 no State demanded proof of citizenship in order to vote.
Arizona was the first state to release such a requirement.
In 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require voters to show that they are American citizens.
These measures are, clearly, limiting the vote hispano.
It appears that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican lawmakers supported in 2011 certain laws which abolían the registration of voters on polling day in eight states.
In addition, limited the right of individuals and groups to create a service to help voters who wanted to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million people.
The measures taken since 2009 ensured that the entrance fee of new voters into 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers adopted laws in five other States favouring the reduction of the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33% of the electorate who voted in advance were african-american, while they did not represent more than 13% of the state's voters.
In the case of the Hispanic was exactly the same thing.
These represent no more than 11% of the electorate, which equates to 24% of the people who vote in advance.
However, whites, who account for 76% of the electorate, do not represent more than 46% of the people who vote in advance.
Of course, the democratic lawmakers and their supporters have been strongly opposed to the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
In this regard, the governors democrats have blocked several draft laws.
The prosecution of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
It was, in part, to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 States adopted the law that required the presentation of an identity card with photograph.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Critics denounce Democrats the partisan nature of the laws that have been adopted, as it is clear that they are intended to influence the outcome of 2012 in key states.
A report by the Centre Brennan 2011 shows that those states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the required 270 votes in the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty whether these legislative changes at the level of electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the presidential election of 2012.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the rate of participation.
In this sense, the measures would undermine the American democratic system.
Screening for prostate cancer: take the test or not letting?
In fact, the test of PSA presents, sometimes incorrect results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it decides unnecessary medical interventions.
It is a good enough reason to doubt the men, already reluctant in itself, on whether or not should be screening tests.
Take the test or not?
We sought advice from two specialists.
In studies in the United States was detected a high rate of infection among groups of shows, so it is difficult to interpret the data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed some difference in mortality among patients who had been made the detection and those who do not.
The study, a follow-up to the 12 years, also showed that there is between 30 and 40% of potential from metastasis if there has been the detection test.
I therefore recommend the test at the age of 50 years, or at the age of 40 years if your father has suffered from prostate cancer.
Source african-american as men have a higher level of risk.
The key is to take a good decision once detected cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are lax.
It is really necessary to achieve that the patient understands the degree of risk of their cancer. should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not violate the long-term life, in which case they should instead opt for active surveillance of the disease.
Today many men to which they have been detected a cancer are not treated as the cancer is not aggressive or poses a risk to their lives.
Instead, they suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it proceeds, we offer a treatment.
See increasingly precise criteria for deciding who should be treated or not.
I would do the test in any case.
But it is important to talk to your doctor to determine whether or not to take the test.
Movember has created, in cooperation with the International Society of Urología, a tool that allows PSA evaluate the pros and cons of the test.

Preventing disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of the investigations, the adoption of healthy living habits remain the best way to reduce the risk from the disease.
We estimate that if everyone eat well and would move enough, a 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If anybody smoke, that rate would be increased, at least 50%," underlines André Beaulieu, spokesman for the canadian cancer society.
Instead, we assess that around 10% of cancers are inherited.
Many others are still totally inexplicable.
For the canadian cancer society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is, moreover, a risk factor for other types of cancers.
Does enormous damage people's health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said the spokesman André Beaulieu.
A hopeful statistic: 10 years after stop smoking, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
The fat and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
Increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esófago, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," he added.
The food
The Agency recommends, too, limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large numbers, they climbed the risk from a cancer colorrectal.
Prepared meat products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat for its ahumado, drying or salazón can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"Can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," tell us.
Vitamins
In recent years, scientists have studied the links between the complex vitamin and cancer.
However, by the time their investigations are not conclusive.
Segú SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one of them found a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, in another what they observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D in the cancer has not been clearly defined.
Furthermore, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about the concerns and the family background of each with their doctor.
"Do the screening test does not cause cancer."
The bosón Higgs in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of bosón Higgs provoked consternation last summer, and with good reason.
There is, in fact, that this bosón is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
What is more, the Particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model: our best or "less bad" explanation of nature and the behaviour of the matter, which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for the physical is not entirely clear that they Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new Particle and that is very close to bosón Higgs predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data disclosed this week in a major conference of physics seem to confirm that it is held in kyoto, although still more data to be completely safe.
In any case, we assume that it is Higgs, since the chances of being wrong are few. We will see what it is.
There is, in the wider world, a general law and inescapable that means that two things must not be in the same place at the same time.
There is no way of breaking this rule and not try to do too much, because it will end up getting hurt.
Although Particle physics is a very complex world, it has also proved that there is such a law: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" which consists basically of some of its features.
Physicists classified particles into two categories.
On the one hand we have the good citizens called fermiones supporting the principle of Pauli wisely.
And then there are the dirty bosones, a bunch of anarchists that has no respect for all, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the website the Particle Adventure of Berkeley laboratories which, by the way, is extraordinary, the bosones were divided into two groups: the mesones, about which we will discuss here, and the "particles of strength," for which the great forces of nature spreads and with whom the bosón Higgs would somehow relative.
These exotic bosones, I should underline here, are not the gruesome creatures that we might expect.
In fact, if you can read this story, it is thanks to a remarkably banal: the bosón fotón or "Particle of light" which acts as a "Messenger" of electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a Particle with an electrical load accelerates or changes direction," desordena "the electromagnetic field at that very environment; a bit like when we launched a Stone into a pond.
In this "mess" born an electromagnetic wave (of the infrared, ultraviolet light, etc.), and this wave is nothing other than a fotón; that is, one of the bosones "proxy force."
Field more stable
The same applies to the bosón Higgs, except that this is another area, the field of Higgs which needs to be "messy" for this bosón appears.
However, the field of Higgs is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. activarlo requires reach extremely high energies, a little as if it were a pond ice cream in which only a heavy rock could slip on the surface.
Why we need a huge Particle accelerator at the CERN (the large hadron collider is a ring of 27 km of girth!) to reach such levels of energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all the particles and all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, they do, but others don't: a piece of paper, for example, never keep for itself on the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all the particles interact with the field of Higgs: those which do have a mass, while the rest (how the fotón, incidentally), do not.
But what "can bring all these investigations?" asks MS Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also permits that physicists escrutinen differences between the observations and predictions of MS.
For their part, many fervently want are, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that tape some holes in the model.
This, admittedly, still has enormous problems, such as that proposed no explanation on the seriousness (ups!) or the dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the area of the universe (another ups!).
But we found no such differences in the CERN so far.
Impact
The impact of these investigations in our daily are difficult to predict, but we do not believe we are wrong to say that there will be no.
To see: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in laboratories in no way suspected the revolution that their work would lead.
Entreveían scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as the physical said Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and by the first laser ongoing (the first was pulsados) in 1962, the laser was rather initially deemed a "laboratory apparatus."
Imagine...
Furthermore, applications can also come from the implementation that surrounds the entire investigation.
For example, the same Willard Boyle produced a captador of light in 1969 in the course of their optical research.
Although it was certainly not his original intention, this captador serves now 'eye' for all digital equipment in the world, which earned him the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC would necessarily transform our lives, but you never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die... | him Devoir
In your committee die in dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life.
The debate must be adopted as it prepares a draft law soon.
However, in this key area, there is still much to do.
I Devoir has tried to see it closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr L. Montérégie lived alone in her apartment.
Prostate cancer that was destroying had given him a break for two years.
"I was given five years of life, but I have been seven," relata, made a pass, lying on his bed in the centre of palliative care Victor-Gadbois Beloeil, reached the previous day.
"But it is always a shock, we cannot be ready for this," continues.
The disease has ravaged: a huge weakness that prevents him from going only to bath and even eat alone.
Sitting before a apetitoso lunch, accepts resigned to help him eat.
Brave, it even smile, to talk to the unknown that heaping attention, I bring medicines and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that I heal diarrhea, it is humiliating," are. informed
A few hours later, the team found to remedy this wrong.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man makes pis up," relata Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the centre Victor-Gadbois.
Return to their childhood, for some people, it is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the person's ability to accept this regression," notes.
Because, in the opinion of the majority of people who work in palliative care, the big moments take place in the heart of this regression.
All patients entering the heart of palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffering from cancer.
Have a prognosis of life more than three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provide care "curative."
The biggest fear of mrs A., 89 years, is dying "conscious and drowning."
But the disease has made him discover to their children.
"I have a good child," adds.
"I no longer are more wishes in this life," he says, before agreeing that he puts a mascarilla to help her breathe.
In the coming days and hopes a final visit to her son who lives in Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois is offered, with a group of volunteers, care of the body and helps to food.
Are palliative care being given when nothing more can be done.
To help his death is more comfortable.
In Quebec have a bed of palliative care for each 11.700 inhabitants.
Is very little, because we know that we will all die one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the female doctors of central male.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying offer from shenanigans with brandy or Pepsi, according to demand.
In diabetics are no longer controls its rate of sugar.
The death is part of the everyday.
Yesterday evening I serve a beer to Mr X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son ended the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help both patients and their loved ones," relata Nathalie Savard, Director of care.
In the Centre Victor-Gadbois the days pass without ever be equal.
On the side of a family man of 94 saborea their last meeting in the courtyard, well placed between its almohadas while all drink to his health, a young man of 36 years dies in a tragic, surrounded by his parents, his wife and their two children, having tried everything to survive.
"For the last six months, there are always three to five beds are occupied by people under 45 years with cancer," Dr. is concerned Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the centre Victor-Gadboisarrivent comes from his home and 47% of the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
77% of canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, care designed to alleviate the suffering in hospital when a patient arrives at the terminal stage of his life, is in his home or in a care centre.
And several bodies, such as the centre Victor-Gadbois and society of palliative care at home of the grand Montréal, specialize almost exclusively in the care of patients with cancer.
It is precisely this great relative shortage in the health care of Quebec which makes many doctors specializing in palliative care fear the adoption of a law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by Balfour of palliative care, as Dr eminences, Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, travels to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone has the right to quality palliative care before they accept proceed with euthanasia.
"Recently," relata, "I saw a patient spend 14 days on urgencies suffering great pain without there being enough to relieve it.
Fear that patients want to die simply because they do not receive adequate care."
And at the same time, many oncologists members with their patients until the last day, in spite of the worst forecasts.
The hopes of survival of Hélène Richard were already low ebb when left a tiring chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my oncóloga who wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that made him great pity that wanted to fight," relata.
"However, she had said that there was nothing more to do!"
No all-powerful care
The Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients seeking die thank their carers who do not have heeded in its demands once they have eased their pain through a palliative care team.
But it has to be said that palliative care are absolutely not all-powerful in treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, Director of palliative care at home of grand Montréal, patients do not respond to treatments for pain in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to sedating palliative, which serves to sleep the patient until the time of his death, either permanently or sporadically.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the disease is not relieved to be able to have the sedating palliative.
Patients who are not relieved all say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean 'I relieve euthanasia," but "I want."
The implementation of this report has been made possible by a Grant of journalism of research institutes of Health Canada.
Far-reaching scandals property in Quebec
Officials of the road network, entrepreneurs of the BTP political parties, fundraisers and specialists from the italian mafia, day after day, they do have a formidable "system," which includes the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosi.
A "industry" that was too expensive to taxpayers natives of Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It is curious how the system is pulveriza once we have shot to the big media," ironiza Jacques Duchesneau, Member in Quebec and former head of the Montreal police.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was possible thanks to a thorough investigation into embezzlement linked to contracts of roads in Quebec, the Liberal Prime Minister at the time, Jean Charest, had not allowed more than to delay.
The "report Duchesneau" established a direct link between the industry, the illegal financing of parties and corruption among officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the Ministry of Transport would have saved $1 billion in contracts," contains some of his instincts to stay with a share.
The Commission Charbonneau "has already laid two mayors," adds, waiting to get to "show the stratagems existing behind individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011, also applies to his team of inspectors, investigators and analysts of the government.
This unit works in addition to the police of "the firing squad Marteau sewage," which, since 2009, have made the "cartel" of Montreal was moderate in inflating contracts.
These past few weeks, the unit has taken the registration number of the allegations of fraud and corruption charges against municipal like Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city on the outskirts.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has now resigned from his post as Mayor of Laval, Quebec city third.
It is suspected that he pocketed repeated bribes in exchange for government contracts.
Montreal road network engineers and entrepreneurs have been formally accused of italian origin, as Tony Accurso and flax Zambito.
The latter has caused shock in explaining to the committee the mechanics of "system" for obtaining government contracts.
He paid over three years 3% of the value of the contracts awarded in Montreal to a broker linked to the Mafia that transferred the money to Union Montréal, the mayor's party Gérald Tremblay.
M. Zambito distributed money to left and right during the years 2000, giving more than 88 000 canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the liberal in power.
He admitted, too, having organised a fundraising illegal for liberal ex-viceprimera minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
The inflation in the cost of the contracts sewage
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant exingeniero of public works, explained it well before the committee: in ten years received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, parties of hockey and bribes from companies in the construction sector for a total of $736.000 sewage, all in exchange for contracts whose inflated costs.
Other officials of the roads have admitted that received money for inflating invoices between 30 and 40 per cent in the form of fake extras.
Moreover, a party organiser, Martin Dumont, accused the mayor M. Tremblay of having deliberately turned a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled their coffers of dirty money.
As a result of these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Political Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected in Montreal that raised an alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies since 2010, in the east of the island, was opposed to the sale of city land acquired by their $5 million and resold by 1.6 million to Developers in the housing boom.
70% of the cost of the election campaigns was dirty Money
Of research that will eventually take place, it guarantees that twist "on a knife edge to understand how the system works, infiltrado by ants, to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits."
And added that the process is "painful, but positive."
We are cleaning the wounds but would take a clean research unit in Montreal and be very alert to the dubious practices are not repeated.
How do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for its part, declares that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but is concerned about the role of the elected politicians aware of the ploy. "" '
Estimating 70% the proportion of dirty money that went to the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, ironiza: "I have said that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality."
The government quebequés proposes to limit to $100 donations to parties, but that will not change the donation, he said, "while not strictly limit election spending, will be dirty money in politics."
Recommends a complete overhaul of the system of awarding public contracts and party funding: "We can't get any lower; go to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the home with a more solid foundation, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Montreal, Quebec and M. Duchesneau invites those who are laughing all to look in the mirror.
"The Barcelona PSG is not the qe!"
This season has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
Could be explained by an individual awareness, but also for the new dimension of PSG.
Have got great players.
Go from day to day by his side.
The technical staff has also brought me a lot.
And these elements I drive every day to raise the level of my game.
In a party, that is easier.
Everything moves very quickly in football.
But I am not acaloro.
Since my early in the centre of preformación INF Clairefontaine until my time in Saint-Etienne, I always advanced by leaps and bounds.
Will benefit from competition reclutada by Carlo Ancelotti.
The recruited this summer are accustomed to play matches at a very high level.
They know that every training is crucial.
This means that a player as I wish to fight and take everything.
Furthermore, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my position.
Is backed by Deputy as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all the technical.
Today, there is no one like in the European league 1 and is among the best coaches.
Has a lot of experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
Has worked with great players.
I think it will be other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a conversation with him very comforting.
I had just emerged from a series of injuries.
The confidence we have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about the PSG in the first part of the season?
In the League 1, Lyon, we took the post of leader.
But remain in the ambush.
One of our major objectives is the Champions League: we have qualified for the final elimination round in style.
What is the aim of the club in this competition?
We are going to try to go as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say to many and very good European teams.
We want, for a start, finishing the first of our league against the port to qualify for the final round of elimination round.
Will the PSG can become a big European club in the short term?
Already has the budget...
In order to become a major European club, Paris has to win titles and be there for the long term.
Today, that is not the case.
In economic terms, the PSG is delivered to their means for that project is achieved.
Not winning the cup at the 1, and in the league last season, would be a huge failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we will invest all our efforts on lead that title of champions.
In the last season do not get far.
In May we have a disappointment, as had the best position to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, the Montpellier, had significantly better season.
This year I think it will be good.
Even if the big teams such as marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think that we have the weapons to llevárnoslo.
Do you think that the media expect more than PSG?
It is normal to expect a lot from us if we think about what has been spent on the players we have.
We accepted completely.
After ganáramos 4-0 Troyes at home, that there are things that criticise is a little frustrating.
We wonder what most people expected.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not the qe Barcelona!
We try to put in place a project of the game.
A team is built in time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Just look at Manchester City which, after two seasons, has failed to qualify for final elimination round, and they also have invested much!
In view of the sums invested, you imaginaríamos with 15 points ahead of the day.
That would be neglecting our adversaries and the championship in France.
Lyon and marseille, which were not well the previous season, have been "driven" by this new PSG.
This shows that the League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up taking us the trophy.
The PSG seems totally dependent on the success of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Better to say that we have a "Zlatandependencia."
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and that gets many goals.
Has been to demonstrate that it is the star of the League 1.
And he has shown in all the teams it has been a great player, a global star.
In the group that we respect the man and the gambler.
And he also respects the men around them.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
This encourages others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows all move.
How has experienced the euro 2012 with the team of France?
Has been a disappointment.
He was very enthusiastic about participating in the euro.
Unfortunately, my injury stopped me scoring game time.
I saw things there and I was strengthened.
Today achievement play good matches in the selection.
It is what I expected from my baptism with the "bleus."
We learned the lessons of what happened in ukraine and that is why we today have exemplary behaviour.
What is your view of the first month of Didier Deschamps at the forefront of the "bleus?"
Is getting results.
They are well situated in the classification for the world group.
The seleccionador is rigorous, close to the players and inspires win.
As was the case of Laurent Blanc.
But I do not want to make comparisons.
Blanc clasificarnos achieved its goal for the European Championship.
I hope that Didier Deschamps leads the selection to Brazil.
The standoff (1-1) of 16 October in Spain helped lay the foundations?
This game gave us confidence.
Each fought by all.
Before that shock in Spain, had not experienced a game like this in my whole career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Quite the contrary to current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified and the burdens of processing transactions between the parties.
Furthermore, as often happens in the technologies, the political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudónimo), is both a virtual currency convertible into dollars, euros, etc and a protocol of change in the manner of BitTorrent insurance, which allows the exchange of files on an equal footing.
There have been close to 200 transactions through 15,000 computers in the network.
And about a thousand websites accepted the bitcoins as gifts or as a form of payment.
The price of Bitcoin, having risen to the top of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, today before returning to haunt the ten dollars (contributions are censan on page bitcoincharts.com).
Is nothing impressive when compared with the global changes in actual currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) expressed by him in a report on virtual coins issued in October.
In it, he described the Bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency," "that competes with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other systems with virtual coins as the "credits," used to run a vídeojuego and that we can win playing or you can buy (and even sometimes swap).
The social network Facebook also developed this kind of system.
But in any exchange a central authority monitors and addresses the changes.
With the Bitcoin all network nodes are both repositories of books, verifiers, issuers of currency and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Every transaction between two users is actually between two addresses in the form of e-mail.
A user may choose a different direction for each payment, thereby guaranteeing the anonymity.
A range of information related to this transaction is concluded electronically through a double key encryption system.
The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the changes of bitcoins appear in the book of public accounts, which spreads across the network.
The key milestone is to write this new compromise in this book.
This depends on the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner, a kind of interim central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
It is a stage of troceado file processing, i.e. a large file in a smaller footprint in numbers and unique.
The computers "caught" the new compromise and add a number "chop up" before the whole.
The aim is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (more noughts initially).
Once it is that number, the other nodes easily verify which is good.
The transaction is then indestructiblemente linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, to commit a fraud, a user would pay twice with the same money very quickly - in less than 10 minutes), the only network would accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would get an orphan, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer to resolve the challenge is 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is in two regularly, likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible by cienmillonésimo, leaving a large margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also in each increase in the power of calculation.
The life of the network already has its ups and downs.
Web sites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and have stolen bitcoins in deposit.
"The ruling does not affect the same protocol used," says Pierre Noizat, which has just launched Paymium real currency payment, a company that uses the network Bitcoin.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of anonymous blanquo of money from this service.
But the cash presents the same defect.
Players in weight as Wikipedia reject such payments.
Others, like the platform Wordpress, the accepted.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit rum, Insitito Weizmann in Israel, discussed the book of accounting and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins does not circulate.
In November, it launched the "discounts giants."
"It changed 30,000 dollars," regocija Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which makes the bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat pedagogical, author of a book on the currency, believes enough in the potential of this technology in addition to online transactions.
His system, Paytunia, amounts to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are cheaper.
The carrier, moreover, manages its identity and can, therefore, remain anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in the shops, which do not have to install new terminals or softwares.
Simply have to provide a precise direction for a phone to "recognize photographed and logged," Pierre Noizat, which assures having thousands of users.
There is a general movement of review of hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take a while to Bitcoin sets, but in 2013 could be a change," predicts.
Moreover, in his report, the ECB provides revalue the various risks, today considered high, in the event that the currency is successful.
We pulled out of Afghanistan.
What next?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US must leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army picked up possession of its territory and the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished especially to Afghan farmers, who have considered terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the injured and maimed.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former heads refugees in Pakistan, but also often with peasants who reject the presence of foreign forces, as in the days of the soviets.
Want to defend their traditions, old and archaic, even if their causes join jihadists, pakistanis, arabs, uzbeks and tajiks.
They will no longer be tolerated, sometimes even aided by local insurgents, when Westerners get more discreet.
The departure of French troops on the basis of Nijrab, which I watched from the top of the hills planted almendros thanks to credit French, was in order.
The trucks and tanks convoys returned to Kabul without suffering any attack, watched by helicopters.
There will be no influx of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since his breakthrough irresistible between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then vacuum and the country involved in fire and blood because of infighting between different factions.
It took control of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to safety.
The Afghans have paid the price of obscurantism of its farmers exceeded by the al-Qaeda organisation, but their situation is no better today.
The old mujahedin, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The main figures of the anti-soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, and with government land for solar revenderlos as for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting the pair of massive American outsourcing contracts.
Are discredited; most of them do not have fought.
The people I have heard in the countryside, aspires to a government that is not formed by thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who were able to take advantage of the American generosity: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are weary of the war and its ideology.
They have lived the modern world for its exiles in Iran or Pakistan and praised its benefits.
With about 65% of its population under 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
We must give work to those young people who do not want to go back to the dark ages of the old parties and the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, are eager for mobile phones. television and its folletines turks with the modern world has great admirers around the country.
The army is now.
Will be deemed legitimate authorities who want to lead the country?
The former commanders of the anti-soviet struggle have already provincial to reconstitute the militias who huirán of power plant.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a degree of decentralisation in the image of Western nations. However, the United States wanted to transform into a centralised state, with a strong presidential power by abolishing the post of Prime Minister that existed from the 1964 constitution.
The President Karzai does not want foreign control, in particular during the elections due in April 2014.
However, the country relies on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has restored its services, no major has managed no dam and irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported, and there is nothing except fruit and vegetables.
The priority is given to private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, would have been necessary government control.
Spread the rumour that Afghanistan had vast mining wealth.
And this only served to increase the feeling of Westerners were there to seize them.
Without energy to extract the mineral Iron and copper to the ground and no means of transport for export through the mountains, there are no mining operation.
The Chinese already have left the copper mines of month Aynak, leaving archaeologists international (funded by the World Bank) excaven the immense site búdico and remain there as the major employers in the province.
It will also need to Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country that largely depend on imports and exports, restore its normal relations.
French troops left on 20 November.
The new Cooperation Agreement provides for the continuation of the traditional aid: girls' schools, schools for children, a French department at the university, the French institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural areas and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the aim of trying to "win the hearts and minds" and making the impossible task of making aid and the offensive action "civilian and military actions" tally, a service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), abolished in 2012, brought and did bring in a small French ngo many agricultural collective interest and rehabilitation work in dozens of mountain villages.
This work, golosos to obtain local labour, have been able to help contain the insurgency: irrigation wells, clean water, reforestation, fruit trees, solar and increase protection of arable land.
What will continue as memory after two billion in military spending?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very tough in these valleys often situated over 2,000 metres high.
The embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
To break free of the uprising carried out by foreign groups, which farmers have told me that they wish, we need to maintain a small civilian support, well controlled and goes directly to them.
A constitution after a struggle in egypt
It is a new double or nothing of President Mohammed Morsi.
While egypt is more divided than ever on the constitutional declaration, which provisionally granted full powers, he decided to play the all for the whole thing.
Took everyone by surprise on Wednesday when it announced that the constituent assembly would vote his final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had given two months more to this House to finish its work.
And nearly two years ago that egypt uses a provisional text, amended several times, weakening the institutional stability and leads to legal entanglements.
This new initiative has only exacerbated the divide in the country.
For his opponents, the autocratic President persisting in its "delirium" and is "betraying his word" and "trampling on the right."
For his supporters, it says that this is a measure to end more quickly with the institutional and political crisis and accelerate the process of transition.
In the next 15 days should organise a referendum.
A very short period of time that requires the brothers to renounce its project to explain the text, article by article, to the egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversial wreaks havoc across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the egyptians will vote for it, as stated in an interview with the weekly American time.
Considering that the resource has been voted very quickly, contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people," or "vote my text or maintain full powers, powers which will come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in this strange atmosphere in which 85 members of the constituent assembly, islamist with a big majority, voted the text yesterday.
The majority of liberals not came to the call.
In mid-November, a little before the constitutional declaration, had closed the door because saw could not enforce their points of view.
The representatives of civil society and human rights, religious minorities did the same.
In order to achieve a quorum, yesterday morning was added to 11 people, Member substitutes, at full speed.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim brotherhood.
As expected, the articles were voted unanimously.
To commentators makes them grace, on the other hand, the fact that one of the few differences of the day there is practically in the prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to believe that the clock of the constituent was wrong.
The text, which yesterday afternoon was still being voted, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, subject to the spotlight, remains finally identical to that of the 1971 constitution, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafi parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental demand, expected it could replace "principles" to "the rules," which would have allowed stricter enforcement.
For the islamists, that this article has been amended is not a guarantee of good will and respect for the other components of the Egyptian society.
Liberals denouncing of hypocrisy and feel that this is nothing more than a marketing device.
According to them, the Islamisation of the Constitution is through other articles.
They concern, in particular, to article 220, which gives the university Al-Azhar an advisory role, especially for anyone who has to confirm their compliance with the laws of Sharia.
According to the specialist in egypt Sophie Pommier, is disturbing because "People called to speak is not elected and has no democratic legitimacy.
Here we see the premises of a theocracy."
Fears of the liberals are also increased by the fact that the next rector of the university would be considerably less moderate than the present one.
"For now, there is no particular religious involvement.
With this Constitution are within the framework of the civil status.
Most of the lawyers who have been working on this text are not ulemas but University, some of them trained in the French system," explains Alexis Blouet, which prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity regarding article 220, because the terms used imitate the religious vocabulary.
"We refer in particular to wind iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that could arise in the future would be to what extent are the competent civil judges to rule on top of this."
Beyond its religious, the text voted yesterday has received much criticism that relate to the widespread powers that gives the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brotherhood will argue that there are few compared with those who were in the previous regime.
Another sticking point: the powers granted to the military.
According to the military, the review of the defense budget will be submitted to Parliament, but not to a National Defence Council.
Neither prohibited prosecution of civilians in military courts, as demanded by the associations for the defence of human rights.
They also showed their concerns relating to the text, which consider liberty.
The crime of blasphemy remains and, from now on, the insults are banned, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially freedom of the press.
Moreover, no article emphasizes the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing was the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word was not on the previous constitution.
Although the Egyptian President should leave last night on television, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Supporters of the Head of State marched on Saturday.

"The great and powerful" lead you to Moscow: immigrants save for the language
While MPs and human rights campaigners argue about the consequences that would bring the law on compulsory examination, have already appeared in the country con trading with certificates' false '
Each year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, st. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of countries of central Asia - uzbekistan, tajikistan and turkmenistan.
Its sole aim is to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home.
Since 1 December comes into effect a law, whereby each immigrant labour should carry out a review to check their knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who have the intention of working in the service sector, domestic institutions of community services, services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promise at the federal migration service, the tests will be mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will not be enough to pay the examination of the Russian language, if not also the history and the foundations of the legislation.
The knowledge of the language will confirm even to receive and renew the work permit.
Exceptions are the citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language.
This law will not be subject to the people who managed to get their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Utility, doom and defending the rights
The network of centres examiners will sponsored by the Institute of Russian language Pushkin, the University of the friendship of peoples, the Moscow State University, Russian st. Petersburg State University and other institutions of higher education.
Immigrants can stand for the tests in all the towns, in Russia are now open more than 160 facilities of this type.
The initiative on the introduction of the examination was supported by members of the State Duma and the federal migration service.
But defenders of the rights, long before the law came into force, were often put this question to the press: What will this actually?
What changes will the terms of knowledge of the language, for both the Russians and the immigrants themselves?
First of all, are the representatives of the immigration service, this will reduce the number of people suffering from "slave labour."
Many people talk today about the defence of the rights of immigrants, explains labour Victor Sebelev, head of Russia's federal migration service representation in tajikistan.
The defence of their rights must begin before his departure.
Only a selection system organised will solve the problem of migrant workers in 90% of cases.
The problems are immigrants without occupation, education, those who do not know the language or pass the medical supervision.
Without an understanding of the language, says Sebelev immigrant, the future will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, on the pretext of helping him get an eerie and close a "viajecito paid" covacha, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received a number of complaints from our immigrants.
"At home I promise one thing, but when you arrive are deceived, are deprived of their passports, not pay them wages promised," confirms the head of the directorate of immigration Labour's immigration service of tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Not enoje jefecito!
Meanwhile, however, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to work in Russia recognise that not only do not know the language of the country to go, but in their own language write with difficulty.
Of course, this is not their fault but their own misfortune: few the turkmen people, uzbeks, tajiks who can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to feed children, let alone vestirlos calzarlos and buy for them what is needed for the school.
To reach adolescence, these guys have set out to work at the earliest opportunity.
It is difficult, if you do not know the language, recognise them.
"You feel humiliated and lower."
However, when it comes to the law on the language, rights campaigners point to an important point.
The tests will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have this status, there will be no examination and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers still living in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or banned the step to strangers"
Many visitors say they receive the official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause is in the bureaucratic obstacles and difficulties of the language itself.
Moreover, the legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
However, a false registration can be done quickly and with only 500 roubles.
The employees of the Russian police know that usually carry false documents, are not registered and listed the cases of extortion.
"We call 100 or 200 rubles for cigarettes or tea," commented to journalists the citizen of tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamov.
"Come on, don't be tacaño, buying a painting"
The first day of the entry into force of the law on the tongue, it became clear that not only documents of registration of immigrants can be fake.
Several certificates' false 'knowledge of the language have already been seized by officials of the federal migration service.
The forged documents had been printed in color printer standard.
Of course, arrived at the hands of the new owners not as gift: every immigrant queriéndose facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official review procedure, which will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption for the 'diplomas' cannot be bought, meet government officials and rights activists.
So far, the authorities can promise the migrant workers who would not have been able to successfully pass the test the first time more time to study the basic course of language.
Moreover, immigrants who do not speak Russian will give them jobs that do not require active communication with the people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with firearms registered is fairly limited
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law with greater rigidity in relation to gun owners for civil use.
This is the government's reaction to the recent incidents: press shot during wedding celebrations in which fortunately there were no victims, and the massacre started by Moscow lawyer Dmitri Vinográdov, which tighten seven people lost their lives.
The police want to prohibit the use and possession of weapons traumatic in public places and raising the minimum age for obtaining licence for carrying guns, of 18 to 21 years.
This view was supported by the head of the state Duma's Committee on Security and fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised reforms in the law on weapons possession will be carried to the State Duma in the near future.
Not all are happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem applying the "Iron fist" policy.
In the social network has published an open letter, whose authors, representatives of organisations of marksmen, need us to desist from such measures of "thoroughness senseless."
The percentage of acts of vandalism with use of weapons registered is minimal, said to BBC news service of Russia, the lawyer criminalista Vasiliy Lésnikov.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, for six months of the year 2012 142 crimes with use of firearms registered in bodies of Interior, compared to total 1168 offences recorded for this same period.
The authors of the open letter are sure that stricter legislation in the area of weapons for civil use will not be a problem for the criminal turn to the black market.
Now, in his words, in Moscow can be found any weapons at low prices.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior says that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to official
The black market arms supplies through various channels.
The main channels are years, said retired col. Victor Baranets, who worked for 10 years in the Ministry of Education and the senior staff.
Capture of screen Web site that accepts orders for weapons
The first," remnant of the army or military," that is, the weapons that were stolen during military actions in the caucasus.
"The weapons were hurtadas by Russian officials and by the same caucasian," says Baranets.
The next type of weapon "black," The stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes hurtadas weapons warehouses of the police and those stolen directly by officials from the bodies of law enforcement.
The illegal weapons are on sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals often had explosions.
"There are versions demonstrated that some fires were caused a exmilitar premeditadamente to meet the need," he says.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their bit.
"Now have proliferated private factories of weapons that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under cover to the black market, including that of Moscow," the expert said.
One more source of the black market is the smuggling.
Plenty of guns and machine guns from poor countries such as kyrgyzstan.
"There have their own production, sometimes small-scale, and has formed a mafia that has organised the flow of arms," explains the former military.
Where are the weapons?
Experts have calculated what the participation of around each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this subject was produced in 2011 by the Centre for analysis of problems and planning of public management.
Experts analyzed reports of the Ministry of the Interior and of Rosstat criminológica literature and public access data portals whose thematic concerns weapons.
The vast majority of the illegal weapons, according to the researchers, from the armed forces and security forces.
About half of black market weapons has arrived there "because of officials whose work is related to weapons," it said in the report.
According to researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of cases were stolen during the production of illegal weapons and 5% corresponds to the "archaeology."
The dependent on one of the stores of weapons, who asked that his name was not mentioned, says that the weapons found by illegal excavadores not buying people for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, providers are directed at military stores when they need a game.
Through some alférez, the provider buying a unit, for example a gun TT.
Removed from the register and the pass over the fence.
"This brings the weapon to the city and sold to 900 euros per unit with two chargers," tells us
"But of course, the police regularly this on all the issues, so I must be met, when the discovery of offences, buy plan to test traders of illegal weapons," adds the dependent.
"As a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer usually available through acquaintances.
"I visited websites and blogs until a type that I proposed it to the platform" Begovaya ', where would a man who I would lead to a "esquinita where we could negotiate."
The price of weapon, I learned just there."
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"For a weapon I need a friend who has contacts," says the dependent on the shop. "I have a friend as well, but I hope not much in it."
Sellers in the markets, but it has to come, say "on the part of Mr Ivanovih, who asked that his daughter told him that he had fallen a tooth."
I can even get a couple of steel manoplas through a person of trust.
He also the supplied only to me because he knows that I am not going to delatar.
The amateurish seeking weapons in different ways.
The former military Viktor Baranets was tested in the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990's, when was preparing to publish an article on this subject.
The schemes, he said, have not changed.
He delivered an album of photos where there was no "all."
"I felt like a luxury boutique," recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Baranets, do not offer to buy a pig in a poke: all that can be proven.
I, as a potential customer, not just buy; we are going with the seller to forests, where we put a target.
"Give me the opportunity to shoot and when I assure you that the weapon fired well, we started to negotiate," describes the procedure the expert.
Sofás shop
Web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte ', which offers to buy arms for different purposes."
That this does not require any document or personal meetings.
"It is sufficient to have a certain amount of money," they write in the title of the notice advertising "buy a gun or a machine gun."
There, users make their orders and put questions.
And sold to minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "ivan" (ortografía preserved).
"Buy a gun TT. Moscow," lacónicamente asked his question "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fake websites and capture two hands to those wanting to buy firearms.
And people go, as hungry for the bait fish, and then to extract coal in Siberia
Military commentator and exmilitar Viktor Baranets
I have heard of these systems: in general, the website is registered outside the scope of the Russian laws.
People give orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an atm.
"In response, he sent a photograph and instructions to let them know where the gun is hidden," The press secretary of the ngo relata "the right to arms," Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets says that if there is an order online, one is left without a weapon and thrown into jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fake websites and capture two hands to those wanting to buy firearms.
"And people go, as hungry for the bait fish, and then to extract coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov $100
In the illegal purchase of firearms, according to the experts, you can spend $100 to 900.
According to Dmitri Kislov ngo "the right to arms," a gun Makarov can be achieved by 100-300 dollars.
We must wait a month and a half.
It is sent from military warehouses by the heads of the range.
According to official statistics from the Ministry, compared with the period enero-octubre of 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia fell by 7%, which is 22.900 identified, and the number of cases of theft and extortion of firearms, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices fell to 7.8%.
Go on strike employees in fast-food restaurants and supermarkets in the US
Up to a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as a teller in "McDonald"
In recent days, the United States has launched a wave of protests against the corporation Walmart the low wages paid in supermarkets and restaurants of the popular fast-food chains, such as McDonald's," "Burger King," "Taco Bell," "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken."
By now no one dares to state whether or not this wave will come to the nine points, or if it meant losing strength and amansarse in their early stages.
The protests have the support of left-wing trade unions and a number of NGOs.
In addition to the increase of the modest salaries earned by workers from Walmart and the system of fast food, the aim of the organisers of the protests is the creation of trade unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents per year?
The action began last week, after the day's action thanks, the so-called "Black Friday." that day, in United States coomenzaba the orgy of cuts that captured millions of inhabitants, and sometimes was accompanied by clashes.
That day, some workers of the Walmart Corporation, which employs 2.2 million people in the world, left their jobs and proceeded with trade unions and left-wing activists protest pickets in the shops of the corporation, whose products go to people on modest incomes and moderates.
Walmart sells everything from nappies, hunting rifles and batteries for cars, until aspiradores, eggs and milk.
The products in its stores are on average between 8% and 27% lower than those of the major supermarkets.
That is why many low-paid workers of Walmart buy only at work.
The availability and choice of products made of Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to the words two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, in part because paid little for their employees.
They also complain about the poor working conditions, such as the lack of montacargas or hand scanners.
The "Black Friday" the participants in the demonstration demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
For a typical worker of Walmart, which receives $9.5 per hour, this spending is excessive, said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average salary to $12 per hour, it will cost the company $3.2 trillion.
This is approximately 1.1% more than it spent on salaries now.
If Walmart puts the wage increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the shop will be only 46 cents more expensive.
Within a year they spent the ridiculous amount of 12,39 dollars more of what they earn now.
Supporters of happy Walmart commented that the protest took place in only nine States and that caused no loss to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" took in its stores from Thursday 8 p.m. to midnight the following day, and during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, their cash registers, performed the 'Black Friday' boxes nearly 100 million transactions.
The representative of the company, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the left-wing website Huffington post, who left his job "less than five" Walmart employees and that the protest had been nothing more than "another public relations conjuring trick," organised by the workers' union.
"Free box!"
The protests continued in New York this week, in which the targets were not exactly the supermarkets Walmart (which in this progressive city would not have appreciated, and why now there are none), but the "McDonald's and other restaurants cheap."
Let McDonald says that sells billions of pieces, and then even honest you attach the sick leave and you do not pay for your work!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council
Currently, in accordance with federal law and in New York, the minimum wage is 7,25$ per hour.
Fast-food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive in New York 8,90 dollars per hour.
Nobody earns less than them in this city.
How is it possible to survive in New York with this money, for me it is incomprehensible.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers are having the McDonald's and worked there, behind the counters, part-time after school but still lived with their parents.
Few were those who saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there a long time.
Now, constantly setback in interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live in this salary, and sometimes even to feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal magazine there is a comment whose author says that it is irresponsible to have children if they do not know what to eat.
Those involved in the protests, which began at 6:30 p.m. on Thursday morning in the McDonald's 40th street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cash and fast-food cooks are starting to pay at least $15 per hour, double its current minimum wage for them.
It also demanded that in the fast-food sector workers' unions are created.
The US law prohibits the government from this right and punish the activists of the trade union movement with skulduggery and redundancies.
Moreover, the administration are seldom makes life easier.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy for the unions cover the food sector rápid.
One of the biggest is the excessive staff turnover.
Discordant
Noisy protests took place the same day in other cheap restaurants of Manhattan.
The completion of the action took place at half the rally in the McDonald situated near Times Square, involving several local democratic politicians, in particular the city's municipal council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it is selling billions of pieces, and then even teaches you a hospital or honest you paid for your work."
The demonstrators were supported by other leading Democrats, for example of candidate for mayor of the city of New York Blasio Bill, which said that "we must support the workers in the fast food industry to achieve receive fair wages and economic prosperity they deserve every neoyorkino."
As the New York Times described him, this was the biggest demonstration of its kind in the history of the American fast food.
But there were only a few hundred people, not even all of them were employees of the fast-food service, in which trabakan tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is not yet clear whether that will spark to cause a mass movement.
"For now, trick the brain is not easy"
The subject of heightened reality, so popular among fans to modern technologies, lately is perceived as normal primarily through the prism of special glasses.
In early summer, at its annual conference Google showed a model on the move and then, in November, it emerged that Microsoft had also submitted an application to reclaim the relevant patent.
However, in a conversation with the head of Microsoft's interactive 3D technology group in the laboratory in Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom dilucidó that that company for scientists, the glasses already belonged to a passing phase.
To them attracts the prospect of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and the creation of virtual spaces open.
- please, in general terms, what is the purpose of study of its research group?
- we are the interaction persona-ordenador, but also try to extend the limits of this interaction.
For now the humanity in its mass has remained trapped in the stage of work with the flat screen, sometimes the píxeles touches the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the console Xbox and sensors Kinect represent a step forward, and today any Xbox sold without Kinect, because we all care about the control of gestures.
- what does the future hold?
- although Kinect has led the interaction at the physical level, much of it still occurs in a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more information), and the exit is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, worked on truly three-dimensional imaging systems, based ​ ​ in various technologies, including the designer.
It must release the world of computers to our physical, make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognise not only the user but also the space that surrounds it.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
Firstly, to hell with those stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- what do you think about the control by voice?
A detail very popular, but do you not think we overestimate?
- clear that it cannot be considered a panacea, remains to resolve the issue of privacy, if not always wants others to be aware of our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in their own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we think signs, but not in loose movements, but shorter.
Moreover, the gestures were captured by the House of the device, but not by a band that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory can be reduced to the size of a watch band.
But, in general, the future is for a combined rate of control, for example of gesture + voice.
- how is that?
- for example, how I would ask you to forward this tin of soda?
You speak and the show at the same time.
- normally I only speak.
- Oh, that is going to be very difficult to recognize.
- or do you want to force users to adapt to what can or cannot do at the moment the machine?
- not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we are going to have to work mainly in the design of new types of Sensors that can accurately gauge the reactions of the person.
These may be, for example, laser sensors, because they offer a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- speaking of his work with sensors Xbox Kinect, what you have complaints from modern cameras?
Do you lack resolution, depth or something more?
- in principle, the current generation is what may be the beginning of our work with the three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapíxeles at the speed of 1,000 fps.
But the issue is not the megapíxeles, but on the quality of the matrix and in depth.
From this point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this makes more work for the designers of algorithms.
So, we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and y axes, but also in Z.
Also important is the speed, the number of pictures per second.
Human movements are very dynamic and the current 30 fps are really scarce, especially for the gestures.
Steven Bathiche Redmond, our laboratory, made a sensor processing of contact with adjustable retardation of 1 to 100 MS and it is worth mentioning that the Modern sensor produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction hombre-máquina.
It would be very useful to me in my work an equivalent of such a measure, but that does not require contact to the tables for two more.
- and it is not necessary to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three cameras, one of which is in fact the issuer of infrared rays and the second recipient of the reflected signal.
But the third chamber is in fact a simple sensor include the standard visible.
It is used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more of cameras could solve the problem...
Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the requisite amount of calculations.
It would be a good idea to create a flexible Kinect analogous, playing with the curvature of location of cameras and see how this would help determinr the three-dimensional position.
- as far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not submitted their glasses to the public.
Do you think that, in terms of daily use of technologies of heightened reality, the glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- of course, miss out all day arguing in a smart phone in the hands, it is not very comfortable, but I think that the best option would be a heightened reality "transmutable" when, on the basis of a cloud platform, the smart phone, you could go from glasses
The glasses are very personal devices, that is its strength (private things you can only see them), but also its weakness: increased reality based on glasses will not allow it to work on virtual objects along with other people.
- imagine for a moment that the manipulation of objects holográficos virtual in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the film "Iron man," but also for any mere mortal.
There is a problem with this idea that the critics often point out: there is no answer táctil!
The hands do not feel nothing!
What answers prepares his group for this challenge?
- In my conferences often say that the reality is the seventh arrival on the increased interaction between man and machine.
I think that the eighth could well be the addition of sensations táctiles.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of second hand as the anchor for the image.
Has the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at bringing tangibilidad to these "images in the air." for example, the interference of several rays ultrasónicos targeted at a specific point where the blame lies is a feeling similar to that one feels if someone were soplándole yemas of fingers, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also bracelets for the doll that influence the terminaciones nerve of the fingers, this also a promising direction.
- has tried to fool the brain?
Do you think he feels it seems that she should feel when he sees something?
- that is a good idea, we have not yet tried.
Here is another challenge with which we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believes that will open, almost without end. We are also working on the idea of the run - not as the tapes of gyms), mobile platforms, as well as the giant balloons.
For now, fool the brain is not so easy, there is still work for many years.
That is what makes it attractive work with virtual reality for researchers, that many things are in a state of total conception.
Personal taste subjective rather than culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the st. Petersburg "Vanguardismo project," dedicated to the people that are saying, at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best are brilliant figures of art and the scene of st. Petersburg, whose achievements are beyond the City: often find recognition in Europe without Russia even the known.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the flamboyant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, a man barbudo dressed in red from head to toe, which can be found near the Russian museum, near the garden of summer or at meetings of fashion and inauguraciones.
The tables of Kirill Miller always attract crowds, wherever the display.
Kirill Miller is one of those cuentistas purely sociofilósofos of st. Petersburg, creators of new mitologías.
St. Petersburg Vanguardismo Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative at the end of the 1980s - the early 1990's.
Moreover, it is a city man, whose appearance on the streets of the city of people smile and lifts all the mood.
Recently, took in their hands a organillo and became the st. Petersburg organillero, as it has matured to make difficult role, for its Bohemian existence, his philosophy and its image.
- Kirill, why do you go the city dressed as red rather than yellow or turquoise, for example?
- chose the color red because I am a fashion designer and I have been in the appearance and image.
In this world, the color red is a compromise between the artist, the creators of images and society.
Although the society, everything that is not a little grey prompts aggressiveness and turmoil of properties nothing good.
But my provocations are designed to start a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions are an invitation to debate.
- when comprendiste debías be artist?
- In an exhibition of the palace of culture Nevsky, where it but my work.
I realised that this was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new, free and I were still incomprendidos.
I took a friend of artists in the new wave, with the subsequent to which were referred to in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10," and the new wave is over.
I sumí in the theatre for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not by the letters.
- and this is all juntó in your Art Clinic... - was important for me to be in the cultural centre of St Petersburg, where they were to gather together the best creative minds.
In 1995, I became a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and, while there was no reforms, there was a musical art club, a club bohemio, the home of the St Petersburg Bohemia.
Many were born there: Noms Tequila, Jazz, I remember the way in which Schnur brought the project to "van Gogh's ear."
Schnur and her friends danced under light songs phonogram vestían tight trousers, among them was the currently fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group began to play in alive, became "leningrad."
Trachtenberg cheerleader was of many programmes before the days of Hali-galivskih.
I gave Trachtenberg and was the start of his great career; basic education and training received from us.
"D 137 gallery," the "club Griboyedov, are the remnants of the clinic's art.
There were assiduous our employees and customers.
I am a hero of the last century, when the culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was done in the press, the prize was "the people of our City."
In nominating "artist of the Year" elected I ended my completion.
In this new era is not comfortable work; I am a man he likes the truth, honesty and the culture of the last century.
In our time is easy to be popular, but the culture and the popularity are separate. You can be popular but very little cult.
- there are in your work something recognisable.
- many of my paintings are hits, which clearly expresses the topical and the occurrence.
I am going to make a scheduled exhibition," the Russian Museum in clowns."
The clowns are a timeless category.
I was previously sociable, but now it is painful and terrifying.
But everything in the clowns embadurna and tragedy is removed.
I love my mind the grotesque, grotesque.
For example, the salvation of the world through compulsory totalitarian and a change of clothes.
Now you are by the clothes, moving it outside, but not in the interior of the person.
And perhaps that person not to shake hands, but he should escupirle in the face.
And deceit will be abolished when they change clothes.
- you saw recently in the role of urban organillero. - A cultured city must have a hero as well.
Who better than me to be!
But - well, perhaps the art trade can be beautiful?
- now the art trade must be careful, sweet, having tact.
We are witnessing the unraveling of cultures.
Before people are agrupaba in herds, the bohemios wanted one thing, the simplones others.
Now all have been divided into micro-communities, it is hard to please everybody.
I am not a $100 ticket for taste at all.
Now we need to think about who you want to please.
Now, every hero worship has its 100 fan.
- and to listen to Stas Mikhailov arrive by thousands.
- will see the abandoned, there is the sexo-social sphere.
And a cultural event are 300 people, 10,000 never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything is marchita.
I hold my fan, the most important thing is not deceive them, not to spoil what you have achieved.
When I was young had a coleccionista possess such paintings hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually ends.
Now often confuse the concepts.
Say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.
I am a man of culture yesterday, grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused the money only to paint charts.
I am in favour of this culture.
- Kirill, what is it that is missing in St Petersburg?
- good experts in culture.
There is a concept: official culture.
But not all of them can go to culture.
When the kings were the right there was another way, kings may not understand very well the culture, but knew that it was necessary to keep the experts right.
In Moscow there is now very good consultants.
We have people in St Petersburg that could well be experts, but they are closed, because it requires experts at a higher level to evaluate them properly and I open way.
It is now thriving the subjective personal taste.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they say honestly that all modern art is not accepted, there are some artists who have to find other museums.
- what is it for you St Petersburg?
- St Petersburg is not a cultural capital. in Moscow there is much more culture, there are ground.
But on our stones art is difficult to grow.
We need cultural and we now have more writers than readers, that is wrong.
In Europe, there are a lot of people with curiosity that going to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is tiny.
We have to make the art of fashion, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The draft was presented with a subsidy of st. Petersburg.
Giving birth in space
The land is in danger.
Global warming or an asteroid strike killer.
Caravans of space craft with humans on board are in search of a spare planet.
To preserve mankind is the main question: how do you continue the species in terms of atmosphere or replacement on the same planet?
I believe that there is little choice.
In fact, only two are real planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and mars," says the chief investigator of the astronomical Institute state, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus is the temperature of 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
It began to address the problems of reproduction in space with the flora.
Half a century ago that were conducted experiments with plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit is not diferenciaban land on none of the species.
Then came the breeding of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, the drosófilas.
In 1979, were sent into space quail eggs to check how the embryo develops in terms of atmosphere.
Get as a result a normal polluelo.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this polluelo must find support, must stand on its own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev laboratory, the director of the institute of biomedical problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
By not find support, the polluelos gave volteretas at random.
And after 10 p.m. in the newborn was a total atrophy of instincts.
The polluelos not they reacted to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days simply died.
"And twice we were born the polluelos, but then we leave because it was impossible to work there with them," says Vladimir Sychev on failure of the experiment with the polluelos in space.
The last time a "biological" miniarca flew to the orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 will continue the experiments.
However, in the biosatélite Bion "only will travel species of the same sex."
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to the area with foetuses.
In principle, there was nothing supernatural.
"This was precisely in the biosatélites, but this was a unique experiment, and Vladimir Sychev studies like this should be done," he says.
Space after the landing, the rats had offspring.
However, it has not yet managed to address the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It is a difficult challenge.
The animals, having lost their usual habitat, simply cannot make their sexual instinct.
The man, however, unlike the small animals, in principle, can.
The Homo sapiens has the right emotional abstract reasoning and is capable of creating a fund.
Similar tests are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women travel into space 50 years ago.
The greatest risk is spent Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity is the female body.
Our gaviota flying, and no one on earth could say: if it is after a flight into space.
May or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, nobody has responded to this question," he says the veteran of the aerospace sector Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, just after a year of the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the girl, Andrian Nikolayev, also was a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in the open area, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
There are few, are numbered astronauts who after long flights have been well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if I may say more, it is dangerous even in flights orbitales," summarizes the pilot cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, mankind must find some new avenues in biotechnology, in the radiation protection, the creation of artificial gravity.
The centre's hidrolaboratorio cosmonauts is a mandatory in the preparation stage of preparation for the flight.
Under conditions of flotabilidad void, the cosmonauts practise their skills to work in the area.
The water it pretends the atmosphere.
If an adult water is a comfortable, though still hostile environment, for a newborn child is his native element.
The small hombres-anfibio seem to confirm that life on Earth emerged from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is approximately 9 months within his mother in the amniotic fluid, because then it will be easier to get used to the water.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth until the time of the first bath spend only 2 weeks.
"This is very little to forget something," says Marina Aksenova, swimming monitora of newborn babies.
In short, if the political atmosphere is a more natural for a newborn, for women is necessary the gravity, the force of gravity.
In the atmosphere the muscles abdominales and pelvis decrepitan very rapidly, the ability of expulsion from the foetus is reduced.
Well, we ignore this, relying on the action of stimulants for childbirth.
You can, of course, give birth in a special chamber, this will drive.
"And then what?" Valeri Polyakov is this original question.
Furthermore, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sense of gravity, the body does not produce the skeleton and the muscular system.
For a child born in orbit is impossible vestirlo with a special suit for exercises, as adults.
It is merely strip of what is vital for him.
"And this experiment we will do together, allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead to bring to the land to a disabled person, a person totally unsuited ', provides for the head of the bioethics Committee of the Institute of biomedical problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in the area is a theoretical question.
However, over time it will become a reality, when human beings in their houses are directed to a distant planet that will be the home for their children born in space.
Head of nkú: inspection of the political system "švarc" has not found the culprit
In terms of public contracts, the Czech Republic has good quality inspectors and legislation, although its implementation falls.
It says Mr Kala, Vice-President of the office of supreme control (nkú) in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its implementation must be right." This is, in my opinion, what we need, "describes the current situation.
The joint inspection of the inspectors czechs and germans come to similar conclusions.
As an example of a bad practice, says Petr Nečas's attitude to the system to be autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "švarc system."
The Prime Minister said recently that the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) would have annoyed entrepreneurs with inspectors. So it is prohibited or allowed?
"The law must be regulated in some way and if ban something, in this case, neither the Prime Minister can prevent the action of the office that has the obligation to carry out such checks or to demand obligations," notes Kala.
At the meeting of the committee's attention of control in the Congress of Deputies, spoke of the joint project between the Czech and the German team, within the framework of which was likened the legislation concerning public procurement procedures in both countries.
What exactly?
It is a parallel control we make about two years ago.
Put simply: European legislation regulariza how to organise a public procurement procedures, this follows the existing law in each country, and then the practice itself.
We have united and, although control is not yet finished, we got very interesting differences. Generally, the law of our country is "tougher and more comprehensive," however, specific practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
This therefore confirms that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly strict rules, it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law itself.
What can bring to this project? What you think are the conclusions?
Exactly a joint control of this kind could help that we failed to invest efforts to implement the laws, the reduction and improvement of the limits, although this will not have a positive impact.
The economy of savings mean getting a proper thing at a reasonable price (which means that the price is not always the lowest) to avoid the enrichment and, in the long run, the criminal actions.
But not just for the sake of reducing the limit in procurement procedures means that we will achieve this.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with both "red tape," that those who want to find flaws in the system can do it more easily than if the limits remained as high as now.
's attention about the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation governing the prácticaa of public procurement procedures.
How does the system of controls in Germany?
Is it an office like our nkú or is organized differently?
How much at the office, such as the nkú, there is the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of auditors), with a similar to our organization, with a school, it is just that in his case is structured in a slightly different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
Also the powers are to some extent analógas, however, as Germany has a federal structure, the courts of auditors are even at this level. Here differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of auditors (BRH) can only control the federal money, what we call state funds.
The public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are in the Federal Court of auditors.
As for the local legislation, is easier than ours?
Usually, I would draw a comparison without specific data. However, Germany remains a model in some ways, but you cannot accurately specify in what is better.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of the inspectors?
That certainly not, but, again, I do not like to make such comparisons.
It must be said that even those countries that take as a model must face a number of problems.
If not, do not pose any real benefit collaborate with our office, do you not think?
With regard to the laws of our country, what it meant for his Office's amendment law on public procurement procedures? is somehow its incidence?
Bearing in mind that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, has not yet been demonstrated on the actions of control.
Given that we ex post controls, there need to be a delay.
For now, it is in the process of preparing future controls: "We have launched a new tool to detect risks not economic," for which we did spend nearly 14,000 public contracts, which have been tested. The changes will be perfectly at home here, as are the limits, are adjusted for certain types of the selection process and similar conditions.
Do you think that the adoption of this law is beneficial or, rather, is a mess for the bureaucratic system?
I believe that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope it does.
The problem that can arise is that the rules "strengthened" and it is impossible to deliver.
Under the old rules, people already controlled were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes of the Regional Council), and every law not respected in matters of public contracts meant the violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then toughen the law in this way?
I do not think in this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attacking or take advantage of it and not to punish those who commit a formal ruling, which has no impact on the decision making.
Such a system will only create more bureaucratic pressure.
What emerges from this?
See where this road leads started.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the ODS would have annoyed entrepreneurs with no controls of the so-called švarc system, with reference to the fact of being autonomous only on paper, what does this mean?
Does the system švarc "it is prohibited or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if ban something, then even the Prime Minister of the government can prevent the action of the office that has the obligation to carry out such checks and demand obligations.
Can say: "change the law and allow," but you cannot say that we will do as usual.
In the Law on Public procurement procedures, the regulations are quite strict about the way in which it must act formally. And that is as it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that exclude the candidate with the best offer for failing to meet the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its implementation must be right. This is, in my opinion, what we need.
Roads are passable, although most of them are ice plates
In several places in the Czech Republic roads are plates of ice and snow.
Although most of the tracks are passable, in some particular care should be careful.
Region of Karlovy Vary
This morning the roads in the region of Karlovy Vary were passable, but represented plates of ice and snow.
The temperature drops and oscilará between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day will rise slightly thermometers.
Nevar has left in the region and in low-lying areas the snow layer is thin.
By contrast, in the crestas metal mounts the snow is almost in the 30 centimetres.
In some places the visibility was still bad because of the fog, according to information from the operations control centre of the roads in the region.
The fast track R6 premier and road in the region are now passable without restrictions.
However, it is recommended to be cautious, especially in some bridges whose surface can be helada and slope.
Furthermore, they are also accessible all avenues of second and third category, including mountain roads.
However, some of them are still stretches with traces of ice and snow apisonada.
We must increase the attention on the road, especially in higher areas.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads in eastern Bohemia and in higher areas and there is a danger of frost in the mountains may have been formed a layer of snow on the tracks, reported in its pages the direction of roads and highways.
Roads to warn drivers about the danger that train operators Pardubice plates of ice, especially in higher areas of the region.
Frost can occur in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially on the roads of second and third category.
The roads I/R/43 and 34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow particularly on the roads in the mountains of Krkonoše Orlické hory.
There is a layer of snow apisonada in higher areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the area of the eastern Bohemia, the sky will today between cleared and partially nublado, without rushing.
Temperatures oscilarán usually between three and a good degree below zero, soplará a weak wind.
Pilsen region
The roads in the region of Pilsen are passable this morning, although particular care should be careful and be adapting to time.
In the early hours of the morning there frost, temperatures oscilarán between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the nevada and the subsequent drop in temperatures, some routes could also be covered in ice.
In some places, drivers will face fog, but the visibility will improve gradually.
This is what emerges from the activities of the operations control centre of roads in the region.
The motorway is D5 transitable almost without restrictions, although it recommends exercise extreme caution, especially on the road between the 80 kilometre and 131.
The surface of most of the roads in the first category is dry and without ice.
In the area of the road of Pilsen and Tachov border with Germany may have sections with plates of ice.
The paths of second and third category are wet, so that, in this case, also warns of sections with plates of ice.
Drivers should know better, especially in the less crowded routes in the area of\ xC5 umava.
Olomouc region
The drivers to go to higher areas of the region of Olomouc will find snow partially dismissed.
After the chemical treatment, there was snow in the port of červenohorské and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Operators of roads took the snow during the night; on the Road\ xC5 umper have accumulated about three centimetres of snow, according to the administrators of the tracks.
In the rest of the region, the majority of tracks are accessible without restrictions.
"In the higher parts of the Road\ xC5 umper, remnants of snow.
Drivers at the port of červenohorské will find snow means dismissed towards Jeseník," confirmed today an operator of the administration of roads of\ xC5 umper čtk.
On the ground and night went to the Jesenická also his colleagues and, after the chemical processing, the lines of the highest areas are now scattered and mojadas.
On the road from Olomouc avenues are accessible without restrictions, in the forest of\ xC5 ternberská motorists should drive with caution in the sections, where the track still wet.
Region of ústí nad Labem and Liberec region
Operators of the roads in Northern Bohemia have reported complications in various sections in the early hours of the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or ice cream, according to the database of the police the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the region of ústí nad Labem is closed.
Temperatures are below freezing, even in the lower areas, so that the ice and snow obviously remain on the road. Instead, in lower areas, particularly in the south-east of the massif central Czech, there are no problems and the roads are generally dry.
The mmento there have been no complications of service.
Operators of roads have warned of the presence of ice in the outskirts of\ xC5 tětí.
According to by meteorologists, the conditions were ideal for the night. During the day are expected rain and snow melting and in the evening the sky will be cleared and there will be ice.
Since the open road have been announced dismal conditions on the road I/13, on the border between the region of ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut for the branches of the trees that had been arqueado on the road with the weight of the snow.
\ xC5 imon Ornest: in our concerts to accumulate positive energy
He says that in less than a month will come the end of the world, what do you think about this?
It is just one of many such alarmist news to which we like agarrarnos.
The Group of the music tap tap we like rather to make jokes about this music and we like to say that we are the only group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to prevent it.
Moreover, in December organizáis a truly original project: three concerts at the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
It is a charitable Act state have been planning for two years.
We decided to use the potential of marketing that is the end of the mayan calendar enunciated 11:10 a.m. on 21 December.
The previous day, on 20 December at 9 p.m., organise 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
Kiribati will be around the same time that the mayan calendar ends on the island, in the Pacific ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, after we were building the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state as we leave the world to our children.
At the end of the mayan calendar have also created a unique collection of original articles: shoes, t-shirts, bags and key rings at the end of the world that can be acquired in www.e-tap.cz, another form of support.
The group the tap tap, along with other interpreters, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, entitled "end of the world, cancelled."
Currently it is very popular on YouTube, can be heard in the beneficial concerts?
Of course we do, and it will be just the latest, well, if all goes well and is not the end of the world...
The cantarán all the interpreters at the same time in the three concerts.
The anthems enlazarán each other simultaneously with the special broadcasting live on Czech television.
Tomáš Hanák wrote the lyrics of this song and interprets the leading role of Jesus in the complete with, where also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration?
Work together with other figures of the Czech cultural scene, apart from organising many charitable acts and concerts.
We put every effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that the majority of them are interested in and entertaining them work with us.
What will be the money raised in the concerts against the end of the world?
With equipment for the educational Center without walls Studeo we term in its sixth consecutive year with civil partnership tap in Jedličkův ústav.
The pupils at the school of Jedličkův ústav are regularly the visit of teachers with the performing amusing and interesting.
Students do not have sufficient financial resources to pay for teachers and do a efuerzo to make that possible.
As part of the completion of the works in Jedličkův ústav, there will be a separate building that we we will convey to this project.
In each concert act several groups and performers.
What are the selection criteria?
Try to draw up a programme that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will Chinaski, support Lesbiens Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, the tap tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
For more detailed information, you can consult www.kpks.cz.
Do you have plans to take another "spectacular" similar action in the future?
In May go for the first time in the festival Pražské jaro, so here probably will prepare an attractive programme with interesting guests.
Next year we would also touch on the Bohemian national Hall in New York and to me personally, while we are in the United States, I would be complemented by action in Washington and in Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, so far have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The tap tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It is not so difficult that may seem at first glance.
There are five Member in electric wheelchair, the chairs must travel for luggage in the hold and also carry much weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far we have fared well. čsa and British Airways were fully prepared, which never ceases to amaze me.
Even in Moscow, where we have recently come back, went smoothly.
Thanks to the exits abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What I have found so far?
In London, luxembourg, Madrid and other cities, everything works better than here; we have seen that in Russia, in the East, there is still a long way to go.
Unlike in Prague, Moscow is full of obstacles, there is still not often that a person moves alone for the centre of the city in an electric wheelchair.
Something as ordinary as, for example, give preference to someone in a wheelchair in a lift, there is not.
Fortunately, it has created a civil partnership that strives to focus attention the problems of people with disabilities.
Where do we must follow the example of more developed countries?
There are many ways in which we are behind...
But it is important to mention that the refinement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people it affects directly.
In London and Madrid is very normal for people with a severe disability go it alone in public and can go to the service to the museum, wherever...
But it is not very often that a large number of people with disabilities to participate actively in social life, in this regard, with the tap tap going a bit ahead!
A society respectful or without barriers is one thing, but when the time comes in which arise eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, really will change everything.
So far, they are isolated cases of people who have a great strength of character.
The group the tap tap is now very popular, but looking a few years ago, what led you to form the Group in 1998?
I entered as educador Jedličkův ústav, where he was quite young people around me who wanted to engage in something.
And since I am musician, raised, among others, the amateur saxofón, founded a group with a work colleague.
And over time, as our moderator says Láďa Angelovič, there was a little out of hand (laughter).
However, the popularity did not arrive until recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that helped us enough to connect with famous singers and also work actively to promote the group.
We came to the conclusion that the work is not, it is as if there were no.
Thanks to the support of the European Union, we can also afford quality teachers, equipment, etc.
You had intended to go so far with the tap tap?
From the outset I saw he had potential, that something can be done otherwise.
The entertainment industry is full of things that resemble each other.
It is logical, in its own way, everything new is cautiously and takes a long time to be accepted.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say that the tap tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who see us for the first time is clearly the compassion, it is a natural reaction...
But compassion is completely superfluous because people with disabilities are not left to suffer and the beings that we have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and developed, provided, of course, that has the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then, is not only a step forward for them, but for the whole of society.
Did the fact that many people's attention is a demanding boss, as he describes?
If we want to do an excellent job, we have to be rigorous in many aspects and demanding discipline.
I think it is completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and with its head in the clouds and when they hear that they must come two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend much time travelling and in concerts, the initial euphoria leaves them quickly.
But that is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and achieve something.
Currently the group the tap tap has 20 members.
How many of them were already at the beginning of 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are a group open, people enters and leaves, cannot be avoided.
Anyone who will and desire will always open doors
Will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
Will take place in Prague, Brno and Plynojem Fléda in Ostrava Incheba sand and included 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic
The three cities will be connected by the end of the evening via videoconference with together to sing the song of the group the tap tap "end of the world, cancelled '
The aim of the concert is to bring together the resources needed to finance multifunctional equipment of educational centre without barriers Studeo in Jedličkův ústav in Prague, Czech whose cost amounts to 25 million kroner.
The entry to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years have free entry into the option of selling early in Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency last week agreed to Poland as a 12th Member of this. Is the second Member of the bloc that country in Eastern Europe, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland started strong collaboration with the esa in 1994 and in subsequent years participated in the Commission of the agency projects.
However, Poland's path to the cosmos began much earlier.
The Polish enthusiasts already went to flights into space before the Second World War, although not always understood their work.
I remember, for example, the Conference of A.\ xC5 ternfeld in the astronomical observatory of warsaw where, on 6 December 1933, presented his ideas on the pioneering study "introduction to the cosmonáutica."
The ideas of the young engineer (born the 1905) left indifferent assistants and, years later,\ xC5 ternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski was the one who had shown interest in her work.
In the year 1934\ xC5 ternfeld won in France the prize Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his "introduction to the cosmonáutica."
Dr Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a great promoter of astronomy and the cosmonáutica.
Published hundreds of articles in magazines Polish and wrote a number of books on this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of the cosmonáutica, was known throughout the world and its contribution to science was rewarded when he put his name to one of the cráteres of the dark side of the moon.
Back in the year 1925 was built in Poland a dresina that was to be provided with a rocket engine.
It is unknown who was the author of the proposal and does not know the destalles project.
It is not clear whether the rocket would be used for the start of dresina or for braking.
The information on this dresina is confined to the collection in the press of the time.
From the year 1933 the Polish artillery began to devote themselves to the missiles.
The research was funded by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with the prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the material preserved, it is evident that the investigation came to the stadium of testing practices.
However, with the arrival of German troops, was interrupted research.
In the year 1937 appeared in the farming press the prototype of a missile of hunting photoelectric designed by the engineer Rohoziński and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna R rakietobomba lotnicza," the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for military use of the engines for missiles.
Provisional shortly before the war, the scientific advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) took care of all the projects of missile technology for military use and coordinated all of the work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, was interrupted by the outbreak of the war.
Other studies on the Polish cosmonáutica appeared in the press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish society of Astronáutica (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 edition of the journal Problemy first referred to society with four articles very extensive devoted to the Astronáutica.
In one of them, the prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society that would be devoted to the cosmonáutica.
At the time had already been launched projects of artificial satellites and it was obvious that the cosmic research was a forward-looking discipline.
Since the beginning of 1956 Polish society Astronáutica (PTA) aspired to be part of the international federation of Astronáutica (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that year the PTA became a full member.
The following year, the first President of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the Vice-President of the International federation of Astronáutica.
Played this position until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA participated in a meaningful way in the development of the rocket probe RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which was carried out scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was launched for the first time on 10 October 1958.
The rocket had a peak of 1.8 metres, about 80 cm and not reached the 5 kg.
Later, it ended the RM-1A version of building and testing began in the summer of 1959 Błędów two-stage rockets RM-2 air in the desert.
The rocket, measured 1.4 metres and he weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket under development would be subject to real scientific study. The rocket RM-34 was to have a peak of 14.5 km and their mission would be monitoring the wind up.
However, in 1962 were suspended business.
The successor to the first rockets of the type RM was the rocket Meteor-1, built during the years 1962 and 1965.
Was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
They developed three types (so-called Meteor-1A -1B and -1C), diferenciaban each other for the space available for scientific equipment.
In the rocket was Meteor-1A space available in the volume of Meteor-1B 0.4 litres, it is 0.34 litres and in the Meteor-1C 0,62 litres.
The height was possible in the three types of 37 km.
Between the years 1965 and 1968 was developed at the aviation institute the rocket Meteor-2 airline, whose first trials started in October 1970.
The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a useful weight of 10 kg to 60 km.
Subsequently the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 version was built.
We must also mention the entry of Poland in the COSPAR (Committee for space research) in the year 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.
As part of the programme Interkosmos, Poland joined the investigation of Soviet cósmico on artificial satellites and space, in 1978, the year the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonauta after Vladimir Remek.
The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution.
Last week the Constitutional Court suspended the law traabajos social.
The resolution was a heated discussion in society.
Existing will certainly be interesting to look at the problem from a wider level.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
Consequently, this means that the different ways economic and national economic systems are in constant conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unrestricted movement of private capital, along with the unbridled speculation.
The effect of the big differences in the cost of labour (salaries) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with imports of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and for that "causes a bajadda 'the price of competitor with the aim of taking the lion's share of the market and thus increase their profit margin.
Large-scale means, for the majority of employers, moving production abroad, buy there cheaper or disappear. The result is a high unemployment in those countries where the price of work, compared with other economies, is higher.
Because the private capital has no social responsibility and, with it, nor is it necessarily responsible for this phenomenon creates, growing unemployment social spending in the state.
This whole situation brings the total disregard for employers to pay taxes and offset the economic and social damage that caused in their pursuit of profit.
The situation is so universally known that there is no need to submit specific statistical data.
Little escrupulosas practices of private capital creates situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of those countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially lowering the standard of living of the population itself and thus attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments put private capital available to its own population without taking into account the social decline.
This is evident especially in the changes to the legislation.
The goal is to force people to accept the dictates of private capital, especially when it comes to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other, by the restricted right of employees on labour rights.
The result is a growing poverty along with the widening of the gap between rich and poor.
For a number of years in Germany, there are points of delivery of food to poor people who cannot stay with their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid arrives at the million.
In the context of increasing competitiveness of the German economy, there is a case quite frequent: people with a salary so low that the state must pay the rest to get to a bare minimum to survive.
It issued a scandal of this type on the situation of junior employees of the German Federal Parliament.
The savings of almost all the southern States of the EU, without a doubt, lead to the same situation. persons, pressured by a dismal decline of its social level, are forced to migrate as in the 19th century or malvivir with an appalling salary on the fringes of society, in the hope that one day reaches the country private investment capital.
Is it necessary preguntrarse comes from where?
In the case in question from other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or is never, as Chinese, turks, moroccans, egyptians, Indians, brazilians or African still work for a tiny portion of a European salary.
This also applies to all of Latin America.
The liberal theories and the media ad nauseam claim that the state should not bring capital into the economy, to manage the economy leads to failure.
The private equity defends tooth and nail the theory that the state should not intervene in the economy meddled in the own control.
Then, the question arises whether the private capital with its political selfishness in the March and, therefore, not influence the entire state.
In this case, the answer is clearly yes.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and ubiquitous, in all the States.
The result is a desperate situation that exists in the field of corruption, in the mutual favours, in legislation that is pretty damning everywhere but it is not a criminal offence.
In Germany the situation is this: the state ministries, for lack of funding, the drafting of draft laws to do private law firms, which are often linked to the industry.
Such bills are approved later in the Bundestag, the German Parliament.
In this way, all power emanates from the people, not as announced in the constitutions of the Western democracies, but the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that liberal democracies with a guideline are quickly into a situation that describes how Appiános in his play the crisis of the Roman republic in times of caesar and Pompeya: "the state was disintegrating and authorities were working to force."
In exchange for bribes, favors achieved illegitimately and help to finance stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread and people acudía no impediment to the polls with the vote... "there were people with character aspirara apalabrado beforehand for a post in the administration, so once, because of this disruption, the State spent eight months without consuls..." began to talk seriously of autocracy was the only remedy for a situation as serious and one had to choose a strong man... "although Appiános thought in Pompeya caesar, rose to power and transformed forever democracy in autocracy.
The conclusion, just as in the old, is that today's society is based on individual preferences insensitive of profit without taking into account the common interests.
The private capital is not capable, in essence, to understand and claim the benefits of the whole of society.
The result is the same as that of then, an unprecedented decline of the elite, without making an effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and Communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalisation of the economic systems in the 19th and 20th century.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems in favour of a liberal democracy of sorts, as a distinct break, waiting for the next blow.
The really damning fact is that the current elite completely ignores the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian disasters that we have seen, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient history and the most recent.
The suspension of the law on public contracts is not the solution, at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek other ways to reduce the standard of living of the population.
This trend is, therefore, systemic.
The solution involves concrete socio-political reforms that strengthen both the involvement of the state's capital and the influence of citizens in the government and weaken the monopoly position of private equity in the company for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the laboratory of chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could" (there is no violence and no could do so), sting in his song fragile and whose refrain: 'Let's do not forget how fragile we are' (let us not forget how fragile we are).
"If my children did not want war, there would be no" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his death bed in the year 1849.
After the latest waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza strip, have emerged, as always, mixed reactions.
One, on the side of Israel, argued in favour of the right of self-defense and encasilla to palestinians in the role of terrorists. The other supports to the palestinians and alleged racism on the part of the state of Israel, accusing Israel of state terrorism and genocide perpetrated against palestinian arabs.
I do not want to focus on who is to blame for the killings which occur regularly and who is the victim. After all, today's citizens of Israel, including the Autonomous territories, born within the current political situation and not lived the beginning of the violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look to discover who take advantage of the tensions that are dragging on for 95 years (measured from the 1917 Balfour declaration, in November) in a small area of land in the Middle East.
Some of my observations are based on historical facts, other conclusions that I arrived on the basis of my own way to understand the issue, on who or what group of people is the main driver of the events in modern history.
In the history of mankind's history of the struggles for power is in the front row.
Every time we can find an Alexander the Great or a napoleon.
But what is no longer so clear is whether these characters were always the directing his footsteps autonomously or whether anyone behind his throne had aimed its actions toward a specific goal.
We must accept that we live in an era that concentrates wealth in the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of power and money that this implies, has not been able to get in a single generation.
Astronomically wealthy stresses that could be considered the most prominent of these families (if there is still someone behind, I do not know, but do not rule that out): the Rothschild.
Not much is written about them.
Of course.
In the 1990s the 19th century bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating its name with very serious criminal acts. The power and wealth, or both, I covered the back, which for them always meant a strengthening.
Have major stakes in almost all the world's central banks and in those countries where they are not represented, or is preparing a war has been declared: before the attack on Afghanistan were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq were 5, after overthrowing gaddafi only four, but Russia has since remained subject the Central Bank to the Russian Government.
Anyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state central bank's the Rothschild, Bank of America began during the war of secession to print money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theatre.
Jfk began to print money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (edf) and was assassinated in 1963; congressman Louis erm Fadden was poisoned the year 1936 after trying to Sue the FED for having triggered the great crash 1929.
Its global thirst for power led them over the years 1859 - 1871 to devise a plan with three world wars, devised by the masón Albert Pike, decorated with the degree 33.
The first war was set as an objective of eliminating the big royal states across Europe; the second would eliminate the colonial supremacy, especially in Britain, and the third was aiming to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and one billion people (this amount of slaves to their well-being and luxury sufficient energy and not so many resources), in addition to the creation of a world religion (the ecumenism is nothing more than a blueprint for such a settlement) and the final adoption of the absolute powers.
The method by which the group operates from richer families, along with the Rothschild, follows the dynamic of the onset of crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (ab order cao - order out of chaos.)
These solutions are, however, always wrong, and carry a worsening of the situation. If not, just remember that the FED was created not to allow a crisis such as the 1907.
So, following the success of the assassination of the heir to the austro-hungarian throne, Franz ferdinand in Sarajevo, and after that, as a result, the First World War broke out, trashed the tsarist Russia with the start of the bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended so sudden and unjustified militarily and economically, the capitulation of Germany (wars to end the tsarist Russia were unnecessary) and the subsequent break-up of the great power of central Europe, the austro-hungarian empire.
To prepare the ground for the second world war, allowed bankers and politicians to create, covertly, a difficult situation in the wake of the massive war reparations imposed on Germany, which were created optimum conditions for the radicalisation of the impoverished masses, then I was enough to the germans the Führer's solution, which was strong enough and simple and noted to blame, and then build a czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities represented so well and with a strong German minority who should play the role of the fifth column, which ignited the flame and caused the outbreak of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild led the foundation of the zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with jerusalem as its capital - return to zion).
The aforementioned Balfour declaration, laid the foundations for the mass immigration of Jews to palestine and began the first conflict with the Arab population.
Produced terrorist attacks on both sides.
The World War II erupted: it is difficult to know whether Hitler threw too of the rope that had drawn international bankers in principle or if all he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created optimum conditions for accepting the jewish state in the global society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similarly to the way in which repairs of war imposed on Germany paved the way for the second world war, with the declaration of the state of Israel was created the focus for a third war.
If international bankers winning start, the jewish nation, as in the Second World War, would become a victim in the front line of combat, now with the generally Arab or Muslim population in the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a welding machine and chaos, not only in the context of their country, but also internationally. For example, take the divide so blunt sympathizers and opponents of Israel.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the israeli-palestinian conflict? where injustice breeds injustice in an endless spiral of violence, whether it was at the beginning of all the greed of some individuals and global thirst for power?
At this point we must distinguish between the people of Israel and its leaders, because, as happens in our country, international bankers just before their candidates in the elections.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is a typical example of fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, which makes every effort to declare war on Iran, and, given that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would become a global conflict and, bearing in mind that Iran controls the strait of hormuz, through which passes 20% of all oil shipping corridor (the world has only two miles across), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In light of what are now the speech David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order."
The new world order in his imagination is a world of gentlemen and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the financial aristocracy well accommodated.
A world in which every new individual he shoots a chip at birth that controls all your being.
"And requires all, large and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to a mark on the right hand or in the front, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they carry the name of this monster or the numbers of his name.
It is necessary to understand: anyone with two fingers in the face, which leads the numbers of this monster.
The number marks to the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six."
Film Argo: if it is crude, draws on Hollywood
In November 1979 the manifestation of a group of islamist students occupied the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 graduates as hostages.
His release would be in exchange for destronado Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, which after the revolution fled to us, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
The situation for the American administration did not offer any positive perspective: throw the Shah overboard could not afford it, because, if it endangered the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the formation of the theocratic regime, was not available to us.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which then escalated further with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The diplomats were released imprisoned 444 negotiating days after the intervention of government of algeria.
In the US, its fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
The failure in Iran has played a decisive role in the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film "Argo" the director and actor Ben Affleck tematiza an episode of this story, which reaped a small success for America.
Shortly before holding the embassy, escaped six employees of the building.
After a complicated voyage, ended in the residence of the canadian Embassy.
CIA covert, in collaboration with the canadian authorities, managed to keep them out of Iran, this was a story a flamboyant point: film came with canadian passports, as members of a team looking at the location in the country for making an overproduction of science fiction.
Gender mix
The plan drew the expert in "slipping" Tony Mendez required cooperation again Hollywood.
So that the lie seems accurate, wrote on the film project in specialist magazines, press conferences were organised, the society of fictitious production had even a real office.
Details of the operation was kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of various genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie ', the story of an episode that went well, a deception (an example may be the series ocean's rise).
In the film are moods. are on the one hand sequences well documented in Tehran. In the flagship credit sequence shown photographs of the time of the events, which were enshrined in the same way in the film; there are not many differences here.
On the other, scenes typical of Hollywood somewhat lighter, marked by the irony and a slight exaggeration.
Furthermore, scenes from the centre of the CIA and other institutions: men trajeados that analyse the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, by telephone.
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been subjected to ridicule, has become a respectable director and its behaviour has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
It is his third largometraje, small after "goodbye, goodbye" (2007) and the thriller the town. "city of thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it is the first film from Affleck in which the action takes place not in the city of Boston, where they raised me.
Furthermore, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a feature of putting old movie directors over standards of Hollywood.
And Affleck demonstrates in Argo, where Tehran is "wheel" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film takes place in the streets, in the reconstruction of events truthful. The introductory sequence of the takeover of the embassy is impressive for its capacity sinóptica trasmite which, at the same time, the thrill of uncertainty and the lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, the story takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators achieves a similar effect on the fictional scenes (the team imposter in the bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that a story explained film does not offer much in the way of the scenes most intriguing.
And it manages quite well. Sometimes it adds something to the reality: here is not quite so elegant (the scene when crises hit at the airport in Tehran, the diversion of a call to America and the pursuit after its runway become crazy).
The weakness of Argo is the fact that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman has a very funny role as participants from Hollywood, although its characters deserved more space and are certainly not alone in this film.
For these reasons, the film of Affleck loses a little hint of drama, but it is a film to proceed with a moderate interest, assess their performance and style retro thriller that evokes the 1970s.
But that collapses, it will be difficult.
As a reminder of a true story and exaggerated as evidence of how that can be the notions of omnipresence and omnisciencia of the secret services, is sufficient.
Rules for the bloated balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which each year submits a survey on bank charges more absurd, has now decided to announce the competition on "the regulation or the most absurd ideas of the EU's workshop."
"It happened after the last event, the EU intends to adopt a 40% quota for women in management positions in large European companies," explained Právo Patrik Nacher, the organiser of the survey.
Among the nominated absurd nonsense "is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women are aventajaban of objectively better prices in life insurance because they represent a lower risk.
"Other incredible ideas from the workshop of the EU can be proposed by the people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," reported Nacher.
Among the controversial regulations in the EU is mandatory, for example, the addition of biocomponentes fuel that, as a result, damage to the environment; another ban is the use of mercury thermometers life only because they contain a small amount of a hazardous substance or guideline sombre the size of cages for hens, which has contributed to the significant increase in the price of eggs this year.
The ban has been criticised factual use the expression "butter," or the withdrawal of the traditional light bulb in the shops.
A banana quality must have a length of 14 centimetres.
The apparatus of the Union takes such decisions often under pressure from either commercial or industrial lobbies, whose demands in Brussels are normally held by any State or group of states - the Czech Republic, even with the threat of a veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the petition, for example, that the best quality bananas should take in the EU a length of at least 14 centimetres and could not present "curvaturas abnormal."
The European Commission defended itself by saying that it only seeks to harmonise national rules not homogeneizadas to date, which only complicaban marketing.
The rules relating to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been watered down on the basis that the existing directive entails a waste of edible.
The candidate to win the poll could be the prescription of the US last year under which the balloons inflables traded is mandatory warning that children under 8 years are not allowed to inflarlos without the supervision of an adult.
The EU referred here to an American study under which, when it comes to toys, balloons are the leading cause of infant death by asphyxiation.
It is also present a similar restriction applies to the use of matasuegras by children of up to 14 years.
Curious Ocurrencias born even in our country
Equally absurd regulation on European officials: anyone who has any official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. Not to offend the sensitivities of Greece, should we talk of former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with the Association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominó in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the prescription of the Union on the volume of food provisions in the territory of a Member State.
The EU ruled the maximum volumes of supplies of food that can be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the EU.
Later, the Czech Republic went through, for example, the required amount for canned mushrooms, which he had a substantial threat of fines.
To the organisers of the survey were also interested the occurrence of pay to those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of providing funding for the Grant application.
This kind of ideas were not in Brussels but in Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact of not having sea.
We call on the European Union compensation," declared in the autumn of 2004 the then agriculture Minister Jaroslav spades (čssd).
He argued with the fact that in our country they produced much grain and, as a result of the so-called intervention buying, the state had the warehouses full and had to be exported.
According to spades, given that the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was prepared to help the Czech Republic and organised a public tender for the purchase of grain from those countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy to receive a Grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for local development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). Specifically, is bound to the drafting of applications for grants from Brussels.
EU: rare prescriptions are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often targets of criticism, the efforts of the EU in terms of regulations and also a more effective functioning and development throughout the Union deserve more, according to some experts, our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the recovery of EU funding for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but that the Member States have made in the budget negotiations.
The czechs also have the heartstrings, in the same way as other countries in the Union, the fight for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has always come out well in these pugnas.
The czechs, after six years of disputes with German and austrian, successfully defended the designation of origin of requesón Olomouc, but had to go ahead and change its name to national rum, whose tradition in our country goes back to the 19th century, and became known as "tuzemák."
Only products made from already distilled from sugar cane can be so-called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the EU's official list of protected designations of Origin, together with the feta cheese and gorgonzola known around the world, the German town mazapán Lübeck or Parma ham, already include for example the biscuits Karlovy Vary žatec Pohořelice, carp and Třeboň and, indeed, the variety of hops.
As maras protected by the EU, can be proud of the bread jengibre Pardubice and Hořice barquillos V Podkrkonoší.
People want to save the Republic, but I am an amateur, says Okamura
Mr Senator, how he happened to run in the elections for President?
It is not to be Senator or President.
If it were all right, then I would submit my candidacy.
But I cannot bear to see stolen in the last 20 years in our country, how the thieves go unpunished, increasing taxes and the retirement age.
Had no ambitions to be political.
When I see something that I do not like, trying to come up with a solution to change.
And since I am 40 years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to stand as a senator or President.
The Senate has already arrived, but soon after has been on the way to the presidency.
Is he not turning their backs on those people who voted?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results in the Senate elections.
Later stated that if was elected Senator, would present my candidacy for the presidency.
But my aim is not the role; the role is the tool with which I can make my own ideas.
Why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we in the bar or in front of the television, but we ride roughshod over anyone who wants to start a change.
Added to this is the media, you discredit and confuse the freedom of expression with the freedom of lying.
For me is said to have bribed to journalists or that I was Jiří Paroubek adviser.
We are going to talk about their ideas.
It is presented to the presidential fight with thesis financial and criminal accountability of politicians and the declaration of property over $20 million.
That must change the law.
As the President does not have this competition and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How can you resolve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a lobby group for the job of guide to be recognised as self-employment, and we did.
The problem is politics: if someone comes with a good proposal, either right or left, is about and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential to obtain the support of all the groups.
Without encasillamientos or party dogma, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Is it more a man of right or left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people I considered more left-wing.
For me it is not important, be it a little left or a little right.
What matters to me is that we come out ahead.
I do not care if someone is right or left, I want to bring people together.
Always support openly any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal from the ksčm or the ODS and, in the same way, I am against bad ideas.
A joke's attention when it says that it is populist.
But it is not showing on what he says?
When it creates a business plan for the company, you have certain goals and ideals.
And you try acercarte to them.
Some will call it populism, but all the proposals that I spoke already operate in the world or known experts talk about them.
But without the support of Parliament only remain slogans.
And so cannot survive in the long term policy.
Or do you think that if he is going to people and talk to them, will, for example, a criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no other option.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and trying to put them on my part to achieve this.
If elected President, there would be no problem to organise a broadcasting live on television to urge the leaders of the parliamentary parties legitimaran criminal responsibility for financial and political, state officials, judges and prosecutors.
And, eventually, they would have to communicate why do not want it.
If there is a strong character who says disputes, it can put pressure on the political stage.
Take for instance the direct election of the President, who has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I say that I am just an amateur, I am not a genius or an intellectual.
For my views and ideals attempt seek allies.
I start in politics and try to get the broadest possible support for my programme.
Try getting things through myself, but if it is not well, in six years I will leave and return to the private sector.
Sounds a bit like Okamura outside to save the Czech Republic.
I am no savior.
I know that with someone I do nothing, so I have visited a number of well-known personalities, if perhaps animaran to submit his nomination to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but refused because he had much work.
For my part, at least I have supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, which brought to light the fraud with heating oils light.
I stood on the basis that people are really disappointed, I am now in the balance.
Sixty per cent of the population turned out to vote, and those who did not, voted for representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate are two of the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so that will be difficult to achieve change.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming his own party?
I have not yet seen it because I do not have time to check on flawless potential of each of the members of the party, nor have the money.
I have no money or for the campaign for the presidency, in my mind open there are only 20,000 kroner.
Has no money?
Talk of statements of property, how is it yours?
I think my private property in some 60 million.
In Prague have a ground valued at 25 million, a flat worth 10 million, another apartment tasado in eight million, a collection of works of art with a value of 10 million, a Aston Martin of around 3.5 million and a\ xC5 koda Superb valued at one million, and I have a couple of million in the account.
By the way, I have a Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. I always liked James Bond, who was driving the car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fighting the evil words and deeds and injustices.
Will lead a Aston Martin, their property is valued at 60 million and has no money for the campaign?
's attention says he wants to change the Republic but does not put too much money on their side.
It is not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
I endeudarme?
In the campaign have already made 2.5 million.
The fact that there is no sponsor shows that there is little interest in my programme.
And I do not have the obligation to pay the campaign with money from my pocket.
The costs of the campaign covered in essence we get in the form of salary of Senator.
But I could not live. For example, could not pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 kroner a month.
If I just make money, then I do not present as a candidate.
So we will continue with their business to live?
Is it not said earlier that he was going to stop this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I promised, in part I made my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will be my substitute in the spring.
People wanted to be the samaritan salvase the Republic.
But I also need to live.
How accustomed to win monthly as a businessman?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which still winning.
If he were President, then leave the business.

The study of architecture MVRDV shows that the real adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Library of Spijkenisse and the recently completed "mountain of books" - 2 photos
"I believe that the building is fun, futuristic looks, and finally there is something interesting to do," said Lisette Verhaig, a transeúnte running through the streets.
And Stefan Spermon, technical it in a large company located near the Library, notes: "the building is beautiful."
But I wonder why we need a Library today.
We all have Internet, tablets and e-books.
Nobody falls for fun in these libraries passé, isn't it?
Spijkenisse bedroom, a town located on the edge of rotterdam that barely deserves a fleeting visit, holds the dubious honour of having taken a record to be forgotten.
The population of 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest literacy rate in the netherlands.
To counter this embarrassment, some years ago we decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copy the seven bridges fake euro notes are represented in the form of concrete miniaturas armed decoradas.
The success of the offensive education was limited.
And that was how policymakers decided that there was a possibility to improve the statistics - we had to build a Library.
Winy Maas, of the Dutch study of architecture MVRDV, a master in the art of the bar diagrams and responsible for buildings fun while cynics, took issue with his usual calm and came to the presentation of the contest in 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile on the face.
And while the jury looked baffled around her shoulders and encogía, Maas proceeded to stockpiling books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the words: "dear fellow citizens:
Here you, my proposal to the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, the so-called'Boekenberg." '
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million was closed as planned.
It is part of the revitalization project, which is supplemented by an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of homes and buildings adosados.
In early November the mountain of books was awarded the second prize "best Library of NL 2012."
In addition, the project is also nominated for "Dutch national Wood award 2012."
In this way, the small town bereft of history, which until now had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly city following whose white façade one intuiría rather a dairy plant, now has a piece of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first building cultural public in its history.
The long road to the book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a quesera.
It is true that there is a lift that goes back right at the heart of this mountainous massif, but the real lovers of space and reading not using it, but prefer merged with its topography at each step of his rise to the top.
The interior is completely acristalado bright and easy to cover with a brick, soil recocido and the elegant street lamps unequivocally support the condition of the public Library.
The urban environment is perfect.
In raising the view may come to see the Park's benches, dogs and children playing football.
And all around books, books and more books.
"Normally the shelves of books are prepared over the facade and the centre was opened a huge dark room that generally tends to be rather awkward and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we have done is to upside down the classic shape interior space and make the area of reading abroad.
The Interior of the mountain is very well taken: in the middle are the offices, the Library of the Internet, the chess club, the Center for environmental education and the maintenance room.
The black shelves deserve special mention to assume the functions of coating mural, parapeto barandilla and at the same time.
The sight, touch and the nostrils are strangers.
Even the civil engineers and architects more up-to-date shake their heads when they hear talk of this material is unknown.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst Spijkenisse, head of the project in the town.
And that is how one day, in a farm friesland, we have the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields of the netherlands a few millimetres thick plastic fabric is used as a basis for secured the roots of crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine fabric lasts two seasons and then dismissed.
For the Library this fabric prensó, for the first time in such quantities, to obtain planks of four centimetres thick.
With the heat and the pressure, the so-called plastic agricultural (KLP) color changes and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smacks of a mixture of new car and zapatilla of sport.
After 105 rungs get to the top of the mountain.
At the end of this route of continued almost 500 metres around the mountain lies the reward: from the bar is not only has a fantastic view of the city, but also that it can enjoy the delicious Dutch croquetas and its ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a congenial atmosphere to the couple who keep the right atmospheric moisture to this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new Soul
"Although perish the thought given its large there, this building is an exemplary project glass surfaces which on the ecology," says Trouborst.
The heating and cooling needed gained from geothermal power.
Despite the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even in the more sunny days the sun shines only for a few hours in his home.
The enormous wooden cerchas located across the facade of glass used to shadow and absorb most of the rays of the sun.
This creates a climate comfortable home.
The rest is left to pull the shutters automatic.
Stefan Spermon, the sceptical of information technology worker, already has dared to get a foothold in the new Library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Equally, the traditional Chinese medicine Professor Cynthia Bogarde try has visited the Library. It calls the "Boekenberg late 'and the' soul 'of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, at which took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book of his private collection.
In this way is to fill a Library, optical moment, the gaps that still does not have its entire archive; currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept has appreciated.
The shelves are full.
"There is nothing worse than a Library half empty," says the architect Winy Maas.
"I believe that thanks to our initiative all the people now have a certain affinity with this building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the Library.
Although he is only there to embellish.
In this way, the study MVRDV has achieved a success in that discipline prevails in the specialist argot is known as "creation of an identity."
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece in the history of literature.
Regardless of how young and inculta that may be.
Finally a starting point to shape its identity.
Szabo: "The germans must play a more substantive role '
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert in US relations. UU.-Europa, this puts Berlin in a diplomatic position rather trickier.
Deutsche Welle: earlier this week, Germany hinted they would vote against the proposal to Grant the palestinians the status of observer state of the United Nations.
However, finally Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, because of the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time I believe it supports the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the political upheaval in libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it was was to establish a zone of flight ban.
It has finally been declared by NATO.
Germany finds it difficult to take a clear position when important international issues are at stake?
Yes, it is.
This is because it is currently with his foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the germans are at a crossroads.
Of them are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to do so.
I think we still are operating extremely close to what its role, but have already begun the journey towards a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to the countries such as France or Britain.
What "normal" means a foreign policy from a German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is prepared to defend positions different to the United States and its European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is a strong motivation in economic policy, that is, in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The German economic interests are somewhat different from those of other great powers and that is why Germany must protect their interests.
Are these economic interests have influenced the position regarding the conflict in the Middle East and in the vote of the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the gulf.
For this reason must be careful and not alienate itself from the Arab public opinion, nor of Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give such importance as it is not a totally one-sided relationship.
However, we play a fundamental role in the German considerations.
Germany has undermined its relationship with us to abstain from voting in important decisions such as in the vote on palestine?
I believe in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys a great deal of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been a break as drastic as in the case of libya.
Perhaps with that Germany has managed to gain some respect.
After all, it has only show that it is a country that, taken seriously as an international player and whose interests must be taken into account.
In Europe there are different opinions about the palestinian initiative.
In contrast, US was clearly in favour of a veto.
Is there disparity of views between us and many European nations?
There have always been these disparities due to American domestic politics.
I think that the Obama administration is secretly a great understanding towards the European position.
But, because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot defend in public that position.
I believe that the real differences of opinion really does not have the scale attributed to him.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu: Obama is not at all happy with the policy that develops.
Does Germany finds it difficult to reconcile the close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I believe that that is precisely what makes it so difficult for the germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a superior being, but must push things from its own position.
That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will assume a leadership role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, simply because of the link to Israel.
This has always been a thorny issue.
But I think the germans have clear that must play the role of independent figure.
Is Germany itself in the role of major international player? would in fact Germany take a leading role?
Or maybe it is still proving difficult to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet been used, it is always a little embarrassed and, for obvious reasons, it is costing the country to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see every time Germany positions itself as a major player, loosened some antialemanes feeling.
This is not easy for the germans.
It is an old problem and is that nobody wants to be surrounded by the countries enemies.
Seen in this light, Germany is in a much more difficult position than us.
Must show a receptive attitude to the differing views and neighbours and that is not easy.
The influence of us in European politics increasingly falls, but the EU does not cover that gap, then who is?
The germans will have no choice but to take a more central role.
Even if they do not, if it is unpleasant or if you become a people even more unpopular, C'est la vie!

"Protection of trademarks in China:" When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a brand known worldwide and Polo Ralph Lauren too.
But what is Armani pole?
After this name is a designation officially registered in China but that has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, there is protection while the real epónimos not submit a demand.
And even then it is not clear that they will agree.
"Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch's lawyer, law firm Taylor Wessing specialised in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Each week a new case reaches my desk.
The Putin imitators simply add a couple of letters to register their brands.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada is Prada-Kny.
German companies are also copy legally in the same way, as has happened to sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a archivador in which holds seats of the trademarks bureau in beijing.
On 14 September 2010 a Chinese company called registering the brand Zegna DF Puma artificial, a name that is also served in the House of fashion Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in this of copying and violating intellectual property rights is well-known.
In the cities there are large stores of various plants devoted exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, cases of Pattloch are of a different kind. On behalf of their clients, he fight against the fact that the trademarks bureau officially granted to Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it, 'Bang Ming Pai "or accompanying brand.
The word comes from the Chinese word "Bang Dakuan,"
That refers to women who have "fish" to a wealthy man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It is bad for the business, we have to fight this," requires Pattloch.
"The brand is broken, the monopoly position disappears and the damage of the image is enormous."
The financial losses and the coast of procedural billions of sectors are affected, especially in the case of luxury flagship products.
According to the market analysis firm CLSA, with a volume of $15 billion per year in size, China is the third of luxury goods and the fastest-growing market.
However, achieving the annulment of inscriptions of dubious legality in the register of brands is complicated and also makes a lot of money.
The process can be extended to nine years and the outcome is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a demand that so much time had passed the name to the already had become a "fact of market demand."
"If the complainant is bad luck, perhaps even have to pay money to plagiador because the process that has damaged the brand in China," says Pattloch.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best-known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against the manufacturer of construction machinery Sany, the company that has recently been taken over by the German manufacturer of concrete pumps Putzmeister.
That is why today the Chinese can continue using a very similar to the star of Mercedes emblem.
The buyer of Volvo, Geely, he initially used a blue and white logo that largely BMW; the matter is dirimió in court and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste clothing manufacturer lost in China against Putin imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, which represented a turning in the opposite direction to the original crocodile logo.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The trademarks bureau CTMO in beijing recognises that in 2010 have had difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however," The emergency labour returned to normal."
In this way, the number of complaint processes without processing has been reduced by 22%.
Nearly 57, 000 of these cases were resolved resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81.500 claims are still pending.
Combating this costs a lot of money
As is customary in China, the numbers are striking.
Last year the CTMO recorded more than 1.4 million applications for protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010.
It is a new record and means that China champions for the tenth consecutive year the list of new applications throughout the world, notes the trademarks bureau.
It seems that this also applies to the number of valid logos, a figure that amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011 would have pocketed 1.8 billion yuan in concept of rights.
In other words, this means that on average each Registration costs 1.280 yuan or 160 euros.
Combating that costs a lot of money, as demonstrated by the case of the German family firm Freudenberg.
For more than seven years the Chinese group fighting in the courts against a copier.
While the germans have been able to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation spare car,
The copier has managed to secure the Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
"We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany the surnames are not protected," says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman and adviser Freudenberg delegate chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trademarks bureau CTMO also dismissed the appeal of the muniqueses.
In the subsequent two bodies have given him right Freudenberg, but the other side still struggling today.
We must be extremely careful
Now the case has come to the gates of the High Court of Justice, which remains outstanding.
Wentzler hopes to settle for the point and praised the professionalism of the courts.
However, it also says that "the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time."
It is difficult to estimate the internal costs; the archive business has had to review files of up to 100 years old to give evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the other side a "sum of EUR six figures in" with the aim of reaching an amicable agreement, but failed.
"This shows how much we care," says Wentzler.
The dangers that lurk in the Far East threaten to overtake Europe,
Particularly if the Putin imitators will assure there duties on not protected brands.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products in Germany.
The group long ago abandoned this commercial area, but failed to prevent the registration.
"It has to be extremely careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch recommend to German companies that are extremely cautious about doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on the international law on the rights of brand, but what we have to do is "record in China everything which may also be eligible for protection," as noted Wentzler.
Otherwise, the issue can be much more expensive than a simple registration.
In fact, in the event that Freudenberg lost the last round of their particular battle, would then have to pay the other side licence fees on his own behalf, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question us expulsarían market.
World AIDS Day: dance, sing, help
In Heidelberg is trying the chorus Imbongi and rejoicing in swaziland AIDS orphans
The story of a link to overcome much more than 8.733 kilometres away.
First it starts with the dance: cowboy boots, tacón basketball shoes, shoes and mocasines looking up on the parquet floor, and find them quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then begin to rise slowly the voices of singers (contralto, low, tenor and soprano) arremolinándose entorpeciéndose and siguiéndose each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the Director of 29 years, threatens to get almost of their boxes to bring order to his vigorous and gentle gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of medical psychology of Heidelberg the chorus Imbongi is trying a new song.
Also reached the 50 singers, aged between 23 and 69 years, since the human genetista until the house husband.
"Om Obani '" is not an easy piece, every voice of the choir has a different text and in a foreign language barely known: the zulú, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and swaziland in some areas.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate by unaids, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS, around the world there are approximately 34 million people infected with the HIV virus.
Contribution of 23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
In swaziland there are 245.000 orphans of AIDS.
More than 40% of the population is already positive.
The partnership voices for Africa has found in Germany Esitjeni godparents to the village's 180 orphans of AIDS.
Seventy of them attend secondary school.
By 15 or 20 per month you can endorse a child.
This contribution will cover the plate of school, the uniform and guarantee him a warm meals per day in the Gogo center.
Stories "or" panegirista Imbongi means in zulú "storyteller."
Nobody in this Chamber knows speak fluently this bantu language, but claim they know.
Ten years ago this chorus is trying songs in this soft foreign language which can sometimes carry them to their place of origin: South Africa.
8.733 miles away in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Kingdom of swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni depends on the voices of this German Choir.
The 40 percent is infected
About 2,000 people live there, some even in simple shacks of mud and straw, a large proportion of them are children.
More than 300 have no parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects swaziland - the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to Unicef.
The people struggled with circumcision, a practice which has been shown reduces by half the risk of contagion.
More than 40% of people in swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and die with more than 30 years has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the chorus discovered this recóndita population, but above all that we saw were many children in the streets that were not only from the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothes and training.
School with no qualifications, the possibilities in a poor country are more than SLIM.
At first it was just the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child outside the College and disfrutara a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year after the chorus founded the association "voices for Africa that since then there has been" professionally for AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the ETS of bacterial origin are the syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrea.
The ETS from vírico more common are AIDS, the papilloma virus, the herpes genital or hepatitis.
The ladillas and sarna are among the ETS spread by parasites.
What are the main groups of affected?
The syphilis and the gonorrea occur more frequently in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute works on the assumption that at least four out of five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have their origin in a sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults sexually transmitted diseases are more common chlamydia infections, tricomonas, the papilloma virus, the candidiasis (hongo) and the gonorrea.
The spread of HIV among the heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections are in this group.
Among the young, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European poll, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years.
In our country, the papilloma virus also adds to the most prevalent diseases among the young.
How has changed the number of infections?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled its number of 1.697 cases in 2001 to 3.698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections continues a downward trend since 2007.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
It is a tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a disease venérea?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, trouble urinating, flow, abdominal pain, as well as ampollas or verrugas.
Often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore not detected.
How can you protect?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through dirt and infections by physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regularly subjected to medical examinations, especially if we change often of sexual partner.
The majority of the ETS can be cured if diagnosed early, and it is possible to avoid any result late.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees they charged the chorus for its actions across Germany, coming to collect enough money.
"In total we have had about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni proud," says Annette Lennartz, President of the Association.
In the very people Zodwa Dlamini a confident woman and qualities of leadership manages the money sent from Germany.
Deals with the orphans find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogos zulú," as they are called in older women, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have until 14 orphans in office, offer them a roof where live and take care of children to come to school every day promptly and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who do not have anyone to remain under the protection of Khanyisile, an unmarried woman who, like the two cooks who are responsible for cooking every day for more than 200 starving children, receives a salary of the partnership.
Furthermore," voices of Africa "has set up a school of tailoring, has built two barns and, in collaboration with the American Health Organization PSI, has made many of the village's inhabitants have been subject to an HIV test.
This is not obvious, since, despite the apparent that this disease is all over the country, not usually speak openly about it.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
A rarity in a country where the king is officially 14 wives.
Black Africa's last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for his affluent lifestyle and full of excesses.
Polygamy rather than democracy.
This way of life not officially accepted is largely responsible for the spread so fast that has made the HIV virus in recent decades.
But it is also due to the myriad seasonal who travel the country from one side to another, and they are where they are going.
According to Annette Lennartz," in any corner you can get free condoms, but these are hardly used.
Here is another culture, only accept the skin against skin contact."
To encourage cultural exchange, the chorus Imbongi travels every two or three years for southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, pugnacity, hope and confidence in the black, songs that many in the southernmost end of the African continent still recall of the apartheid era.
A bus full of white singing songs in a language of black; both recognition not only brings an excellent atmosphere and arrancarle very pleasing, but has also made a couple of tears to some rabioso border that another soldier.
The journey leads them always Esitjeni, where the singers visiting children apadrinados.
In spite of the fact that this small population barely appears on maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is widely known.
"Acércate Esitjeni, there is the light," says local people.
And after doing the 8.733 miles in a straight line back to Heidelberg street until the trial chambers Bergheimer full of singers dictate the step, you realise that it is also possible to see shine your light from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on mercury
The probe Messenger has found evidence of the existence of ice on mercury.
Probably the ice has a thickness of up to 20 metres.
Nasa, the American Space Agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on mercury.
Despite being the closest planet to the sun, there are also water helada specialist, as emerged from three studies published Thursday in the journal "science."
The probe Messenger would have found evidence that in the area of the planet that is constantly in the shadow has been formed a layer of ice.
It seems that it has at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 metres thick.
The water is presumably from comets or asteroids that collided at the time, most likely, against mercury.
No one blamed the discovery of ice with the possibility of life on the planet, says the chief investigator of the probe Messenger, sean Solomon.
The temperature in mercury can reach up to 426 degrees celsius.
However, the findings could help explain how the water and other components of life have arrived in other parts of the solar system.
So completely unnoticed for the inhabitants of planet Earth, the probes, and small robots such as the Telescope, is dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time send images to earth: small windows to the immensity of space.

In this cloud of stars, along with the shadowy Roseta, also constantly arise new star; 5,000 light years from earth.

The researchers assume that was formed shortly after the big Bang, when the universe was found particularly hydrogen.
Our window on the universe: the most important Telescope
It seems that the Telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey 1608, before Galileo Galilei used a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical Telescope, has stopped growing and images that give us increasingly have depth.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Telescope Hale situated in the centre near San Diego pigeons was the largest in the world.
Its mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five metres.
In Arizona, USA., closed the large Binocular Telescope.
This allows observing the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The Interior of the great canary Telescope located on the island of La Palma is enormous - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 metres.
The mirror of the southern African large Telescope in South Africa is segmentado to save costs.
Despite this, has a diameter of approximately 11 metres.
The downside of this construction is more economical than the Telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so their mobility is limited.
The Telescope Hobby-Eberly in Texas also has a fixed angle of elevation.
Their particularity is its enormous capacity to collect light.
Despite having a diameter of mirror comparatively smaller, this ability is matched by that of the world's largest mirror Telescope.
With the help of Arecibo radiotelescopio (puerto rico) researchers can explore the universe in search of signs of life heading.
The radiotelescopio has a diameter of 305 metres.
In the "search for intelligence heading" (SETI by its acronym in English) can help anyone who has a computer, providing processing capacity.
View the European southern observatory (that) located in the chilean Andes.
Here was the very large Telescope, a Telescope to live up to its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this Telescope can also illuminate the spectrum infrarrojo medium.
The that also will host the so-called E-ELT (European extremely large Telescope or European extremely large Telescope).
Its primary mirror cover 42 metres and will consist of a total of 1,000 reflectantes elements.
Until 2018 is not expected to take pictures.
Until 2007, the two Telescope Keck located in the Kea volcano hawaiano of Mauna were considered the world's largest.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 metres.
The Telescope Keck form part of the Kea observatory Mauna, which alongside them explores the sky with the help of the Telescope Subaru and IRTTF.
On Kea Mauna is planning to build a new Telescope mirror of enormous proportions and with a diameter of 30 metres.
This is a picture of how it would be.
However, the most important information in the cosmos comes hand in hand with the Hubble space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990 sends images of distant galaxies.
Since March 2009, the space Telescope Kepler seeks planets extrasolares, mainly those that are livable.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that since the start of his mission had been located 1.235 candidate planets.
In the image are the final preparations prior to the launch of the space Telescope Kepler.
The James Webb space Telescope Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The space Telescope's primary mirror has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the functions of this Telescope will seek the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big Bang.
Researchers from the basis that there are ice on the South pole of mercury.
However, there is no hard evidence, as the probe Messenger revolves around the planet in an orbit much closer to the north pole.
For decades the radar measurements suggest the existence of ice on mercury.
Thanks to the probe Messenger (2004), the first to orbita on mercury, scientists now have the certainty that is so.

A search for fingerprints in a country in which people of 97 years are still considered young.
The journey through the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as savage and romantic.
The minibús moves with great commotion through the between road that passes the side of forest hills, rivers of wealth and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think that is in the black forest.
However, we are in the southernmost area of azerbaijan; the border with Iran is just a few miles from here.
Here are the "talyshi" well, a people that does not know much, apart from that dominate the persian and the azeri and are very longevos.
Our destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts a robust architecture perhaps too we have here designed in the Soviet era and that does not seem to fit that into such a scenic mountainous landscape.
The European tourists barely come to this place, because the road from the capital of azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To go 323 kilometers from both city centres, eight hours are needed because the road is one-way.
The astonishing wealth enjoyed by the country thanks to the caspian sea oil has not yet reached this recóndita region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what you need to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May at the conclusion of the eurovision song contest and next year we will celebrate the festival of the world's most elderly people," says Fatulayeva.
It is the director of the Museum of longevity, perhaps the only one that exists in the world.
This is documented the lives of eight dozen talyshis the place beyond the age of 100. Fatulayeva points to a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
His son died at the age of 136
However, the undisputed star of the museum is the pastor of sheep şirali Müslümov, which seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no departure of birth that assurance.
And given that the older man documented lived 122 years, it seems that the age of Müslümov is quite disturbing.
"Born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. apparently still had time to conceive a daughter more at the age of 136 years.
Is wrong then şirali Müslümov in their age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, gerontólogo at the Max Planck Rostock Institute, has also heard of the age of this inhabitant of central Asia.
"In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan also very old people live," Scholz says, "even in sardinia, many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age, especially when there is no civil register.
Every day full of butter derretida flasks
It is a fact that, in a surprisingly frequent, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over the age of 100.
Why do you live here in the south, many elderly?
The tourist guide azeri Farid Mugimzadeh explains that it is the special genes of the talyshis.
The Director of the museum, mrs Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in the food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it seems logical that food rich in calories from the talyshi, who worship the meat, bread and milk products and many of whom, moreover, drink a glass of butter derretida daily, is so healthy.
Or perhaps it is the natural way of life which keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small town not far from the town of Lerik live Rubaba Mirzayeva.
In its 97 years is relatively young for what is estila at these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, living in a simple wooden House typical of the entire caucasus region.
Sitting on the ground, moving unremittingly a huge tub of butter.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of the sons and a daughter of Mirzayeva, both became grandparents long ago.
Also brincan from one side to another two small children.
In the kitchen preparing tea for the guests, a tea served in a typical flasks with abombada form.
The teeth of Mirzayeva are white and are perfectly aligned and lurking beneath the headscarf two long dark hair that his son found us proud trenzas.
I have always washed leather with milk, so I have been dropped and never has maintained its colour.
"I have never used a shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
The pension is enough to live
Of has always eaten only what produced on its own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my life I have never gone to shopping at a supermarket.
Then she speaks of her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the time after the Second World War.
However, all returned to their feet when the "dear father, Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds strange from an older woman.
In azerbaijan, however, the cult professes to paternal figure of the nation, who runs the country as a dictator, knows no bounds.
He remained in power until 2003, when he gave up the baton to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly people of azerbaijan does not know what is poverty.
Mirzayeva claims 230 manat (roughly the same amount in euros) in the form of monthly pension, an amount that you can live well, considering the situation here.
And perhaps the canoso son of Mirzayeva is right: "the elderly are very respected in our culture."
Living in a large family, they are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this were not reason enough to stay alive many years...
In the Constitution lack the expression 'human rights'
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations vying with one another in Cairo demonstrate the tremendous division currently facing the country.
The future Constitution, with Sharia as the basis, it is very controversial.
The Egyptian President he gave in patetismo.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that is my responsibility to the people and to God," said on public television.
His speech was aimed at all the people, especially the coptic christians, liberals, enlightened Muslims and the secular.
All of them, inevitably plunged so far in a confusing opposition, they fear.
Fear of a theocracy on the nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost asking forgiveness, has had to cancel on a temporary basis the powers of the constitutional court and extend theirs "to save the Revolution."
However, neither the egyptians and the whole world knows full well what this engineer of 61 years with a phd awarded by the University of southern California really wants to save.
Depriving their power to the judiciary?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval was prompted by a constituent Assembly consisting of 100 Members predominantly islamist in 15 hours a night, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, in the draft also says that the law is based on the "principles of Islamic law."
"Principles" however, what does that mean?
This was and remains open to interpretation and it seems that the islamists will seize this vague wording, as well as the legal room for manoeuvre that brings Forth, to impose a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
That at least is suggesting a new article added: in all issues relating to the Sharia is mandatory to consult the Al-Ashar University, the country's largest Islamic institution with a great power in Sunni Islam.
It need not be this way, but this may mean that the clergy should monitor the legislation, which - in fact - as a result the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation
It is also a problem that aims to maintain the military jurisdiction.
During the Mubarak dictatorship these courts have put a harsh crackdown on the opposition.
After the dictator was until 11 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As set out in the draft, the state will protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote their morals and values."
It is a very imprecise wording in legal terms that this article with the help of state institutions could even control the content of the film and literature.
Let me make it clear it is not a matter of anything other than censure.
But that no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
Instead another prohibits offend or slander the Prophet Mohammed and their legacies.
However, it is not clear what is an offence and how to be punished.
Equally questionable is the formulation that prohibits the "affront to people '
Is it enough a caricature of the President or a joke about a letrado?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been submitted to Mursi for signing and according to his words," very soon "will be presented to the egyptians to be put to a referendum.
"The revolution has become"
Weeks ago that the opposition is closing ranks against the superiority of the islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in an unusual harmony on the afternoon of Friday in Tahrir square of Cario and swore themselves drive minutes before it can come into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will overcome," says Hamdin Sabbahi, which ranks third in the lists for the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace and exdirector of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, declared that the draft Constitution should be "in the dustbin of History."
Through Twitter accused followers of Mursi to lead a "coup against democracy."
"When the referendum will call his palace and derrocaremos," says the opposition Jasser said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been expiada ', was quoted in the Egyptian media on the political opposition Chaled Ali.
And several judges said they did not want to monitor the referendum, so it would not be deemed valid.
"The koran is our constitution '
For its part, the well-organised Muslim community called for a contramanifestación; in case not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the nile, to the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the salafis took part in the same cry: "the people demand the application of the divine law."
Demanded Mursi "cleaning up the country," at the same time that proclaimed: "The koran is our Constitution."
A symbolic fight over sovereignty of the Tahrir square, where it all started, had led to a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that the supporters of Mursi did not want to risk that this might happen.
The Muslim brotherhood said that both those who oppose the draft Constitution as supporters have expressed their opinions loud and clear.
Now it is time to let the people decide at the ballot box which direction the country should take.
In this respect, it seems that the draft of the islamists has guaranteed the majority.
"The expression 'human rights' does not even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this constitutional process forced that really should have lasted until February and have included all the social forces.
This 48 years specialising in human rights lawyer and President of the Egyptian organisation for human rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim brotherhood when they are held in prison or had to cope with a trial for Mubarak's dictatorship.
Not because sharing their ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression'Derechos human 'does not even appear in the new Constitution," complains in a conversation with the newspaper Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of the powers of Mursi to the three powers of state did this lawyer to resign itself.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and lead to egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Rather than strengthening civil society, what the President has done is rendered null and void," laments Saeda.
But democracy cannot work without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels abandoned by the international community, which also noted the ideological struggle which is taking place on the nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against them.
A demonstrator in Tahrir square warns: "You are envisaging a monster that podréis not control."
The Norwegian rakfisk: the world's most stale fish?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoys one of the highest living standards, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the success of the country relates to their greed for a very stale fish?
Take a series of excessively cured cheeses.
Football Colóquelos amid a mountain of clothes dirty and wet.
Make that there a week here.
Can then tell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of the exquisiteces of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours of Oslo.
It snowed. The scenery is spectacular and the smell, always present, fleet in the air.
The rakfisk is trout in salazón is making wine in water during stale, depending on how you prefer, up to a year.
As tinted and is doing more cold, they come in droves to a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, devoted to this delicacy of the most, so to speak, mesmerizing.
"Can be eaten raw and then drink a glass of aquavit of a pill," says Havard Halvarsen rakfisk, fireman of the city that is what is known as the "general", which is in charge of organising the festival.
People eating this fish from all directions that is kept in small buckets and sipping from a pill significant quantities of drink.
"Some people like the aquavit rakfisk ', says Havard.
The beverage can kill the smell.
Pruebo some pieces.
If you can avoid pass near the nose, is not bad; it is not very different from a piece of sushi that has travelled a few miles by bus.
The rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different era, in which poverty sweeping Norway and where, before cooling existed, the fish was during the autumn immersed in water and salt in barrels watertight.
Later, in the winter, when enough is enough fermented, lifts and obviously with the senses inactive due to alcohol, can be eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, higher wages and a comprehensive system of social services.
A stream of people in Sweden, the old rival and until recently not too much richer than Norway, arrived in this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered something important, an essential part, although quite stale, of Norway's past.
Is among the most expensive dishes that can be bought.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A rod of beer or a sandwich you cost the tune of €10 ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of the international news and the majority of Norwegians like that.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist acribilló shot and killed 77 people, among which included men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the event of 22 July."
To the Norwegians costs very much believe that in its quiet country one of their own was able to commit such cruelty and homicide.
Behind much of the current wealth of Norway is growth, since the early 1970's, one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason why we go as well," says Anna, our camarera, while passes bandejas rakfisk and that, with its long melena rubia and its striking blue eyes, is the image of the Norwegian welfare.
"We are, as you say you, people cautious."
His English, like the majority of people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to boast, we do not like the ostentation."
Norway has managed its oil wealth very cautiously; all but a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
As the whole world waste money that did not during the years preceding the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the wallet closed.
"While we ski in winter and making rambling in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," adds with a desenvuelta belly laugh.
I am in the snow queuing up to eat something; I just had enough rakfisk.
Now a hamburguesa raise is certainly something different and quite suculento to savour.
But at night, becomes the stale fish.
The hotel where I alojo is one of many in which is hosting a dinner of local rakfisk where the comensales vote the best fish, or perhaps the most tests the graves nasales.
A live television has connected with a broadcaster that brings pajarita and is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
Seems the eurovision contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here is our score, Havard."
There is laughter and applause.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps outplayed by aquavit.
Or perhaps exhaust all the fish.
Mexico: henry Peña grandson faces a tough start
While Mexico's incoming President, Enrique Peña grandson, prepares to take office, the BBC correspondent, will Grant, looks at the challenges facing the new President and the different expectations of its people.
Trafficking in Mexico City is particularly bad today.
In a city that, in the best of circumstances, is already congested, has been installed since Monday an Iron fence that short several main roads leading to the city and that is causing considerable chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not stopping people could come to their place of work, but to prevent the demonstrators could come to Parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Peña grandson, will receive the presidential sash and will assume the management of the nation.
Faces a difficult task.
Mexico has been getting good economic performance during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is submerged in a war against the narcotráfco that has already killed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a strong commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," explained Mr Peña grandson earlier this week the US President, Barack Obama, in the Oval office.
"I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal."
Before rubbing shoulders with the President of the US, Mr Peña's previous political experience was as Governor of his home state, Mexico.
A populous state and a rapid growth, which surrounds the capital; the views on the new leader are divided in this territory where he used to move.
An Honest Man
In the bucolic town of Valley Bravo, for example, he recalls with affection.
Its residents attribute the merit of the growth of tourism in the place and the construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city you can drive by one of the new roads of Mr Peña grandson, which is a huge improvement compared with roads agrietadas and full of potholes that were rehabilitated.
One can also see plates with his name on the entry of a modern polideportivo and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We hope that he will make a real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a member of the party of Mr Peña grandson, the PRI.
"Particularly in terms of security and economy, we expect the interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Member Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of pine trees within the Party there are many expectations of henry Peña grandson.
The opposition also rejects the rating to lack of substance of the new President.
"It is a very honest, very committed and man with an excellent vision of the country.
It is a fantastic statesman and, above all, is a person who you listen to."
On the other side of the state, however, that is not the impression that many people on its former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as city Neza, the contrast with the streets adoquinadas Valley Bravo could not be higher.
Hidden under sections of motorway high is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the municipality's problems are too tough and urban.
Earlier this year called for the intervention of the military to help in the fight against drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a desert area, located next to a rubbish dump, have been abandoned in just the last two years the bodies of dozens of women killed.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr Peña grandson was the governor, a rate far higher than that of ciudad Juárez, unfortunately, famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with murder of innocent women.
Critics of Mr Peña grandson say, at best, which failed to address the problem of feminicide while in office.
The most critics accuse his administration of turning a blind eye.
In a house of concrete, typical of the blighted neighborhood, Irinea Buendía must make efforts to stem the tears while shows photographs of their deceased daughter, Mariana moon.
According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, his family believes that her partner murdered.
"When I came home, it seemed as if he had cleared the body," recalls mrs Buendía.
"There were signs that had been hit and rigour mortis had already appeared."
While his mother relata history, a photograph of Mariana notes from the walls, along with a cross in which you read a single word: justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says he has been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me as if it were an old chismosa, a alborotadora, a quejica.
What they want is that you simply accept what they say and street."
"But that cannot be true when there have been so many irregularities and such negligence," says.
The presidential sash that President Peña grandson will on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new President has promised to make it a priority during his mandate.
"I hope it will be the kind of President that was when I was Governor," the Member said the PRI Olvera in Valley Bravo.
But that is precisely what the families of the victims of city Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning not reported mistreatment, according to state prosecutors
Prosecutors are trying to cope with complaints of abuse of Bradley Manning during his stay in prison
The trial focuses on the period of Quantico Manning in the military prison in Virginia
The defense wants to be immediately discard the case on the grounds that the imprisonment of Manning was severe
The army's soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to show on Friday that the soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the biggest leak of classified information in the history of the United States, lost many opportunities to denounce abuses now alleges that military suffered while he was in detention.
During interrogation that Manning in a hearing prior to the trial the prosecution made in Ft. Meade, Maryland, the prosecutor commander Ashden Fein said that the records of weekly visits from officials of the unity that Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaint about the treatment he received.
The questioning, which took place during a hearing conducted following the request from the defence of desestimara since his incarceration had been hard and that it had already seen enough punishment, came one day after Manning had testified that he had considered suicide while in custody.
The Army intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
Wikileaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
In view of the Friday, Fein reviewed with officers Manning the forms rellenaban after visits to Quantico Manning during his detention at the military prison, where he was imprisoned in solitary maximum detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers would have asked questions to Manning and noted their answers.
When Friday Fein asked on the forms, Manning admitted that he had described the treatment they gave the celadores as "excellent" and treatment facilities in general as "very professional."
The forms do not show any complaints of abuse, even though the official asked Manning directly about the treatment he received, Fein said.
Manning said he had expressed his concerns about certain issues and that the officers I visited had talked about these problems and I had to be treated, but indicated that they were not aware of these issues in the register.
"Wrote" without consequences' after having spoken of the problems - but that does not necessarily mean that I had not mentioned any problems, "said Manning.
The judge, army col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why it had not denounced the treatment he received during the meeting which took place in January 2011 with a Council to explore the intentions of suicide that was expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to get the reduction of the "Prevention of injury" scheme under which was.
The military said it had put him under restrictive regime, which is a level below that of surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure their safety and the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff knew that I was well and (wanted) to be under Prevention of injury... to be able to enjoy what is, in my view, a better quality of life," said Manning.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison located on the basis of the marines in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and once lost consciousness due to the heat.
He said that the fact that they are not allowed to know what was happening or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world fell only the camp Arafjon, to that cage," Manning explained on Thursday.
"I thought he was going to die in that cage."
Manning said that once moved to Quantico, spent most of the day in a small cell for at least 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a cushion, a blanket, a chancletas, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that trying to move all the time, which was already prohibited sleep or even lying during the day.
Manning said he always had a light from outside pointing to his eyes while slept.
He said that if the celadores could not see him up when he gave a return at night, woken him for you to take the ride.
Manning's lawyer submitted a formal complaint about the treatment he received in January 2011 Manning.
Manning was transferred to the military prison in Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning on a plea that had made in Thursday's statement, according to which, after being forced to sleep naked in his cell one night Quantico forced him during a morning count to remain standing desdnudo before the celadores and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he was never given the opportunity to be covered with a blanket during the recount.
During questioning by the judge on Friday, Manning said that dedujo by the order, which gave him the celador to slip the blanket with which could have covered, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to stop falling.
Manning testified on Thursday that she was forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to demonstrate to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said that he had told the official that could have used the elastic of his underwear or their chanclas for autolesionarse but that it had not.
Manning testified that that night had withdrawn from his cell his underwear, their chanclas and his glasses.
His lawyers have the hope that the judge will at least look at the experiences for which happened during his time in prison and drastically reduced his sentence if convicted in the Council of war, which is due to begin early next year.
The defense claimed that it intends to make Manning is guilty of minor offences and defend other allegations considered too extreme.
It is expected that the hearing will resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held according to the rules apply to all detainee who is maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, cause illegally publication of information on the Internet, leak of national defense information and theft of public property or records.
If he is convicted of all charges, could face life imprisonment.
My identity crisis mexicano-estadounidense
He says that many were forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticise those who were; he says that recall Mexicans in those difficult times
Navarrette says that the mexicano-estadounidenses are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, barely had declined by the explanada handling of immigration and come to the area and was totally confused.
Some posters showing the way to two lines: one for "Mexicans" and another for "foreigners."
I was there a few seconds without being sure where to go.
Having grown up in central California, all my life I have called "Mexican."
It is about ethnic taquigrafía, in the same way that my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "Irish" or my italian friends in New York to call themselves". "
Later I decided to "mexicano-estadounidense."
But this was Mexico.
And, in the country of my grandfather, the taquigrafía or the scripts were not needed.
It was American.
I speak Spanish. well enough and manejarme during an interview in that language.
But I do not have the level of vocabulary of a native American and I cannot get rid of my accent.
So I took my American passport, and I was in the queue of foreigners.
I thought at the time of this week in which Mexico's president-elect, Enrique Peña grandson, visited the White House to meet President Obama.
On the day's agenda, as always to meet the leaders of those two countries, was: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña grandson was also keen to talk about growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons that at the moment is as likely to stay in Mexico as a Mexican who venture to go to the United States.
Wants to be associated with the United States and Canada and create a trading bloc in the style of the European Union in North America.
Furthermore, Peña grandson promised to continue to fight against the drug cartels in Mexico, but did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and fraught with resentment.
Probably the majority of Americans will never remember that in 1848 America invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give half of its territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who believe in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that you remember are everywhere.
So, in the time in which a United States official says anything that involves the slightest criticism to Mexico, if you start to hear complaints, both in the press and among the elite Mexican, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of its neighbors.
And the children of Moctezuma are on a war footing.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really is quite a challenge we have with the more than 35 million mexicano-estadounidenses living in the United States.
About grudge?
There is.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for which it is not.
The only reason that so many people of Mexican descent living in cities such as Los Angeles, las Vegas, Denver, San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree, there was one person, perhaps the father or mother or one of the grandparents, which was closed the door of the opportunities in Mexico and had to go to the north.
And most of the time that person fitted in a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of qualifications, from a poor people, etc.
We are their top-down and they are loyal.
To Mexico.
And, despite the fact that perhaps we are now living the American dream, having gone to good schools and have had good jobs, we can never lose sight of what we are experiencing is that, the American dream, not the Mexican.
It is possible that sometimes our identity is not clear, but our loyalty it is.
It is for the United States.
Moreover, we are aware that many of the Mexican belonging to the elite of the ruling class are not gustamos.
The feeling is mutual.
We see it as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and we look over the shoulder as if we were of a lower status that is not sufficiently Mexican.
The Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, had not been gone.
And we would not now be trapped behind this silk screen, living in the United States but, yet, as a solitary souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and wine legally to the United States when he was a child, I am reminded that there is this roce between Mexicans and the mexicano-estadounidenses because the first know all the more forceful who they are and the seconds it bothers them.
Although it is a citizen of the United States, she is considered part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many mexicano-estadounidenses I know feel they are not part of either of them.
We love to hear the Mexican group the tigers in the north, but also to Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of each country, but you are not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to complicate matters further, so I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want the mexicano-estadounidenses work as "ambassadors" of Mexico makeshift, representing their interests in the United States.
We say to our fellow Americans how fantastic it is to visit that country and presionaríamos to political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course...
That is not going to happen.
There is too much resentment.
And, with the inequality of wages, rampant corruption and violence by drugs, many of us are not so sure that is a fantastic country.
I am afraid that you you will be alone with this idea, friends.
Is fair.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way in which tried to Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some mexicano-estadounidenses are still very bitter about how his family was treated for much less time.
Hmmm.
We are perhaps more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and hamas could well be an unlikely basis for Peace
Will one day be a lasting peace between arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of the usual useless and discussions about who started first, lots of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed and, for the first time, rockets from Gaza have fallen Near Tel Aviv, Israel's metropolis, and the Holy City of jerusalem.
But, despite the fact that the Israelis and palestinians seem to be stuck in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has made everything shattered like it or not, palestinians and Israelis have been stuck in the regional uproar.
Perhaps this will make his fight even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to think that their deadly impasse could desencallarse.
A war that neither is lost or wins
At first glance, the optimism is now very difficult to justify.
Even if it keeps the ceasefire agreed on 21 November, the clashes this week have reinforced the hawks on both sides.
Leaders of hamas, the islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, despite the fact that Gaza has received a good kicking.
And despite having killed some of their leaders and got pressure on Gaza's 1.7 million people in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel could not deal with hamas.
Indeed, hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other side of palestine currently governed by their ruthless rival Fatah, the more moderate palestinian faction.
In addition, the leaders of hamas could come to the conclusion that the time is on their side.
Since the islamists have gained influence across the Arab world, hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power that had previously been Israel's closest Muslim ally, has also embraced the cause of hamas. did Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic in the gulf states.
Jubilant the member of hamas say the Islamic crescent is persistently surrounding Israel from lebanon to the north, which dominates the partido-milicia hezbollah via syria, where islamist rebels from a growing tendency could overthrow Bashar Assad, to jordan, where hamas's allies are threatening to the king.
On Israel's southern flank, the growth of the Muslim brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in egypt, by far the most populous Arab countries, and fundamental has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not too long to hamas.
In contrast, the Muslim brotherhood are cousins Brothers of hamas and its leaders depend more on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic action, it is possible that hamas emerges as the player cannot be excluded, including Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, Israel's hardline wing will draw the opposite conclusion.
With regard to the military aspect, have put hamas in its place.
Israel's top Iron missile system has proved its effectiveness and many of the hamas rockets have been destroyed.
The Israelis dormirán happier... for some time.
As for diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries also blamed hamas for initiating the latest wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered, especially under the government of benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets fired from Gaza have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, in part thanks to the barrier that hollowed out West Bank, the main chunk of a territory contender to become state of palestine, and protects the jewish settlements that are still rising in spite of the fact that, under international law, are illegal.
Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined a group of an even tougher line led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the election on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why coddling those clever palestinians giving them their own state?
If it really gobernaran in the West Bank, does not dispararían rockets as did their compatriots in Gaza?
It is better to have them after that wall and give them a good blow if rose to head.
Perhaps we impose a hard wing, although the Arab Spring could upset their calculations.
Although the islamists to take power in egypt and elsewhere not have much love for Israel, his priority will be tackling the internal difficulties.
Israel's defense budget is higher than that of his four Arab neighbours together.
Starting a war with the superpower of the area will hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr Morsi has worked with Barack Obama for a ceasefire is a good omen and could mark the start of something.
Also the Israelis should think long term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, to deprive the palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a tinderbox that one day will explode in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that blew up a bus in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the jewish state and demographics worsens the situation as the Arab population increases.
The harsh missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject hamas will pay a toll increasing diplomatic.
Both sides need a push of people outside the conflict.
The solution remains the who preach sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and ceding territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the cease-fire given a little more impetus to the outsiders who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which should start to curb the entry of weapons in Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to persuade hamas to accept the idea of a jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared jerusalem.
Arabs outside the matter should also put pressure on hamas and Fatah to join.
That would contribute more to the creation of a palestinian state that the imminent bid for a virtual statehood at the UN.
Mr Obama also has an important role when it comes to get Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term failed to present its own plan for peace.
Once in the White House, it seems equally reluctant to devote their attention.
This attitude is a deplorable vision.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and palestine.
The generic packaging of Tobacco law comes into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and body parts with diseases look on packs of a muted green colour, which are the same for all the brand
The Australian law on smoking and generic packaging, a pioneer in the world, comes into force and replacing the logos and colours of the brands by wrapping a muted green olive, a horrific images of body parts with diseases and depictions of children and babies ill as children of smoking parents.
With the exception of the various images and mandatory health warnings, the only difference between packets, since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them small print on a type of source.
It is the world's stricter regime for Tobacco packaging.
Australia's federal government says that the goal is to deter young people from smoking by removing the traits that make this habit has glamour.
Relies on studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that it never will.
"You can see that children, even from a very early age, understood the message that the Tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said the federal health minister, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls do the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess.
Despite the fact that Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and that these changes will not greatly affect the profits of the multinationals, other countries are considering similar measures.
The Tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
The Tobacco companies said that the law would encourage Tobacco black market, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious unintended consequences," said Scott McIntyre, British American Tobacco, in Australia.
Increase the amount of Tobacco that will bring counterfeiters in China and Indonesia to sell it on the streets of Australia.
Others say that their business has benefited after the adoption of the law.
Sandra has, of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that demand for silicone pitilleras and covered to plug the unpleasant images of the packs had soared almost from scratch two months ago, when the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco and Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in the Supreme Court of Australia.
She has said that Zico had sold Up to 6,000 units to wholesale outlets and that was awaiting further supplies.
"For us it is good business."
According to experts, the potential obstacle is the popularity of social networks between the target demographic sector as the plan.
After a number of Australian laws which prohibit advertising on television and sponsorship of sport and putting the majority of sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, the marketing of Tobacco has gone through online.
Australia has banned Internet advertising companies and local websites, but cannot restrict it in foreign pages.
"If comercializas Tobacco and you can only this brief window to promote your products, the most convincing in the online Space is the place to be," said Becky freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in statements on brands from "ordinary people" published on social networking websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
I wonder if it is just a private citizen who really loves cigars Marlboro and has taken the trouble to make a video or whether any company of marketing is behind all this.
The British American Tobacco Australia indicated that the industry is focused more on what the new rules mean that marketing.
The industry has even pay for ukraine, Honduras and the dominican Republic recusen the new rules; those countries are saying to the World Trade Organization that is unfairly restricting trade, despite the fact that none of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia.
It is likely that the wto issued a resolution by the middle of 2013.
Plibersek said that the government had held talks with other countries that are considering implementing similar laws on Tobacco packaging.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce the requirement to include images on packets.
Currently are compulsory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and ukraine.
In Britain, new zealand, South Africa and India is considering implementing tougher laws.
In Australia many smokers are defiant.
"The photographs do not affect me.
I simply not case."
"Coges cigarro and guards the package," says Victor Hage while buying a package with the image of a tumor in the mouth.
"Frankly, there is only one reason why would stop smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of watertight king of the pack at the centre of Sydney, indicates that the packs uniform make it more difficult to bring them on the shelves.
"Normally tardaba an hour in desenvalar; now tardo four delivery," says Yu.
"The government should have banned all Tobacco and then, as is, well, goodbye and shut the shop," says while lifted their hands up.
In a constantly connected world, is not so bad aburrirse a little
During the holidays thanks to this year's day of action, so unexpectedly had to spend five hours in an airport because the plane in which volábamos suffered a mechanical problem and had to wait for it to another plane.
So I had plenty of time to think about the Boredom.
I am not going to lie.
Spend the day in an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is rather dull, even if you have the wherewithal to be entertaining, such as books, magazines or iPhones, not to forget the duty-free shops.
But there are more and more academics and experts in child development that praise the virtues of Boredom.
According to them, it is right that we and our children, we aburramos from time to time.
Aburrirse forces the brain to find interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Given that, at present, the majority of us are connected to this or the screen, experienced the benefits of Boredom.
So, should we accept in good mood Boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But, as we will talk about that later.
Firstly, like many people, assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, Boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter says Toohey Greek and Roman, professor of History at the University of Calgary, in Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: Lively History" ("Boredom, a Lively history") published in 2011 by Yale university press, is not.
"In fact, the history of Boredom is very extensive," says.
On the walls of Pompeya graffitis exist in Latin on the Boredom, dating from the first century a.d.
We must also consider how we define the Boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many different ways," says John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the published research and raise the idea with a focus group composed of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined Boredom as the experience of "hope, but we cannot participate in an activity that fills you."
He says that the difference between the Boredom and the apathy is that the person does something but wants to do so.
Notes that with the apathy there is a desire to do something.
The main experience of Boredom, he says, is "the disruption of the care process, coupled with a low mood and a sense that time passes slowly."
The Boredom may sound terribly reminiscent of the depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that, although they may be related, people who are dreary tend to view the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed feel that the problem is with them.
Sometimes we feel that we are bored, when what happens in reality is that we have problems concentrating.
In his study "the Unengaged mind: Defining Boredom in terms of attention," published in the September edition of the magazine Perspectives on psychological science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues were referred to a previous experiment in which participants heard a tape of a person who was reading a magazine article.
Some groups were in the neighbouring room a television programme to all volume that bore no relation, others listened to the volume low, so that was barely perceptible, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that had the programme with the volume low showed more boring than the other two groups; cost them focus, but were not sure why and attributed the Boredom.
"When you try concentrarte in a difficult task or interesting, the disruption of the attention can lead to Boredom," said mark J. Fenske, professor of the University of Neurociencia Guelph Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you are doing something boring, such as detecting defective parts in a line of manufacturing, a music you distract you can help not aburrirte."
"In fact, we know today that move or make garabatos, actions which are often interpreted as a sign of Boredom, may actually help to combat it, because it makes that person is physically more alert."
"Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are being forced to stand still," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what is aburrirse at some point: the delay of a plane, a dull speaker, a particularly boring film.
But some people are likely to aburrirse than others.
To help measure, some researchers developed in the 1980s a "level of trend to Boredom."
The scale covers issues such as "many of the things that I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things that interest me that I do not have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that by using these scales, researchers have found that children are likely to aburrirse more often than girls, and particularly need more external stimulation and more varied.
But, in general, teenagers are a type of group that was weary quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and Community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which was put in contact with 400 teenagers and their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search.
Found that 32 per cent of teenagers said that aburría while in school or doing homework, while 23 per cent said that it was aburría when he was in school.
On the other hand, the 3 per cent of parents said they bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the current rates of Boredom, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said that what we knew was that "adolescence is a period in which the Boredom reaches its highest levels," in large part because both children and adolescents are not given a great control over what they want to do.
So, back to my question of principle: is it good aburrirse?
Sometimes it is not, as absurd, taken to extremes, can push us to expose to physical risks, such as gambling or fall in the consumption of substances as a way to combat it, as evidenced by the investigations.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between Boredom and creativity, claims Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
"Boredom is the brain's way to tell you that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain does not always know what is most appropriate.
If you are bored and utilizas that energy to touch the guitarra or cooking, that you will.
But if you see the television, it is possible that you meet in the short term, but not in the long term.
"So, if your child is boring and give him an iPad, it is possible that it is no longer aburra, but there will be no less learned to entertain itself or to dosificarse," says Professor Fenske.
And "this ability to dosificarse applies to other situations," says.
Your child not only less learns to entertain themselves, but are learning to be better in other areas.
I do not think that we really want to praise the Boredom.
But we should not be too critical of him.
Our goal should be, rather, to feel comfortable sections of the persistent rumour activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our view, we need more tiresome, but the Boredom is a wish too distressing and disturbing to link it with something worthwhile," says.
Points out that what people really want is a way of blocking and enjoy a time-out.
"In an environment where we are constantly sobreestimulados," says, "it is difficult to find ways to turn our attention when the noise stops."
Colorado: no book of instructions for the new law on the use of marijuana
Anthony Orozco, 19 years in a community and footballer Institute student from Southeast Colorado, is facing a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal in the state: the possession of a stones of marijuana and a pipe that used to fumarla.
Orozco says that a day of September, he and some friends led by Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when the police stopped.
The police found marijuana in the car and a later judicial Orozco was given a citation for possession of drugs and related items (minor offences that carry a fine of 100 US dollars) each in which he reported on the date of the trial.
"Treat us like criminals," says Orozco.
And what are they?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote that took place in Colorado for the legalisation of the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer in hundreds of minor causes for possession of drugs depends less on the law of the location.
Hundreds of minor offences for possession of marijuana are canceling both here and in Washington State, where it passed a similar measure.
Police departments have failed to bring charges against those over 21 years for possession on a small scale, to be adopted legally once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors of more conservative districts in Colorado are committed to proceeding with open cases for possession of marijuana and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent Opening shops in marijuana, approved recently, in their communities.
"All this is changing so quickly that I do not know what will be next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those who are responsible for the regulations in the state of Washington also are dwelling on the matter.
And are still seeking advice for establishing a licensing system for production, manufacturing, distribution and sales - all before the deadline, 1 December 2013.
They say that, for better or for worse, Colorado is ahead of most of the States on the regulation of the use of marijuana, first with terapeúticos purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, as well as a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the alcohol control committee in the state of Washington.
But Mr Smith admits that somewhere or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
"There is no real precedent that will serve as a model," he says.
The Washington law, called I-502, comes into force on 6 December, leaving a year during which nadará between two stools, as the licensing system in this state still exists, but the acquisition will be legal.
Moreover, there are some delicate mechanical issues that must be resolved during that period, and how to maintain a balance between the state's obligation to provide a suitable "access" to the authorized marijuana and a ban on doing business of cannabis in a radio under 300 metres of schools, parks, play areas for children or day-care centres.
"Nowhere is more difficult to locate a business of cannabis authorised that in urban areas, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for legal cannabis, a research group recently established.
On 21 November, Oates Aurora, the police chief, sent an e-mail to its police officers in which they reported that the prosecution of the city would cease to prosecute minor offences for possession of marijuana for people over 21 years of age and that the police would bring charges against these crimes "with immediate effect."
The police chief Oates said that they should be in charge of enforcing the rules of the city that regulates the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and that would continue chasing drug smugglers and sellers.
In the county of Weld, in northern Colorado, the district prosecutor, Ken Buck, represents a stricter vision.
After the vote, he assured that his office would pursue cases of possession of marijuana, mainly to put pressure on consumers and to receive treatment.
At the moment, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, even though many of them have other charges.
"Our office has a duty to bring legal proceedings against those mistakes that at the time that occurred were crime," Mr Buck said in a statement.
The answer was complicated, even in places like rural county of table, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana.
The police in grand Junction, the largest city in the county, it quoted adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, County district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the cases pending for possession.
"I do not think that it is losing the time to continue enforcing the law until it changes," he said.
Despite the fact that 55 percent of voters supported the measure, was never considered that carry the consumption of marijuana for recreational use at the heart of the government and the judicial system would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that occur around the state show a sharp ambivalence among officials about the large green experiment in this state.
"This is a cultural barrier with the tax district," says sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents defendants for possession of marijuana and is local spokesman for the National Organization for the reform of the law on marijuana.
"They have spent so much time pushing people before the courts that, in fact, still can't accept that is legal," he said.
As the first states that consider the small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become test cases nationally on the legalization of drugs.
While lawyers and state officials have a new frontier of legal sale, also are looking forward to receiving information from the federal government, which still provides for the consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offences.
Defenders of the legalization of marijuana have the hope that the Department of Justice will subside.
Although there have been some high-profile arrests of patients and sellers of marijuana for therapeutic purposes, the Federal Government has allowed mostly offering businesses for sale of marijuana for such purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
"Although it is likely that the anti-drug agents not to pull down doors to confiscate a small bag of drugs, probably will balk at the operation of shops regulated by the state to allow the sale of marijuana for recreational use, permitted under the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, a exasesor anti-drug policy of the Obama administration.
Several cities in Colorado do not wait for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the day of the elections, some local governments adopted moratoriums on any new store of marijuana, even though it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the Western city of Montrose adopted a ban of six months and are likely to be approved next week.
"We do not want to put ourselves in a situation in which allow someone and then we have a serious problem at the federal level," explained Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
"Our Community voted against this amendment.
We are looking for what the Community voted against a vote in favour of what the State voted."
There are many questions about it.
Petronella Wyatt: "I acosaron until echarme of Oxford as a Tory"
It attacks the University for their points of view not only now
I do not recall any time in my life that has not been dreaming in securing a place at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother had been in which I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that drove the two pillars of civilisation: the free thinking and tolerance.
However, in the two weeks to take my place in the Worcester college in the late 1980s for the purpose of the race in history, had already made the suitcases, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and was in tears.
My friends were bemused.
The evening standard newspaper said that I had left because they tolerated some colleagues from university maintained sexual relationships in the room next door.
The writer A. N. Wilson announced joking that I had gone because I forced drinking rates desconchadas.
The truth was less fun.
Huí there.
Yes, Huí, because she had been subjected to a systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my flamboyant name, or the fact that came from a private school.
I acosaron for one reason, that in the cradle of the alleged illustration was somewhat intolerant and barbaric: my Father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
You may wonder what this is in now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of center-right students is suffering a similar prosecution.
The institutionalised and growing hatred of the students of the conservative party is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them have called for the same level of equal rights for homosexuals, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Member of the conservative JCR (grouping students in grade) of Corpus Christi college say they are "often seriously paragraphs, personally attacked and treated as undesirables" for his political ideas.
They want to create a seat on the board of equal opportunities for its University College to make sure they can express their views freely.
Their situation was not helped by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: young, bright and on the right" (paradise: young, bright and right-wing) on the policy of students and presenting the Tories as eccentrics and neo-nazis.
Showed the Oxford university graduate student Joe Cooke, former head of the conservative party Association (OUCA), in a silver Rolls-Royce, looking a suit and a cane with the silver empuñadura.
Conservative in other universities, students say they are treated as "scapegoats" for the introduction of higher tuition rates.
Luke black, 20 years and deputy chairman of the conservative party association of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing trend of left-wing in universities.
People assume that we are like the Bullingdon club without even know."
Samuel Roberts, of 21 years and student of history in Corpus Christi who tabled the motion for a better protection, says that this environment is "uncomfortable," while Stephanie Cherill, 19 years and elected President of OUCA, says that the attitude of the Member of the center-right JCR towards people who are worse.
"This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate, as well as for the welfare of the Members," says.
During my first weeks in Oxford was more alone than the one.
I joined the university in September 1986, was an 18-year-old man terribly timid.
The hatred of the conservative party was at its peak.
Last year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, former pupil, an honorary title "cause" following cuts in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere had done shudder of horror to any stalinist.
Already during the first few days of the week to welcome the new university, when the new students are known and unknown to the professors, received a sign of the bitterness that I expected.
I found that the professors did not only turning a blind eye to the derision that was of the university conservative, but willingly participated in it.
The policy of the miners' strike, privatisation and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa spilled into the Wood of the seminar rooms.
The first I attended were translated into English French texts of the 18th century and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "Please lead the first paragraph."
Di no.
Pitt, a man bajito with a face that seemed mass of bizcocho, knew well how to oust bad bilis.
"Do the thatcheristas refuse to learn French or, simply, is that they are stupid?" asked.
The other university rieron.
My eyes were burning of tears trying to contain.
"I suggest you go to French classes in their free time, provided that is not too busy knowing people," gruñó Pitt.
I returned to my room and a soul in pity.
That night I sat alone at the time of the dinner at the university; then I felt a mild slap on the back.
It was a second year student of English called James that was presented as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," I said politely.
"I am afraid that this is how will the thing.
They pick on anyone who is suspected of being Tory.
For me it is very complicated, but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be even worse.
Many Tories newcomers seeming to be Labour."
Later, at a local pub, I tried a cowardly manner disguise.
Stressed that he did not agree with everything that mrs Thatcher said.
The trick was useless.
A first year student of philosophy, politics and economics that, paradoxically, had studied in Eton fascist, said: "You are the product of a pig.
Are contaminated."
Other students took this cancioncilla.
I became the dirty perverted.
"How have sex the Tories?" asked one.
"There are a beating each other, isn't it?"
I was in the same way that should have been the liberal gay before the law in the 1960s.
Could one day lead a normal life in Oxford?
I will end up having to be with people who think like me just after dusk?
Would to labour and repress my natural tendencies?
The three years that I hoped posed as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only Professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history at my university college.
They hated him for being not only of the conservative party, but also of Thatcher in foreign policy adviser and one of the people he wrote his speeches.
It was there.
Detestaba the place that they regarded as parochial and insignificant and his adherence to the marxista-determinista vision of history.
In 1997 accepted a post at the University of Bilkent, in Ankara, Turkey.
"Here you will not be happy," he told me.
I started to go daily from Oxford to my parents house in London, finding refuge in my family and friends of metropolitan more open-minded.
I told my father hated Oxford and why.
I thought.
When he studied there in the 1940s, it accepted all the political points of view.
"But if it is the best place in the world," he said sadly.
"They never do that, not there between my dear dream needles.
Communist to my friends always had a faultless attitude."
With their pain eyes began to nublarse.
"Dale another chance.
I am sure that we have done just to joke.
Makes my heart partiría if dejaras."
Tired of so many trips to London, my emotional stress was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the conservative party, had succumbed to the pressure and had resigned his creed.
The following week, during a seminar in which another professor of history had intimated, speaking entirely seriously, that I was an "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Red embarrassment inside, admití that my parents I had washed the brain "and called them" old "stupid."
The truce lasted a short time.
It was my father who put the final nail in the coffin of my career at Oxford University.
By the time my father wrote two weekly columns in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I was inside acurrucada fear and, after five minutes, my persecutors desistieron.
When they were made the suitcase and cogí the first train to London.
Never came back.
Perhaps I llaméis weak llorona.
But no one of 18 years should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only been 14 Prime Ministers of the conservative party but, to date, is hiding behind a nothing deserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to the fame"
At the shows "Valentino: master of the tailoring," which was inaugurated this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous italian designer's clientas
Somerset house, a former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has said during the opening of "Valentino: master of the tailoring," a retrospective apoteósica bringing together more than 130 high tailoring clothes created by its "maison" during the last 50 years.
Very dear "me this palace," he says with his unmistakable italian accent.
This display is the pinnacle of a story whose sole player is "il signore" Garavani, but that could not have been written without honourable clientas.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the poisoned and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition, open until 3 March, private letters and photos with the signing of the most granado aristocracy abound, from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan until Lord Snowdon, via the Marie-Chantal of Greece and Princess Margarita of England.
Valentino taught these personal memories as trophies of their upward mobility: from humble Voghera fashion of the city, in northern Italy, the "idol jet-set" international.
Be lover of the royalty is not at all bad.
"At least not apagan colillas their pitillos on your wonderful carpet and make some beautiful celebrities of pop music," says lady Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino host is a spectacular and expensive enough with generosity and grace.
"We all encantaba be guests to his villa in Gstaad," explains the exmujer "Heini" Thyssen, intimate of neglected beauty spots such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance to the notoriety.
And yet, it is a star.
Valeria Mazza, looking a Valentino
The argentine model Valeria Mazza nor forgets the charisma of the fashion.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, went to dinner at his flat.
There were 20 people, among which were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the apartment, layout, food, music, things looked and felt his spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and dear," recalls the "top a" high tailoring, which began working with him during the week of Paris, in 1995.
"Never goes out of fashion because their designs are works of art," rounds off.
Parade of alcurnia
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession, but loves well matched.
He loves the people with good education and better titles, and they will love it.
One of the galleries of Somerset house has been turned into a glamurosa gateway for 60 metres long that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models may and must parade for the bridge to see a "hearing" dream that looks Valentino masterpieces such as clothing that chose Jackie Kennedy for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costumes he used Monica Vitti in "The Notte ', or a wool coat and shoes that belonged to empress Farah Diba.
In an audience of maniquíes relucen names such as luxembourg Sibilla, Gloria von habsburg Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Bulgaria or sofia story.
Naty Abascal and the fashion, in 2006
Many of these clientas say that the first Valentino is like the first love," impossible to forget."
I remember perfectly.
Name was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a chaleco gillette "and a jacket of the collection otoño-invierno 1971-1972.
"It was a gift that I did it," says Naty Abascal, 'one of the muses of' designer.
"I prefer him over other for their femininity, for his great love for women, because enhances our beauty," added the former duchess of fair.
I like very much the colours that uses, are very light and are "donors" in the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The Princess and prescriptora fashionable Patricia della Giovampaola d Arenbergtampoco can forget the first time I was clothed Valentino.
As a teenager and lived in Italy, dreamed of reaching the age and the opportunity to use one of his suits at night...
Eventually the time came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first dress Valentino for use at a party at the House of my cousin, prince Edouard Ligne.
It was a red suit, with skirt volados," corsage drapeado and escote word of honour."
"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this aristócrata italian who lives between Paris, New York and buenos Aires.
Princess d Arenberg keeps its clothes of fashion festival with "the maximum care... because a dress is not just a dress, it is also the whole of memories that entails."
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is the Marie-Chantal Miller bride in her wedding dress with Paul in Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as he calls the fashion to their costureras) to develop this colour ivory silk dress with incrustaciones pearls, twelve different types of relationship and a queue of four and a half metres.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes specialist, highest authority of the press, the dress is a milestone in the high end of the 20th century," the return of the clientas tailoring of high society."
Obnubilado for years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, now Valentino is their best exemplary.
Cavaliere di great Croce senior (the distinction in Italy), Cavaliere Lavoro, Commandeur de l Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the legion of honour, Garavani accumulated so many honours as any of the spouses of their clientas.
"I have always been struck its refinement, calm, his appearance pulcro and perfect," admits d Arenberg.
The last time that I saw was a month ago at a dinner gala at the Museum of Orsay.
He was on the table of the countess Jacqueline Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"It was impeccable, the time is not for him."
If it says a princess...
The hardest job in the world: the human seen Kawah Ijen
By four euros, the porteadores indonesian volcano risk their lives and health burden 70 kilos of sulphur from empinados Stone paths
There are those for which his work is a hell and another, literally, working in hell.
In the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living making sulphur from the volcano Kawah Ijen, east of the indonesian island of Java.
To that end, must come down every day to the bottom of the crater, where sulphur gas emanating from the bowels of the Earth is solidifica when they come into contact with the air.
After clawing large rocks of sulphur, reaching a total despite a 70 kilos, carries in two baskets of bamboo that burden on their shoulders through escarpados Stone paths.
Are just 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which amounts to 2.386 feet, but the exhausted porteadores take over 40 minutes to amount to a snail's pace, observing the balance and measuring very cautious in their footsteps to resbalarse and not fall over the precipice.
They know that any catch could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist despeñó years ago by the Kawah riscos Ijen.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulphur mining
Once up, are appearing among the tourists that the circus fotografían as if they were monkeys, and charge fatigosamente the heavy canastas, walk three miles until the balance that a mining company has put a little lower, at 1.850 metres high.
It is a question of PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company operating since 1960 the volcano and, rather, their employees, who never pays indonesian 662 rupees (5 EURO cents) per kilo of sulphur.
Then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to manufacture cerillas, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whitewash the sugar.
"As is normal load 70 kilos, produced a $46 rupees (3.8 euros) on every trip," explains Anto, who usually make three portes daily.
Takes three hours to each one and just molido, but it may raise 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a pittance for such inhuman effort, is triple what would gain in the countryside.
"The miners jornal is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid to 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly wage is EUR two million rupees (167)," clarifies the porteador, who previously worked as a bricklayer in the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the proportion was not as hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for reasons of weight that is as strong as the sulphur: "married to a young woman from Bali, Indonesia, where hindus, and I have brought on Java to turn to Islam."
Anto has asthma, is breathing with difficulty, tose constantly and it irritate the eyes by toxic gases
In its 27 years, Anto brings three playing the skin in Kawah Ijen sulphur, which has already begun to pass Bill despite be covered his face with a mask and special glasses.
Has asthma, is breathing with difficulty, tose constantly and it irritate the eyes of toxic gases that fires the volcano.
It is the price we must pay to achieve their dream.
"Work two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," promises in an English more than acceptable.
Punished for life, this young engaging and intelligent could be tourist guide, a hotel waiter or recepcionista, but instead is the work of a mule.
Sharing an infamous wooden hut with other porteadores, every day to the two was closed in the morning because the sulphur is manar at night, when his characteristic colour yellow becomes blue and is in the midst of darkness.
Defying the shadows, Anto falls to alumbrándose crater with a small pocket torch affixed to its hull, which he has bought with money.
Some 400 porteadores loaded baskets of sulphur on his shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its great profits, the mining company has not mechanical engineering extracting the sulphur to save costs and provides no equipment to the porteadores, who work on their own and so much weight.
In fact, not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge for house that, along with the entry of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) of this natural park guards charged to tourists who come to photographed the volcano and logged its seen human.
"This work is for the animals and not for the people," protest Madrusin, a fornido porteador of 42 years in the Kawah Ijen three decades, since he left school.
Capable of lifting up to 110 kilograms, ensures that aguantará working "everything it can" because it needs the money to raise their three children, aged between 10 and 18 years.
I am not jubilaré, I will die here because the volcano has been my life
Although the sulphur burning throat and rankles the eye when the wind changes suddenly and locks the miners in the thick columns that are out of the volcano, so hard that none complained of serious illnesses... beyond, of course, their usual artrosis, respiratory problems, pain in the knees and sores on the shoulders, which have been malformado by the weight of the baskets.
Balanceando the basket on their backs, Unainik alone can load 50 kg of its 53 years.
Every day, he and his fellow grub 15 tonnes of sulphur the volcano, which three trucks move the warehouse of goats Tamansari, 18 miles away along a road between the undergrowth.
"I don't jubilaré, I will die here because the volcano has been my life," proclaims Unainik opening his mouth, where it lacks several teeth.
Of their five children, sulphur, 30 years, also works loading.
As time passes, but poverty continues from generation to generation, one of the strongest of the world: the offices that make human seen Kawah Ijen.
Singapore seeks babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the race, the stress and the cost of the property and education for not having children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a husband patriotic patriotic, you are my wife, do our civic duty and we believe life!
It may seem implausible that these lines are part of an announcement of menta tablets, but despite that - or perhaps because of it - the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The sentences are part of a rap that uses local references such as "we will put a bao (roll) in the oven" for laughing at the birth rate in Singapore.
The publicity firm that made the video, BBH, hopes that with the announcement it will draw attention to the problem in a funny way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says that wanted to use the power of music for people to achieve their national duty." "
This is a purely of the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in reproducirnos ourselves, so we feel that this was an issue that we must address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as launching perfumes with feromonas or organising evenings for quick quotes (speed-dating).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily worked.
So we thought, why not do as creative as possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
It does not take it so lightly is the government of Singapore.
Spent $1,300 per year in policies to encourage people to have more children.
A package of government for married and fathers gives up to $15,000 per child, extended parental leave and distributed tax benefits.
But this has had little effect.
Singapore is a hi-tech, wealthy city-state in south-east Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its division of national population currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time I was in excess of 2 -conocida as reposición- rate was in 1976.
So why singaporeans do not have more children?
As Wei Ming, Director of the division's national population policies of marriage and the family, says that is due to a "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."
"That allowed people to have a broader range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and starting a family," explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the rise of the soltería, and to delay marriage and children, which results in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an EU immigration policy tip to drastically increase immigration to confront the decline in the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites rife with barely disguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who criticised for keeping wages low and not integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why that last year the Party Government of Singapore experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the election there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher fees and charges for foreign workers.
Unintended consequences
While the decline in the birth rate has known effects in a nation's economic growth, tax revenue, healthcare costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore is also having some unintended consequences.
The government is trying to so many homes are not built small.
For example, has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has moved to control the number of small apartments, known as "box of shoes," which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These flats are areas of 46 square metres and sales have been very successful.
However, there is concern that can promote a lifestyle of soltería and discourage large Developers who want to build homes, family.
But Lim Yew Developers buildings soon, ceo of the company, says that his "boxes of shoes sold much faster than larger units."
Are more popular, in the sense that the units are exhausted, days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, admits that the new rules give clearer guidelines for Developers, who before they put obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city state.
While these new rules may be a step towards a national increase in the birth rate, in talking to singaporeans who work in the city centre's apparently will not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive and so is education, so that many people are postponing it," says a young executive.
People can have children.
"But it is important for me to have my own money and time," says another young man of about 20 years.
Men and women mentioned his career, stress and the cost of the property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to babies, singaporeans are those who have the final say.
The private off line is private on-line
Privacy.
According to the dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy is the quality of private or "has the right to protect the privacy of any interference."
What is private for a less than 16 years?
How does this definition in their daily lives and on social networks?
Can you see the dangers that is exposed to ventilate online situations that surely would share out of line?
Elperiódico interviewed five boys aged between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, asociaron the term "something very mine, on a personal level," and "in the name of the user and key," when applied to social networks.
"My deepest secrets might not to a post," says Jorge, ten years, when trying to explain the significance of private on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and windows live Messenger, where it accounts for two years.
Secret "are very secret, my mother can meet them, but not everyone," says.
In belgian francs subo images fine or games.
I also entretengo with my known.
"I would share a photo that is not mine, or someone who is being ridiculous," she says.
The child recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs of naked people, or write comments humiliating or violent crimes.
Jorge ensures known to the 35 friends in belgian francs and their nine followers on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
The mother is included, is the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to speak and write tweets interesting.
"I don't know if I answered, I only the subo," adds.
"Social networks are entertaining, I can speak with distant relatives or with my friends quickly," says.
Does not hesitate to say that would never accept a request from an unknown person.
Nor would do if someone that I recommend to a stranger.
The case of Jose, 14 years, is different.
The teenager has open accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, my space and ask, in this latest admits not knowing 20 people aggregate in their list of friends.
"I am not afraid, because we have something in common, music, for example," says.
According to the boy, none has just been and asked the leadership of your home or your phone number.
"If I simply pressure or you require the sack of my account," acknowledges.
Jose was follower of ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy did not fall outside the experiences of what is now known as ciberbullying.
In a famous for my friend were extorsionando in a social network.
It threatened and he demanded money.
"Never knew who he was," says.
The victim, according to José, did not close the account.
"Only placed privacy."
Then he explains a number of steps to shape the Bill safely.
In contrast to George, this boy might photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
It would, if you fall ill or you get anxious.
"Even though I know that this is ciberbullying," says.
Key questions
Marielos batons, teacher of English and with a degree in education and learning, believes that to guide to children and adolescents should be understood that the purpose of social networks is reporting.
"The Internet emerged as a means to find information, but with the aparecimiento sites changed the rules of the game," says.
Batons points out that the academic Marc Prensky, masters in education at Yale University and author of the book digital natives and immigrants, coined the terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, children and young people who were born with the technology.
"We are the digital immigrants that we have to teach them, while we are still learning," he says.
He says that the issue is complex," because we are asking that they have a definite attitude about what is or not endorsing, publishing or say to an age that the maturity does not for that."
"Also to be selective when what matters most is popular, having thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences," adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach what privacy to children and adolescents is through questions that make them think.
"Say it does not serve," adds.
Then, batons lists some options: there are things that would not contarías to a strange, why you do on the Internet?
Or, do you like to publish a picture of you as a friend publicaste?
Do you know what others publish on it?
When photos of party labels, pediste permission from the others to parcel them off?
And one more, all they need to know what you are doing every time?
Another point is signalling that on-line must act as they do off line.
Are the same rules.
"One out of Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, as must be on social networks," says.
Surveillance
Estuardo guard, university professor, professor of primary and educational consultant, says that it is essential that parents read thoroughly policies of social networks.
To understand each of the relative they have solid foundations to talk with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is permitted to share or publishing," she says.
According to guard, is key to remind the children the lessons of "no hables with strangers."
The Unasur summit ends without making public the Lima Declaration
The Sixth Summit of the presidential Suramericana Union nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without it being made public the declaration of Lima, announced previously and allegedly signed by the seven leaders in attendance.
Efd tried repeatedly to access the document signed in the sixth ordinary meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but sources of chancellery and presidency emphasised at the outset that he was given after the closure, but later said that at some point will be published on the web of the peruvian government.
To be consulted by the text, signaled that the content had been made by Peru's President, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statements to the press.

Subsequently, the presidency of Peru sent an email to the media with the final declaration of the summit, but it is the pronouncement of Humala, and not the official document which closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of Arab Sur-Países America (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being repeatedly required by the press, nor spread the so-called Lima Declaration that had previously been announced.
On the official website of ASPA can confirm that the document was published on Tuesday.
In both international meetings, the peruvian authorities have worked with it insured transmission systems for all journalists but limited the maximum obtaining information.
The summit concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court in the hague that dirima diferendo border between the two countries.

"Chile has been, is and will remain a country respectful of international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, the Treaties and international courts," added Piñera, and welcomed with a shake of hands to Humala, along with the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that will be submitted to the icj happened next to Colombia this week denounced the pact of Bogotá who had agreed to submit to the judgments of the international court, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua considered seriously wrong.
The summit was held with the presidents of Brazil, Dilma inasistencias Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Evo Morales, Bolivia and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.

With Europe in crisis," the economic consolidation (in Latin America) do not have a parent triunfalista but must serve to extend nustra parent productive and look forward to a better future for our peoples," added Humala.
"We have decided to favour a group of 31 flagship projects that improve the connection of the areas of South America, especially in rural areas and borders... joining our countries and generating new economic channels," said the peruvian President in a message read.
Among these projects, said that five correspond to Peru, and estan located in the cross-cutting themes of their territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two points to a greater connection with Ecuador, but did not give further details.
Moreover, the final document said the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will rejoining the South American Union of nations," of which is currently excluded.
The need to keep Latin America as a region of peace and prosperity, integrated, and good relations between neighbours, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this respect, the colombian president, Juan Manuel santos, said before starting its participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his pair of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to discuss in respectful manner the maritime diferendo following a failure of the icj, questioned by bogota.

"South must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship ': Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a target in the south, in this case "yes, Europe should learn from."
Correa, who took part in the sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told the state-run TV Peru that Europeans "was killed in the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but now they are virtually a homeland."
Defended, in that sense, the project of establishing citizenship Suramericana who encourage the Member countries of the Unasur.
"We need to ensure the free movement of citizens and workers by any country suramericano reactionary, as already happens with members of the andean community, but there are still areas we want to return to the past," he warned.
The ecuadorean President was, moreover, in favour of the rearrangement of the Organisation of American States (oas) under the premise of reducing the influence of the anglo-saxon and take account of states that have signed the pact of San José on human rights.
Those who give academic never commit to anything and, in return, we signed the South America everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the inter-american Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States," said in reference to the political asylum by Ecuador gave to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that is not repentant of that decision because it has not betrayed their principles, but that he respected their "profound democratic values and human rights."
Adding that, at the time," had a well-founded suspicion that Assange should be extradited to a third country and does not respect the process."
He, also, to the Swedish Justice to demand that is put on their territory to interrogation by an alleged sex crime when "the Swedish legislation itself can deliver via video conference, that could be made from the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa said that there is a risk of unravelling the physical and mental health of Assange.
"I have not spoken to him since he came to our embassy, but the ecuadorian Ambassador lung told me I had a small problem, nothing serious," said the chief executive.
So there is a danger that deteriorate their physical and mental health for being locked in a small area without power do exercises in the open air.
"This complicates the health of any person," added.
Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted Assange at the ecuadorian embassy in London since June, providing a salvaconducto to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the confinement of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, that word doesn't use in this case, but there have been ongoing talks.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because the lawyer for Assange, Baltazar Garzón, is making a series of procedures in different European institutions," said.
And ruled that "if Britain gives tomorrow the laissez-passer that is running out."
And if Sweden, as well as allows its legislation and as he has done in other cases, interrogated Mr Assange at the Ecuador embassy in London or questions via Skype tomorrow is just this problem.
Correa took to assert itself as a defender of freedom of the press and matizó that it does not tolerate is "mediocrity, bad faith and the lie, which weaken the freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not evil, evil politicians but the bad journalists in terms of profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
Here was pleased that are no longer these journalists' bankers or the bourgeois hegemon and countries that dominate in Ecuador," and brought forward to be re-elected "deepen in the revolution to continue along the path and the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto to Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next election, to argue that the agency "must be firm and does not tolerate the opportunism and the law" because in reality "golpismo been shattered the legitimacy of democracy paraguaya."
The ecuadorian President also found "very pertinent" the desire of his colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel santos, the maritime limits between both countries to negotiate now with Nicaragua after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in the hague, which benefited nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, there is no toes that ruling.
It is a problem between a South American country and one Central American.
The conflicts are unavoidable, but they must be overcome by the willingness to walk together.
We need to prosecute them in a broad sense to overcome them and move on.
Also entrusted to a good conclusion of litigation by maritime limits between Peru and Chile in the same court and ruled that "is right for Latin America seeking international bodies if the two countries agree to accept failure by painful it is."
In reference to the event to be presented as a candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term said she sees that possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite hard."
Correa assured that if it loses the elections of February of 2013 will be removed from public life.
On a personal level I was never interested power, but in situations as unfair as the socio-economic in Ecuador that poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My movement pólitico believed that it was I who guaranteed that likely victory, because we have to accept that reponsabilidad," he said.
To win would be my last period in the presidency and hence out of public life.
If we lose together.
"It is a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I have just spoken with the Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolás Maduro and tells me to go to a treatment that was already planned, routine, we waited to move the campaign to return to Cuba.
"Does not mean a relapse in the state of health of President Chavez," said.
The ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima in the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) that ended with calls for greater regional integration to sustain the progress, equality and security.
Deaths from AIDS are now due to late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the positive outcome of the test: Aids.
"It was as if I was a bomb," referring to recalling the time of the announcement, which the doctor would do "more suavecito, without clear success."
The boy hid it to his family.
Decided to take over just about his illness and began to learn about it; with such determination that already festejó his birthday 43.
It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the civil hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years ago, something hard to imagine in the early 1990's, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, to the director of a clinic's IMSS avoided bid him farewell "because brought a cut."
Then, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.
However, unaware of his illness, yet many people arrive when the virus has already wreaked havoc," exhausted "his immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years of the onset of AIDS in the world, not the least of reported the first cases," the great achievement means at this time that a patient's sobrevida starting treatment in a timely fashion and sobrevida among the general population, it is exactly the same," said the head of the unit's HIV HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after saying that this information was supported in April this year in a scientific journal prestigiada.
Infectólogo and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a judgment fatal, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of affecting the immune system of the patient before the diagnosis, better expectation for people who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years, when bring 500 CD4.
In simple terms, this means that whoever gets the diagnosis of HIV positive at 25 years of age, under these terms "while maintaining control can live without problems until the age of 75," explained the interviewed.
For dimensionar this progress, it is worth remembering that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
Although the mortality has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS declined 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (unaids annual report), it is also true that from the onset of AIDS, 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and van 187 deaths until May of this year, but will ensure that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
 - Why still deaths?
 - it seems to me that the problem is not of access to treatment.
So visualizo, that has happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had desabasto of the drug problem is that patients are very advanced because unknown state of infection, in late stages of the disease.
Took a stunning fact: "nine out of ten patients arrive when already have some opportunistic infection what has to be done in order to have a greater impact on the overall mortality, early diagnosis is made more and, therefore, have to offer screening tests on a massive scale, to all those who require it."
In its motion are specialists and prevention of AIDS in Jalisco State Council officials (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to take the test at a particular laboratory, only motivated because I had done a friend and, despite their young age, was in a stage of AIDS and even experienced sarcoma Kaposi, a cancerous tumour that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that is going to die and do not want to know anything.
"If I am going to die, better reviento three times a week," say not in my case.
The change was to improve, I feed well, I exercise, I take the medicines.
To date, their parents only know that suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life, as anyone.
"Work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but I am cautious involved, to me and to the other person," listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share their privacy with millennium Jalisco to justify their testimony to those today, within the framework of the World AIDS Day, they are afraid.
To take the test, if had risk, that between quickly know whether they are HIV positive, it is better and if they have the diagnosis, they learn that they can live like any person, being responsible.
This, his message, sums up the motto of this battle AIDS 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Big are the gaps between the health programmes and the ordinary citizen, argued Ricardo Salazar, journalist tapatío who has assumed the cause on the HIV.
And the largest is in prevention.
At the sites dedicated to this task "has effectively increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now give us packages of 100, and that is all very well but some still do not have access to a condom," he said.
New infections are among the most vulnerable adolescents.
"Why do you want?" is a common question, ironically and guiding value judgments of social workers, schools, employees of pharmacies and health staff, who did not want to expose the teenagers, assured the communicator.
Proposed redirecting this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not only behind the counters and those 100 are in despachadores public baths of sites that go to young people.
Is not motivate the promiscuity.
Nor is it pay the chelas and motel, as the governor Emilio gonzalez replied, to ask if it distribution of condoms in his administration.
"This is not the sex, it is best to bring condoms to those already in a sexual activity," said.
Keys in Jalisco
There are 13,435 accumulated (12,158 cases of AIDS and HIV 1,317).
The state is 4 ° national rise in new cases and accumulated of 13th of HIV and AIDS.
92% of the infection is the sexual way, 6% to the way blood and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50 thousand people may be living with HIV as a case registered about 4 to 5 people who do not know it.
Ratified by a US court of appeals a ruling that ignores the successful restructuring of the group's debt Vitro via a commercial competition in Mexico, the scenario puts a harmful precedent for any company with national ramifications in the neighbouring country with solvency problems.
It seems, then, that the procedures in support of survival of the firms that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the stars and the stripes, out of step with international conventions.
In practical terms, the boost to the ruling issued on 15 June last by Judge Harlin Hale of the bankruptcy court for the northern district of Texas, Mexican firms left defenceless against the possibility of seizure of their property in beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the Supreme Court of the United States, claiming three inconsistencies.
For a start, while the judge in the case says that creditors should be governed by the law of bankruptcies in the United States, the court of appeals for the fifth circuit, based in new Orleans, says that the main procedure is the commercial contest through Mexico.
The first point would ignore the international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational companies with profile.
In fact, towards that end was created the United Nations model law for the uniformity of international trade law, appear as referee the American law Institute.
Secondly, the ruling says that without the inter-company vote, recognized in the critical mass of tender commercial debts they had with their parent subsidiaries in Vitro, had not been achieved the required majority to approve the restructuring.
However, the possibility the recognised the Mexican laws.
In fact, the in Vitro was not the first case in which it accepts the scheme.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex Mexican and commercial, whose debts inter-company supported the Federal Institute for favour commercial contracts.
The truth, however, is that making the votes of subsidiaries, however Vitro creditors who fought against it in the courts of the United States, the funds "buitre" as Aurelios capital, Aurelios convergence, Elliot international and Liverpool limited, will not have achieved majority.
The vote would have been 45% against 37.
The fact it omits the Court of appeals.
From another angle, it blames Vitro's difficult situation that faced from 2008 to soslayo of the grave economic crisis that confronted us, pegándole coletazos the country.

Héctor "Hetin" kings: "basketball was my life '
Basketball Héctor "Trotamundos Hetin" was more than 60 years linked to sport of kings tabloncillo and, thanks to him, traveled the world.
Few people in puerto rico has a mental collection in the history of the local basketball as large as the Héctor "Hetin" kings.
And that is before a stroke confinara to a wheelchair in 2008, reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, was as a national player of higher minor categories, basketball player, grabbed and leader in the BSN Bayamón with jeans or President of the basketball federation.
"I came many hats in the basketball in my life, including several at the same time, as when he was President of the federative BSN, President and ceo of the national team during the 1990s," recalled first hour during a visit to his home in kings Bayamón, where lies with Elizabeth, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Kings not exaggerated in making that claim.
The walls of his home, nearly all decoradas with photos and memorabilias to denote his extensive career, bear witness to this.
Bayamón the heart
In all, which has now clocked up something with more emotion they rememoran its passage through the jeans since the mid 1950s as player until 1982, when served 15 years serving as coapoderado or hold of the franchise.
"These were my best years, the more I enjoyed because I had the opportunity to be part of eight championships of jeans since 1967, were already as rich, coapoderado or leader.
Many years of satisfaction, including the five championships deprived from 1971 to 1975.
And then I despedí with one in 1981, the year of debut Jerome Mincy BSN.
From then on was responsible "bogeyman" Ortiz, which was a great manager, "said reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, which sent here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "you have a good strong player, 6 '7" stature.
Do you want? "
And this was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that has had puerto rico.
Bartow nativizado and then advised the Raymond Gausse sniper, was one of our best marksmen.
I remember that said that if it had given a championship Mincy Bayamon, Gausse would help bring one again.
The championship of the jeans with Gausse enjoyed it, but because of the distance since 1988 was top dog federating.
By that time he preferred to enjoy their ejecutorias Mincy and those in the national team.
I remember when I won for the first time to the United States during the Preolímpico in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we came fourth place and should have been bronze but for the canadian referee made us repeat the final game for the second time, reyes said.
This group of the 1990 World Cup is the best national team that hayas seen?
It is among the best, as he won the dream team in the olympics in 2004.
But my favorite was the Panamericanos in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a pela the United States team, which was quite similar to that which we won the bronze in the world.
The team not only kept returning to Mincy Gausse, Raymond Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) (Javier), but also had to "Toñito columbus" young and James Carter, the lion (brothers Francisco and Edgar "quixote") and Mario Morales, who had not been in the 1990s due to a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personnel, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was the 1995's Preolímpico in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players of role as "Canito 'federation, Paul Alicea and a youth Rolando Hourruitiner in place of the suspended players for the mess of sea Panamericano silver, won gold against all the odds.
What has been the best player of puerto rico?
Without doubt, this has been Piculín Ortiz.
Their numbers at the level of internationals are impressive.
Nobody in puerto rico has dominated at that level as it did Piculín.
And that without his record in the different leagues who played.
Who was the best leader boricua?
This is very difficult.
We have had a very good boat which includes July bull, flower Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau Armandito Torres.
For young people, I love the work of Leo Arill.
What consideras Your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been part of the national team's most glorious era between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 1990s the BSN took until 17 teams in a season.
What you came to do?
There were things I wanted to implement, as the regionalisation of the smaller categories.
For example, that the boys of Ponce only playing in your area and only enfrentaran teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now, children travel and play too unnecessarily.
At least see the fruit of the certifications compulsorias and course for leaders, bureau officials and referees.
I welcome that.
What do you do now?
The most I do is listen to music, watch videos of the music of my time on YouTube, disfrutarme to my grandchildren and occasionally go to baseball games.
And clearly, enjoy the company of my wife, Elizabeth, who has always been with me.
The actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, born on 21 September, 1931, in Forth worth (Texas), became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas," in which embodied an unscrupulous businessman, malicious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the predatory tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
She was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died on Friday afternoon due to complications of cancer, according to a statement from the family provided to the Associated Press by Warner Bros., house producer of "Dallas."

To Hagman diagnosed him with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted that he had drunk a lot over the years.
In 1995 he found a malignant tumor in the liver and was given a transplant.
Years before "Dallas," Hagman made his name on television as a decent rate in the mild comedy "I dream of Jeannie, disseminated by the chain NBC from 1965 to 1970.
It interpreted the captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is disrupted when is an attractive genius as interpreted by Barbara Eden, and takes it away to live with him at his home.
Was leading two comedias who were little time in the air," the good life "(NBC, 1971-72) and" here we go once again "(ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included welcome by the critical roles in "the group," "Harry and stupid" and "primary colors."
But it was his masterful interpretation of encantadoramente detestable J.R. which led to Hagman peak estrellato.
The dramatic series of the Channel CBS on the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was out from April 1978 to May 1991.
The phrase promotional "who shot J.R.? ', intended to generate expectation on an episode full of emotion in the character of Hagman almost risky is killed, sparked an international speculation and millions of dollars in gambling houses.
It also helped give the series A record audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 chapter, an average of 41 million viewers sintonizaron and made "Dallas" the second programme of entertainment in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which took 50 million viewers.
It was the sister-in-law of J.R. Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.r. embarazó and then threatened to characterise it of prostitute unless it is outside the city, but others also had reasons for attacking.
Ewing Hagman interpreted as a corrupt infidel insatiable with a charismatic smile: a tricky businessman and a husband who sought to make his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), outside internada.
"I know what I want on the tombstone of J.R." said Hagman in 1988.
I should say: "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only negotiated that lost.
Victoria principal, coprotagonista of the original series, on Friday reminded Hagman as someone "enormous, inside and outside the screen."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of every one of us who had the good fortune to meet him and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were conveyed a few months ago with great success for the channel TNT.
He had already finished the recording of five of the chapters for the second season and a sixth was in process, reported the chain.
Immediately there was a statement from Warner or TNT on how will he manage the series loss of Hagman.

Open course that explores the "end of the world"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic issues such as nuclear war, the zombie, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion Professor Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, knew he had an irresistible hook: the end of the "long final countdown" the mayan calendar, on 21 December, which many people have been held as proof that it is the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what I expected in the next couple of months: the cataclísmico hurricane Sandy, a fiscal precipice that some have called "deudarmagedón" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists of the end of time they will begin the apocalypse.
"I realised that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester there has been," said Charmé this week to students of the university Rutgers-Camden (new Jersey).
If you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we were to 30 days and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mindset.
And he is not only a teacher who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last of history.
In nerve, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker is running the course "Media, Culture and the end of the world."
Every week, students explore apocalyptic issues such as nuclear war, the zombie, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We look at why these ideas spread over time," he said, and the way in which offer hypothetical scenarios that guide some human behaviour.
If the nuclear material falling into the hands of terrorists, for example, may ignite a war.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and exploraron how compared with examples of real life.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
At the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania professor of history of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari attached, a professor of art history and results, have made team to provide only a course, entitled "the end of the world."
"Not add '2012' to always have the option to teach the course again, if the world does not end," said Restall.
Despite the "imminent ruin," Students should study, generating projects and take final exams.
In Penn state, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the apocalypse, which leaves students with no option but to work "until the evening in which it is assumed that the world ends," said Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
"It saturó in two hours," said Restall on its course for students with high average, which was filled with 35 students.
We received e-mails for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, people who asked if there was still held.
The students, for their part, claim that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to console themselves to themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a student of the race in religion and sociology of 23 years Haddonfield, new Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And is that the apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, it is just a matter of comfort or the lack of it.
Will Wekesa, a student of the career of psychology and nursing, for 25 years, said they had seen all the apocalyptic films.
"Had never heard of a class that could teach that," said.
I enjoy.
But no student interviewed - and far less a teacher - said to believe the sell-by date of December 21.
"Our first project was on the mayan prophecy and in some ways desacreditamos," said Julie Zeglen, 21-year-old student last year in nerve, and in West Chester.
The mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
But acotó that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, going back several centuries, in which people react to changes around them predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a boom in such speculation.
"Otherwise people don't think about this," he said.
In mostly in the english-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the university the Salle providing courses in the Philippines this year, responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about some progress on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, suggesting an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the pope.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of reckoning, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December," people will start to think immediately in the next date "or to philosophise on 21 December is the beginning of a period of seven years after which will end the world.
Students and teachers are taking lightly the date.
Several said they think go to Christmas "the end of the world."
"Maybe to call some friends to riamos us together," commented Samira Ford, student communications for 20 years.
