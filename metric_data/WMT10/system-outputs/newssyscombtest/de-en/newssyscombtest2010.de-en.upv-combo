Lack of snow on the mountains haunts the hotel owners
Scneelose Pisten Sorgenn make not only the giant residents.
The lack of snow discourages people from appointment of the Skiaufenthalte in hotels and pensions.
It can therefore in Giant still free room for all winter dates incl. Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are often visited.
The people go through the offers, the prices, but now they are afraid to order binding.
And if they call us to ask immediately, whether we believe that this year's Christmas on snow or will be led by the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura.
Who the New Year's stay in the Spindelmühle just after his ideas ideas, should no longer hesitate with the appointment.
Anyone who prefers saving and the quality of the stay in second place, which can try to wait a few days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners offer now for the Silvestertag Year's Eve day mostly only weeks stays.
I think that they are still for a will seek to sell it, but then they must also give in and for shorter periods.
And then the free rooms room quickly quickly, Jandura estimated.
Free beds in all winter dates is always always the travel office Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer is about half of the seats are still free.
That is why we have already some cheaper Christmas prepared for the last moment, the director of the travel agents Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Silvestertag in Giant can also offer the Vrchlabi-travel yet, but there is are less free seats.
Good (also find the first 14 days in February, the rest of the winter dates are sold on average.
This year is the interest for the winter also negatively affected by that in Giant is no snow.
The people are waiting to see whether snow falls.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
Should the runways within a week verschneit, will also be sold out the Christmas, says Schiefert.
Conversely, and slightly better than in last year, manages fill the room in the hotel horizon in Pecpod Snezkou
We are about five per percent better than in the previous year.
On Silvestertag and Christmas we have only a few free room.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February, will the business will also well, informed the director of the best Pec Karel Rada.
To 80 percent for the New Year's Eve is also the hotel Omnia Hotel in central Zentralparkplatz in Janske Lazne occupied.
Remains remains Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne even half the beds.
Pleasantly surprised us in January this year of January, for which we are currently at around 60 60%.
A bit weaker is now the February, but at the moment when the snow comes, is also the interest in the periods in Giant, the director of the hotels Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
On for a more snow mess the Giant hotel owners now.
On Thursday it should cool and if it there is rainfall, should be the snow on the mountains.
But then again to a warming, informed Jiri Jakubsky from the site of the Czech weather office in Hradec Kralove.
United States: repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is almost comical, with what Schülerstrebsamkeit Barack Obama, the President with his reputation of the brightest, the strategy of his predecessor in the issue of which he even for the most
When he finally his awaited ausschwitzte Afghanistan doctrine, it was that he abschrieb this on the Kopierpapier from the Bush Szenariovor three years ago.
Not only that it times in the text itself the saying goes, "as in Iraq", he has even used the name of the Bush statement of January 2007 as the name of its own declaration: "new Vorwärtsweg" used without fence.
He has even three years ago, the Bush idea - fresh troop contributions in the troubled by the civil war in Iraq - as "irresponsible and in their conclusions karastrophische decision".
Subsequent months showed, however, that the recommendations of the military Bush is the only possible and was very successful the that we is today in the news about Iraq no longer
The Bush's reputation has not improved by because he has his successor a much dankbarere starting position as it was to be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle repeatedly.
In order to increase the contingent have asked him again asked the military, especially the commander of the Afghanistan operation General Stanley McCristal, even despite the Subordinationsgewohnheiten the zaudernden protect in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers in order to reverse the situation for the better.
The President postponed three months, but with no better idea and so he has betrayed the general wenistens about 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has the promise of another 5,000 5,000, even if he originally at least 10,000 expected.
Highly problematic about the whole Obama strategy is its plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and this process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the increase in the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite despite the fratricidal war in recent years is the Iraqi society relatively well structured, its leaders pay to the values.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the indication - one can rely on and there are no agreements.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, which are used every day to change their day.
The political institutions, even if they were established formally correct, that leaves only buildings, behind which the patriarchal tribe relations further proliferate.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, particularly because of the confusion of the conditions that the Pakistan- and Iran even more complex.
The building of a "strong state", which is the minimalist objective of the whole operation is very unrealistic.
Time horizon of the Obama strategy surprised by his voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has and now it is on the verge of explosion.
To believe that the small soldiers in the war cries on the broke here create a miracle, can only create a truly romantic soul, which is not influenced by facts.
From the political point of view is the date for the withdrawal of irresponsibility, because the Taliban as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of the Europeans to participate in the combat in Afghanistan, is running out.
Europe's politicians cannot and do not want to their voters not explain way the security of Germany or Italy with the war in the Hindu
Another possible factor that can influence the situation radically, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on the Iranians do not for the United States is a very serious question of whether the problem to be problem with troops.
This question must be answered in the period in which America after Obama the winner withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Any solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation plaster for Barack Obama is the fact that three years left until the presidential election, and therefore, there is still enough time so that it can to a different strategy, fallls would prove to as a total loss.
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs receive no bonuses more in cash

The company has announced that the responded to the sharp criticism of its pay practices.
A group of 30 top managers will instead of the money but they can sell only in five years.
In addition, the can be shares the managers in the case if they act excessively risky.
Goldman Sachs is so accordance to the Reuters news agency at the forefront of the to the premium Wall Street with long-term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street on the further direction is aware, in which it has to go, the former banker of society, Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after having for the first three quarters of this year, almost $17 billion dollars for set aside.
The total amount of bonuses bonuses in the course of this Jahra, according to after the Reuters news agency probably also despite the today measure exceed $20 billion.
The high premiums bonuses in the banking sector with the start of the financial crisis in a whole series of Länders has become the most political issue.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to the bonuses of the bankers, exceed the 25,000 unique with a tax of 50 per cent.
Similar steps are also preparing for France.

Minister Janota is considering the resignation. Klaus has invited him in the Burg
President Vaclav Klaus on Friday morning the Finance Minister Eduard Janota, who about his continued presence in the government, because it is with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form which this by the Assembly on Wednesday was released, does not agree.
It is thought that the budget and perhaps also the continued presence of Janota cabinet in the issues of the Friday meeting.
The budget will also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which as the crisis in the public finances.
On the meeting informed of the presidential spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
On its future remain in his post Janota on Monday with the prime minister, Jan Fischer, negotiate.
After the which now Klaus to sign, if the Czech Republic with a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
In Parliament were but on Wednesday on the Left to monetary money and the money for the civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of the social services and direct wages of farmers.
The government has the proposals of the social democracy, that they increase the budget deficit.
Between the Left Party, on the one hand, and the government, Klaus and legal party, on the other hand, is therefore a sharp domestic political dispute, dessentwegen the question mark over the future work of the cabinet, on whose design of the ODS and CSSD and Green Party agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget as it was approved by the Parliament, the package of austerity measures virtually wiped out by the Fischer- government imposed in the autumn, and that to their understanding of the public debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget, but not not, said today in the discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs that the politicians of the "serious problem" that "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances, have neglected for a long time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution.
An improvement could only bring a strong government, which could still on a broader consensus among the political parties.
The ODS Mirek Topolanek, led that the budget is terrible, and the government should consider their continued existence.
The ODS chairman, Petr Necas, said the CTK that the concept of the cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party apparently no longer works.
Premier Fischer described in the editorial similar words as a "strong worry."
The CSSD leader, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek that the budget deficit is that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that exceeds 200 billion kronor.
Already on Wednesday the CSSD the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was satisfied.
Mandela was in the new film by Clint Eastwood played by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: the Ungeschlagene of the world much of the country from its fight and victories despite some criticisms that the main role was of by an American actor.
The story tells of sport, relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless campaigner against the racist apartheid system of government in the South African Republic as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is in his life history of the American Oscar-actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he was asked by the einundneunzigjährigen Mandela was asked whether he could be in the Eastwood- film.
A further important role Matt Damon.
I said to him: "If I play, I must take you.
The zweiundsiebzigjährige actors, actor, the price for his role in the drama from the Boxbereich "million dollar baby" had already the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from the end the slave owners, become a fictional US president, and also in "Evan Allmächtig but only rarely someone who is still alive, and for many people is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was for his active activity in the end of apartheid in the South African Republic of 27 years in prison.
He was released in 1990 to undfür four years he was President of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "ungeschlagen", and at the same time, it is the name of a Gedichtes of the English author William Ernest Henley, which was published in 1875.
The requirement was to speak as he
The film recounts a true story, in the Nelson Mandela his forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, in to the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people after apartheid still rassenmäßig and economically
He believes that he can his people through sport, so he decides, the rugby players players, the world to the outsiders.
Finally, the South African team to the World Cup of 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela-history on the cinema screen.
He had no objective other than to play this role to this as closely as possible to the reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, so to speak, as he has.
The actor said that if he and the world leaders would be in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, to eat with him to and in his speech to be behind the scenes.
The most important thing was for him to shake Mandela's hand.
I have noticed that when I give you the hand schüttele, I accept your energy, they will be transferred, and I had the feeling that I know what they feel, he said.
For me, it is important to become a different person.
Matt Damon is in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have prevailed.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him, when he Pienaar met for the first time in his house.
I remember when I rang the door rang that he opened up and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life, was: 'in the film, I see much more '.
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors in comparison with their actual role models, he has led the director Eastwood "Invictus: Ungeschlagen" positive reviews and we are also talking about prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his assessment in the following words: "That was a very good story, very well ausgeführter film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, has Invictus 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secret on Norway Norway: the Russians have tested a missile

The Russian Defense Ministry has only yesterday admitted that near the Norwegian border an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested.
The launch was not successful and as a type "Bulava" missile, which was originally be the pride of the Russian army should is becoming a nightmare of Russian generals and the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on the ground in the missile test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava is usually not at all or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers one already on about "Bulava" than a "missile, which not flies."
A missile, which do not flies, but not
This already 13 attempt, was at the beginning of normal.
Only at the end of the flight in turn, technical damage to the missile.
Presumably the engine exploded in the third stage.
This time, "Bulava" from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij which under the water of the White Sea.
This Raketentyp allows the shooting from the submarine.
It is therefore likely that the caused by an unspecified fliegendes object mysterious light on North indeed the damaged "Bulava" was.
In addition, the Norwegians since the first moment not doubt that it is a Russian rocket.
The Generalität has diesesmal challenged and claims that it cannot not speak clearly from a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket fell not from and the accident was only the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines in the first stage.
Even if no test launch without is still the leadership of the Ministry of only six out of thirteen for unsuccessful.
The almost 50% success therefore the generals with optimism and so will continue to claim that the "Bulava" will fly without problems and even to ten Hyperschall warheads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tonnes.

Czech discovery: a substance, which also in tempered like ´ HIV viruses works
The team of Czech and German scientists testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of improved substance is that he is also in the viruses which are resistant to drugs.
This fact against the disadvantage that the link to normal virus variants not as strong as one of the existing medicines.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured.
The patients can the drug but can prolong the life and prevent the proliferation of the HIV virus in the body.
Their their is accompanied by a whole series of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of the reproduction also has the development sg. Resistentviren, against the no medicines are more effective.
The work of the experts from the three institutions of the Academy of Sciences CR, from the VSCHT (chemically-Technological technological Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way how to deal with the virus-resistant.
They have proven that the as Metalokarborane substances on the protein which is responsible for the expansion of HIV responsible.
The Metalokarborane are links from Bor, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These links block the virus in a other ways than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists to new ´ improved ´ been prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their attachment to the viral were prepared.
The Metalokarborane have a unique three-dimensional structure: two vielfächige cages from of hydrogen and carbon atoms and through a metal atom, in this case, cobalt, are linked.
Heimtückisches and constant virus
HIV Protease is protein substance of the HIV virus, which is for the life cycle of the virus is essential.
Without the HIV caused by the HIV virus division would not mature Infektionsvirenpartikel.
If we eliminate the HIV Protease, we call the propagation of the virus in the body of the patients, the scientists in the press report, by the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences was CR.
In the work published in the newspaper Journal of Medicinal Chemistry was published, the scientists describe whole ranks of the compounds, in which two couples of cages (see table) by a brief organic chain are is then systematically changed.
A weaker, but reliable
The impact of this series of substances against the HIV wurdne tested in tested, even against their steady (resistant) variants which were won by HIV-infected patients.
The impact of the Metalokarborane in the usual variant is not as strong as in the clinical used medicines, but they do not lose their effect on the resistant against the of medicines are often ineffective.
The unique effect mechanism and its other properties, such as the biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical makes the Metalokarboranen to interesting links for further on the development of effective medicines against HIV research, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the laboratory for structural biology of the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry and the Institute for molecular genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute over budget. ODS went to fishermen, the Fights Back
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, called the approved budget for the next year as "terrifying" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer in his should consider their continued existence.
The statement of the ODS described the Prime Minister as a "strong Aussprüche."
It is time for the analysis.
The deputy ODS Petr Necas, said that the concept of the cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party apparently no longer works.
After Necas the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in the minority when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether it be in order to remain in office through the Parliament left.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits is diametrically opposed to Necas pointed out.
Parliament has on Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, but with Link on more than 12 billion kronor.
Parliament has the money for salaries, for the maintenance of the social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has the proposals of the social democracy, that they increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should with a backlog of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS has left the chamber before the vote, it is the desire of the government, because the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the provisional Frase not clear
Frustration and futility
The Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, has spoken of his disappointment and a sense of futility, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer has stated that the government of the current situation.
Necas is convinced that, if Janota seriously with his resignation in the event that the amendments were adopted, the situation would be different.
According to the Czech television has Janota on Monday after the government business in the Premier.
He has indicated that he be to remain in office.
Reason reason is his disappointment on the Verhandugn of the budget.
To what extent fishermen for the fight with the budget deficit, so in accordance Necas the Nominanten the Social Democrats (CSSD), the changes in the budget budget, in the government had nothing to do nothing.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament adopts continue to deficit laws, for example, the sick pay and pensions or the service be changed.
Topolanek: the ODS nominated ministers were wrong not
That is a matter for the Prime Minister, fishermen and the entire government.
The ODS nominated ministers have not made mistakes, mistake, Topolanek in a text message from the United States.
It has mentioned that in some ministries in deputy function people who to top 09, who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen in favour to on the fight against the level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority which is at in Parliament".
Then he allegedly with the support and tolerance of the citizens Democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if it will be then I will deal with this said of the citizens Democrats nominated Defense Minister Martin Bartak the journalists in Parliament.
Premier Fischer flew in the afternoon at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS came at the request of the Prime Minister back
Necas stressed at the same time that the ODS probably on Wednesday in Parliament would vote against the revised budget, if the Premier Members of the Democrats explicitly ask that they allow the adoption of the budget.
We are not as orphans, we are not small children, so he responded to the question of whether the ODS in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party leader of the party in Parliament and in the Czech Republic was not back.
I have not noticed that my vote would be lacking.
As I withdrew to the mandate, I knew that in coming months, in at Bolschewisierung of Parliament and destruction of all would be reacted Topolanek itself.

The Czech railways stopped or restricted from 13 December some less its Schnell- and local trains, other links will be strengthened.
The whole transport volume will reduced from the day of the new road map compared with today at two 2%.
Most of the tariffs incl. Basic and Kundenfahrtarif will not be changed.

One of the biggest changes include the introduction of the new Direktverkehrsweges from Milovice to Prague, now the the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth route of suburban transport system Esko, whose opening thanks to the rail electrification from Lysa nad Labem after Milovice is possible.
The routes in the capital will be in the target station Prague - main station.
The CD is more lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains after Sumperk / Jesenik in the space of two hours.
With the Pendolino the passengers since 13 December no longer go to Bratislava.
This year's bill for regional rail: increase of 200 million
The fast trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, a the railways to reimburse the so-called liquidity loss in the next year, four billion kronor, genaus as this year. local trains supply the districts, overall they pay for in next year, eight billion kronor, while the state zuschießt three billion.
This year, the regional trains 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains and the fast trains has completed the railways a ten-year newly contract, until now the Treaty was only for a year.
The railways praises the system, perhaps it has not to the increase in the price of the vast majority of tickets.
To changes, it is only in one-day network Netzfahrscheinen CD net and favourable Internetfahrscheinen Eliska.
For passengers without the customer card will be the price CD net of 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price eLiska will then depend on the Stecke pro-enlargement until now, he was for the travel between any district uniform and cost 160 kroner.

The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods in the American cinema "Invictus: the which is a part of the life history of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid apartheid, Morgan Freeman, has already a few years ago allegedly by Mandela himself himself.
The players role of the legendary South African champions in rugby, Francois Pienaar, has received Matt Damon.
With the launch of the film will also be reactions of critics and the public.
Nelson Mandela
With whole name means he Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on 18 July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988, he received the Sachar price, in 1993, together with de Klerk the Nobel Peace Prize.

Jancura collects complaint for libel against three head of the CSSD.
The owner of the student Agency, Radim Jancura, criminal today for libel against three democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a zwanzigminütigen Inteview on radio Journal.
The complaint is linked to the effort of the company, the regional trains in some districts.
All regions have regions, but ultimately the end the long-term contracts with the Czech railways.
All three head are attacking us and say that we take the cherries, we have the offer only on the size, as it was voted with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech railways, because we know the prices of the Czech railways were completed last week.
So we have no nothing but than to defend us.
Because of this defamation of society student Agency, said Jancura the Journal.

Vaccination against Pneumokokken free of charge and voluntarily
Imfung against Pneumokokken changes from January the usual.
It is a first for the families free and voluntary.
But now voices that the vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against Pneumokokken culminate.
The Institute is already set the maximum price of vaccines vaccines, which have to pay for health insurance.
The experts are also on the vaccination clear.
New vaccination
Vaccines free of charge for August children
From January children can be vaccinated against Pneumokokken free of charge, on 2 August last year and later were born.
The condition st that they have not received a dose.
Anyone who has with the vaccination in last year or earlier, must also pay for itself.
The first dose must be between 3 and 5 month of life of the child.
Already last year, a quarter of the families against vaccinate their children against Pneumokokken.
The parents paid 1,600 kroner and more for a dose.
For the vaccination of the youngest children are four doses required.
As a whole, the experts estimate that the health insurance for the vaccination doses 300,000 to 450,000 kroner per year.
They save but in the treatment of the children without vaccination would need.
Until now, the state for all land vaccination of children spent around 500,000 per year.
The vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumokokken cause Mittelohrentzündung, but also cause serious infections including Gehirnhautentzündungen and blood poisoning.
By Pneumokokkeninfektionen die in us after investigation in hospitals per year up to 28 children up to the age of 10 years.
Outside of the Czech Republic was the duty of children against Pneumokokken in some 40 countries.
Will the vaccination be duty?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccine could be in the future.
From January this paid by the insurance paid and be voluntary.
That the vaccination would be better, mentioned, for example, the head of the citizens association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky.
His association already in the long term for the Pneumokokken vaccination.
The experts at the international conference, which our group was involved, were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination.
That is not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have succeeded, at least
I believe that this is the way we must go now, Kalovsky.
The Department of Health wants but the vaccination procedure against Pneumokokken not change.
At this moment, we are considering not at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, say the doctors.
The chairman of the society of practical Kinderärzten, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, then it could be on the reduction of vaccination number "in a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccine vaccination launched a voluntary," says allerdingst Cabrnochova.
The experts expect that more than 80 percent of parents their infants against Pneumokokken from next year.
The vaccination against Pneumokokken is also groundbreaking, that this is the first land vaccination paid by the health insurance and not by the state.
The insurance should spend the money for prevention, so that they save for further treatment, erkärt Cabrnochova.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
This that is a concern of the practical doctors, linked the purchase of vaccines.
After the initial project the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and doctors receive then in the same way as well as other issued by the state to vaccines.
Some Members feared however, that the insurance so "the money from the health insurance could
Therefore, why the doctors will buy the vaccines themselves and have to wait until the insurance companies pay for them.
According to the estimates estimates, the individual practitioners doctors must invest 40,000 kroner per month, which is a significant of sum.
This will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.

Can Islam can be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when the Swiss voters voted for a ban on building for minarets and the concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, a thorough and thoughtful report about whether Muslims in one of the avowedly säkularisiertesten societies of Europe can be integrated and be integrated.
Some readers will this new book from admiration for the last work of the author: "Why the French no scarves love" (original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006) (2006), an elegant and densely argumentierenden study of a contentious issue, which the country about one and a half decades and employed and whose effects are still today.
Bowens neustes book offers a more comprehensive and kühneres spectrum.
As a good anthropologist he would like to know not only what the politicians and the media about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and colleges, which are now the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islamic free offer.
He is a good listener, he gives debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim in a mosque or a City Hall (or both)?
Should be lectured young Muslims about evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman can marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim, to use a zinsorientiertes banking system in order to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly down-to-earth matters, he claims, the daily life, in contrast to the political drama, the media.
The author acknowledges a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a well-known name, perhaps with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a born in Switzerland Muslim scholars and academics.
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how it is possible, on the one hand, a good Muslim and on the other hand, a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not have all the arguments on their side.
The Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who Bowen are at odds with their Salafi counterparts – supporters of the puristischen Sunni Islam is with Saudi Arabia – the nowadays is a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen is of the opinion that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires a give and take on both sides.
He is question whether extent French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, so passionate the separation of church and state state) really committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may be a rougher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, which in turn had to make their historic compromise with the secular had
He sees more of a "tightening of the values" as a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam can be French? After reading this book, one is inclined to say 'yes, but not "

All the so-called counter-revolutionary activities, the include protests and critical writings, suggest a risk of risk.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are regarded as a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing which led by the popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband and attacked by government representatives and attacked.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to receive prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractors will probably increase the tension between the communist government of Castro brother in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had a "slow" approach to improve relations with the island island.
The news of the arrest was first Friday night by the New York Times reported.
The new US policy stresses that the United States will provide a return if the Cuban government concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and create more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are in Cuba Cuba, even though they are new and coveted products in a country where the average earnings of government employees $15 per month.
The Cuban government has allowed only since this year ordinary citizens the purchase of a mobile phone, they will be used for the sending of text messages, since as a 15-minütiges telephone conversation would cost a daily wage.
The use of the Internet is on the island island. extremely limited.

Pakistani government officials plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at five men from northern Virginia send to Afghanistan in order to kill US soldiers, and said that they hope that this case could help to an a extensive network of terrorist recruitment to the Internet after radicalised young men.
Investigators said that they had a opaque insurgents, known as Saifullah, had sought the men had been invited to Pakistan after he had made because one of them on the Internet video site YouTube favourable comments to terrorist attacks.
Saifullah after their arrival in Pakistan Pakistan, the leaders of these men and tried to help them to reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service, which was informed on the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not persuade the that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were on days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far removed from the inhospitable mountains in the north-west, which have become a terrorist haven.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government officials who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the wanted to
The government officials said that the men were not discouraged and continue to get the right recommendations in order to gain access to the Al camps, when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of the five men - which remains in Pakistan and interviewed by the FBI - underlines the vital role of recruitment in the identification of future terrorists and possibly even more important, in decision who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the service to a matter of the utmost urgency, human asset within Al Qaeda.
The agencies of the organisation as those not those whose commitment to the holy war is not seriously enough and those that might be spies.
American would-be recruits from a Qaeda by a special examination, said analysts.
Because of their potential access to objectives and its propaganda but they also as extremely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, rank the highest analyst of the NEFA Foundation, based in the United States, said that terrorist groups in recent years become much more cautious in about to whom they allow access, because the US intelligence services are experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to send anyone in these groups, what better way could go as the recruitment to which so many have followed?, said said.
The model is based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators are calling in Copenhagen climate "
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday and demanded by the negotiators in the centre of the city kühneres action on climate change.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, while the police estimates of around 25,000.
The event passed off relatively peacefully, although a handful of masked activists small explosive in the vicinity of some government buildings in the inner city zündete.
On a day when the promoted by the UN climate talks little happened, thousands of activists with banners through the city, which in English, "there is no planet B" and one in Spanish, the declared the world says" enough ".
Some stars joined the protest, for example, the Danish model, the Fotografin Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, the birth of their mother, her with the herzzerreißenden problems the country because of the already perceptible effects of climate change.
This is part of the reasons why I have decided to participate in the large demonstration - to pass the floor and to the world leaders to to a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way that the it.
The police kept the demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella Center and said that they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either mitführten or pocket knife
According to Danish law, these actions during demonstrations demonstrations. banned.
According to a viewer, who did not want to be named because he is involved in the climate negotiations, zündeten demonstrators in black clothes several explosive in the vicinity of the Copenhagen main in near where several ministries.

In the interior of the Congress people on television screens to the whole afternoon the demonstration.
But the protest has the awareness of the main officials, such as Su as China's chief climate negotiator, apparently not.
When he was asked whether he thinks that the demonstration would have a positive effect on the international considerations, he replied in English: "That is something of which I was not even aware".
He then in Mandarin and said: "Because of the venue is great, I cannot hear what is happening out there."
He stated that it from the perspective of the individual individual, whether the demonstration would help or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "we can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or the freedom of other people
Prüfungsdaten data show persistent racial divide
The certificates to mathematics performance last week were welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the district of Washington still far behind the schools in the country, the maximum show the evidence show that the Viert- and Achtklässler in the last two years faster progress than cities, Atlanta, Chicago and New York, have made.
But what in the latest figures from the National Assessment of the Progress (National Assessment of Educational Progress - is included, is the persistent achievement gap between African-American and white pupils, both at local and national level.
The average score of the white Viertklässler from Washington D. C. rose in the last two years of 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), their African-American counterparts, but only three points from 209 to 212.
In reality, the gap rose between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African-American Achtklässler remained basically the same, he fell a statistically negligible point of 245 to 244.
The average score of white pupils was not included in the test data, because the sample size was not big enough.
The picture over a six-year period is not encouraging.
The gap, the white and black Viertklässler separated in 2003, when the first NAEP was covered in this district, 60 points (262 to 202).
And although the item number the children of both groups have achieved in that time has been the difference with now 58 points points. decreased.
Some education advocates of the southern last week expressed its concern that the results of school Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty celebrated, for the most part of white pupils, who are already strong children.
This suggests that we the overall assessment by the treatment of those at the top end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a member of the board of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that for the educational equality in Washington D.
I will not for a span of two or three points and said the democratic Washington City Council member Kwame R. Brown, a daughter in the fourth class of primary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said that the message of the point is that the secondary schools in the city need urgent attention.
Of course, we would always see the positive signs, which I respect.
What I me, however, is that we do not spend the time and energy that we would have to use for our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the weak pupils.
In this autumn, for example, some teachers trained to trained, a new reading curriculum, the reading system, to use aimed at pupils in the upper classes of the elementary school and middle school, the basic skills of reading have not at the beginning of their school have mastered and the significantly behind their peer counterparts classmates.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum, from kindergarten to the sixth class games and life experience in the fore, was under the former chief schools inspector Clifford Janey to Washington and this curriculum curriculum, some of the NAEP last week were reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to the best measures the pupils to benefit below the central level, said said.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system and will continue to play the extra money and resources for the weak schools can which are necessary in order to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, the urban audit results.
The conventional remedy is its resources and management reforms at the schools, which in the poorest areas of Washington D.C..
The objective could create political fallout work against this important agenda item.
The weak point is, of course, as with other urban school inspectors that they tried to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We must strengthen our schools in the so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education.
Janey, who is now school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to the closure of the achievement gap is the traditional public school year, which in Washington currently 180 days, to in order to compete with the charter schools.
We must increase the school year to nearly 200 days in order to have the power to change, said Janey, with his teachers' union last year to reach an agreement on 185 days per year, which he called "a milestone" on the road to a greater increase in the next Treaty.
Higher education for more people than a future
The coach reached the Gettysburg with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, is rising and blinzelt a moment at the sight of the white pillars the brick facades and the smaragdgrünen lawn.
Gracielas parents have completed the School in El Salvador.
Until recently, had also was in silver Spring was recovered and now lives in Riverdale, never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and of the other Achtklässler the group, explore the Gettysburg, where the teaching costs dollars per year year, was more of a ehrfurchtsvollen visitor, than of an enthusiastic future students.
"Yes, I will soon be here!" called Graciela who would like to study medicine, as the leaders announced that they had now entering the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said they for thought, as the low to ratio of the school school. reported.
The college in Pennsylvania was the visited the children on their three-day tour visited and now they have the intended message completely: the question is not whether it's College.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States hispanischer immigrants, not the High end or as a become teenager, on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands, which the college that is needed to in the middle class.
In truth, one of five of these "second generation" of Hispanoamerikaner the college – which is a remarkable achievement, because many of their immigrierten parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, in the United States, without the to have School.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because it for a generation, which will play a huge role in the labor force in the country, show the way forward.
Those who study powerful children, say these often have a natural affinity for the school and its inherent drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who give their children high goals and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But advisory programmes also play a major role by Graciela and millions of children as they help to in college, especially if these efforts over a long period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them in the Wegsuche through the system, then will be a single measure at any time does not solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California at Davis, the hispanoamerikanische students studied.

US companies were in some cases cases, because competitors, particularly the Chinese and other state-controlled energy company, have significantly lower wage costs and more risks, because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies have to the contracts with the ministry.
Major US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which with the Iraqi oil ministry close relations and in recent years with technical advice, are empty.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the this weekend this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has for more contracts than any other companies and with large packages of contracts for two major fields go home.
We all know, said the spokesman of the Ölministeriums, Assam Jihad that China is on the way, one of the big of the world economy as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company with its Mitbietern can and will meet its commitments to Iraq.

US Defense Secretary Gates: Iran must reckon with additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon be "significant additional sanctions" on Iran, because he has not in talks on its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke during a 7-tägigen tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of about 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq and played the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there are no good options for options, he said in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things I on the soul, is, if we in the last six years have learned something from Iraq, the war own Unvorhersagbarkeit."
The Obama administration prefers a sanctions package in aimed at the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranians.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is necessary "in order to convince the Iranian government that it is protected with nuclear weapons in reality less because their people will suffer from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesman for the White House, Robert Gibbs, the American government, the European leaders in the warning that Iran must reckon with "credible" consequences if he with its nuclear program not the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology only for peaceful purposes purposes. be won.
In talks in Geneva on October 1, Iran said that he would the talks to curb its nuclear programme and a substantial part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor would reactor.
The US government has pushed for this type of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and to win time for negotiations.
Iran but since that to the negotiations on the interim agreement to -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
That Iran the international community in relation to some of the proposals, which they had already agreed in early October, simply left has, frankly, the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way, as it did in connection with important additional sanctions on Iran have never Gates said said.
President Obama has the 31 Dez. set a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before he other options, including those the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "crippling sanctions" will continue.
In a statement issued in New York has condemned the Iranian representation at the United Nations, which it on Thursday "gratuitous and unfundierte allegations" of certain members of the Security Council on the Iranian nuclear activities and said that they are ready to the talks with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate long-term solution."
Gates, the last Friday should return to Washington, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before he in the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meeting with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish authorities representatives in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, in particular in relation to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, in order to prevent delays the US plans to reduce the American troop strength by the end of August by 115 000 to 50,000.
Gates also sought to the Kurdish concern about the withdrawal of withdrawal. US representatives quoted Gates, to Masood Barzani, President of the Kurdish regional government, said: "We will your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you. "
A change of direction in the ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband husband, surrounded by propaganda posters on lecture them lectures that "mother earth is too tired to have more children" and "a baby more means a more more".
These lessons have you learned that, as well as government officials in Shanghai, by the low birth rate and ageing population in this summer, suddenly began to change course and young couples ermunterten, more than to have a child, their response was immediate and definitive: "in no circumstances".
We already have all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child is nothing left, said Wang, 31, a staff leader with an 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, the two generations of notoriously dicklichen, spoiled Einzelkindern who affectionately called "little emperor", has produced a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate is at 1.8 children per couple, compared to 6 at the time, as this policy came into force, the UN
Department for population issues, while the number of the population of 60 years and older in the year 2020 from 16.7 percent of the population by the year 2050 to 31.1 percent rise rocket. This is well above the global average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is in rich coastal cities with educated population, such as Shanghai, stronger.
Last year, 60 children and older almost 22 percent of the reported residents Shanghai, while the birth rate of one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai city population and family planning has said that couples receive normal reproductive age babies, in order to help reduce the relationship of the ageing population and to alleviate the labour shortage in the future".
Shanghai will soon "as old -- but not so rich -- as the industrialised countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
Enshrined in the constitution of the country in 1978, China's one-child policy be the most controversial which was introduced by the ruling Communist Party until today.
Couples who against this policy, must reckon with huge fines -- up on her triple annual salary in some regions -- and with discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese representatives have attributed to this policy, that the critical demands on the natural resources could be avoided, while human rights activists have condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, have some officials pregnant women who have already had a child, forced to abzutreiben.
Many couples have had geschlechtsselektive out abortions, which an unnatural high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for population gradually their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they have allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including urban dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife have been Einzelkinder -- and 2007 was the tone of many hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research of the University of said that government officials recently discussed even more radical changes, for example, couples to allow two children, in which a partner Einzelkind.
Shanghai was in July the first Chinese city, which has an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters, the families only to have a child, have been replaced almost overnight of directives which describe in detail, who qualify for a second child and how to can apply for the
The city government has sent urban employees and volunteers for family planning, to couples at home and information sheets under the doors.
They also asked about psychological and financial advice for the available, which have more than one child.
The response was not encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disappointing response
Although officials from a rural town in the external areas of Shanghai said that a recovery in the applications from couples to is after the launch of the campaign to a second child, the urban districts against no change.
In the Huinan municipality with a population of 115 as an example still per month, only four or five month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that the 2010 expected number of births in the city despite the campaign still around 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai municipal Caolu, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to give her first best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juan Juan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and this is legally allowed.
But they have, how many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance to the government.
Without a social network, they say, that decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West assess the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer, whose wife in the seventh is pregnant with her first child child.
Yes, it is robbing us the opportunity to have more than one child.
The the problem is not simply in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples be psychological reasons for their reluctance.
Wang, the personnel chief, said she they would like to a one child, because it was also a Einzelkind. "we were the centre of the family and used that everyone has about us.
We are not accustomed to care for others and do not want this. "
Chen Zijian, a 42 which a translation company, said it plain.
For parents from the middle class with dual career, through which the birth rate is falling, he said, it is about to be successful and we must be selfish.
The age group of 20 to 39-year-old grew so to their parents during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment to see and they want a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, is huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must abandon their social life for at least two years.
Then there is the question -- "we must rebuild his home" -- and the life planning -- "if the child is 9 months old, we already have a CV for the best nursery schools."
Most of his friends are ready, this is a time time, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to has achieved a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want to too many victims.
UN group plan to reduce emissions
The by the UN climate change which up until now by wild postures and mutual accusations has set on Friday with the publication of a document document, a priority for the next 40 years, recording an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases, with the industrial nations in the near future have to shoulder the greatest burden.
The text, which is the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases could has both the remaining obstacles, as well as the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation, the time next week, more than 100 leaders from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, which was created by a special created UN working group was is silent on the amount of money from the rich countries to poor countries should be countries, so that they can these short- and long-term global warming.
He also offers a range of options for the key issues, including how industry and major emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature should be, the political decision-makers.
The process will be a great deal flexibility, so John Coequyt, a senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who the pages document, has drafted a 180 pages long negotiating text in the focus on what the leading climate of the UN Yvo de Boer, described as "the big picture".
It shows the outline of a possible agreement, in which the industrial nations together their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent, compared with the levels, of 1990, while major developing countries to reduce their emissions in the same period by 15 to 30 would percent.
Together the countries could reduce emissions by 2050 by 50 to 95 percent
The European Community has the talks on Friday also a boost by their assurance, over the next three years, 3.6 billion dollars per year in order to help poorer countries to adapt to the effects of climate change - from the masters of floods and droughts to avoiding deforestation.
The Friday expressed the same verbal fireworks, which the talks in the last week.
The American climate envoy Todd Stern has rejected the binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries, compared with voluntary reductions for major emerging economies, demand, if they are not funded by the industrialized nations.
This train announced that the Obama administration a tougher line with China, as a representative of the Bush administration not than two years ago.
The United States will sign an agreement without major emerging countries stand up and take action, so Stern, who also lamented the fact that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the cuts could be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave its opinion an hour after the declaration of the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei, meant that the leading American climate negotiator either to common sense" or "highly irresponsible" of him was that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not help China to tackle global warming.
The fact that the future economic direction of the major world powers is at stake, both within the industrial nations, as well as between the industrialized nations and emerging countries fault lines.
The current fight applies equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to save the planet, with China and the United States because of their respective commitments, while poorer countries argue that the two dozen influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder steps.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are fight who bear the costs of the down of the greenhouse gas emissions, because even affected countries have begun to aggressive more the countries with very high greenhouse gas account for their actions.
It is clear that this is a game, which will develop a new economic will Ulate, so is also as a regional climate change adviser for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries that are to the effects of climate change are most change, said that they would continue to fight a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks in the best will lead to a political agreement.
The alliance of small island states with 43 members on early Friday morning a 24 page draft treaty.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states, political pressure on the entire political process," in part because they are now united and measures of the emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding issues before the arrival of the government leaders to be resolved in order to reach an agreement.
Senior representatives, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister entstiegen their aircraft and breaks through the corridors of the Bella to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences claims to be negotiated during the next week.
The sheer scale of the Assembly -- 13,000 people every daily in the Centre and and, gitarrespielende activists hold late-night shows, in which they are fun of the countries which they feel betrayed and sell, and draft passed from hand to hand rather than by e-mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity builds just: almost all the important ministers are now here and on Wednesday be 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of the organization Conservation International.

Britain's first 225 km / h faster train defines the Monday feeling new
Monday morning at 5 p.m. 13 will penetrate a pipe penetrate the darkness to announce a which represents a revolution in transport in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country in his lightning trip from Ashfort, Kent, to London St Pancras 225 km / h and 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the transport minister, will then lady Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin services from London.
He hopes that the new service to Britain finally to an international rail network faster, more reliable trains and the major urban areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London London.
The neglected province could be living commuter towns, Arbeitsanfahrtszeiten would radically reduced and the change of plane and car to would the national carbon emissions and reduce congestion on the roads.
In theory, believe the three main parties in this vision.
But the many billion British pounds, which for the construction of a new national network, the inevitable planning battle and fears about environmental damage could in the British high-speed could still applying the brakes.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company based in January, the government should present a feasibility study, Lord Adonis, according to the Times report on 30 December.
This gives receives a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line, the London with the West Midlands, will with a margin of five metres in urban areas and in places where the effects on the environment are controversial.
The free site will the plan the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final stretch.
HS2 will also three options for a larger, northwards leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option proposed is a Y-shaped route, in which a single high-speed link in the West Midlands.
The route would share in or near Birmingham and a Abzweig would west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another in the direction of East after Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the most viable option," said a insider.
After the completion of the journey time between London and Edinburgh to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part of the which would not be opened before 2025, it would allow the travellers, the London-Birmingham stretch in 49 minutes, compared with just over an hour to go.
The proposals would offer the of the travel with a speed of 400 km / h, which the British rail network would be the quickest of Europe.
The first route was planned that 400 metres long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can to travel.
Up to 18 trains per hour could on the route in operation.
This in turn would mean that a terminus in London would be necessary on the 20,000 passengers per hour could be hour.
Given the space limitations in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be extended to include the high-speed network.
Rail experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston this potential.
Lord Adonis will know whether this plan, in his opinion, should be continued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be taken until after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains to first from the high-speed lines on existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, which the journey time between London and Scotland would in about three hours.
This is as a key sticking point, so that a switch from air to rail can be ensured, a beacon for the rail revolution.

Equally, however, the 15 criminal ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane beds Court, which will be carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heir and Hauptaktionärin of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially among the during the investigation of the public prosecutor of Nanterre's conditions.

What the lawyer by Françoise beds me Me Olivier Metzner, he is very happy with the decision of the court.

For its part, Liliane beds Court had always been manipulated by the photographers, to which it sees as a longtime friend.
Although the court the admissibility of Mrs complaint by Mrs initiated to examine the Plaidoyers of lawyers on Friday led to a large family debacle.

The court has now determined to deliver a verdict after the process on the admissibility of Mme beds has taken place.
Manager-revolution revolution or the end of the strategic early education?
If nothing will change in the leadership of the major French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence in vain...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to his staff, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumers from the marketing revolution: it is for the staff to "values" determines the best, as it was to on the consumer-products of by the technicians in the to
By the customers in the heart of the company has the marketing revolution the strategies of the conquest of the markets in the place... although the authoritarian temptation products separately factors preferences of customers to impose regularly again!
A demobilisation of staff can lead to a deadly demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much larger phenomenon, in particular the employees affected.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company, in particular those of R & Eund, even more crucial to those of economic intelligence.
In fact, calls the IU (Intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) "by all the parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision it claims by the staff a use which the instructions of the authoritarian management completely
That is why we are calling for a occupational revolution, which would be the staff in of the concerns of the company on an equal footing to the customers.
The very conditional use of internal polls
The the internal polls, as the questionnaire, the Orange has his wage made this revolution in relation to the management practice?
I fear that, unfortunately not.
- First, because I could see that the entire structure with a new situation after many route, finally the primarily to do what it has always done.
Also because the authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power in proportion to the importance of his own failures.
And finally, because most leaders have a much simplified idea of human behaviour.
Emerged from the great engineering schools is their interpretation of the psychology mechanistic.
They play by intellectual comfort the old behavioristische theory, which recently by the American "neuroscience" reactivated and unknowingly far-reaching of research institutes and through the media.
Thus, and it suggests that it is possible to the "leverage" (sic) on the involvement of employees, to a aktuellein Le appeared Figaro.fr survey by Ipsos executives in a position to a mechanistic control system, which is unsuitable for today's world.
The mobilisation factors identify and measure

It is, in any consideration or practice of management to integrate a fundamental protocol: for the workers is the commitment to the company will only be possible if it clearly as a means to a part of their dreams, their ambition and their projects.
Now take only the studies from the multifunctional analysis of this idea of the motivation of the staff.
These studies have shown that they their companies on the basis of a set Doxa judge them by their perceived picture of the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and the measurement of these factors can the executives of the companies' social their "social predict and anticipate and their human resource management back to the right place.

The activists are now instructed not to block the supply centers.
"There will probably always be some recalcitrant who are not satisfied with the agreement," he added.

The signature of the TLF allows that the agreement for the first of this organisation affiliated companies, and that they then in the event of an extension by the minister for the entire profession.
This will be the case "in a very short period of the Bussereau Bussereau.
The opposition of the employers' associations can only delay the process.
The federation FNTR lambasted a "fraudulent trade because the 100 million euro were the sector to offset a of the carbon tax has already been "
The Secretary of State for transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but the goose in the approaching Christmas days, laments the Unostra.

New Silicon Valley
For many years it was a secret city, for Western visitors inaccessible.
Selenograd, one in ten districts of the capital Moscow, was in the Soviet Union, was a strict bewachter location for secret defence research.
Today, the community with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the Moscow Centre, as "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production facilities for micro and nano electronics are here.
Since September 2008 representatives Selenograds contacts to Frankfurt science location Riedberg - with the Uniinstituten and the firms of Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were been several mutual visits and on Wednesday now Selenograd and Riedberg in Frankfurt a "protocol on closer cooperation."
The Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Rosljak and prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation for Frankfurt Planungsdezernent Edwin Black.
2010 will be representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises in the science Foschungsschwerpunkts for a seminar after Selenograd travel.
Scientific exchanges
It is a continuous scientific exchanges.
But it is also about economic relations.
Firms of the FIZ will be to on the growing Russian market.
Conversely, want to Russian science firms contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.

Stuttgart brake
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the supporters of the project is purely and simply "the new heart of Europe".
Right. S21 is much more than the low of a railway station, more than a gigantic construction project, which the City of Baden-Württemberg capital for a decade in utter chaos construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 is from the spirit of the 1980's.
Head stations with tracks, end right in the middle of the city, were seen at the time as transport technical fossils of the 19th century, the as of a modern rail transport transport, as it was once a lot amount of time, locomotives from behind back umzuspannen forward.
, briefly, drive to go further - so ´ s
And that is why the head stations disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, about half-way through the trans-European rail route between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - so the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 will now actually addressed, although the visions of the 1980s no longer compatible with the reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realised that it is in the hessischen and the Bavarian city almost is to implement the deeper
Head stations have no one and exit problem more, since there are modern trains with locomotives and tax cars at both ends.
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21 and the route after Ulm is now being addressed.
Regional and local politicians have enforced.
The train power with, partly because the risks of the largest infrastructure of the Republic of taxpayers and not the state company.
Städtebaulich the project is still reasonably justified.
It is new urban - to is the computergenerierten graphics of the planners - equipped with a lot of green.
For the transport system rail is harmful.
The transit station and the routes expansion are intended for the passenger of which the - typical 1980s - huge growth.
At that time, there was not the competition from low-cost carriers.
Modern transport policy, but it must first be to strengthen the freight transport, because the transport by rail is much cleaner than by lorries on the roads.
But the new route is because of intense climbs not for freight trains.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly affects many other rail projects.
Good six billion euros in Schwäbischen are buried.
That is the official number.
Experts believe that ten to 15 billion for realistic.
It is clear in the next decade will the money to other hubs and Engstellen in the network.
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the Ministry.
One of the most important is the development of the 180 route through the Rhine Rheintal.
Since 1987, will built on the route in slow motion.
would to needed, right here on the tube.
But S21 will act as a brake.
The Rheintalstrecke will is the bottle bottleneck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.

Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Gümbel back, the provincial government attempts to with "Rechtsverdreherei and sleight of hand" to their night flights.

Visibly confused and move Söllner read out a statement in which he German writer colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his cooperation as in for the Romanian Securitate Securitate.
Together with some of those present Söllner 1989 had received the German language Sprachpreis.
The recruitment attempts have begun creeping, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner Söllner, someone who is against intimidation to intimidate the Securitate not enough."
The lyricist Werner Söllner is Walter.
Almost at the same simultaneously with the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary dispute with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule the literary scene and, in particular, the Community of from the German authors shaken by a case that the throes and the cowardice of a political system which is based on monitoring and spying.
Werner Söllner is, so far as can knowledge after can knowledge, not only the perpetrators, but also victims.
In his Securitate Walter have played a role in Walter, said after the confession Söllners literature scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of the Walter.
He had it him in all for him at the time sensitive points "," Markel.
It is a moral need to make this point.
Söllners statement was in the form and before this audience unexpected, surprise is the commitment of a former dissident and its cooperation with the Romanian secret service, however.
Germany is a cosy reserve for Securitate Herta Müller had already written in July at the time, after having had their own acts, 914 pages, read.
The people so we must be speculation and in some case may also have known what name behind the aliases Sorin, Voicu and even Walter Walter.
Unlike the here now very verfahrenssicheren sighting of the Stasi is dealing with the legacy of the Securitate still very vague.
A systematic education is in recent years and has been hampered
One of the Birthler authority National Council for processing the Securitate (CNSAS) was set up in 1999, the publication of the files since then has been rather slowly.
Only since 2005, there is a law that regulates the management of the files.
The the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very high, documented after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller an interview in which a former Securitate from Temesvar dismissive about the prize.
They have a psychosis, finally interrogated it only once. interrogated.
The infamy of power said quite openly in the form of the freedom of expression.
Certainly in the case Söllner, as so often in connection with publicize guilt, inevitable questions.
Why only now? who was hurt? the measured response of the to on Söllners commitment gives hope that the continuation of this chapter of knowledge rather than determined by apportioning blame and shame shame.
To Genese of Herta Müller, who has received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Sättigungsbeilage Champions League
It felt as if just a smart gekleideter Außendienstler of a very nice Christmas party, at a sporting goods manufacturers had distributed as the new coach Christian Gross in the company of an orange plastic bag of Ausrüsters a quarter of an hour after midnight in a herbeigerufene rose ¨
The man with the enormous Glatze was because of the chauffieren foreign city city.
Otherwise he would also have be able to drive - alcohol was not in the game, and besoffen before luck was the 55 55-jährige as little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow is the work is
Or will not right.

The joy of the commencement of the Babbel-successor remained was so.
Not only with the supposed saviours, of the uncertain Stuttgart professionals in the short time self-confidence, dedication and game game.
I am received on the players and I have told them that they should on their strengths, and have them to be courageous, souls plumber Gross said that simple simple-sounding recipe for success, under Therapeut Babbel but had had any effect.
He has a certain magic, Babbel babbel-befürworter Jens Lehmann, "if in a new impetus, sometimes things happen football, which would not have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, after weeks of injury break thanks to its dynamism straight to the best players on the place tried the phenomenon "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh air" and the operation of the new superiors: "He is a man who action and requires discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation. "
Under Babbel had it been lacking.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet out of the woods, warns sport Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart needs but above all, constancy.
As Gross herding because players and managers, the victory against a weakened and completely swamped defense of the Romanian guests guests.
They have also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0: 4 the wake Khedira to Khedira.
And sports Horst Heldt warned that a season has been achieved, but the other is still far off.
We are not yet on the mountain.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday even after the first home victory since three months after celebrating was not was due to the events of the weekend, in the form of a just before the game broadcast by of gate-keepers Jens Lehmann fresh fresh.
There are decisions that other meetings and not the Jens, Heldt countered the harsh criticism.
The had accused of the board of leadership weakness and decided the change coach to pressure pubertierender fans
Also that his free day after play had been withdrawn, wertete Lehmann as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and jealousy.
Lehmanns statements were "of by pure selfishness," keilte Heldt back and announced consequences for the final man.
They will probably no friends for life, the two forty forty.
After all, but they were with all other agree that without the preparatory work by the abgelöste coach the teaching and vindictive, strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share of the success," said Heldt and Lehmann - and also the man with the plastic agreed.

The minister said the deadly bombing of two fuel trains in September "knowingly the said Green said chief Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the German ARD programme Tagesschau
It is called the landläufig: he lied.

Dream worlds Traumwelten
Some people see in wachem state images and hear voices, the others do not see or hear.
Not only in mental health and drug binge blurs the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in their sleep, everything is in order.
If we are with closed eyes in our dark rooms, we must likes the wildest ideas and imagination
However, who in the his traumartige conditions conditions, things and hears things that others do not see or hear, hear in the modern Western world mostly as crazy or drug at least as a Sonderling.
But such images and voices arise not only in mental health or in binge.
Blame our imagination: the same neural processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures or to write novels, sometimes to ensure that the boundaries between dream, madness and reality
Traumartig modified awareness conditions can occur in variety different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case madness.
Even if cause and effect may differ, the visions of the Mystikerin Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of the Age Carlos Castaneda, schamanische Entrückungszustände, psychoses and hallucinations but similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions, if the balance of the neural messenger substances of the brain - and noradrenaline, serotonin and Acetylcholin - and the interaction of various parts of is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and wahnhafte thoughts are very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The gravity has no power over him
The context of madness and dream, philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle concept hallucinations as a form of the dream in the state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, 1861 noted a "great similarity of the one with dream for Sigmund Freud was the dream even "a psychosis, with all the inconsistencies, Wahnbildungen, false perceptions of such
It is the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. in into a comic figure.
His body is two and quietschbunt.
The gravity has no power more over him, he is hanging in the bedroom ceiling.
He senses a kick.
Behind him vicious figures with blood blutroten, distorted Fratzen, zähnefletschend.
They hunt him, him with serious, inflammatory boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain of the whole body.
Noisy, malicious voices roar from walls and radio.
He can no longer bear the voices that attack and insult him.
Henning T. snaps two cable from the stereo, knotet to a noose and consolidating them in a hole in the ceiling.
It is rising on a loudspeaker and establishes the noose around the neck.
Jumping The. . one.
The noose resolves itself.
This should be a lesson to you, the voices in trommelfellzerfetzendem choir, "walk in the clinic and let you cure!"
Today Today, Henning T. 40 years old, he has seen six acute psychosis, the last is 2 years ago, the first in nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffektive psychosis, moreover, he is also he takes drugs, against the depression, mania, the schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, for three years, he is married married.
In the climate I have seen worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The images are cruel reality
About one per cent of the population affected at least once in a life with schizophrenia, in psychiatric hospitals, it is treated as the second most common illness after the depression.
In an acute schizophrenic affected mostly can no longer distinguish between internal and external world, they get are in a übererregten state of lead to hallucinations, sizes, relationships or can paranoia.
Particularly This is particularly prevalent widespread - voices the comment on or dialogisieren.
Also optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person is no important to separate from trivial, the brain can no longer ausfiltern disturbing signals the awareness is awash with impressions.
As the dream opens the psychosis the floodgates for a flood of ideas and fantasies, the deeper awareness classes.
The reality of perception in the climate is subjektzentriert, says Professor Thomas fox, doctor the clinic for General psychiatry in the Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is itself in the middle of the it, everything has a importance to him.
At the same time, he is in a passive role, he will, as in the dream, overwhelmed by the events overwhelmed and it cannot not actively shape.
Schizophrenic so often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality is usually not possible, the images are cruel reality, wake up.
Once in a life to have seen a hallucinations
Unlike in the dream, says says, "but remains the sinnliche and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in the psychosis, basically."
The obsessive thoughts and hallucinations were based in reality, the reality of the Erlebens will take place in real terms.
Why exactly our brains brain antics, researchers are still a puzzle.
Ausnahmezustände can in every person can lead that he loses the reality the short says fox.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
It seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the only determinants.
Researchers assume that affected minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronale maturation of the brain at an early stage of development will be disrupted by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, for example, explained fox.
But it remain a mystery, as the disruption of the neural system is which not also first over many years.
Environmental environmental factors also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be a trigger for psychosis if the choice is there.
Also halluzinogene drugs can also trigger psychosis, as they intervene in the transmitter system.
If our brain is hot
The is Psychotiker suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medicines in order to get rid of them, others give money for drugs in order to get says the Lübecker psychology professor Erich castes.
Whether images as pleasant or unpleasant, is often only a question of the position.
Caste collects for ten years, reports of hallucinations and the last year, he has his results in the book "The unreal world in our evaluated.
Hallucinations belong among the typical effects of psychosis, but also of astonishing many other diseases.
These include mental disorders, such as line or depression often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease and Schädelhirntraumata.
Surprisingly, hallucinates under certain conditions, even the brain healthy people.
Hallucinations, so castes, from memory content, which would normally be withheld.
They arise if brain in which sensory are processed or too little; if our brains hot or, or even if stimulation missing.
Drugs can trigger this state as well as brain damage or a psychosis.
But also appeal of deprivation, stress, love or other mental situations.
In recent studies up to a third of those polled said that at least once in the life to have experienced a hallucinations.
In the summer of 2005 2005, Sarah K. 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and visited the school school.
A normal girl, really.
If it not for the images and voices.
In the break, it can happen that a schlaksiger boy with long, dark hair it addresses.
If he replies, at the classmates it surprised - no one else sees or hears these boys.
They think the timid girl for a versponnene Tagträumerin, but Sarah K. not dreams, it knows it.
It is awake, you can see or hear these boys, just as the girls in the bank alongside to and or hear.
You can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that, they may be the boys.
Am I crazy?, asks them sometimes.
But she know that this boy and the other not images are not real and then disappear again.
At night, are the phenomena mostly frightening
The the images are also a burden.
If you are sitting in the class room, it can not follow the teaching material sometimes because the teachers in their eyes and ears just a new classmates, while he for all other hör- and visible from the bar of mathematical equations.
At night, the phenomena are mostly frightening.
If they are in their dark room to sleep, which is far too little and far too late, they can often not distinguish whether it is awake or already dreams, whether the pictures they sees the Fratzen or the girl with the bleeding wounds of arms and legs, before their open or closed eyes.
Let me in a they to the characters.
Parents and friends told them nothing, they would you be crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
It has in the past year the baccalaureate and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since on the Internet contact with the psychologists castes, she knows well that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art from despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from withdrawal, he has in all probability, after a while hallucinations, says castes.
I suspect that the brain is then and even for his entertainment.
Sarah K., a Einzelkind, had as a little girl fear of other children, often played alone.
Their hallucinations began with 13 learned that the man they called Papa, since they can think is not their leiblicher father.
As visual and acoustic hallucinations the same brain areas are active, the real impressions and noise, it is affected as Sarah K. difficult to distinguish images and reality. "every experience," says caste, "will take place in the brain, the reality is there.
Hallucinations are also images of the brain, that is why they are so real. "
Also night dream images of caste as a form of hallucinations.
The hallucinations of healthy do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute psychosis.
In contrast to Unlike schizophrenic are mentally healthy in the to situation, their mere images as unreal.
Caste advises his patients, therefore, the hallucinations as a special ability ability.
Border state between dream and hallucinations
In our very bewusstseinszentrierten world imaginary experience unfortunately mostly pathologisiert, says Michael Schmidt hard, professor in Heidelberg and chief doctor of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy of Florence Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also has positive, creative - madness is also a work of art from despair.
Schmidt has researched the so-called oneiroide experience form, a special form of dream traumartig modified guard awareness.
Oneiroide are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, which the Erlebende for real and he also cannot distinguish from the in
The oneiroide consciousness state emerging in trauma or illness extreme situations, for example in Polyradikulitis patients in full awareness of a motor paralysis.
If a person of self- and world loss is threatened for by continuing total impotence, it replaces the life-threatening reality through their own imaginary world, the is decoupled from reality reality, says Schmidt hard.
A kind of border state between dream and hallucinations.
Since the deal with a situation in the reality is not possible, a world is place, but the real situation in the imagination.
An intensive form of sense Foundation and meaning in an a situation situation, the us people own ability, not submerged in a nothing of the loss.
Everything is real, later in the memory
The the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his experiences in his book "heart change" as a bailout of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness after a heart valves operation, followed by a heart transplant posted on travel, while his body in the intensive care unit of is doomed.
Claussen a in a selbstgeschaffene world, foreign times and places: he is seen as bettlägerigen, old man, on board a Zugsanatoriums, a robot guard on his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages under nobles the drugs from blood.
By a Greeks on the motorcycle in his own country, surfing with his hospital bed in Firnschnee the Alps and hits a Korean Mafioso.
He is completely in the imagined happened, everything is real, later in the memory.
These internal travel for Claussen differ fundamentally from any dream.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
Quite In contrast, I have the memories from mental travel even after years and in minor details clear.
More and more even than really Erlebtes.
The intensity of this Erlebens goes beyond the horizon of our other lebensweltlichen life experience, says the psychiatrist Schmidt hard.
At the end of show Oneiroide psychoses, hallucinations and drugs binge, how fragile our internal copies of external reality in the guards.
Any change of the say the psychologist caste, "can lead to a Verformung of what we call reality."
An experience which may also be enriching.
The snow fall can come

The promises of FonPeek
Peek is limited limited, a device with which can only read his e-mails without a possibility to be able to see certain annexes or surf the Internet.
It has enjoyed his five minutes of fame, it the magazine Time to one of the products of the year.
It is on the to see is unlikely, but the idea is is, nevertheless, especially for young people of interest.
In contrast to the Smartphones Peek costs very little and has a very favourable flat rate, for example, only half of the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After the company has seen the success it has two new devices on the market: one that is only for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free service for data, in unlike to the Peek, in which it must pay a six times higher price.
was presented yesterday at the event Le Web is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same borders, as his American counterpart, however, has a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the telephone, about 12 euros per month, roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who with a Smartphone around the world, already know what it means to to all the data in order to be able to read his e-mails, once soon cross the border or if you are desperately for a café with WIFI (or a link possibility with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flat rate is incredibly tempting and should be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already specific contracts and prices for abroad, but in my experience, you need a doctorate in physics and a good glasses to be able to read all the small print.
The repeated criticism from the European Commission in relation to affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe remained almost always ignored.
Auβerhalb of their own country has always afraid to read his e-mails and rightly so.
That a small device as FonPeek (although it is always amazing that it has the name of Fon, although it has no Wifi / offer this kind of tariffs can offer, means that the telephone providers slowly but surely rethink and start to consider various ways consider how they can use their data network.
Kindle is another good example in its prices is the downloads of books and other questions on the Internet.
Without Vetrag and without snags.
It is a internetfähiges equipment and pay only once, at the time of purchase, and not every month.
And that is exactly what I expect of one day of expect a buying opportunity with lifelong Internet access as it the Peek already in the United States.
And this is not because I want to buy it.
I read my e-mails with the telephone, thank you.
But I expect this, because I am of the opinion that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish colour of Michelle
Yellow is without doubt the favourite colour of the American First Lady.
the of the arrival of Barack Obama as President of the United States appeared in a dress and a coat of colour and has the same colour re-elected him in his, without doubt, the second most important moment in his life: to the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has on two occasions very similar models except that it was almost the same colour - a bright grüngelb - was the clothes from three parts - dress, jacket and coat from the same substance, and it was something groβförmig gesticktes or a neck chain.
It even goes so far as that it at the first sight seemed that the first Lady of the United States follow the model of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to follow the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes but very much in the Stoffart, from which they are made.
At the inauguration she wore a dress from head and in Oslo one from gemusterten in Oslo.
The accessories were different: the first time green shoes with halbhohen paragraphs and the second time a änhliches model, but goldfarben.
Also, the hair every time was different: the hair were on this occasion as hair wreath with the previous wore the hair.
75% of working mothers have because of their maternity problems in the work
The discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, especially among the younger women who wish to have children.
This this result is the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for women study "fertility and career of women in Spain."
The survey of 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labour market because of their motherhood.
The study is that there are very broad differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and if so, what kind of work they
Those of you who other of the House no other work only part-time work or have no fixed contract, is more likely to be mothers and have more children.
In contrast postpone the women with a solid job, particularly in the public sector, the creation of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a solid job their first child on average only 3.7 years after the draw, a number that to 4.1 years for women with permanent employment which took longer to achieve this and Zusammenziehen and the first child until much later.
Auβerdem also has the kind of work a groβen influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar in the contraceptive willingness, "explains the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor in the age of the women in the marriage and the first child must be taken into account.
According to the is the age at the time of the marriage and the first child the higher, the higher the level of education.
This difference was also in the women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group between 35 and 49 years, depending on whether they are only the main education or a higher education, on average, each with 25,1 or 32.1 mother for the first time mother.
There there are still, depending on their level of education, another difference between the women.
While the women with Hauptschlussabschluss before its first permanent employment and have their first child, make it the women with a medium or high school exactly the other way around and only a permanent employment and marry later and then have their first child, Delgado Delgado.
Diane Kruger, it is also worth

The trip is exciting and Vicent saves neither horrors still Erleuchtungen.
Auβer that this book is a köstlicher readers reading, it is also a moving call to read and again reading.
Here are a few sequences from the book.
On Albert Camus: read his sides I found out that the Mediterranean is no sea, but rather a spiritual, almost voluptuous driving, just as I have always felt without found words: the joy in contrast to the disastrous fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any God."
On Samuel Beckett: "nihilist, allegorischer Christian, he wrote about what he is in the blood, not in his brain, had, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a umwerfenden poetic humour, without any sense of how the knife that almost killed him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was from this woman with a passion which lasted for 13 years, dermaβen in its ranks, in whose meat the emotions on grounds of adultery with the pleasure of remorse remorse, a spiritual privilege, which was in the sky on the medium of corruption."
On James Joyce: "Ulysses" was in 1922 in Paris by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000er summit in the world literature, you must be climb to the north wall, on the wall, again and again the best mountaineers try. "
On William Faulkner: "The was a comical Kauz.
He said sometimes about himself that he would be the legacy of a the County and other times, he said that he is the son of a black and a Krokodils.
Both dreams of a certain GröΒe. "
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: this writer took the insane cry from a bridge from the personality from Munich so that its response until deep into the night of the 20th century on his literary way out This he made during a journey that which he fled from themselves and with a speech full of violence before the anflehte posterity.
On Dorothy Parker: "One day they kniete and My my God, I would ask you to do everything in your power to ensure that I finally leaving, as a woman to woman."

On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage, she had always their depression.
The husband took it with utter normality, when she said him that Eduard VII it between the Azaleen ausspionierte or the birds sang in Greek.

On Pío Baroja: "What made Martín-Santos because otherwise than to try to Joyce in Baroja?

Cowardly aggression
My 70 mother was last week by our district of in the town of Fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years alongside their and our dog herliefen, our dog is a Mischling, that we have obtained from the animal sanctuary and just six kilos, and then out of the blue missed him two Fußtritte and injured him so difficult.
Our one can never be in words, because it is incomprehensible to us, where since the fun in a cheap aggression against a small and defenceless animal, which is, of course, be on the leash.
In to is the suffocation attack, a woman who was walking comfortable, as they to these people as a result of the incident they feared even feared for their own lives, because if such a attacked a dog, he will be the same perhaps with a woman, a child, an elderly gentleman or probably even with each, the weaker than he is.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighbourhoods at five o'clock in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has geheult all day long.
Of We we have of course, in a nahgelegenen police department complaint, however, we have great doubts as to whether this will bring anything and to prevent any prejudice from the outset, we would to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our indignation about what has happened has led us to this incident.
We cannot understand what must be in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a defenceless animal fun an animal that we love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and the respect for the animals and the people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the Helms
The tyre manufacturer Michelin has, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for road safety (Fesvial) a campaign to promote the use especially among the younger motorcyclists as both companies announced today.
This initiative is to draw attention to the importance of the helmet use, because it is ultimately the only protection element the head injury or even death in the event of a motorcycle can prevent.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment in to the road safety, the "far more than just the design and manufacture of products with every day always more and confirmed that they also with other actions educational and informative nature contribute to this objective every day to come a step closer.
This new campaign to promote the use on the motorcycle, under the slogan 'to be or not to be' will in a first phase posters of about 500 motorcycle workshops, so as to achieve the best possible spread.
the Michelin Michelin, stressed that the road safety "a constant concern" of the company company, and it is precisely for the reason that they are as manufacturers of tyres for rädige vehicles always obliged to see that one of its main objectives of the development of safer products.
The sale of small is rising again something
After almost two years of the car market for small trucks finally some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles which were approved in November in Spain mean an increase of 12.6% in to the year 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first increase at all after 22 consecutive months going with decline, gemäβ the manufacturers' association Anfac and the car dealers' association Ganvam presented figures.
These good numbers, however, are currently only with great caution caution, as the comparison reference data in November 2008, which is a particularly bad Verkausjahr with a drop of 60% on the previous year.
However, we must in remember that, apart from the rise in the last month, the overall this of 11 months still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total 95.853 vehicles sold in this figure but all vehicles from which the vans market contain: descendants of passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, small vans and lighter vans / chassis.
Furthermore, are still the same storm clouds in the sky, the demand the most affected, because even if some of the vehicles purchased by individuals, the of the sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which almost 100% of all cases the purchase with a third-party financing.
So we is to these restrictions, which are the result of the zugedrehten tap of credit institutions, are other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In this scenario, and unlike the passenger cars, have the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the plan 2000E little little.
This plan is intended not only for individuals, the self-employed and small businesses have a right to expect that, if they are a vans up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 must not exceed 160 grams per kilometre may want to buy, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday had Ganvam reminded that it is part of the state, is also a special attention to this small vices and, of course, also on the industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The car dealers association predicts for the year 2010 a similar year as the last, for which it with a sales (in passenger cars and SUVs) by 19%.
The support for Bremsmanövern in critical situations is now duty
As was the Antiblockierbremssystem ABS and how it is now with the ESP stability control must the aid systems on the brakes in emergency a duty equipment in the European cars.
In fact, they are already duty on all newly registered passenger cars and light trucks, for the remaining vehicles was a set by until the end of February 2011.
The adopted by the European Union has aims to improve the protection of Fuβgänger, but these can braking systems because of their operation also help to prevent many front-rear collisions.
The task of the Notbremsassistenten is more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical Bremsmanövers, which the system on the basis of the drivers carried by the on the brake pedal
However, this system is not this pressure until the end.
According to one of the components manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles commissioned a third of the drivers involved in an accident before the Zusammenstoss no longer to on the brake pedal and half of them had not slowed down with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The Bremshilfe against with maximum force in the braking system and reduced the Bremszeit and therefore also the Bremsabstand, a car in the Bremsvorgang back.
According to a study by the EU could each year up to 1,100 fatal accidents which pedestrians harm to be prevented if all cars were equipped with this type of Notbremsassistenten.
It would be even fewer accidents - it is estimated that every fourth accident involving personal injury could be prevented - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency systems are popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that (on radar or a camera) obstacles and warns the driver, while at the same time, a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver then responded, helps him the system, to increase the pressure on the brake pedal, if it would be necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the Zusammenstoss is inevitable, the Bremsassistent the maximum pressure on the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors postpones the plan for Opel until January
While the workforce of the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, have been informed that the production of the new Meriva in the first week of will probably on 8, according to Mr Ortega, the American car manufacturers to out that he needs more time to get the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, will to ensure that the affected side their assent to each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, the first of the workers and then the governments of the countries in which it works, will be until the beginning of 2010.
Dementgegen from GM assured that it will in the next few days a decision on the sale of Saab
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American car has so that this is a decision as soon as a possible.
GM to stand with some potential new buyers in contact.
One of these buyers could be Geely, which also would like to buy Volvo, however, the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper cars, which the Russian group Converg backing has ever support.
If it should come with any of these buyers come to an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to Saab at the end of the year, if it is not sold been sold, will also continue.
At the helm of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and made it really really, to make it easier to 80 kilos, and he is now only 1.275 the
In order to create something they refrained the first on the automatic aufklappbare roof, roof has been replaced by a Zeltleinwanddach with manuellem drive so that alone has saved 21 kilo; thanks to the model used in this model as the GT3 "disappear" a further 15; by the removal of the air conditioning again 13; auβerdem one has the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, so that saved another 7 saved through the installation of sporting Bacquet again 12 and with the slight 19 19-zoll-felgen customs saved five.
Then we had also through the renunciation of the audio system CDR-30 again six kilos less and through the exchange of Türgriffe by from substance the lack of kilo.
Although he also with the Doppelkupplungsgetriebe PDK is available, the test with a car with 6 hand carried out mainly on the smaller Landstraβen of California, on mountain routes, which really very kurvig.
In his driving behaviour can give him only the note perfectly.
The reduction of its weight, but has not meant that he is now no longer so sure would be on the lie.
Rather, the opposite is the case: since long have we no longer such a small and easy model which is a but also a sense of great security in the curves, even at high speed.
It is a small athlete, able to his its muscles in a low gear in the necessary time to make warm until we give him the orders, to to slow to recover and then again everything from his engine to out...
He makes everything he says. The car makes everything we him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is just as communicative as precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
An engine Sound for all tastes
The Sound of his V6 Boxers with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very good and it can still increase it with the 'sport' sport and by means of a system that can change the engine noise, which already the Panamera used for the first time.
The acceleration capacity is unimaginable brutal, whether from the foot out or renewed acceleration.
The Federungen are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the roads, on which we went with the Boxster Spyder, was quite damaged, but the car meisterte the potholes.
The electronic assistants had on the whole route almost nothing to do; and that, although we in some of these curves ice at the dawn and Rollsplitt this morning.
In summary, we can say that it is an car car, a car, with which has an indescribable Fahrspass as it otherwise rather rare and it is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster SS.
The car will come on the market in February 2010 and cost 70.831 EURO.
Bag girl '
The singer, a friend of Karl storage is the face of the cosmetics line Coco Cocoon and a Gelegenheitsstarlett in the fashion of ', they presented their evil face with the same obduracy as their pockets of Chanel.

The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many fancy players in the team against Mr Ivanovic, an excellent triumph with 82-91 during his visit to the complex Fuβballfeld of Maccabi Electra and is in the first place in its group after the groβartigen appearance of Mirza Teletovic, with eight triple times the best of his team (29 in the (29).
The team from Vitoria the significant loss of Mr Mann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a very broad dose of use and team work, even if they wait until the bitter end to its victory victory.
The great hits from the Perimeter with 16 valued three times contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the Blue right from the beginning at the top of the table.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came from the Perimeter it was already guess that they had on to the pitch with good reheated hand

The second quarter was little different, only that the team from Álava for a innenseitiges game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, on his return to the team with Pfiffen and applause was is his home is to their advantage further before the break (34-43).
Teletovic began, as the best of his team with 13 points, also wennn the "minus six" assessment of cluster already guess that this would not be the best night of Brazilian.
Nevertheless, was the game despite the clear advantage in the break far not decided and the Makkabäer wanted to the Vitorianer once again remind you that not everyone on the pitch, and thanks to the attacking "hand of Elías" they came back into the play.
Eidson and Pnini contributed significantly to that the "yellow" the helm umdrehten (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but anything other than dead, had to prepare a few gambits with accuracy, in order to get air and one of them suddenly the gun of Mirza Teletovic, with three successive almost three triple and with the support of English and Ribas ensured that on the table again einberuhigender of (54-67) was notified by the hosts at the end of the third quarter with (57-67) could make.
The Alavesen the last quarter bloβgestellt and English and San Emeterio (60-75) has already announced that they would allow anyone to them the victory which they in the first dreiβig minutes honestly taking away again.
Nevertheless, resigned Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team and tried to their team by three points from the line (70-77)
Nevertheless, and despite the because was fouls the not on the team of Ivanovic, not defended well and although the Israelis nor in the last minute aufholten (85), the game had already been a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in this season.
Injuries prevented that was stood up

The team from Malaga had no fear of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship before the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the most in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their game in the first quarter were the Andalusians start to dream. An aggresive Verteidung and three consecutive three times, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, dazzled the hosts with 12-18 in the ninth minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the ereins Unicaja surprised, even if the local team with a home game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed that the ads in the 13th minute 22-20 in their favour, the minute in which it almost a an action almost to brawl between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and why both were disqualified.

Thank you!
After the glowing days since last spring, in which the inflation of assets the prevailing mood in the markets, is returned the uncertainty in the markets, which in any is surprising, since this is their natural state, in an environment in which the broker decisions on an inherently uncertain future.
The used to stabilize the markets, it was to the debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly to the liquidity to a free hand in interest rates, which move to zero, so that in this way the banks assets to buy assets.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets as well as ended and without their heterodox policy to liquidity in question, start to throw a spanner in the works, as the BCE näc already vormachte with its annual auction, which place next week.
That is why investors have doubts about the ability of the world economy, the economic recovery without these heterodox Maβnahmen and we are currently witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The Flüchtigkeiten the stock markets and the differences in corporate bonuses rise again, even if they are still a long way from the paranormalen amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states have been forced to nationalize the private risks and the national debt will rise again.
It is now back on quality and the United States, Japan and Germany are the preferred haven of investors, which in turn to an increase of the differences of the countries the euro zone in regard to Germany.
Spain has been now affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision downwards on the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, not a degree of uncertainty is not to the defenders of the moral risk to silence the had tried again, with the leaders of the world economic policy, an awareness, for what they had caused to produce, since the devastating effects which the restriction of loans led to the loss of jobs, had slowed down, as they should actually a new day for thanks action should have
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai, on a tribal war between the Emiren to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was also previously earlier.
A government which the public debt, elections and a new government, which draws on the same side.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary at the beginning of the year from the of their payments saves and thus therefore a euro member country no longer meet its obligations.
However, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and its citizens in need of auβergewöhnlicchen Maβnahmen with the duty to maintain the stability of the state money.
Yes, we are as expected before an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some excesses to large sums it would now lie within the expected.
In the case of Spain, we must not worry, as long as the differences of public debt with the same speed as the European corporate bonuses.
However, should reduce the European differences and increase the Spanish dannn would increase, be is a special Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the local early indicators of a Groβteil of market research institutes to their scenarios for the recovery and their scenario for 2011 to including the OCDE and the European Commission, which again with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy come all promises despite warnings not a long life life.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish stock, although at the moment, "caution is the order of the
Associated industries
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, came as the first yesterday before the subcommittee of the House, where in these days the strategy in relation to the energy supply of Spain in the next two decades.
After his appearance, the chairman of Gas Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca followed Galán the press some key points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind versschlossenen doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola Spain 50 billion by 2020 Euround further 60 billion from that date until 2030, under the that the current nuclear power stations will continue to remain in operation.
Should this not be the case, would the investment needed to 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola is of the opinion that we should not invest more in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international groupings.
From 2020, the question will change and we should increase the performance.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities to capture the carbon dioxide and, of course, especially on renewable energy.
In this case, he is estimated that 18,000 MW more are needed, under the Vorraussetzungnatürlich by other "Stützenergien."
Galán, is of the opinion that the Gesetentwurf for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, in line with what has called for his company, wanted to say something against this law, how to create incentives for the national coal consumption, which exactly the opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, is clearly in this direction, despite some" individual Maβnahmen, as the chairman of Iberdrola.
Be it as it may, Galán, believes that we now have the decisions on the investment, even if they are in the long term, should because it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created in order to tackle them.
