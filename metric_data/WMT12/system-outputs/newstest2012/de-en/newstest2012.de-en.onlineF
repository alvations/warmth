No liberating novella for Tymoshenko by the parliament
The Ukrainian parliament refused today the request to abolish in the context of a novella of the penal code that paragraph on whose basis the leader of the Opposition Yulia Timoshenko had been condemned.
The new regulation, which could have smoothed the way to the freeing of the arrested Expremierministerin, rejected the delegates with the second reading of the request for moderating the punishments for economic crimes.
Timoshenko had been condemned in October because of the conclusion of an allegedly unfavorable contract with Russia over the purchase from natural gas to seven years detention.
The judgment is not valid yet, in December is the appointment of the condemned ones before court to be negotiated.
Timoshenko calls the judgment political revenge of the regime and also in the west let the process the suspicion of the prepossession of the court arise.
The request to remove paragraph 365, on whose basis the Expremierministerin was condemned, from the penal code became from 147 delegates supported.
226 voices would have been necessary for its acceptance.
Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion knows already its losers.
Muammar Al-Gaddafi is because of an unknown place in the desert buried and without it is the war past.
Now the winners are to be only defined.
Like it to this region usually, Islamists, the question triumph are only in the elections, which - the moderate or the radical.
The national transition advice well-known itself for the customary law of the Scharīʿa, from which one has yes now with God a certain conception.
Libya became the country without crime, because for theft one chops off in short the hand.
Also women should forget thoughts at emancipation as soon as possible, become possible faith renegades executed, and so on.
Instead of only one dictator the society becomes future from mutually attacking trunks by the Koran united.
In short - in Libya an order will prevail, which would be hardly desirable in this country hardly conceivable and above all.
Only - our lifestyle is just not the only one seen probably not and objectively the best and alternation the mentioned Libyan would hardly fit.
So seen is it rather appearing strange that the Muslim fighters let themselves help at all from the disbelieving dogs.
For its apology probably only the fact may serve that the air strikes of NATO were led not by any general from America, but by Allah themselves, whose omnipotence was praised after each successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The west does not belong to.
We participated only in a shooting, served the interests of the Islam and our politicians got rid of in the person the dictator of a political allied one, without this would have brought any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq we rather refrained from a military occupation of Libya.
Thus the local ones a concern are loosely - the expulsion of the cross drivers.
Do the mineral oil enterprises get in addition, without occupation the black gold to the ridiculous price?
Probably hardly and so the west can praise itself finally once with good reason its disinterest in things protection of the human rights.
If this for them the Scharīʿa representatives do not spoil.
Beginning of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of the investors.
On Tuesday a statistic storm low raced by Europe.
The individual states published their information concerning their Gross Domestic Product for the 3rd quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated in the comparison to the previous quarter, Germany and France adds.
The obligation market tears today however all records.
The investors keep not only Greece, but in the meantime also Spain, France, Austria and other countries in the eye.
The statistic offices of the European zone, Germany, Czech Republic and some further European countries published their provisional prognoses over the economic development in the third quarter.
The Gross Domestic Product Germany grew as expected by 0,5%, that from France by 0,4%.
Both countries corrected at the same time their data for the second quarter, in which Germany registered a higher growth, than one had originally expected (growth around 0,3% instead of forecast 0.1%), while France granted an easy decrease around 0,1% (original information spoke only of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew in the third quarter of this year in the comparison to the previous year by 1,5 percent.
In the comparison to the previous quarter the gross domestic product stagnated however and according to Tsch. So the trend of the growth slowing down of the economic efficiency was confirmed to statistic office.
The results are thus worse than the prognoses of the analysts.
The highlights:
The Czech economy grew in the third quarter of this year in the comparison to the previous year by 1,5 percent, in the comparison to the preceding quarter stagnated it however.
Reports provisional and according to seasonally over-counted the German economy in the third quarter grew by 0,5 percent.
In the entire Eurozone and in the European Union the economy registered a growth between July and September in relation to the preceding quarter by 0,2 percent, which with expectations of the analysts agrees.
The Greek economy shrank in the comparison to the previous year by 5,2 percent.
The net yield from its 10-year old government loans ascended the value of 28,45%.
The net yield of the Italian and Spanish government loans rose up to their critical borders.
Also Austria, which begin the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries to feel problems…
The net yield with Czech government loans hold themselves under 4%, even if the situation in the region worsens.
In Germany will voices loud, the EZB is the creditor of the last instance to become.
The Czechs qualified themselves for EUROS
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and celebrate now their qualification for 200 million
The football selection mastered the heaviest task of the whole season!
Owing to a well presented goalkeeper Čech and a wonderful gate of Petr Jiráček won it in Montenegro 1:0.
With a large portion luck could defend the Czech football in such a way its luxurious lead of the home game and once again not with the European championship will be missing.
IHNED.cz pursued the promotion tie in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half time and a giant portion luck in second.
The Czech selection triumphed also owing to the conclusion weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro quite happy 1:0 and thus its ticket for the football European championships redeemed.
Also because of the precise defense play of the Czech they could pressurize the Montenegriner only in the second half time to more.
The jinxes of the portion were Damjanovic and Vucinic, which fired two giant opportunities.
Also owing to a outstanding Petr Čech the Czech selection thus next year with the European championships will mix together, pleasing is also that a premium at a value of approx. 200 million flows to the domestic football.
From the first minutes on quite aggressive football was played.
Both crews combined lengthily and in such a way particularly around the center line were played.
Also in the second half time the pressure of the home team was missing and the far anticipated payments before the penalty area by the Czech defense was successfully repelled.
Iranian students are ready to die for the kernel program of their country.
They formed living sign.
Some hundred university students formed living sign approximately around around a nuclear object in Iran.
With this gesture they wanted to demonstrate their support for the kernel program of their country before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed Tuesday noon before the object and afterwards to the USA and Israel death had announced.
A few hundred students of the university in the Iranian Isfahan formed on Tuesday alive sign approximately around around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, in the uranium one processes.
Thus they wanted to do kund that they are ready, the kernel program of their country, to protect even if necessarily with their own life.
The international atomic energy agency (IAEA) determined recently in its report, Iran to all appearances its efforts around a nuclear weapon for a long time did not give up.
Also in Israel speaks about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear installations.
Students had prayed afterwards at noon before the entrance to the complex and to the USA and Israel death had announced.
In case of an attack led with the intention of putting the Iranian nuclear programme as far as possible lamely according to the Israeli press out the center in Isfahan also the atomic enrichment plant would be in Natans attack target.
The bill of fare of an fat-addicted child: It has breakfast not and eats to evening bread sausage
More than one third of the children from 9 to 13 have problems with predominance, whereby 9 percent of all pupils and 5 percent of all children are overweight.
Current surveys proved - adipöse children mostly originate from families with unhealthy lifestyle.
Thus is it shown once again, how important for the healthy development of humans the environment is, in which it grows up and who are examples, which surround it.
On the tables of adipöser children sausage goods up to the half stand more frequently on the table, than in families, in which normalweighty children live.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children the day before the clearing-up action under the slogan “adiposity is no coincidence” French fries had to evening bread.
In families with Dickerchen also sport does not rank straight among the favorite occupations, which concerns however also the majority today's pupils - only 15 percent answered that their parents few are once in the week time for active movement.
Survey among 900 children
The survey took place past year toward end of the school year, almost 900 children from primary schools in completely Czech Republic were asked.
That was not already the second class of the action “adiposity is coincidence”, which is supported by the general health insurance company and the society Unilever.
So far more than 12 thousand pupils participated out 4th and 8th classes in the project.
Unhealthy food and missing movement in the family are thereby crucial factors, which are responsible for those alarmingly rising number of children with predominance or even obesisty.
“Only half of the asked children stated for example, five times on the day to eat in the mode breakfast second breakfast lunch Vesper Abendbrot - one of the main conditions for a healthy nutrition”, then one of the survey data reads.
No breakfast and sausage to evening bread
Experts refer to the fact that also relative little things, as for example also the regular breakfast time of the family, for the healthy development of a child is important.
In Czech Republic have breakfast however only 23 percent of the families of the pupils.
And - in most families everyone has breakfast for itself alone.
The statement, which in each tenth family at all one does not have breakfast, was worst.
The breakfast is considered thereby as foundation-stone of the healthy daily nutrition.
The survey test brought among other things to the day that one consumes much more frequently unhealthy French fries in the families of overweight children.
And nearly everyone - without consideration for the weight - drinks each day sweet lemonades (70 percent)
Drive more than 40 percent of the asked children sport, but do only less than half of their parents - the only 15 percent.
Arrange you your own menu
A further part of the survey made it for selected children possible (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools), to arrange itself from offered possibilities according to appetite and opinion their own menu.
“Which Czech children between 12 and 15 prefer in terms of nutrition, are far from the ideal of a healthy nutrition.
Under their favorite foods were many flour foods, meat dishes and naturally sweet foods.
“Above all the large popularity of sweet lemonades” is alarming, in the final report to this survey is stressed.
With the lunch, thus to the main course, pasta triumphed scarcely before poultry.
Leguminous plants did not like the children nearly and also the popularity of fish and vegetable courts as the lunch were very small.
Limp-honor to the health
At the same time the survey showed in addition, that the children are quite ready to change their eating habits if they get correct information.
“With the control group of the survey-taken part, which is not the questionnaires after conclusion of the clearing up lecture “adiposity coincidence” filled out, a clear shift of the preferences was to principles of the healthy nutrition to register”, is aforementioned in the results of the project in many cases.
Obvious this was for example with the sweet Limos, where many children began to give to usual water the priority.
The children marked in the questionnaire poultry or fish with a cross than main course of the day also much more frequently and were ready, less dumpling or sweet meals to be eaten.
Professionals state - a Stylist must be also a good psychologist
In the introductory article over it, as Stylisten learn, I had a little grumbled that was a little too much material for the beginning.
There I did not suspect in the slightest, what still comes.
Lectures of three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how runs “at the place”.
It is to come still more badly.
The more near the examination moves, all the more information and practical tasks is approaching for us.
In addition, if the course of each Saturday takes place and Sundays, it is nevertheless fully occupied.
This time we debated with directress Alena (at the course not one man takes part), as one attracts a woman, who does not have an ideally proportionierte figure.
And those are nevertheless most of us.
A too short neck, the others have the one a too youngful figure without tidy curves and again different are chubby.
It is thing of the Stylisten to cover broad shoulders optically to extend the neck or the necessary curves conjure up.
We got also hints, as one tightens a type of woman such as Jennifer Lopez - thus with large bosom, broad hip and narrow waist - prettily and figure-stressed, without she works all too provocatively.
If for example the difference between waist and hips is so large that the skirt or the pants does not fit really, one should leave oneself at least one piece to made to measure cutters.
One will not repent that surely, because well sitting clothes are simply priceless.
In such a custom-made skirt feels one much better, than in one of the bar, which high all the time and slips, in the waist is away, etc.
Boy-clung figures can take the liberty again, clothing with folds, billowing, applications, to carry embroideries or Raffung.
With this quantity of information and figure types I am glad that I have a whole week time to let me everything go thoroughly through the head.
And nevertheless I have fear that it is not to be created in view of the laid on homework nearly.
Everyone of the class participants got a celeb assigned, for which it was to invent fitting outfit - daily clothing and evening robe.
Are we the present appearance, which mode style of the appropriate star and its type of figure consider.
I am Miranda Kerr “to tighten”, you possibly from the campaign Victoria's Secret know.
On the inside I am jubilant, because that is personally much better for me, than attracting for example Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who lately probably to the hundred Kilos increased (well well, which are a little exaggerated), or also young Selena Gomez.
The articles of clothing we are of magazines to cut out or in the Internet look for, expressions and afterwards graphically work on.
In the “Moodboard”, how the whole result is called, our completely personal style and our relationship with the graphic organization are to then come to the expression.
It is very important to think also about the graphic side of the styling.
The Stylist attracts the models not only purely physically, but arranged also the so-called product side in the journals (after concrete default, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
Of it the Stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us.
But only on Sunday.
That is, that a Stylist must have good highlights.
The Saturday lecture filled with information about figure types was equivalent peppered of three visitors from the industry:
of the Stylisten January Pokorný, of the mode creator Jakub Polanka and by the mode photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us of the fact that mode is illusion and some Stylist should be capable of using this.
And returned Stylist is able to work with only one piece of clothing in completely different way.
The magic word is called variability.
So one can carry for example a trench coat as used to over the jeans, thus like a T-shirt or a coat, one can him in addition, on the naked body carry, paragraph shoes in addition put on and him as dress carry.
It is enough to turn up the sleeves or the collars and directly looks the whole look completely differently.
“Thereby”, stressed he plays.
At most me however the following advice came convenient: “Must first you the rules perfectly know.”
“May only then you it injure”, said Jakub.
Finally it becomes clear me why we all these theorems to swot to have, which one can combine with which and why, even if one gets to see frequently completely different one in fashion journals.
To be silent from fashion shows completely.
Owing to the photographer Ben I know now that a Stylist must have prepared many more clothing variants, than he photographs finally.
Thus one must be preparatory for a Fashion story with ten sides (speak ten of outfit) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing in the photo in combination with further accessories looks every now and then completely differently, as in reality.
On all that one must count thus with the organization of the outfit.
That image and style every now and then half of success constitute, confirmed us also January Pokorný.
There one needs only times Madonna to have regarded have made from the images and marketing a world star a not straight brilliant singer.
In Czech Republic one stands for the services of a Stylisten rather reserved opposite.
Also well-known personalities regard this frequently as eliminated money (the main thing is that I bring something, as I thereby look is secondary).
And if someone from us can to be styled, then we are to count on the fact that it or it forces upon us in all probability completely different (smaller) size, than he or she needs in reality.
Then one needs to only google afterwards, in order to determine with security that the popular press writes, the appropriate celeb or decreased, etc.
January and Mario put us on Sunday to the heart not to believe that a Stylist needs only on the fashion to focus and then the outfit “assemble”.
With its work it must communicate particularly with humans, who he styles and it must be a cunning psychologist.
Humans estimate to curry favor without itself and to his opinion stand.
“If us any manager orders, in order to sight and supplement around pretty pieces its wardrobe, then we cannot eliminate and say the whole cabinet for her - my God, that is terrible.”
“One must at least to few lobenswerte things find, to which one recommends, what one in addition carry can”, says Mario.
It showed us also completely concretely, what must contain so so-called “blow-out ashes”.
Thus so a bag, which one buttons up at the waist and carries in which one all necessary Proprietäten with itself.
Except such clear things, like shears, unwind stand to the hair removing or safety pins contains it also such implements, like a nylon thread (with it the Stylist helps itself when photographing products, like handbags or hats out), special clips, with which in the back the clothes are dug, if it is too large (pins or other clamps are forbidden, thus the material not broken go) and naturally sewing kit.
So that we do not however only have to listen, but also somewhat practically to try out to be able, we learned, how one under-sticks shoes correctly.
Also when photographing in the studio, where the floor is even, one can damage the sole, not to speak of that outside.
O stuck us and stuck we…
With the shears one may not even affect the shoes, so that one does not damage her.
Thus one must proceed really skillfully.
Mario pleased me, by praising my “creation” without restrictions.
The mentioned skill is not straight my strength.
All this was only the fraction of what we got to hear with at the second week END continuation course.
One became clear me in the meantime - the styling on professional level to dedicate, no children's game is.
V Need for speed: “The run” - illegal running straight through America
Review
The originally carefree trip becomes by a series completely avoidable, dilettante error the routine trip the early shift.
It succeeded to fulfill the ambitions to a large extent but which that uses already, if obviously nobody had desire to do a little more.
Already before he came on the counters, the new part with the sub-title “The run” created high expectations.
It promised nevertheless to shift the play series of “Need already bejahrte for speed” piece into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples seemed it actually not only one from many Action Rennspielen to be.
We were also curious, as the fit in passages fail, in which the main protagonist from the car rises and continues to foot.
But like one it with NFS is already accustomed, is eventually much different, than one had expected.
Surely - there is potential quite decent arcade running, but altogether the play is diminished by some redundant errors, which are long present more or less already in this series a few years.
Thus there is actually no more errors, but rather signs incomprehensible of a in principle laziness of the play developers.
The adventure begins very well.
For a start one is introduced to the history, whose main figure Jack has certain problems of a personal character\; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race straight through America.
In San Francisco, thus at the west coast, one sits down to the steering wheel - with the task to be than first in New York.
The philosophy contains a whole number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided in ten stages and in more than fifty individual running.
That means that each running on other distance is delivered and that the individual stages in different, sufficiently different and interesting environment take place.
One does not have a moment the impression that play would offer the same again and again.
Some environments are to be regarded in addition still expressed prettily, although the technical level of the diagram does not go beyond that of the earlier parts of the series.
Thus nothing worldshaking.
But the trip by the desert, by autumnal landscape or highly above by deeply snow-covered landscape work visually very pleasantly.
Now and then atypical elements bring little alternation into individual running.
In the desert for example one is surprised by a desert storm, which limits the view strongly.
In the mountains again one must watch out infernally that one is not buried by an avalanche.
Besides are quite well one behind the other an individual running inserted.
Only few, but they are enough.
One while one tries in such a way, which prescribed number from opponents to overhaul (in principle classical running), then one has time to catch up (classical running against the stopwatch), then expects still another personal duel with only one contractor.
And in addition also still the police interferes, which wants the whole thing vermasseln.
A novelty are passages, in which Jack leaves the car.
It concerns rather certain interactive animations, in which Jack flees forwards possibly someone and where the player him must help, by pressing the correct button in the correct moment.
Thus nothing complication.
It surprises however that it gives in the play much less such passages, when one (concretely probably only three) would expect.
Finally this is the thing rather for the advantage, because so this element has at least no opportunity to become boring - it belongs in the context to said the above to the elements, which make the play more varied.
The driving model walks into the Fußtapfen of the preceding parts.
That is, seen by today's focus, it tears no trees out, on the other hand one one could not state, it would be bad.
Who looks for realistic simulations, must look around elsewhere.
But a action-loaded running driving becomes also further completely well fair the local driving model, although one could find with the competition better.
By then so far everything is best correct.
Genuine problems emerge only after certain time.
Contrary to the driving model the collision model is not whole o.k.
It is hardly to be expected by a play of this kind that it complicated deformations and collisions computed, but if one has practically before no impact on possibly an object notion, how the car behaves, then is obviously not everything correct.
Typical example: With close overhauling or driving past at accomodating cars one “touches” the other car in some places only easily, in other, almost identical situation comes one however into hurling and turns wild pirouettes.
Or the cart drives equal too scrap iron.
Owing to the restart system that constitutes nothing else, off annoying always is it.
The restarts are so solved: if one has total loss or far off the distance lands, then the play throws back to the last reference point of the distance.
Only - in each running one has only five restarts.
If one exhausted it, everything starts from the front.
The restarts are thus rather something like an aid, if somewhat does not succeed, but on it abandoned should one itself rather not.
Sometimes however times the restart does not help, there helps nothing else to learn as the critical section by heart.
It is expressed unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
One must drive through some curves for example in completely specific way, otherwise one does not fit simply through.
One meets civilian” cars elsewhere in the appropriate place “always in same configuration, no matter whether one comes as first or fifth, five seconds in former times or one minute later.
That is particularly in situations annoying, if one sees the fact that the contractor goes past before easily at two coming to meet cars but until one arrives there, is the cars already in such a position that one must circumvent or brake her.
And it is no matter, when one arrives there, everything is in such a way that conceived it comes to this situation always closely before your nose.
The contractors have still further advantages.
Generally speaking play gives it to a few places, where one is always overhauled in the same place by the same opponent and also here again without consideration on the time.
At the craziest one this is for the conclusion of the play on the long bridge, which one passes in opposite direction.
The contractor must one obviously on devil comes here out to overhaul.
And if it is already before one, then it takes the view naturally, so that one at the beginning of the own car a few marks in become lumpy there drives.
Clearly - one wants to make the play for simply exciting and more exciting however this intention is so clear that she spoils fast the joy in the play.
And that is unfortunate, because despite simpler driving model is the play altogether quite entertaining and also in parts so action that one does not know nearly no more, where the head stands for one.
And in principle it is no matter which “debt” to it actual concept with fifty singular routes, the arrangement that running on a way that no boredom can arise, or somewhat completely different one…
An unusual idea is also the car change in the run that running.
One may not survey thereby the gas stations at the distance, because straight here one can change the car, although the car is in most cases sufficient, which one has straight.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well for the urban ranges suitably, the strong American sedans for the straight highways and exotic supersports cars for the technical trips, for example on the zigzags in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode to play history also the task mode (challenges) goes - thus running in the individual localities, which one knows from history.
Here there are not only medals to win but also points of experience for the own profile which is common for the tasks (challenges) and history.
In order to arrive at the higher driver level, different articles must be unlocked: of the car begun, up to the Backgrounds for the profile.
This is at the same time connected with the ONLINE function autolog, which among other things the own obtained results with those other player compares and even for further collective functions provides.
One of further incomprehensible gaffes is a situation in last running of history.
Here one comes with the car into an underground tunnel (on my account), where one races in the dark on the rails long (on my account).
On the Tacho numbers between 150 A 200 km/h (on my account) look, but come there at once from the rear an underground and drive one uncompromisingly to scrap iron.
In our editorship we will argue probably still for a long time about whether that was a blackout of the play designers or whether the authors consider us so dumb.
The technical side is however at least the visual general impression is in most cases quite responding nothing overwhelming and here and there even brilliant.
It is all the more annoying that at some exciting moments the image repetition frequency becomes slower and this every now and then rather dramatically.
That concerns however in particular the accidents with larger number of taking part, where a continuous FPS uses anyway nothing.
The sound reproduction is so far o.k. and that soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In the effort to address a as broad as only possible scale of rather recent audience a soundtrack A developed lá “of each somewhat” - however who buys such a play already because of the music?!
The general impression of Need for speed: The run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the play were not diminished due to the mentioned totally unnecessary errors, we could have stated with the chest tone of the conviction that The run is the best piece of NFS in the last years.
But the play works in such a way somehow incompletely.
On for itself a class a pleasure, but one should be preparatory for the fact that these errors with the power of airport headlights sting into the eyes.

European union-ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the call of negativists and euro sceptics
“The contract of Lisbon brought the balance under the individual institutions perceptibly from the plumb bob.”
I would not have expected that such is inflamed a hard war.”
“It will take five, six years, to itself and will have gotten accustomed all to their new role”, began Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador will have smoothed the waves with the European union, quite sharply their lecture at the legal faculty.
How seriously it takes the slogan “understandable and openly over Europe”, she already showed in the first part of her lecture, in which it succeeded to it to describe the individual organs of the European Union and their mutual relations in such a visible and understandable way that she could have envied so some lector of the legal faculty of the Karl university therefore.
Mrs. Vicenová praised thereby also the new constant chairmen of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
“Beginning became loud criticism, it is too inconspicuous - a grey official, who did not grow such a role, but I must say, leave speechless it has everything, how well it took care of the thing.
“It is to be communicated humans, who bring it completely to listen to twenty-seven member states patiently with them and above all clear conceptions of it has, how it is to continue with the European Union.
The new position of the high representative for foreign affairs and security policy explained it then as answer to the question: Who is that actually - the European union? Which number am I to call? ”, thus as important step for the agreement and better readableness of the EU policy in relation to states, like e.g. China or India.
Nobody wants to forbid our Ölmützer Quargel to us
Mrs. Vicenová dedicated herself also to the agenda, in accordance with which the European union lived, lives and intends in the near future to live.
It called the Czech presidency from forwards two years success.
The Czechs would have mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and would have organized also the summit for eastern partnership.
It called the case of the government during the presidency large Negativum, which had strongly harmed the image of the Czech republic.
The Czech agency in the European Union has to do all hands at present fully.
With the words said, it reached to the ambassador not only with the presidency, but also with the following crisis, which is today not yet overcome until, quite hectically.
And there still the seven-annual budget of the European Union must be approved of, what makes the thing straight many more complicated because of the today's economic situation.
Whether it becomes a slim and economical budget, which industries receive priority, which countries more are promoted less and which - all this stands now on the agenda.
The ambassador reminds also of her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: “Understandable over Europe”.
“If I somewhat do not like, then there is greyish contractions, foreign words and jargon, which nobody understands.
As I am to actually know as citizens whether one invents in Brussels really bent or round cucumbers and differently large bananas or whether someone wants to actually forbid the Quargel to us.
She would have used the ground of the European Union also gladly in order to get more Czech into European institutions.
Europe of the two or different speeds in prospect
According to opinion of the European Union-ambassador the Czechs stand in the call to be euro sceptics more the negative, than the positive sides of the thing notice.
The weak agency of Czechs is all the more annoying in European institutions.
Many factors debt, among other things also the restraint of our candidates, are their inability, to write motivation letters and not least also the weak support of the Czech side.
Except the successful Czech presidency main header it also the strength and co-operation of the Visegrad group, the so-called V4 out.
“Faith you me, if poles or Hungarian comes to me and is a Slovak in the proximity, then means the Frenchman beside me: “He, which plugs it together there the heads - is that already again your V4?” and a rather sour expression makes.
Mrs. according to Vicenové the European Union in the future above all hard rules for the budget politics of the member states expect.

Fire story:
The Innovator IBM steps into the second century of its existence
If one wanted to look for a suitable word that the strategy of IBM characterizes most exactly, then this would be probably the word “longevity”.
For the broad public IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, one knows it as modern enterprise, although since its establishment already one century elapsed.
The basis to this longevity already put its first boss - who sen visionary Thomas J. Watson.
Already it represented the slogan, countless world-wide problems let itself easily solve, if humans were ready to think a little.
Its slogan “Think!” became in such a way the brand name, over the life of the future giant to take place should (and at the same time to the title of the internal magazine, which one began to publish at IBM in the year 1935).
This was also the basis of the organisational culture prepared thoroughly by Watsen.
“For us from IBM this long-term thinking means a kontinuelle movement toward future.
IBM survived and was also a whole century successful, because it remained faithful for its principles and not before back-frightened changing everything else all around.
Permitted us to transform in the course of our first century, the technologies, the Business and also the society.
We hope, which we create, said in the next hundred years still more” Samuel J. Palmisano, the today's director of the enterprise from cause of the anniversary.
Thought-out system
Watson operated already in the thirties social care of its persons employed - in a similar way, like the entrepreneur Baťa in Czechoslovakia: The IBM people had paid vacation, an insurance as one the first American persons employed by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as work clothing and a thought-out remuneration system for best newer one and resellers.
Just as thought out is also the long-term relations of IBM with their customers.
The enterprise was from the outset ingenious in the talent promotion - when one of the first companies up and could themselves world-wide main header IBM any Diskrimination accordingly select.
In agreement with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the present plan, which is alternated Palmisan at the point by IBM in the next year by a woman - by Virginia Rometty.
Those participates already thirty years at IBM, so far took it the position of the Vetriebs, marketing and strategy boss.
IBM makes so-called of on-line brainstorming in the last years, from which many future strategies and innovations arise.
No miracle - ideas it gives enough, in the enterprise is busy nearly one half million to humans.
An institution with good reputation
Their unshakeable position in the Business guarantees a strong image and this to the enterprise inward and outward.
“From the outset IBM had rather the concept of an institution, as a bare technology enterprise”, said to Economist the professor of Harvard Business School and the authoress of a book concerning IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology enterprise, but a company, which helps to solve business problems of assistance from technologies”, added George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the enterprise stresses, there are a difference to be only present on the market or form it by this presence directly.
IBM - in the states of their logo because of familiar “Big Blue” mentioned, is grown up in one century to one of the largest enterprises of the world.
It is one of the most versatile technology enterprises at all - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, Hosting and consultation achievements in unbelievable product width - from servers up to the nanotechnology.
From all American technology enterprises IBM possesses the most patents and five its employee with the Nobel Prize was already distinguished.
To its most well-known inventions belong e.g. cash-point dispensers, credit cards, financial WAP, Strichcode or also the floppy disk.
With approx. 220 billion dollar stock exchange value (market capitalisation) was IBM in this year the second largest technology enterprise (right after Apple), whereby it overhauled for the first time since 1996 Microsoft.
The view ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of the customers today - unfortunately for example the attempt with the own operating system OS/2, on-line service Prodigy or also the computers IBM PC was jr.
“Business is based on the forward movement, therefore one may bind not emotional to the past”, means themselves in addition Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore IBM does not have a problem to build its foundation walls on different platforms - to leave and if they do not function, it also re.
Contrary to the opponent Microsoft, which stands and falls in principle with its operating system Windows.
Promising technologies
In the profits of IBM take part in largest measure services, software and hardware take part to in each case a fifth.
Still 1990 hardware with one were more than fifty-percent portion most strongly represented.
Since 2000 of 15 billion dollar, in the same time it however 58 billion dollar invested sold IBM little profit throwing off active in the value into the purchase of promising technologies.
In these investments IBM continues also after 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept for the first time like a storm over the world.
IBM the legacy of its first boss remained also here Thomas J. Watson faithfully, who in the middle increased its investment extent in the large world economic crisis.
So far it seems that the enterprise IBM gets over the today's crisis without prejudice to.
The value of the IBM shares rose since 2008 rocket-like by 120 percent and the clear profit of the enterprise grows kontinuell.
The enterprise slogan of IBM reads: everything cannot be changed - only the values.
Also therefore it may be expected that this flexible giant masters also the next crisis.
IBM history: From the cheese cutter to universe flights
Before one hundred years the society IBM (international Business Machines), created in New York, had at first a quite complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording corporation.
She only 1924 took over the name IBM - originally it concerned a trademark for an address into Canada and South America.
The foundation-stone to the later society IBM the fusion of four enterprises put, to their history into the 80's the 19. Century goes back.
They possessed technologies like for example the famous time card clocks for the registration of the beginning of work and - end.
The architect of this new enterprise became Charles Ranlett Flint, which had the presidency in the supervisory board until 1930 also.
And it was Flint, which adjusted the boss of the competition company Thomas J. Watson, so that this helped him with the line of the enterprise.
This Leader placed then even the founders of IBM into the shade - on Watson's ideas was based to today the invincible culture and identity of the enterprise.
Watson led the enterprise until 1952.
IBM, began, like already the name betrays, with the production and the selling of all possible machines for the trade - from Wurst-und cheese cutters, up to cashes.
In the first four decades, in which Watson led the company, it doubled its sales on nine million dollar and the enterprise expanded gradually on all continents.
Watson was for the company so indispensably that he sat whole forty years long in the executive chair, he from his son, Thomas Watson junior was only then replaced.
Under its line IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed also the first programming language.
In the 60's technician and computers of IBM helped to lead NASA of flights in the universe - to Mercury and Saturn and in the year 1969 also the famous flight of humans to the moon.
Meanwhile IBM developed the first computer family with same computer architecture in the year 1964 - the row IBM System/360.
A classical PC, which determined the computer standard of that time, came in the year 1981 under the name IBM 5150 on the market.
Later IBM its computer production sold twenty years to the Chinese society Lenovo, on the other hand one it bought however the consul aunt part of the enterprise PricewaterhouseCoopers and entered hereby completely into the business with consulting achievements and services with high increase in value.
The strategy, IBM in the last three years pays off is the concept “smart planet”.
It embodies the intention of using technologies in intelligent way in so far ranges even not planned e.g. also for the improvement of the situation in traffic and in the city administration.
To the commercial sector IBM introduced recently the platform “smart Commerce”, which was to help the resellers to lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has also in Czech Republic a strong history.
Already 1932 created IBM an address in Czechoslovakia at that time - as at all the first country in central and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM ČR operates among other things also a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The center for central and Eastern Europe settles in Prague and is here also a Top Forscherteam from world level that with the technology of the voting recognition is concerned.
Darina Rychtářová over their unfaithful husbands:
Iveta - this donkey cannot you keep yourself, I wants him no more!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now is conclusion!
After its spouse had become Josef Rychtář (53) of the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45) their lover, Darina remained still hope that Josef from its rose-pink dream awakes and comes home.
But now it is finally with the patience past and for the further life it clear rules sat down.
“Josef can come home, but no more than my partner”, explained. Rychtářová to D.
When Darina Rychtářová of the singer had ordered Ith Bartošová in its own house refuge, you would probably not have broken in times in the dream, how goes out with its man.
When Iveta pulled to urge on its after 30 days again out and back after Říčany, went along equal Josef.
Yes it admitted even publicly that he loves her.
With the time resigned Darina, yes it seemed even, as if she wanted to again reconcile herself with her unfaithful man - now however she gave him finally the run passport.
Rychytář is no matter it, with whom its wife sleeps
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future nevertheless, then it is received at home surely not open arms.
“He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide its days in our common home, then I become him do not out-hunt.”
“However not as more loved, got lost an old donkey, but as humans, to whom I have still certain connections”, betrayed Mrs. Rychtářová\; in addition, she said, she had separated from him already emotional and insists alone on mutual reputability.
Josef carries the circumstance that Darina locked the back door to him, so far with became.
“I respect the decision of my wife.”
“I do not stay together with Iveta, to it change for anything.”
“My wife wants a paper marriage and respects I.”
“The company keeps running, I worries about the repairs, the garden, property, I makes the purchases.”
“With Darina maintenance I completely normally, only the bed we divide just not”, said to J. Rychtář (the sheet) Blesk.
If Darina wants to look for each other new loving, then it wants to prevent it not from it.
“We do not sleep with one another, therefore it is no matter to me whether she has a friend or who that is.
Me is clearly that my debt is, I with Iveta fell in love and therefore transfers I any responsibility.
The worst female Untugenden: How does it stand with you?
If one requests the men to call some typical female Untugenden then they vibrate some promptly without exception from the sleeve.
Dear women, recognize each other you in the following lines again, in which we let happen a few Unsitten revue again, which leave the blood in the veins boiling to the men?
Purchase craze
Does their husband accuse to them to be purchase addicted?
Do you have to weekly buy at least a Hader?
May you do go shopping gladly and it with actions also equal a little more be?
Then it probably really concerns in your case weakness.
Some women are at least aware of its and try their purchase desire halfway under control to hold.
But hand on the heart, which woman bears it already to stroll in the search for a well sitting clothing only in such a way by a dress business and try themselves out not directly all (in all possible color combinations) in the cab?
Even if buying for most women is a hobby, for the men it is often pure hell.
Consider they nevertheless times, how often they already said to their man - remain you times rather outside…
Constant discontent
“Am I not too thick?”
“I would have to remove at least five Kilos - was I to begin to jog or make gymnastic?”
“Do I please you at all?”
Them does that come somehow admits forwards?
Yes?
Then you belong probably to the women, who are proper possessed of it how they look.
That does not mean for a long time that you react yourselves go to let to be supposed, but many men allergically to if their wife constantly whines over their appearance.
The stronger sex is itself united - with rising frequency of the complaints the women are ever incompatible.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It is a fight against windmills.
Windows deseam, tiles and dust wipe, which scrub tub - and this at least twice in the week.
Do you grumble with their partner, because it tramples once again with dirty shoes on the clean tiles, scolding you the children, because the straight scrubbed wash basin is already again dirty and because the glass door at the living room cabinet has already again fingerprints, polishing so much trouble make where nevertheless?
If you should under this kind “deviance” suffering, then you should know that one may not to exaggerate and the order and cleanliness in the family circle in the first place stand nothing.
This excessive Reinheitsfimmel can harm finally also the mutual relations and above all the peace in the family.
Burins
“Dirty sport pants come into the laundry basket.”
“Do you want to tighten the old socks really tomorrow once again?”
“One does not throw a wet towel simply on the floor.”
If its partner such is exposed to a tirade, you may not be surprised that on the palm brings it.
Clearly that is not badly meant, it wants nevertheless only, which has everything its order.
If the men knew this, then the women did not need possibly so much to grumble.
Gossip and gossip
Some women applaud and gossip gladly, there behind the back are gossiped secretly or slandered or one forge alliances.
Women are just focused on relations, therefore they pant gladly such topics through, like for example - who, where, with whom, like and why.
Probably everyone of us women has a little harmless gossip and gossip in stock.
Hand on the heart - that is probably own to all women.
That is however not to confound with gossips of roughest caliber, which is holy nothing and nobody, which probably despise everyone in their environment and which particularly for woman collectives represent a substantial danger.
Jágr and Voráček help Philadelphia with their Assistenzen to the victory
Ice hockey door MER Jaromír Jágr had with on Mondays play of the NHL with two Assistenzen large portion of the 5:3-Sieg of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and is thereby again most productive Czech player in the NHL.
Beneficiary of the overview the nine-and thirty-year-olds of the ice hockey star was in both cases Claude Giroux, which added and to the best player of the match was proclaimed still another Assistenz.
Also Jágr's fellow player Jakub Voráček registered two Assistenzen in the same play.
Jágr stated after the play opposite journalists, it to Giroux a large evening prophesied.
“Before the play already says I to him that today a Hattrick succeeds to him.”
I had that somehow in the feeling.”
“Now and then a feeling” overcomes such, explained Jágr, after whose action Giroux already obtained a gate with the first shot the flyer.
A little later also the second hit had “a Czech trace”.
Voráček fought for the puck behind the gate of the Hurricanes and submitted it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
One second before the final whistle of the first third obtained the home player Patrick Dwyer a Short Hander, but the second third belonged then again the flyer.
Concretely Giroux.
In co-operation with Jágr it obtained its third hit, afterwards Wayne Simmonds steered its shot to the fourth gate.
“I love it to play with it.”
“I do not want to say that he is the best player of the league, but certainly belong he to the best three”, appreciated Jágr to its centers.
“In the life it would not have occurred to me that I played for the conclusion of my career with such an ice hockey player together, as with it.”
“Makes happy me enormous.”
“I cut my play to I.”
“Universe the years in the NHL stopped my fellow players their play to me and now turns the skewer over”, grinned quietly Jágr.
Carolina still made play the drama - by the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, which succeeded from a punishing shot, approached it on a gate.
Matt READ prevented however each further complication, in which it was successful in majority two against one.
“Pronger still in our zone, acted excellently.”
“It got the puck, I took up trip and (READ) pulled to more distant posts.”
“I tried to meet it and am glad that it folded”, described Voráček the last hit of the portion from its view.
By this victory Philadelphia sat down to the point of the eastern conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček injured itself in the play against Buffalo and was ruled out in the second third because of an injury at the torso.
The Candiens paid for beside their experiences Beck also its guidance unverloren in the penalty shooting 2: 3.
Tomáš Plekanec could not transform one of the punishing shots.
More than the lost points probably hurt the coach of the home team the high illness-conditioned loss in the defensive - they played the play only with five defenders in the end.
“That is bad.”
“The meeting we played with a only one experienced player in the end, the rest were young players.”
“Nothing can however there be made, thus must we become finished”, said Jacques Martin.
“With each change an attack wave after the other one and we did not have to oppose anything to that.”
“We would have the play to make simpler and the puck from our third bring out have.”
Here there was still reserves”, meant P.K. Subban, one the defender.
The Czech goal keeper Ondřej Pavelec repelled thirty shots of Tampa Bay and contributed so considerably to the 5:2-Sieg over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which terminated hereby a series of five defeats, five different contactors had portion.
Development of the trip prices since 1989
Until 1989 it gave in the ČSSR at that time only five granted national travel agencies: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies sold at that time above all only journeys into the socialist Eastern Bloc countries, into the west were allowed at that time only chose.
And in such a way Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (into the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sotschi on the peninsula Crimea at the black sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the black sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A light exception was the period of 1962 to 1972, when one was allowed to travel also to Yugoslavia, then hit Yugoslavia a pro-Western course and therefore the journeys to Yugoslavia was strongly limited.
A large paradox of those socialist times was it that it not even citizen of the Eastern Bloc (thus also the Tschechoslowaken) was permitted to travel in the context of the socialist countries freely.
If a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel for example individually to Poland or to the Soviet Union, then he needed in addition a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual journeys were not possible.
The travel agencies offered also to journeys already at that time into the west, then one must take however enormous queues in purchase or stay overnight also in the sleeping bag before the travel agency, and/or have at least “good acquaintance” in the travel agency.
The thing had not yet run also in such a way.
The so-called foreign exchange promise - the condition for a departure into the west - was only given to “politically reliable” people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovakian currency was no freely exchangeable currency, without finding foreign exchange promise it would have been thus impossible, the necessary moneys (western currency) for a journey into the west.
Those from far away most Czechs spent from there their vacation inland, no miracle that the Czechs bought innumerable weekend houses and Dat - a habit, which persists until today.
A travel revolution of the Czechs followed the samtenen revolution of 1989 after the foot.
While until 1989 one vacation in the GDR or in Bulgaria the measure of all things were, the Czechs spent last year 4.5 million of their foreign holidays into countries of the whole world.
An enormous paradox, whose one is today no longer conscious, is the fact that one into at present most popular vacation country of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989 at all to travel could not, because it was part Yugoslavia at that time.
Directly of the beginning of the 90's of the past century on the foreign exchange obligation was waived into the neighbouring Western European countries, which caused an enormous wave of short visits particularly to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Tschechoslowaken could not get long time of their journeys into the west simply enough, everyone wanted at least a few days there to have been.
Thus the Czech holiday-makers slept with journeys to Paris in the tent in the park, because who would have at that time already the money for an accommodation in the hotel or in a pension had.
A typical characteristic with journeys abroad of Czechs was at that time more crammed with canneded food, beer and continuous sausage an etc. trunk.
A further important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades our tourists the western currency could buy themselves finally freely.
Our life level and thereby also the average salaries rose, which led into 1997 a further important instant.
Owing to the increased demands for journeys the travel agencies began to prepare journeys after 1997 regularly by charter flights, whereby the air passage reduced in price owing to the possibility of negotiating quantity discounts in the comparison to the past unbelievably.
The Czechs, with exception of the USA, had end of the 90's already foreign exchangeless exchange with all highly developed countries in the world, which made the travel still simpler.
To a further interesting instant in history “post samtenen” passenger traffic came it in the year 2000, when owing to the high demand the first direct charter flight was dispatched into an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then fly annually direct charter aircrafts with Czech passengers to sunny countries removed far\; in this year one approaches twelve exotic destinations directly from Czech Republic.
To the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel annually to exotic countries!
A further important instant in the epoch, which marked our “post office-revolutionary” development, came in the year 2008.
On 17 November 2008 main headers the USA the visa obligation for Czech tourists up, whereby our country incorporated itself definitely under the highly developed countries in the world.
In the year the Czechs spent 2008 for the first time more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they gave than 15 Tsd for only one vacation sojourn including the costs at the resort more. CZK per head out.
The general meeting is to find a new chairman - again a stalemate threatens.
Already nearly five months long the Czech football does not have a chairman and threatens that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the point of the Czech football federation (FAČR) does not even admit after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk will be.
Until today there is still no agreement over it, after which electoral law is to be selected.
And without these at all no vote is possible over the three potential successors.
Three prospective customers would like to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June Hašek withdrew from its function, whereby he requested his colleagues with resignation had to agree and to find a strong personality, that could lead the football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek the old arguments between the two federation chambers broke out again, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This showed up klipp and clearly on 16 September, when the new chairman should be selected.
The delegated ones of the general meeting had come completely in vain into the community center in the Prague quarter of Smíchov, because the negotiation it led not only of the choice to no result and was a matter.
One could not agree times on who during the full collection actually enfranchised actual only the statutory representatives or also the functionaries equipped with an authority.
In this only point one obtained at least partial agreement, to which also the recommendation of the institute for state and right contributed, according to whose opinion an agency on authority basis was not permitted.
The disputes around the electoral law persist however further.
Also the executive committee did not bring any more clarity into the thing, with whose meetings - no matter whether tidy or extraordinary - nothing at all in principle different more on the agenda stands.
Even if the views regarding the choice a few marks changed - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question reads: how is one to proceed in the 3rd round, in order to avoid a deadlock?
“The point at issue concerns the question whether one is to proceed in agreement with the statute, or whether completely different model must be found”, determined to Dušan Svoboda, one of the three deputy chairmen of the FAČR, which represents the professional football in the management.
According to statutory model that candidate, who receives the larger percentage support in the chamber, triumphs for which it stood as a candidate in the third round.
Moravia is allegedly ready to deal with the compromise that candidate triumphs, who receives the higher number of voices from both chambers.
The Czech side again insists on the condition that the winner receives a two-thirds majority during this percentage voting counting at least.
“Then the two first rounds have at all no more sense, this mode the entire bicameral concept in question would place” to select understand Svoboda the objections of the Moravian side, which would find it best, not to sort out the electoral law but according to valid statute.
That agrees surprisingly also Tomáš Paclík, even if it appears that the statutory electoral law of all candidates at the earliest probably Pelta comes against.
“My desire is it that after the statute one selects as far as possible.”
“With it no unreasonable spare variants to be invented, as at the last general meeting”, the owner (the soccer club) explained to Victoria Plzeň, which stands as a candidate for the first time and defined themselves in its statements above all opposite Pelta.
Pelta remains however optimistic.
According to its opinion will in Nymburk the new chairman admits to be and it believes that the candidates in the future will also constructionally co-operate.
“The possible qualification of the national team for the football European championships on the today's day would contribute surely to calming of the mind.”
“If the football only on the euphoric wave rides, then also the readiness for co-operation is larger”, means the functionary from Jablonec, that from all three Adepten the largest experiences bring along and this both on professional, and regional level.
Rajchl is there more reserved.
“I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately ambivalently.”
“That is not a thing between the people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts “to bend into shape” the regulations for own purposes.”
“Therefore a renewed blocking is not impossible at the general meeting.”
“I hope however that the common sense triumphs finally”, said to Rajchl.
Only - much time for the agreement of all sides does not remain any more.
Some negotiations should take place allegedly directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football generals up to the qualification play will be at all complete.
The charter aircraft, with which among other things Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl should fly to Podgorice, could not start in the morning in Prague because of a technical disturbance at all and looked for one feverish in such a way for a spare variant to be brought as one a part of the executive committee still to the venue of the bar rising up first leg.
Finally then nevertheless probably the meeting on Minister level is crucial, to which it is to come allegedly on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, which would have Ministers for public education, youth and body education the split parties within the largest sport federation of the country gladly induced to an agreement.
It stands much on the play: national allowances, Vertrauungswürdigkeit of the Czech football and also the lining up general meeting of the ČSTV, which is to point toward the financial problems from Sazka the new direction to the Czech sport.
Paclík goes into the fight for the position of the chairman, because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the boss of the Pilsner soccer players before the extraordinary general meeting had been able to constitute a strong candidate, who would have fulfilled all to its conceptions over the new chairmen of the football federation of the Czech Republic of (FAČR), he would not have gotten involved at all in the fight for this top position.
“If it a good candidate would give, then I would fight for it and without the choice would do.”
“However in the present situation it did not succeed to find such Adepten”, said Paclík ČTK.
The principal reason for Paclík to go into the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to be prevented it thus that the alleged favorites of the choice, Pelta, at which point of the FAČR arrives.
Paclík stresses also that he intends to exercise the function of the chairman only one year in case of his victory, thus until 2013, up to the date of the statutory general meeting.
In the position of the chairman he would have seen gladly experienced Top manager, who is involved into the football happening not too much to one.
“With some which are applicable people I spoke personally.”
“To hardly believe that some said to me, they did not want to identify themselves at present with the Czech football.
“Gladly” he would have changed, stated such opinions.
At most of everything Paclík disturbs allegedly the connection Pelta's with the chairman of the Pilsner of district football federation novel Berbr to affect a man with controversial call, which is considered behind the scenes as powerful lobbyist, with the ability, delegation votes on general meetings.
For Paclík it is unacceptable for this reason that Pelta would have the position of the chairman.
“With its victory the today's condition and in the Czech football was in-conserved would not precede it.”
“The support by Berbr, smarter Businessman, would doubly badly get the football”, stressed Paclík.
Hereby it alludes also to it that Pelta's name fell some time ago in connection with telephone hearing to the determination in a corruption affair, from which Pelta however exempt from punishment came out.
“I do not know, which prestige a victory of Pelta (tsch.) Football to bring in should.”
“And as we would stand there, said in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA” řekl Paclík, to which its earlier utterance, “it will sell the Pilsner soccer club, if Pelta of chairmen becomes”, but already somewhat more left sees.
If Paclík in the Thursday choice should triumph, he can quite imagine however a future co-operation with Pelta.
Exactly the same also a further candidate thinks - Rajchl, which Paclík before the general meeting had supported in the October, which ended with a fiasco.
“It (Pelta) would be first, to which I would go.”
“It has large abilities”.
“I could understand myself it well for example as a boss of the national team.”
“However I do not believe to lead that he is capable, the federation as managers.”
“I am not my nose nevertheless into affairs, about which I understand, said nothing” Paclík, which had provided in September thereby for attention that he stood behind the recall of the arbitrator commission with Luďěk Macela at the point, which Dagmar Damková replaced.
Paclík stated, it feels the role of the federation chairman grown.
And thereby he refers also a boss of Pilsen to its abilities with the line of private businesses, since past summer is, which celebrated first Triumph in the league with its support in May.
“I have the power to change and contribute to a certain cultivation of this something in the football environment.”
To limit “around the influence of certain groups of interests, which tend to affect disciplinary and appointment commissions which degenerates, stated in repugnant situations” Paclík, which does not make no secret from its antipathy for example opposite the Sparta boss of Daniel Křetínský.
When it would regard one of its priorities the consolidation of the relations between the FAČR and the Czech olympia committee, with whose assistance he would lobbyieren with the political point politicians for it that more funds from the lottery tax into the sport flows.
“That is one of the crucial things, to which the new chairman should dedicate himself”.
“If it for the taxation of luck plays comes, how the political parties define, then understands I its argumentation, then they must say in addition, klipp and clearly, where the money goes, said” it.
Its connection to the Pilsner club does not regard Paclík likewise as handicap, although it stresses, the chairman of the FAČR must be “non-partisan”.
Pelta again is connected to Rajchl with the Prague Dukla with Jablonec.
“That is not ideal straight.”
“It makes for my opinion in addition, not much sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner club hypocritically to a third person over after one and a half years again to return”, got straight Paclík.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which would exclude a deadlock in the future.
One of the candidates for the office for chairman, i.e. Miroslav Pelta, promised two days before the general meeting of the football federation it in case of his choice for the fact will make itself strong that the FAČR gets new statute, which excludes in the future disputes over the electoral law from the beginning.
The functionary from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday negotiation in Nymburk and believes, the election campaign with a possible success of the Czech selection will defuse themselves surely.
Pelta had already promised before the not realized choice in September, he wanted to concentrate in case of his choice on the national team and the production of moneys.
He decided only on the last moment to take part in the choice before the last general meeting and so might him the two-month break have helped have defended and have presented in a broader context its conceptions over the line of the football.
“People on all levels dedicate themselves, it to the football are impatient and expect from there that the chairman admits on Thursday is.”
“It feels that it is high time that the federation is led by someone, means the man, who is connected particularly with the Jablonecer club in addition, many years with Sparta and in the executive committee acted.
Also therefore he that he sufficient experiences have means, in order to lead the Czech football.
It is convinced that for the today's problems with the choice the euphoria is responsible, which prevailed at times of Ivan Hašek.
“Unfortunately at the general meeting in June statutes were approved of, which were not so perfect, as all had accepted it.
If they had not permitted different interpretations, we would have had, meant a chairman starting from September already” Pelta.
It used the straight revision of the most important document of the citizen combination as LOCK means for the delegated ones.
“I should become chairman, then I take care of its personally and am ready personally responsibility to be carried, if it does not fold.”
“That is a thing in principle, without which he can not be”, states Pelta.
In the further one it does not try to define itself opposite its contractors.
Already in former times he had announced, he could imagine a co-operation with Jindřich Rajchl, which he recognizes because of its legal education and he knows well that its rival candidate would be its first deputy.
Also Tomáš Paclík it attacked not for a long time, which let again no dry thread at Pelta.
In the football it already moves over one year and can already refer to certain successes.”
“Its attacks were disparaging however and many people were shocked from its election campaign.”
“Also therefore now many doubt addressed Pelta its contractor, who remains faithful probably for its proclaiming its real character”, which it already in September expressed.
According to its opinion its strongest weapon is the knowledge of the football of lowest divisions, up to the national team.
And this should be the sign of Czech football.
“I would strive also to terminate all affairs - of the Causa Bohemians, up to resounding the corruption scandal from the past year.”
“Soon after I would fall myself on negotiations with the private and national sector, around sufficient moneys for the whole football to guarantee”, said the six-and fourty-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time he promised also that its introduction will not mean personnel cleanings into the point of the Czech football.
“I would have to familiarize myself for a start with work contents of all persons employed”, said he toward Strahov, where due to the long anarchy as may be understood nervousness prevails.
Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios, which accompany the lining up general meeting, he believes that the delegated ones do not drive in vain on Thursday to Nymburk.
“The only contentious point to be if real should, how one selects in the third round, then gets we over it.”
“The football needs reliability and recovers it only thereby if it finally a new Leader has”, remains Pelta two days the possibly crucial day ago of its functionary career optimistically.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR under him begins to work hard
If the past deputy chairman Jindřich Rajchl on the general meeting should be selected on Thursday to the new chairman of the football federation of the Czech republic, this allegedly many people in the federation the mood would spoil.
Rajchl promises that one begins to work in case of its choice hard.
It wants changes of system would bring in and the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football ranges to make.
In addition it promised to solve the case Bohemians to improve the relations with the UEFA and FIFA to bring more funds into the football and continue otherwise the work, which the previous chairman Ivan Hašek began.
“As a chairman I would like to dedicate myself to the football as whole one.”
Begun from the international contacts to the UEFA and FIFA, over the national selection, the professional football, up to the achievement football for the youth.”
“With it I do not want to say that I want to make everything alone”, said for Rajchl in the discussion for ČTK.
“I am a team player and would like from there the authority in the executive committee in such a way to distribute that each member dedicates itself to a certain range.”
And I will distribute hard tasks, advance thus the football in each segment with mile steps.”
Over it many not straight would be delighted, because them would have to begin to work, instead of criticizing only the work of others, now even really hard”, added it.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement considered of not standing as a candidate no more.
“Of me it is well-known that I work 20 hours on the day.”
“However I must know the fact that it makes sense and that stands for humans behind me, who do not throw incessantly clubs to me between the legs and question, said each step, which I make,” he as explanation, why he hesitated.
“Many people said to me however that I was not allowed to give up, because otherwise also different would do it.”
“That is confidence, which one may not to squander”, said he.
Allegedly motivates it also to be allowed to continue the work which it began under Hašek.
“In two years we mastered a large piece of work and that do not want I now not simply to throw away.”
“Processes were started, which become effective probably only into a few years and I would see only reluctantly the fact that someone stop”, he meant her and expresses hereby his doubts that if the other candidate selected himself - Miroslav Pelta the situation into the times before Hašek return could.
“I believe in systematic action and that am something that does not bring Mirek Pelta.”
“Behind it stand above all people, which would make the football in such a way that it would only be there for chosen one.”
One can probably accuse some to me, but not that I would be biased.”
“I strive to be objective.”
“I want football for all, because it can then to all well and, Rajchl did not only notice the chosen one”.
It contradicts also the statement, it is only one chairman of the Czechs.
“Even if some people maintain the opposite, I intend really to do the optimum for Moravia.”
“For example it is to be considered time, whether one should not divide the league into a Czech and a Moravian part, their winner then into the first league ascended in each case.”
“Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs in the league played, which for the young players in Moravia a problem is particularly”, means Rajchl.
Because now also the boss of the Pilsner club Tomáš Paclík the fight for the function of the chairman followed, Rajchl does not dare to estimate its opportunities that he is selected.
“I feel a strong support in the Czech chamber, which selected me to its deputy chairman and now recognizes that clear successes behind me stand”, stated for Rajchl, also the saving of tens of million crowns for disadvantageous contracts, which agreement of television contracts and the negotiations regard around the lottery law as its success.
On the other hand it gives itself partially the debt for the fact that the federation does not pull on only one strand.
While he says of Pelta, “he is from the beginning disqualified, the Czech football to new confidence to help”, regards he to the second rivals - Paclík as a strong candidate, who has to offer to the football really somewhat.
“Nobody can question that it carried out for only one year in Pilsen into distinguished work.”
“He should be selected, then he the things would probably continue introduced, the Ivan Hašek and also personnel occupation in the commissions he obviously not in principle would change.”
It would want surely to sort out the things not to its favor”, judges to Rajchl of its rivals.
Of Europe most beautiful pools
Leap in the blue
Of Julia Stanek
Planschbecken in UFO optics, splendor pool in Budapest: Who travels by Europe, blue miracle can be experience - and after a city route or a migration the tired legs in jacuzzis rest.
A book shows, where spa is most beautiful in the water.
If iris Meder went in the past one and a half years on search journey, one in its luggage could not be missing: their bathing suit.
Back Ling lying on the water, it looked to marble Putten against, which waited at the pond edge for her highly in ornate arranged domes, it swam, and was astonished over with the utmost care restored art nouveau natatoriums.
If you pleased a bath, she took it immediately into its note book up including worth knowing details over the building method and history of the building.
More architecture historian Meder explored and presents than 200 swimming pools in this way - her now into their straight published book “bath joys”: People natatoriums in Munich, historical bath palaces in the Black Forest, “buildings of hardcore concrete” in the Taunus.
By 13 countries it led its “journey to the most unusual baths in Central Europe”: Beside Germany, Austria and Switzerland it visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, the Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and in each case a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year old German is a true bath cultural enthusiast.
With sport it does not have much at the hat, says Meder - only in the water is that different.
Annoying only that swimming fans must resign themselves to blue tiles and chlorine stink, while joggers can that beguiling smell of spruce forests inhale or to merry bird twittering in the park listen.
“I asked myself one day, why swimming pools must actually be always so ugly”, say the Meder living in Vienna.
“Thus I began to collect beautiful baths.”
Water surface doubles architecture
Geplät in the leap basin and ethereal sauna oils - the spa factor in baths is so largely, because all senses are served, like that Meder.
And if the designers tried hard, natatoriums can be a true Augenschmaus: “Place of a floor one has a water surface in baths.”
“You, reflects on the other hand however the beauty of the whole building is on the one hand transparent.”
Everything doubles itself optically: high vaults, multicolored tiles, springboards.
The small-sized book of pictures “bath joys” obtain worth knowing on 190 sides over the architecture and cultural history of historical spa oases - however above all desire makes on a leap in the blue.
The pool Sammlerin Meder discovered remarkable copies with its searches in Hungary.
Beside magnificent therapeutic baths like that she found 100 years to old Széchenyi bath in Budapest a nitrathaltiges waters in one URI towards Karsthöhle (cave bath in Miskolc Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath, whose basins are filled with alkaline water and in a flask-shaped building are (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular prospects however offer many heated open-air swimming pools in Switzerland and in Austria: While one has the whole city in the eye from the inhabitant of Zurich roof bath, one can look in the external pool of a bath in St. Anton on the snow-covered Arlberg - and: In the steambath there is a window, from which one can observe a driving on the ski runway.
The perhaps most unusual pool design expects bathers in length field: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a straight UFO landed in the alps.
From three upward open bowls it steams in the winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztals rise up into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in each swimming pool the pool Sammlerin Meder the smell of chlorine rose into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell it after sulfur, in the Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba stink so strongly after fuel oil, which one hardly believes in a health bath to have landed.
The smell comes from the alkali hydrogenkarbonathaltigen welfare water, which is nearly black and whose mud one sticks at the skin, as soon as one can be slid in the basin - a spa experience of the special art.
At a place iris Meder on their search for beautiful bath places was however also disappointed: When it free and sunbathe in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz to visit wanted, it found a locked terrain.
The 1902 of the architect the Dušan Jurkovic arranged bath were in the meantime closed.
When Meder threw a view by the weathered windows of the red-Weis-yellow art nouveau building, she saw, how weeds between the tiles rampantly grew.
One worked against the decline however in a charmful swimming pool in the Black Forest: the palace Thermal in bath Wildbad.
This bath has three construction phases already behind itself\; to discover one knows not only neo-Romance elements, which originate from times of its establishment in the year 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which were added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization 1995 the palaces Thermal is the favorite bath of the pool connoisseur iris Meder - and that not only, because she originally originates from the Black Forest.
“It is already an achievement to merge so different architectural styles into a so great unit”, says Meder.
With such a palace is the dipping course in the Thermalpool obviously only secondary matter.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank lets raw material business analyze
By Christian Teevs
Do Deutsche Bank give their business up with agrarian raw materials?
After mirror on-line information Josef Ackermann assigned a working group to check the consequences of the speculation for the arms of the world.
In January the company head wants to then pull to consequences.
Hamburg -
For the Federal citizens the thing is clear: It does not find 84 percent of the Germans acceptable it according to a study that banks speculate in agrarian raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two thirds of the asked ones demand that Deutsche Bank and other financial institutions step out of this business, because it intensifies the problems of the poorest ones of the world.
That is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf the consumer association Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report, which Foodwatch in the middle of presented Octobers.
In it the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets at the global raw material stock exchanges drive the prices up - and the banks therefore a partial responsibility at the world-wide hunger problem carry.
The campaign of consumer protections is directed concretely against German bank boss Josef Ackermann, even if major banks act such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley similarly.
Originally raw material bets were meant for securing resellers against price fluctuations.
But meanwhile are itself most experts united that the gamblers decoupled themselves of supply and demand - and at the expense of the poorest profits to make.
Differently than the US competitors Ackermann reacted to the criticism: He did not promise, which said reproaches to check and, business is worth it “to risk the good reputation of the German bank”.
After information from Spiegel online an international working group checks at present the reproaches from the Foodwatch report.
Until end of the year is to be concluded the examination, then the results the executive committee of the German bank presented - including recommendation, how is to be gone around with it.
At the end of January wants the point of the bank to then communicate, it draws which conclusions.
In the end a reduction of the raw material business, or even the complete break could stand.
Ackermann tinkers at its image
Foodwatch boss of Thilo Bode welcomed the message, affirmed however at the same time its criticism at the financial sector: “The bets on rising prices of food shows particularly drastically, like inconsiderately banks today the common weal damage.”
Ackermann now particularly stands as the highest bank lobbyist in the obligation.
“Must Deutsche Bank all plants from its portfolio paint, with which money is used for bets on food prices”, said Bode.
“No matter whether it concerns to Mr. Ackermann hunger suffering humans or the call of the German bank.”
The insight of Ackermann comes at first sight surprisingly, clearly is however that the company head would like to deliver few months before its outlet from the office a perfect picture.
On Monday Deutsche Bank announced that the chief executive will planned not change differently than into the supervisory board.
With a break with the disputed agrarian speculation it could improve its image.
And in order possible losses needs it to hardly bother - thus its successor would have to finally do.
Each second would quit raw material plants
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure high the manager.
So far already more than 30,000 internet users participated in the campaign of the organization.
On Tuesday Bode published the survey, for which Institut Forsa on 7 and 8 November asked 1001 humans.
Just eleven percent therefore regard it for legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers plants, with which prices as food are bet.
Many banking customers would draw also personal conclusions, if they experience that their bank takes part in such business: Each second would quit all plants, with which money flows into the raw material speculation according to the survey.
Acquaintance would advise 43 percent against such a bank to quit and change to another Institut 49 percent indicated to think about it their account.
21er house in Vienna
The moved pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with heights, depths and happy ending: The Austrian world fair pavilion of Brussels 1958 achieved prices, became in Vienna the museum, stood and decayed.
Now it is reopened as exhibition house.
If by modern post-war architecture one swarms, from clear forms, glass halls, courageous momenta and new building materials, which are typical for the faith in the technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brüssler world fair is 1958 an appropriate and famous example.
Schwanzers pavilion received at that time the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its and floating working steel glass construction.
The building is valid until today as milestone of contemporary architecture.
He announced the architect in such a way that also during the next world fair of Austria pavilion built.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus dish-like Nebenbau in Munich it became finally 1973 internationally famous.
Its pavilion planned as temporary building of exhibitions one had set up, had converted after the world fair in Swiss garden with the Viennese south station and to 1962 therein a museum the 20. Century opens - “20's the house” it was called.
Suitably the building was not however neither spatially and technically as museum - walls for hanging the art, no good climate.
Nevertheless it was so for a long time used, until the contemporary art got a new house in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building stood and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz converted the pavilion, he is called “21er house” and in the future as museum for contemporary art is used now.
Tuesday evening opens the museum Belvedere, to which the house belongs, there the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in every sense.
Implemented the new beginning Agnes Husslein Arco, which became 2007 new directress of the Austrian gallery Belvedere.
Husslein Arco, attained a doctorate art historian with considerable career among other things in the youth as Eiskunstläufererin, later with Sotheby's, the Guggenheim museum and than establishment directress of the museum of the modern trend Salzburg, implemented the change seriously with politicians and monument conservationists, it procured public means and private sponsor funds and specified the use.
Except contemporay art the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be issued by the foundation of the same name, a café and a book shop should it give, and an office building had to be built in addition.
Supervision, small budget
For execution then Krischanitz was ideal occupation.
Not only, because he had sensitively converted and had extended Joseph Olbrichs Secession in Vienna and had won the competition, but because it studied Vienna with Schwanzer at the technical university and the pavilion for it was a “tremendously important place”, at which he had regarded “nearly each weekend” the exhibitions.
It knew the Ur-draft, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost during its transfer to Vienna and his use for new purposes at generosity and ease.
With the current change there were far larger problems: The building was “an energy centrifuge”, says Krischanitz.
The window sections of the glass facade were replaced, glass-fiber reinforced insulation glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cooling bridge steel girders were replaced strengthened or, and asbestos-filled covers were reorganized.
Two basements brought place for the new use, a lowered light ditch between house and road provide for the exposure, a bridge lead to the entrance - nearly a new building, but still the light tail he pavilion.
The original outer doors remained, the house are painted in the old red-brown rust protection color.
And the cinema hall is even still completely exactly the same, as it in former times was.
And all this under strict supervision of the monument authority and with small budget.
“Often a material had to be found, which is good and is cheap and also” Krischanitz pleased, says the office for monument protection and refers to a rough ground in the basement.
Despite all obligations, problems and changes the building remained easy flexibly and.
It is difficult been with the pavilion, “from Brussels came along”, Krischanitz recently said, a typical “drop in the town center history”.
So an architecture stands “always at the wrong place” and wants nevertheless “a correct consciousness to arouse”.
In this case the 21er is house however not at the wrong place, because it entered a stroke of luck concerning town construction: Around Swiss garden around develops the straight completely again planned “main station accomodation”, with office and houses.
And another stroke of luck will perhaps still enter: The 21er house could get reinforcement of another Krischanitz building, because the Sammlerin Francesca of Habsburg bought the citizens of Berlin temporary arts center, and how one hears, she already negotiates with the city around a neighborly location in Swiss garden.
Course plans winter crisis package in million height
The course devised a crisis plan, which is to prevent course losses in the winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That costs millions.
In the fight against winter-conditioned course losses and delays the German Railways a newspaper report spends according to in this year over 70 million euros additionally.
The “picture” - newspaper reported first with reference to a company internal crisis plan, to 2015 is investments by altogether approximately 300 million euros intended.
Thus a better availability is to be achieved by vehicles and railway system also with extreme Witterungen.
Planned is among other things a doubling of the internal and external employees for the snow removal on railway facilities and platforms on 16.000 persons.
A goal is it to release platforms up to the operating beginning and 90 percent of the switches necessary for operation within four to five hours from snow and ice to.
Two months ago railway boss had warned Rüdiger Grube after a meeting of leaders with government and industry before course losses and delays also in this winter.
In the past winter the course in the passenger traffic had substantial problems, since it lacks her among other things with difficult weather conditions reserves.
Thus numerous new regional courses wait for years for a permission of the railway Federal Office.
Besides there is a delay with the distribution of ICE courses.
It makes for the course also for years to create that she must let axles of ICE courses check clearly more frequently in the workshop, after a ICE had an axle break in Cologne main station.
Deutsche Bank pays million-punishment in the USA
To tumult around boss Josef Ackermann comes new trouble from the USA: A million-penalty must pay Deutsche Bank there.
As if the problems would be not already for Deutsche Bank enough at home, now also still its past in the USA catches up the industry giant: Frankfurt Institut pays in a comparison 145 million dollar (106 million euros), in order to settle disputes because of the failure of five large loan banks during the financial crisis.
It concerns the sale from mortgage papers.
The financial market adjuster NCUA accuses to a whole row at major banks the loan banks with wrong promises to the purchase of the financial products to have tempted\; they would have played the risks down.
Such papers lost during the financial crisis strongly at value and tore the banks also into the depth.
“We are content that we could solve the topic, without the parties before court had to pull”, said a German bank spokesman in New York.
The bank did not grant a debt with the comparison.
That is valid also for the Citigroup, which committed itself to the payment of 20.5 million dollar.
The obligingness of the two financial institutions welcomed the NCUA chairmen Debbie Matz.
National Credit Union administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US-loan banks and substitutes with failures, in order to protect the customer inserts.
The NCUA tried to get the developed billions-worth damage replaced.
The now closed comparisons are first of their art.
The adjuster had given a good talking-to also different major banks and in the summer JPMorgan Chase, which sues Royal Bank OF Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
With the questionable mortgage papers it concerns so-called Mortgage backed Securities.
These are the basis house credits.
When the US-real estate bubble burst 2007, this became a variety from financial companies to the calamity.
In September 2008, on the high point of the financial crisis, the US-investment bank Lehman Brothers tilted.
Even if the events are already past some years, then the banks at present in the USA a sharp wind blows against.
Investors and supervisory authorities brought innumerable actions, in order to punish compensation received to or misdemeanors.
The federal housing Finance Agency (FHFA) released the largest complaint wave.
She accuses 18 international major banks the two national US-real estate financers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with mortgage business in the volume of approximately 200 billion dollar to have overreached.
Also Deutsche Bank to a complaint of the FHFA, here goes it must place itself around several business in the value of altogether 14.2 billion dollar from the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires that the Frankfurt ones for “substantial losses” answer, without calling however an exact sum.
Deutsche Bank the demands as groundless had rejected and had explained to want to resist.
Warren Buffett enters with 10 billion at IBM
Financial guru buffet invests strongly in the IT-enterprise IBM.
For March it bought up shares in the value of more than ten billion dollar.
So far the large American investor had always explained Warren Buffett not to invest in IT and computer enterprises since the long-term development of the companies can be prognosticated only badly.
Now he read however the business reports of IBM and changed its opinion over investments in the industry.
He had to understand already much in former times the fact that IBM offers above all services and for the IT-departments of other enterprises procures computer systems.
An investment of Warren Buffett is considered as knight impact in the financial world.
Therefore may the IT-bedrock IBM now “sir IBM” call itself.
Because buffet revealed now in the U.S. economy transmitter CNBC that it had bought since March IBM shares in the value of 10.7 billion dollar.
Its investment holding Berkshire Hathaway is ascended thereby to one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a portion of 5,5 percent.
Buffet said that IBM had not even known so far something from the commitment.
It praised the management, which had provided even in the economic crisis still for tidy profits.
“You made, said a great job” buffet to the strategy.
IBM sets for quite some time on the lucrative IT-services like the enterprise of datacenters.
The more than 100 years old computer pioneer offers also software and consultation on as well as high performance firm computers.
Buffet had to date rather avoided technology companies.
He says, he invests only in enterprises, whose business he also understands.
Instead accessed buffet for instance on a freight railway, with a lubricant manufacturer or machine-builders.
Its holding Berkshire Hathaway possesses portions of a whole set of large concerns beside approximately 80 own subsidiaries also such as Coca-Cola or the Munich RH, the earlier Munich.
The 81-year old had transferred the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway to the 1960er-Jahren and had developed it with intelligent investments to one of the most valuable enterprises of the world.
Its lifestyle is modest nevertheless.
It is therefore for innumerable investors in all world a cult figure.
Its nearly unfailing sense for the money making brought in the nickname “oracle of Omaha” for it.
After becoming known the buffet investment the IBM share rose in the free market around a percent.
“Big Blue”, how IBM is also called, is at the stock exchange altogether more than 220 billion dollar worth and ranks thereby together with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology enterprises of the world.
At Microsoft, then buffet said, does not want not to enter it however.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is seizable
After uncovering the “Zwickauer cell” Turkish media doubt the German constitutional state.
A newspaper speaks of a “bloody ideology”, which revives now again.
The murders at eight Turkish-born and a Greek little businessman in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-extremist background.
To this message in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany with fear and concern one reacts.
Because for many German Turks thereby a ghost for a long time dead-believed returns: Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993 it gave no more comparable force with right-extremist background against Turks.
The fact that there is hatred of foreigners in Germany nevertheless never stood in question.
The uncovered right-extremist network reveals however extents, whose dimension is still for a long time not foreseeable.
“Does the bloody ideology live?” the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper “Haberturk” headlined.
The newspaper “Sabah” however stressed that one is to have been the perpetrator a V-man of the protection of the constitution, and shows up anxiously that also German authorities could be entangled in the right-wing extremist sump.
Deliberated the Turkish community Germany reacted: It reminded on the weekend with a memorial vigil before the Brandenburger gate of the victims of racist force.
Only two weeks before the Turkish community in Berlin together with German and Turkish politicians in a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish enlisting agreement had thought.
In merry colors with one another had been produced - as a history of success.
Like a slap there the reporting of some Turkish media works: Of “Germany gift to the fiftieth one” the heading of an article in the Turkish Internet platform “Haber X” reads, which reports the background of the series of murders.
Also the Germany edition of the “Hürriyet” cannot be taken it to draw this mental connection.
“It catches on too to stink”, is called the title of the column of Külahci.
It stresses in the fact that humans were murdered, the taxes would have paid and with their work an important contribution for the reconstruction of Germany would have made.
In German-Turkish Internet forums the action of the police and their late search success are discussed extremely critically.
Why it occurred to the German authorities not already much rather to look in right-extremist circles for suspects the authors are surprised.
Some one shows up at least rhetorically ready for drastic means: “One geschlampt here further, then nothing else remains for the migrants as self-defense and the armament”.
“That will be probably best self protection”.
“Of the quality of the clearing-up and suitability of the punishment of the entire network very strongly the internal peace in Germany off”, writes “Selen” hangs.
Which means it, if the internal peace in Germany in danger is, the attacks clarified of Mölln and Solingen in the 90's.
The photo of the fire ruin of Solingen is deeply anchored in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the here living Turk more clearly that there is a seizable threat, and the German that distrust and distance can flow in right force.
The attacks sharpened however of feeling of togetherness on Turkish side.
The errors of the past do not repeat
In the Turkish press above all the failure of the German policy was criticized at that time after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused visiting the survivors from Mölln to.
After the arson attack of Solingen it sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish president, let themselves on the funeral service in Cologne however from his minister of foreign affairs Klaus Kinkel represent - Kinkel enumerated at that time in its speech, how many deliveries carried the local Turks out.
Completely so, as if compute yourself the value of humans after the height of its tax deliveries.
The present reporting of the Turkish media shows once again, how deep since then the distrust of many German Turks is into the local rule of law.
Apart from the efforts of an extensive clearing-up and re-valuation of the right-wing extremist terrorism in Germany it needs this time open words.
The scandal bank of the Zürisee
The most adventurous bank of Europe sits not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS went in the financial crisis nearly bankruptly and slides since then from a crisis into the next.
Now it is to direct a German.
Thus it had not imagined Axel Weber surely.
After his spectacular outlet of the point of the Federal Bank it became known in July that he would begin 2013 an almost just as spectacular new job: President of the Board of Directors of Swiss major bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was pleased publicly, praised Switzerland whether its beauty and UBS whether their again won soundness and let friendly remarks over the future colleagues to fall.
“UBS the turnaround created”.
“I look forward to co-operation with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel”.
But in September already it became clear that everything would come completely differently.
A reseller of UBS in London had gone around all security systems of the bank and approximately 1.7 billion euros had gambled away.
UBS chief executive Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland of praised bankers, had to go.
The President of the Board of Directors of UBS is considered since then likewise as fastened - and all ask: When finally does Axel Weber come?
Already it became admits that Weber may on advise the bank of February 2012.
And it already transfers the board chairmanship in May - not only in the year 2013, how the bank communicated on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber becomes that hard.
It is not banker, rather economics professor and issuing banker and a training period would surely necessarily have had.
With an impact he takes then the responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which proved just now once again that it earns for a long time the title “largest scandal bank of Europe”.
Because is on the one hand enormous UBS - until recently it was the largest trustee of the world - and slides on the other hand for years of a scandal in the next.
Nothing, then seems it, remains once so proud Swiss bank saved.
It began in the financial crisis.
Until 2007 UBS had an excellent call.
The image of the discreet and the solid, in addition, ausgebufften Swiss of trustee it with ambitious goals had combined: It wanted to become also in the investment banking a completely large number.
Thus UBS administered 2007 on the one hand with 1.6 trillion dollar more money of wealthy customers as every other bank of the world.
And on the other hand it than investment bank had advanced into the league of the largest banks of the world.
That made impression.
The former banker and later bank professor of many years in Zurich Hans violonist tell: “Meaning student I at that time always put UBS as sample of a good bank.”
“From today's viewpoint one asks oneself: As I could do only in such a way err?”
It erred enormously.
In the year 2007 for the first time obviously it became that somewhat duly went wrong in UBS.
Center of the year withdrew chief executive Peter Wuffli surprisingly, to who by then as high-more intellectual and just as ingenious banker was considered.
Later one suspected some months, why he had gone.
The investment section of the bank had gambled away itself with Subprime papers and had to copy billions.
Around to shoulders, UBS announced a capital increase at a value of no less than 13 billion franc.
But it actually found to investors, however which, up which some would have turned briefly before to still the nose: opaque Asian state funds from Singapore and Arab state fund, which was so discreet that one did not even experience its name.
But that was only the first impact.
In April 2008 it came more badly.
The bank had to announce new billion-losses, President of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, 2006 still the second-best paid board of directors of Switzerland, withdrew.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: UBS stood in view of its bad investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be saved by the state.
The central bank bought problematic securities, which Swiss Confederation gave six billion franc for an obligation conversion loan from UBS for tens of billions, over which it could become joint owner of the bank.
Whole Switzerland was shaken - it noticed, how dramatic it is for a small country, if it accommodates so large banks.
Finally the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see diagram).
“Again we could not save UBS”, say bank researcher violonist.
The first disaster second followed.
Already few months after capitulated UBS in the tax litigation with America and explained themselves ready to publish the data of wealthy customers who possibly evaded with the help of the bank taxes had.
Besides it tuned a payment of 780 million dollar as repayment of unjustified profits from these business including punishing impact.
Thus UBS admitted more or less openly during the tax evasion to have helped.
At the same time it lost something, since always their capital had been in the competition around rich customers: the nimbus of the discretion.
After the scandal was Swiss the banking secrecy no more the same.
The resignation from chief executive and President of the Board of Directors followed.
And the exodus of customers' money.
Thus the bank had lost its reliability in both central divisions within a few months: in the investment banking by bad speculations and in the administration of an estate by the assistance for tax evasion.
And straight as it again became somewhat calmer, straight than one thought, now UBS it will already again manage, there follows this unfortunate reseller history: Individual reseller gambles away 1.7 billion euros, before the bank notices that somewhat goes wrong.
And it obviously becomes: With the risk management in the investment banking it does not fold obviously yet.
“With the case Adoboli one had to state that risk control changed too little, says” Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at Bankinstitut of the University of Zurich.
Also the finance executive committee of a large German bank is safe itself: “The problem of UBS is that it does not have risk control in the grasp.”
It was to be become been nevertheless exactly the idea of the caution, with which Swiss bankers had long ago begun, guardians of the large fortunes of the world: no all too large risks, for it security for the money - times the world might have broken down also beyond the alpine republic.
The safe deposits of Swiss banks had become the symbol for unshakeable reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The center of UBS in Zurich still fits the plate of native Swiss private bank - it is only a little larger.
The situation is classical already.
The bank has its head office at the inhabitants of Zurich Bahnhofstraße, which leads from the main station directly to the Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-covered summits of Swiss of mountains.
The buildings are splendid here, the shop rents belong to the highest in Europe.
One finds jewellers such as Tiffany's here between Swiss tradition business like the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries here Swiss banks reside: of the central bank over the palace of Credit Suisse up to elitist private banks such as Julius bear.
One enters the receipt hall of UBS by a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are marble-disguised, stand in front of it thick leather armchairs, beside the bank logo a large sign to the “safe-deposit box”.
Knows UBS, what the customer looks for here: Security.
Both Swiss major banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, - or betrayed, displaced this idea of Swiss bank however sometime how the boss of a private bank finds small Swiss.
Its name he would not like to read rather in the newspaper, finally makes he, like all Swiss bankers, also with the two major banks of business.
UBS much too largely, finds he became - particularly in the investment banking, where besides would have spread the fishing rod Saxonia.
Swiss would have to say nothing more there.
“And if nevertheless, they have for a long time the customs that fishing rod Saxonia adapted.”
Actually it was the anglo-saxon investment banking, which changed UBS, it only high profits given and then the debacle: No European Finanzinstitut lost so much money in the Subprime jungle like Swiss major bank.
On 15 October 2008 the disaster became visible.
“On that Wednesday the government coalition of the small seven-million-country decided largest rescue operation in the history of its nation”, writes the author Lukas Hässig in its book “the UBS crash”.
Up to 68 billion franc or approximately 45 billion euros granted the politicians, in order to save the major bank standing before the bankruptcy.
How could it come to it?
If one speaks with Swiss bankers, then they see the problem particularly in the size of UBS.
In June 1998 two of three Swiss major banks united to an enormous company.
Developed a bank, which was too large already with the fusion for small Switzerland - and ever continued to grow.
It helped that the two different forerunner banks of UBS complemented each other: a rich, but overslept bank with the emphasis administration of an estate in Zurich and a poorer, but internationalized already more strongly.
Suddenly the internationalized investment bankers came favorably at much money, with which they could turn an enormous wheel.
Two names are connected with this ascent UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 company head of UBS, and Marcel Ospel, at that time chairmen of the board of directors.
“I always thought, Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team”, say bank researcher Hans violonist.
“Wuffli, which high-intellectual, modest ones, which understands much about models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly human being, that up-worked itself from the bank teachings to right at the top.”
But Ospel relied in the end on Wuffli.
And Wuffli made in the end probably a crucial error: “It thought, its models were the reality”, say violonists.
“That is a tragic case.”
Tragically, perhaps.
Is clear: Over courage came before the case.
Employees of UBS remember clearly the executive personnel meetings, on which company head Wuffli spent the same slogan again and again: Goldman Sachs of the throne push.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank of the earth.
She stated the “League Tables”, the rank lists, which documented the success of the banks of that time.
There wanted UBS, after right at the top.
Some steps were already turned out well it.
In the foreign exchange transaction and in the stock broking it played right at the top.
Management consultants, who were assigned, emphasized however weakness: In the international interest business, in the banker language “Fixed Income”, gives it an enormous distance to the largest banks.
UBS has gaps with American mortgage products.
In order to close this gap, UBS went into an adventure, which cost it nearly the existence.
Hungry after growth, invested both the bank and before their created Hedgefonds into American Subprime plants.
It developed to an enormous machine, which packed securities on American mortgage credits and passed on - in addition, even risks kept.
Also still, when other banks looked for a long time the exit.
“Still in the summer 2007, when the American property market was on fire, UBS bought there”, say bank expert violonist.
So largely the euphoria, so deeply the case.
A manager after the other one had to go, than the attempts failed to clear up more with difficulty than meant.
Posts with UBS became the ejection seat and are today wobbly until.
Who leads the major bank now, has an almost impossible job.
He must find a strategy for a bank, to which all obvious business models got lost.
Bank researcher violonist has already an idea: Conclusion with the investment banking, concentration about the administration of an estate, return to Swiss roots.
Completely so far the bank does not want to go (still).
But the investment banking is to shrink strongly, so much is now already clear.
On coming Thursday the new bank boss Sergio Ermotti of the world wants to present its future strategy.
The 51 years was meant old Italo Swiss actually only as temporary solution, when the bank separated surprisingly from predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile it succeeded: It is to lead permanently the business of UBS, communicated the inhabitants of Zurich bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to go back the investment bank on the conditions middle of the 90's.
It paints 3500 places.
That becomes however is not enough.
A vision needs UBS.
Who is it?
With what does she want to make money?
Those are the questions, which Axel Weber surely now already places itself.
Publicly he says so far only, he with his wife for a start a apartment in Zurich will look for himself.
Next year.

Intelligent crows spread in cities
In many places seed crows are considered as “problem birds”: But from the cities the high-intelligent animals do not let themselves be driven out for a long time any longer, maintain experts.
, like the one they, which would like to get rid others them completely fast: Crows belong for centuries to the townscape, but in many municipalities adjacent resident complaints over dirt and noise of the animals accumulate themselves.
A means is so far not against the “problem birds” in view.
Seed crows are not from the cities any longer out to gotten, said experts with the first crow symposium in the East Frisian empty.
There specialists from the entire federal territory advised over possible ways out.
They look for alternatives in the cities
Conservationists attributed thereby the problems in cities also to the migration from the land of the particularly protected seed crows: The chemistry employment in the agriculture destroys increasingly the traditional habitats.
And the cases of typical breeding trees the life made the hunt, increasing land development heavy for the birds.
Crows stand under nature conservation.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding's pairs among other things in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest among other things in Jever, Diepholz and Achim with Bremen as well as in empty.
There 2005 a disputed project had provided for the massive killing of crows in the district for negative headlines.
Critics had called a catching of the animals in bird traps and killing with clubs particularly brutal.
“Normal expulsion, the Vergrämen, does not bring anything”, the city and landscape designer to Werner Klöver from empty determined.
Nests with water away-squirt or trees fell, have often unwanted consequences, said also the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Wuerttemberg.
“The animals evade, large colonies split up and distribute themselves at other places.”
Vergrämung is conceivable only as exception at hospitals, old people's homes or schools.
“We must live them with them, we get no longer away.”
Without the surrounding countryside let yourself the problem in the cities not solve, meant mayors Wolfgang waiter from empty.
A combination of Vergrämen of the animals from sensitive living areas and loss leaders is conceivable, in order to settle it in other places again.
“Against it the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens for completely different handling the animals recruited info. boards instead of chain saws”: “We can bear a pimple in the face finally best self-confidently.”
Jürgen had in Schleswig-Holstein the Ascheberger crow didactic exhibition along-justified, at which signs inform about the life of the high-intelligent seed crows.
The project is in the meantime already accepted by tourists.
Also to the criticism at the noise of the birds Jürgen's its own opinion had: “There a lot of communication is, those has itself much to say.”
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Seed crows do not only use aids, in order to come to a delicacy, but manufacture as aids their tools even.
Behavior researchers of the University of Cambridge tested recently at four seed crows, as far the intelligence of the birds extends.
In an experiment the birds learned fast that they must bring a stand with stones to the collapse to arrive at a moth larva.
Without they recognized much training purposefully, which size and form a stone must have, in order to let the platform collapse.
In a second attempt the smart crows had to then solve a trickier problem.
In a perpendicularly set up cylinder the researchers a small Eimerchen with a moth larva had placed.
With the bill the birds could not reach their booty.
However the researchers them had put wire malice down.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with whose assistance they fished then the Eimerchen at the grasp from the tube.
This succeeded to three of the four seed crows even at first attempt.

Mass slaughter on a personal level
Sensitive one and magnanimously begins Peter Englunds new book “beauty and fright. A history of the First World War, tells in nineteen fates” with a long list of main persons, who to hearts goes to one.
Here a hint, as one could proceed: Cut this side out carefully and make you them your bookmark.
They will become acquainted with these humans in Englunds of novelful narration very well. And these main persons will function as your GPS, when lighthouse in these few moments, in which them like Englunds of men and women in the fog of the war lost and are robbed of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is besides a new constant secretary of the Swedish academy, which intends the Nobel Prize for literature.
It wrote an unusual book, which he does not describe without foundation as “a work of anti-history”.
It contains only few large names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly Ambassadors, racing reporters or discussions over tactics and equipment.
It is less a book concerning it which happened, explains it, but rather “a book concerning it, like it was”. It acts of “feelings, impressions, experiences and tendencies”.
“Beauty and fright” nearly the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war together, of school girls and botanists up to mountain climbers, physicians, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some these humans become heroes.
Some to prisoners of war, lose limb, are moved or to die.
Each of these lives flickers like the Votivkerzen in a church, some is added, while others expire.
Englunds book deviates from the usual story-books.
It corrected in addition the conception, the First World War was only the devastating position warfare at the Western front.
“Beauty and fright” walk with expert view over other theaters: the alps, the Balkans, the Eastern front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book straw hives, one fall celebrate Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsefliegen are an unsolvable problem.
This is a moving book nearly from the outset.
The war inundates the life of these humans like a natural disaster, how a hurricane Katrina, which smells after Kordit.
Imagine, you are a woman, who is with its children at home, and cannon fire in the distance hears. Do you remain seizing or you the escape?
Who comes at all?
Hardly anyone understands, what is passed or why this war is at all led.
“, Then Englund determines missing facts”, “with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors was bucked up.”
“Beauty and fright” follow individual persons such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard stump, a young German ship sailor.
Their stories were inferred mainly memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life reports can be alarmingly or moving, but they are extremely alive in Englunds of the accumulation of small moments losing in details.
Many of them act of lack and managing.
In the history of a German school girl it tells: “Replacement, everywhere replacement.”
“Spare coffee, wrong aluminum, wrong eraser, paper federations, wood buttons.”
It tells more of the spare meal in Germany.
It describes “meat, which was made from pressed rice and baked in mutton fat (and with a wrong bone from wood one served last), tobacco, which was made from dried roots and dried potato bowls, shoes, those with wood was besohlt.”
There were, like it noted, “837 registered food substitutes, which were permitted in the production of small sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes.”
Some stories act of honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge to ferocity and says about the war: “One feels that despite everything that is, which was intended for men rather as in the armchair to sit, with the evening paper or the best-seller and a cigarette and a whiskey in the hand, and to do in such a way, as if mean such a front civilization and as if would not give it barbarism behind the own strengthened and metal-mounted shirt chest.”
Turned around a British soldier recognizes that he probably die and nobody will worry of it note to take or about it.
“If one of the thought to sacrifice itself distances oneself, would like to think one that this happens, writes before an audience” it.
Instead it is as terribly as “a condemned man, that was on the sly hung.”
Other observations act of old Europe, which falls apart, and over new kinds of the terror.
“The conflict became increasing an economic contest”, writes Englund, “a war between the factories.”
It catches the arrival its, which he calls “a new species in the Bestiarium of the still recent century”: “that word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderers in the tailor-made suit, which slaughters, during it behind a desk sits.”
Humans behave on unexpected way and it give just as frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers, who tried actively to be infected with a prostitute with a sex illness in order the field service to escape.
“The grotesque expression its can be discovered in the trade with Gonokokken pus, because soldiers bought and on their genital organs lubricated themselves, in hope, into the hospital to thus come”, write it.
“Those, which had really despaired, rubbed it into the eyes, which led to the fact that they were blind the rest of their life.”
In this translation from Swedish of Peter Graves Englunds poetry becomes supple and nevertheless unobstrusive and adapts perfectly to its human task.
In dozens of small scenes it catches the way, as the war provoked “in unique way uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hate”.
Humans begin themselves to ask, why their leaders bring them to fighting.
The best books concerning the First World War were usually rather falsified like Paul Fussells “Great were and decaying MEMORY” or novels such as Erich Maria Remarques “in the west nothing new” as extensive story-books.
Englunds volume joins an unconventional fame hall.
Its book has the most devastating end, from which I read ever in a specialized book.
I do not give it.
But it is, as if it would have snapped us with its book this side with the main persons before the nose and with a match would have ignited.
After an early lapse a meticulously planned encroachment
Hundreds of police officers were involved in it, some by them wore employment helmets.
One had decided for the night of Monday on Tuesday, because at this time hardly humans are in the Zucotti park.
The operation was held and only few high-ranking officials were secretly informed. All different believed at first to participate in an exercise.
Chief of the police Raymond W. Kelly was in the middle among them and its presence underlined the fact that the operation of full challenges put.
The incidents of the past weeks like an using of pepper spray against protesters, which offends against the rules of the department and whom an enormous increase in public sympathies for squatters provided, were not allowed themselves any longer to repeat.
And in such a way the police action was accomplished for removing the protesters from the Zuccotti park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these, by observing, how occupations in other cities were handled.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti of edge universe Iceland.
Officials strengthened the so-called chaos training - measures for counterterrorism, to which also fast moving of a large number of police officers counts - around itself on Lower Manhattan to concentrate.
The last training unit took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The instruction to draw into the park came “in last minute”, said someone, which instructed with is familiar, what for a defining as “exercise” spoke.
“The few policemen, who were as far as I know referred, did not know that it concerned, said the Zuccotti park” someone, which would like to remain anonymous.
“The only one, which knew that around the Zuccotti went to park, were the high-ranking officials of the department.”
A reason for the secrecy was a lesson, which had learned the city.
On 14 October officials wanted to vacate the park, fell back then however, when hundreds of protesters came together, after these from these plans had experienced.
Officials of different police units were involved, among other things also in the operation of Tuesday employment command from the whole city - groups of one hundred of mobile officials, who are normally used in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that in the course of the day many persons in the park in and go out, nearly like commuters, so that 1 o'clock is in the night a good time, in order to go in.
“It was appropriate for doing this if the smallest number of persons in the park is, said” it.
Ambulances with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were available before the departure at the Pike slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt drive in the proximity of the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the news, which roared from the loudspeakers, noted first, seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials penetrated in their light blue wind jackets into the park, many protesters snatched up simply their things and left the place.
The police said that until 1:45 clock no tents would be touched to pack in order to give the protesters time, their has got together and property.
Other teams of officials were seen, how they collected themselves in the environment, in order to intervene, should arrests in the park become necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, Sprecher of the chief of the police, said, this had happened at their own security.
But many journalists maintain that one wanted to hold it to observe the police actions in the park. And they said, handling of the officials had been very roughly.
Mr. Browne said that television cars in the Church Street at the west side of the park could have made photos.
When the police toward the west by the large disorders at personal things of the protesters, among other things the suit-case, artificial turf and bags with dresses, moved, you followed employees of the town cleaning, who waived, which had been left.
Some protesters, itself refused going, to outside were dragged. Pictures of it appeared already short time after in the Internet.
A main core of protesters referred position in the proximity of the kitchen range of the camp in the center of the park.
Some established barriers and the police continued its methodical arrests.
About 10 persons in the epicenter of the camp tied themselves together at their arms.
And two persons chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Officials of the disaster control were called, in order to loose-cut it.
As Mr. Kelly said, until approx. 3:30 clock no arrests were accomplished in the park.
The evacuation was final according to statements of the police after 75 minutes.
Mr. Browne said that 142 persons in the park were arrested.
To most arrests it came, as it said, due to “improper behavior and resistance against an arrest”.
The most prominent official locally was Joseph J. Esposito, the boss of the department of, the highest uniformed official of the department.
Likewise there Phil T. Pulaski, department boss of the detectives, was.
Despite his presence Mr. Kelly “did not lead” “the operation”, as Mr. Browne said.
If they should access, a second group of officials at the eastern side, between Liberty and Cedar of the Street waited Broadway.
In the Cortlandt Street, to a road block north the park, and in the Pine Street, a block further south, barricades were established.
It could be observed, how from these locations the police expanded the periphery always far by the Zuccotti park around.
At a place one observed, like several officials, many from them with protection signs, persons after outside floated.
About 28 persons were in the northern periphery.
Some the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5 o'clock south the Pine Street a protester jumped on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators let air out the tire of a police bus.
At a place the quantity threw a piece plywood.
In the end an official and a protester came into the hospital.
Trade union of the responsible persons will submit complaint because of dismissals against the city
The trade union, which represents hundreds of school responsible persons, who lost past month their job, plans, to sue the city on Wednesday since the dismissals are due to their inadequate influence on the schools, which inform poor students, not necessary and discriminating.
The complaint is probably the last possibility, which stands for the trade union, district advice 37, to cancel in its efforts, the dismissals still openly.
_seventy aide, co-ordinator and other employee, which to to bad pay employee the city belong and to 7. October in a chess move its work lose have, which trade union leader6 as political revenge for it describe have, that one last year the city the access on a fund, which the working group maintain, refuse have, with which the budget gap close should.
This accusation by the authorities were categorically rejected.
On a hearing of the town councillor Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, in the past month, said the dismissals part of the budget it had been that one discharged in June.
A member of the town councillor shot back and explained to it that in the budget nothing specifies that employees of the school assistance will dismiss became.
Officials of the town councillor 37 said, they would have and warned the Ministry of Education before a complaint. On Wednesday it will give a press conference, to which submitting the complaint before the supreme Court in Manhattan is formally announced.
The complaint becomes Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the city as accused would drive and eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs count, who are all together colored or Latin American women, as most the aide, that lost their work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman of the Ministry of Justice of the city, said, the complaint would not be appropriate for the city forwards and thus could not their individual statements be commentated.
According to a complaint draft, which is present New York Times, the trade union concentrated on the number of dismissals at the schools in the poor districts of the city, in order to support a complaint because of discrimination. It states that poor schools of more aides would have lost, since they were chronically under-financed.
She states that, while there were no dismissals on Staten Island and only few dismissals in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa 17 school aides in the district 23 in Brownsville, became to have lost Brooklyn, and dismiss 46 aides in the districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
With the statement of the loss of five of eight school aides, that were employed in the public school 36 in Harlem, where live 68 percent of the students in poverty, the complaint means: “This is not to be caught neighborhood of betuchter parents, who can organize donations, around budget shortening.”
P.S.: The budget the 36. District this year was shortened by 3,26 percent. In addition funds were lost, when the city changed its calculation method for the extra financing for each arm school registration.
In addition the trade union deplores that the ladder of the High Schools by the language in a note in err were led, which approved the dismissal of the care co-ordinators.
The note used the English word “excess”, in order to describe the action, even if “excess” (German: transfer) in the USA usually the change of a teacher of the pay roll of a school into a pool of available workers describes, who are paid by the central office.
_“sixty co-ordinator dismiss, not transfer”, mean the draft.
Mission terminated, congress ready, regarding Libya inform themselves
It looks finally in such a way, as if republicans and democrats in Washington would already be to inform themselves regarding the rebellions in Libya.
Everything that was necessary for this, was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the dictator of many years Muammar Gaddafi and the completion of the American interference.
On Thursday the committee for international relations of the senate decides a resolution, which is subordinate to the chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts) together with senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph Ith Lieberman (Connecticut), whereby one praises Libya for the successful rebellion and the US-American troops for its “courage”.
“This resolution honours courageous humans of Libya, who began Kerry with the reconstruction of their country”, said.
“You is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties.”
The language may sound innocently, but so far nothing was simple in the Libya debate.
This summer argued legislators of both parties and the white house about the word choice of a set from resolutions to the approval or disapproval of the role of the US-military in the Libya mission of NATO.
In June Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution, which approved the reduced use of military forces of the USA in Libya.
The law was rejected in the senate by a broad fringe group of both parties and it came to no vote.
But on the same day this law in the senate fell through. In addition the chamber outvoted a resolution for shortening the funds for American operations in Libya.
Thus the US-mission came into a kind legislatives purgatory - with a congress, that was applied enough to criticize Obama's approach in the context of the mission but not furiously enough, in order to finally pull it the ground away under the feet.
Then the indetermination of the congress was overhauled by the events.
Tripoli fell in August under the Libyan rebel and Gaddafi on 20 October was killed.
The NATO mission ended officially on 31 October.
Now the senate is perhaps ready for acting.
The resolution of the committee for international relations “congratulates to humans of Libya to their enormous courage and their unusual perseverance in their self freeing” and “praises the men and women of the US-American military and their coalition partners, who support the military operations for the protection of humans in Libya, for their unusual courage and their professionalism.”
In addition the resolution affirms “the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to the democracy”.
Are the new measures the full support received by the committee for foreign relations or them the legislators will split, how it did the law from June?
The last version encounters Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis) the resistance of the senator, the point republican of the committee.
Peeping acre spokesman said on Monday that he had not seen so far the final version of the new law yet.
According to Capitol it lies at the senate to co-ordinate this week on a constitutional change which demands a balanced household, a Top priority in almost any congress legislative period of the republicans and some democrats.
The measures under the line of the republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change of household or another range, which comes at present to the vote into the senate or congress.
Other legislators tried so far unsuccessfully to bring their changes to the vote although they tried it often enough.
Goodlattes change is only of 68 constitutional changes, which were submitted to this congress and a whole range of topics to cover.
Some are doubly - the same law was submitted both to the congress and the senate - other soft only easily from each other off.
There are alone in the senate at least 15 versions of the change of balance household and further dozen, which “Federal expenses control” became.
Some the laws it are also identical but they give to boast to its clients - in particular beginners with the republicans, their personal record to polish up want - the possibility with the fact that they have such a measure “written”.
The household control law, which was passed in August, requires that both senate and congress co-ordinate on a change of household reconciliation.
In March 58 senators were correct for a not binding resolution, which supports the idea of such a change.
Beyond the household some members want the number of regulations, which can submit members of the congress, limit, during which republican José E wants to waive. Serrano (New York) the delimitation on two terms of office of the president.
The republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) suggested a set of changes, which guarantee among other things the right to a good education and hygiene.
A change, which forbids a marriage under same sex ones, is just like a change, which forbids a burning of flags, a recurring template.
In addition some legislators want to make the abolition possible of Federals law, if two-thirds of the states reject these.
So eagerly, as the members suggest changes, as much faster they move as in the past years.
In 111. Legislators 77 of such changes submitted congress. in 110. Congress 66.
The speed fades compared with that the early 1990er years, in which members suggested regularly more than 150 changes every two years, so the numbers, which the senate library makes available.
But they were not also many more successful than the today's.
The last change to add the actual the 27. -, 1992 were ratified, actually already suggested however 1789 the congress.
“Does not defeat meet, but”, thus GIF Ford in the first television interview after the assassination attempt
Ten months, after an armed man from next distance had shot during an election meeting in Tucson at her, the republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) arose to Monday evening on the national television. It sang alone to the piece of Broadway of “The Sun wants Come out Tomorrow” and said, the desire, to recover was larger than that to return to the congress.
When it arose together with Diane Sawyer in the ABC news “20/20”, she struggled for words and needed assistance when going.
Transmission showed heavy slow recovery of damage, which the ball, which arranged their head divided, which perforated left side of its brain and crossed her head from the front to in the back.
Three months ago it returned surprisingly to the congress, in order to deliver triumphing their voice to the debt brake.
In its first television interview after the assassination attempt in the January, at which six humans were killed and 13 was injured, GIF Ford smiled, laughed and sang - and described its recovery as “with difficulty”.
When Sawyer asked it, how she feels, GIF Ford (41) answered: “Whole well.”
The interview with GIF Ford and her husband, the astronaut Mark of Kelly, was part of an in-hour “20/20” - special, which was noted shortly before the publication of the new book of the married couple: “Gabby: A history over courage and hope.”
The special pursues of GIF Ford recovery since the assassination attempt from 8 January.
In videos, which Kelly had noted in the first weeks, one sees it in the hospital bed, with bald shaved head and a long scarf over the forehead.
It can lift only or two fingers, if their husband encourages her in addition.
Months later sits GIF Ford in a wheelchair, while therapists show it, how them implement simple movements.
Nodding with the head.
Twitching with that lips.
And then, their first words: “Which.”
After few days of GIF Ford whispers a further word: “Toast”. She would like that their breakfast is changed.
Videos, which are played in the ABC show, show that music played an important role in Giffords' recovery: One sees, how the congressional representative as well as the therapists sings to Cyndi Lauper “Girls just Wanna Have Fun” and to Tom Petty “Free Fallin'”.
In the interview with Sawyer it said GIF Ford which spends daily two hours with therapy that she cannot remember to the day of the assassination attempt.
Their husband said that he GIF Ford to 12. March an article of a daily paper had read out on the assassination attempt, when it interrupted and for the first time for six humans asked it, who had been killed during the assassination attempt.
The presumed contactors Jared Lee Loughner serves a sentence in a prison in Missouri and obligatorily medically one treats, while it waits for its negotiation.
“Many humans died”, told GIF Ford Sawyer.
“Hard, hard, hard.”
In the course of the recovery of its wife, then told Kelly Sawyer, it said: “I was met.”
“Thus, I would say: “Gabby, you was not defeated”? ”, Kelly said.
You were only met.
And you will get through that and you will recover and you will more strongly return than ever before.
Troops feel rather compassion as respect
The event was an embankment a Street gala, which collected millions of dollar for homeless veterans in New York town center.
Kid Rock sang a ballad over helplessness, frustration and loss.
On a keyword collected themselves hundred soldiers, sailor, pilot and marine around it.
The quantity in black tuxedoes rose and applauded.
“The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes”, said David Saltzman, which organized the fund-raising campaign in the spring.
A high-ranking military officer on the gala, which among other things by the staff boss and chairman at that time, admiral Mike gauzes was observed, saw the role of the troops differently.
“You were introduced like orphans”, wrote the officer in an email.
I am safe me, the organizers it well meant.
I know that.
But it was not respect, really not. It was compassion.
The glaring contradictory impressions illustrate the heavy relationship between the military and the usually dissociated, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are over-accumulated with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, says service member.
The public behaves increasingly, as if you would do humans in uniform suffering.
“We were not by any means victims”, said brigade general Sean B. MacFarland, who will go to troops in Iraq commanded and soon to Afghanistan.
“The only way of the support that is however apparent is to press us into the role of unfortunate souls.”
The topic is extremely sensitive for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungratefully or in the controversy with the public, which they serve.
Also they recognized that the rage, which struck returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War against was by far worse.
As consequence discussions over compassion take place secretly and private ones between war veterans.
After its two sons returned from fights with that marine, the Colonel warned a.D. Mark of Cancian it before the fact that humans could see their service from two different perspectives outside of the military world.
Some they would regard with a feeling of reverence, since they had traveled rebels defeated and to exotic places.
Others would ask themselves, whether a “furious, violent veteran under the surface” hides itself, said Cancian, which had fought in Iraq and after its return an elevated state post to Washington transferred.
While, then he said, felt to its search for employment he that some the Befrager subtly it inquired whether he was able to withstand right after his return from the fight the pressure of a demanding post in Washington.
“If it about your service speak, must you the negative impressions counter”, explained Cancian its sons.
The missing ease of the military is rooted partially in the missing interest of the Americans in the war.
Achievements on the battleground are picked out only rarely from a country that little experience with the military has and only little benefit in the wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan sees, as praise.
“We as a nation estimate military heroism no longer in such a way, like it still in the Second World War were absolutely usual”, said second lieutenant general David Barno a.D., that US-troops in Afghanistan commanded.
Instead the praise of the politicians and the public concentrates to a large extent on the suffering of a service member.
Troops find acknowledgment for the number of attacks, which bore them, the number of friends, them lost or for the weight of their injuries.
Military places itself to the increasing pressure to hard reaching through with rape
This week an important hearing decides whether 28 women and men are accused of nonintervention with a rape before the military court.
If it should not come to it, hundreds of plaintiffs are available for the next hearing.
Obergefreite Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11. Week more pregnant, than she was raped at night of a soldier colleague.
It was in October 2008 and it returned straight to her barracks to Miramar north of San Diego of the dinner with a friend, when it met a male colleague, who carried one of 12 pack beer with itself.
He asked it whether he might accompany her on a drink into her room.
“My alarm bells went on”, said Lyman.
But the Texanerin wiped its doubts aside.
I thought: “Oh which, it is 19.
It is from Texas”, said it.
“I wished, I would have heard on my gut feeling.”
Few minutes, after they on Lymans room had gone, the man stepped, pressed behind it her downward and raped her, maintains her.
This week, to 18 November, wait Lyman and 27 other present and earlier military employees fearfully on process with historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia, decided in which, whether a complaint, which they raised against the former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, before court becomes certified.
The complaint states that Gates and Rumsfeld did not proceed against the wide-spread rape within the military and under injury the constitutional right of the soldiers.
In February von Susan Burke, a woman barrister from Washington, D.C. submitted, covered the complaint at the beginning of 17 plaintiffs, who rose however in the following months to 28: 25 women and three men, who maintain all that they were raped by soldier colleagues or sexual were abused, to condemn and that the military missed it to determine or to place one appropriately jurisdiction after the alleged attacks to the order.,
Burke says, it pursues the highest military guidance, since the problem begins there.
“The military is hierarchically developed”, says it.
“Who are the individual persons, who are in the position to exterminate the culture retaliation too? The guidance.”
Burke says in addition that she contacted almost 400 further survivors for February, many of them could be part of future complaints.
Their strategy: Instead of all plaintiffs putting their eggs as it were into a basket, they become, if necessary, many further complaints to submit, in order to receive the pressure upright.
The team of the defense for the Ministry of Defense, aforementioned of Federal State lawyer Neil MacBride, placed a request, in order to reject complaint.
The documents of the court, which are present Newsweek, would drive in detail the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be accused by present or former soldiers for injuries, to which it in the armed forces came.
Due to a law of the supreme Court from the year 1950, the government is responsible to the so-called Feres doctrines not for injuries, which add themselves in the active service to soldier present.
“The presumed damage developed during the military service of the plaintiffs”, the document means.
The Ministry of Defense refuses each comment to this history.
The things changed for the 1950er years.
If women are not yet to the service in the fight certified, then the distinction only lies in the name: modern wars have only rarely clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan teams of soldiers play increasingly important roles, particularly in the contact attach with native women in the theaters of war.
The result: between these two wars 150 soldiers, two thirds of them died in fighting.
It is at the time that the military is modernized, says Burke.
And it does not stand in its fight alone there: three further complaints except their are pending.
To the Yale Law School prepares the Veterans' legally services Clinic a complaint against the four most important military academies because of presumed promotion of a misogynic atmosphere.
The non-profit of it independently collect Vietnam of veteran OF America a complaint against the military forwards, in which one concentrates on the diagnosis “personality disorder”, which rape victims received, in order them from the service to dismiss - a usual approach according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the service Women's Action network, a human rights group.
Their group was enough in December complaint against the veteran the administration (dt.: Administration the war veterans), in which she accused it discriminating against practices in their handling performance demands for persons, whom indicated, in the service sexual to have been abused.
Nine laws independently by a mixture from senators and representatives of both parties one submitted to the congress, which offer a set of reference points.
2010 became according to the sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (dt.: Office for prevention and message of sexual abuse) of the Ministry of Defense of 3,158 sexual abuses indicated.
But most abuses are not at all announced and according to the own estimation the Pentagon consider this number to approx. 13.5 percent estimated 19,000 cases, to which it per year comes.
The report, which was published in March, examines also the prosecution rates: 2010 came 20 percent of the seized cases in the military before court, only half so many as in the civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burkes case describe their attacks as only first of a series of traumas.
In Lymans case announced it the presumed rape of the military police less than one hour after the assault.
At this night, then it says, it was 11 times asked, the details of their rape of a whole set of policemen to tell physicians and commanders.
It had a rape set and the blood of their aggressor, which originated from a cut at its arm, in its bed was found.
Six months later, in April 2009, one belonged to Lyman of a judge. During this hearing she was asked for the sex, which she had before the encroachment with her friend.
Six persons stated as character witnesses in the name of the presumed perpetrator, who was finally acquitted.
“I remember still well the day, as which judgment was read out”, says Lyman.
“I thought, which would use a blowing. I ran crying from the court room.”
“You brought me into the psychiatric department and I remember that I, when I came out again said to my commander: That was not its procedure. That was my procedure.”
Lyman was requested to visit a military psychiatrist who diagnosed finally a personality disorder and her for unfit for duty explained.
In January 2010 it became dishonorably to dismiss, so that she does not receive any support.
Whether the complaint, which Lyman and the other plaintiffs submitted advances, is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of the jurisprudence at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, then he marks: “In my opinion they should advance.”
Which stands between them and a pronouncement of judgment, are this doctrines, which are criticized, since it was questioned for the first time.
I am lifelong a critic of the Feres doctrines.
The military limps one decade afterwards, because they do not possess the same incentive and the same deterrence, which bring a liability with itself.
It adds: “The opportunities stand against it… however it are important for it that they try it.”
These things will change only if good humans are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its way, becomes Burke, which woman barrister of the plaintiffs, with its hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases to begin.
“We will continue to fight the military in this regard, come to it to reforms”, say them.
Or to we die, whatever enters as the first.
Walls have eyes: As researcher you on Facebook observe
Before it became the new face of the right-wing extremism in Europe, differently Behring Breivik was only one of many boys, who would send its anti-immigration opinion on-line.
On Monday Breivik, which confessed with a rampage in Norway in July to have committed had with which 77 humans were killed, its first public hearing before court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is not by far alone in the cyberspace: He spent much time up to his attack before his computer and chatted with some the millions of nationalists, who support right-wing extremist groups on sides of social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer researchers wanted to find more out over these humans.
But how one finds it?
That is easy - one must log in only with Facebook.
“We have determined that it was not heavy, to them to come”, say Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a report of the British think-tank DEMO appeared recently about the digital populism in Europe.
Facebooks hiding place of personal data is so encyclopedic, says to Bartlett that the researchers must use simply the advertizing tools of the side, in order its desired demographic data with scientific accuracy accurately to specify - as it marking out for years do.
Bartletts team turned up one half million fan of right-wing extremist groups in all of Europe and visierte it then with ADDs, but instead of itself with new volume or a new diet product to link, the ADDs invited users to a survey, in whom for its educational background, its attitude in relation to force and the estimate of its own future one asked.
Owing to Facebook Bartlett and its colleagues in the position were to ask more than 10,000 supporters of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries - without them only once would have had to leave their office.
“It is a quite new research method”, says Bartlett.
Some the results hardly surprise. On-line promoters of right-wing extremist groups are usually young, male and are annoyed at immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist “those are, those their on-line activism with an off-line activism combine more reasonably, more democratically and less violent than those, those behind its computer screens to sit remain.”
Demo work is only one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands from scientists.
Think-tanks, medical researchers and political scientists use the side, in order to study everything, of health questions up to society trends as in “Likes”, text news and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, who add on the average three contents per day, generate Facebooks “data supernew facts” a research boom, which let the number of scientific work with the name of this side in the title rise in the last five years around almost 800%.
For some researchers the beautiful is not reached by Facebook the fact that one can study humans by this side, those one normally with its clipboard on the road.
“If you in former times tried to ask humans of the British national party were very heavy it to identify it.”
“You had to inform first the party and those them never admission would have granted”, say Bartlett.
“With Facebook that is omitted everything - you go directly to them.”
Others say that the side offers a possibility of recognizing and of solving social health problems.
A current study of Dr. Megan Moreno of the University OF Wisconsin, Madison, and their colleagues found out that students, who discussed their drunken stupor on Facebook are inclined significantly more strongly to the problem drinking than students, who were silent over this topic.
Moreno suggests that of equal standing students, for example apartment adviser, supervise the side and to a student help, if these too many status updates post.
“You cannot solve a problem, if you did not recognize, said it” Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko-author and director/conductor of the Child Health, Behavior and development at the Children's Research of institutes in Seattle of Washington Post.
“We did not find a possibility of identifying endangered children those differently found would be.”
In addition Facebook constantly taps the data of its own population.
The data team of the side provided statistics over the relationship status and Valentine's Day, election turnout at the by-elections 2010 and one national to luck index (whereby primarily information was used, on only the Facebook access has - masters of the digital freedom know for a long time that the side should make their large data treasure trove for others accessible research purposes.)
But the users of Facebook know that the side observes them, whether they want now or not. In order with a friend, who is distant for Scrabble from miles thousands, to play to be able, one permits to yield for the side the own personal data.
But which, if the users of Facebook become part of a survey, from which they something do not even know?
While researchers have strictly specified guidelines, as they collect their data off-lines, on-line everything is permitted.
“I do not believe that many users thought at all about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles”, says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge lab, to a study from the year 2006, into he the public sides of students on Facebook examined.
“Which concerns it, went it only around it and her friends.”
Then there is still the question of methodology.
Even off-line does not give it a warranty that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is to be known not possibly, how many of the information are true in a user profile and in contributions.
“Which one says on Facebook and which one makes outside from Facebook, two completely different things” are, say Selwyn.
Therefore Selwyn thinks despite its years as a technology researcher that a clipboard and a pin are still the best research tools, which everyone can use.
“There is no replacement to go out into the material world and speak with material humans”, says it.
“Social research must worry about the social - and a lot of social life takes place still off-lines.”
“Cold and inhumanly”: Differently Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court
Differently Behring Breivik, which man, who were killed confessed two rampages, with which in this summer in Norway 77 humans, has himself in its first appearance before a public court in Oslo than “resistance " a fighter described.
“I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight of Norway”, said he before a court room with more than 500 humans.
“I raise objection against the court, since you received your mandate from organizations, the hate ideologies support and because thereby the multiculturalism is supported.”
“I recognize the laws on, but I do not admit myself guiltily.”
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monolog, since he did not want to give “Breivik the possibility of using this hearing as a platform on which it its opinions express can.”
For the same reason it refused permission to Breivik, which along-brought a speech written first, for contacting in the end the hearing the members of its victims.
In addition Nesheim did not arrange that the police keeps Breivik for 12 further weeks in custody, it four weeks an entrance to the media has. He said that the authorities will control all visits and the entire correspondence exactly over eight weeks.
Approximately 30 survivors and member of the victims participated in the hearing.
Some came in hope to be able to see Breivik into the eyes others wanted the confirmation that it remains behind lock and bolt.
All participated with the goal that everything come down to locking away.
“I thought, he work coldly and inhumanly”, told a survivor of Utoya the Norwegian transmitter NRK.
“It was unpleasant, but for me it continues to go a piece, after I saw and heard the suspect.”
Breivik carried a dark suit and a blue tie and worked during the entire hearing calmly and professionally. He looked journalists and survivors into the eyes, when he entered and again left the building.
Despite Breiviks bizarre reference, it would be part larger “resistance " of a movement, came the judge at the conclusion that it was and said not mentally ill that there would be no proof for it that it would have had accomplices.
It may please to unite that the attacks from 22 July the work of individual extremist was apparent and not a group the radical.
But that facilitates automatically the grief and the confusion, which feel a whole nation still?
“I wished, he would look like a monster, but he does not”, said the member of a victim.
“It would be so much easier, if it did it.”
7 lessons of the interview with the deceased Steve Jobs, who was shown this week in a theater
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October compared some it with Henry Ford and emphasized thereby the technology genius as a large modern inventor.
Which perhaps most informative Apple fans find however in recently the again discovered job interview, which was entstaubt this week before special film demonstrations on the important markets, is, as very this creative head understood business processes and operational sequences.
It was surely designers, dreamers and even appointed hippie, but it was also with the utmost care organizer, who tinkered eagerly at charts - a man, who believed that many managing directors at “an illness of thinking” suffer, “that a really great idea 90 percent of the work constitutes… [however] there is enormous quantity of handicraft art between a great idea and a great product.”
1995 developed Bob Cringely the TV-series “Triumph of the specialized idiots” over the departure the personnel of the computer. And it sat together longer than one hour with jobs, in which they led one of the rare, detailed discussions.
At this time as 10 years, since then jobs from Apple had passed pushed were. And it worked already hard on its new computer enterprise NEXT one, and looked forward to the broad acceptance of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringleys interview was used in specialized idiots, it says that the master copies of the interview were missing in the case of the supply.
Only after jobs death one discovered a complete VHS copy in the garage of the director.
This easily revised footage forms the basis for the 68minütigen film “Steve Jobs: The lost interview”, which comes this Wednesday and Thursday into the land Mark theaters.
For someone, which admits for it is that it abhors detailed interviews, appears jobs here surprisingly eagerly in the explanation of its technological philosophies and business strategies.
And unbelievably thoughtfully.
In the course of the interview it comes four times to longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds reflecting, in which jobs clearly weighs its thoughts and is endeavored around accuracy.
It gives also moments, in which Jobs' perfectionism comes to day, if he reacts apparently impatiently to Cringelys questions and pushes him, faster with topics or Nebenhandlungen of greater importance to deal.
The era ago the lost interview appears taken up by Pixar, iPod or iPhone somehow terribly farsightedly, if evaluates jobs, which other enterprises of its opinion make correct or wrong and represent its own vision the future of the computer.
It is a thing to read posthumous appreciations of the career Jobs'. But is somewhat completely differently, original and inspiring jobs as the eager dreamer to see here, who is on the leap to the admirability.
It has a vision, as the things could be and be should.
Briefly after it had implemented this everything here, he set off and made it.
A fast view of seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
As it learned to lead, an enterprise:
“During the whole years in the business I always ask: “Why you do things?”. And the answer, which you always get, is: “Oh, then is made simple it.”
Nobody knows, why it does, what he does. Nobody in the business thinks really in detail about things.
I determined that.
Continues to implement jobs its efforts to rationalize record keeping at Apple.
Were astonished, like costs noted - mostly one began with “standard costs”, which were numbered on bare assumption and which were then adapted with “deviation” - developed it an automated factory, which guaranteed that the business costs in the smallest could be determined.
As the Pope was spoofed:
Equipment tells jobs of the “Blue box”, which it built with Steve Wozniak, with which one could to creep in into the telephone company and lead long-distance calls in vain.
Over the equipment one wrote already much, but is job enthusiasm, when it describes the Blue box as an act of the self seizing, contagiously.
It describes, how Wozniak and it would test the box, by using a chargeable telephone, a call active and from an AT&amp\;T network into another to be then connected, while they grind through so many satellites as possible.
“We sent a half dozen to things times around the globe and if one roared in the telephone, it came one minute later in the telephone again next door out”, tells jobs giggling.
“We were young and we learned that we ourselves can construct somewhat, the trillions of dollar at infrastructure for the whole world to check can.”
We both, we did not know much, but we could not build this small thing, which can control a gigantic thing, that were an unbelievable lesson and I believed that it would give Apple without them.
Jobs continues to tell of glorious caper, which almost took from Wozniak and he off, when they in the middle called and with the Pope to speak wanted box in Vatican at the night via Blue, while they could do so well it Henry Kissinger copied.
Since several members of the catholic hierarchy were called for in the middle at the night, in order to speak with the American diplomat, the two had to burst into laughter, before the Pope came to the telephone.
As it into the technology fell in love (and Bill Hewlett called unprepared):
At the age of 12 years, when he looked for spare parts, in order to build a frequency counter, it looked for Bill Hewlett in the directory and called it.
Shortly after their 20-minute telephone call jobs received a part-time job for the summer with Hewlett-Packard.
“That had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only enterprise, which I had seen at the age and it formed my opinions over it, which an enterprise was and like well it treated its employees.”
Jobs of one became later the HP employee, who visited the research labs of the enterprise in Palo Alto, where he “the first desktop computer, which was ever manufactured” saw.
He was as largely as a suit-case, had a small screen with brown Cher tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb upward with HP as teenager and on this machine would hang and programs for her would write.
As one innovations improves:
Several times in the interview jobs speak about how one invents spontaneously new products.
Already early in its career, when he inserted some plates, it was asked by a customer to assemble the whole computer.
He worked with a time fixed for payment of only 30 days and had to think the assembly and the distribution out of the finished devices both.
Later at Apple it remembers the problems, which he had with the development of a computer mouse:
“I remember piercing arguments… They cried me on that it would take five years [over a mouse would cost to build, the $ 300] and I rose, went out and found a manufacturer.”
Ninety days later we had a mouse, we could let which build for $ 15. That was unbelievably reliable.
Over large enterprises, which diminish:
For a long time before it let Apple re+-live, jobs saw the ways, on which so many industrial giants with their visions came in tripping and which lost control of their shares, ahead.
“Legends we, you work at IBM or Xerox, therefore you make a better copier or printer, well and?”
They possess the share monopoly, therefore the enterprise is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successfully, thus [there is such humans], which the enterprises to finally lead and the product, with which the people from decision making are pushed.
The product genius, who led too this monopolistic position, is not exterminated by the people, a concept to have concerning good products vs. bad products, - handicraft art necessarily.
The happened at Xerox…
Xerox could have possessed the whole computer industry.
One could have been ten times more largely have been, the Microsoft of the 1990er years could…
They got the defeat of the victory.
Over innovation as art form:
“It lies a lot of handicraft art between a great idea and a great product… if one this great idea developed, changes it and grows themselves.”
One learns much over its intricacies.
One must make votes, certain things, which one cannot do, but electrons, glass, robot, factories.
One must note 5000 things, bring these concepts, and her together all…
Finally it come down to the taste, it runs out itself on it that one tries, with best things, which humans created, apart set and then tried to bring these things together to which one makes.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steals.
We are always schamlos in stealing great ideas.
Part its that made Macintosh great, was that the people, which work there were musician, poet, artist, zoologist, historians, who are coincidentally the best computer scientists of the world.
If it would not have been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things within other ranges.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of the health laws, when court accepts case
On the day, in which the supreme Court behind locked doors participated met, in order to discuss the politically dividing question, whether one will listen to a contestation of the health laws of president Obama, two its judge, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, in a Dinner, which was gesponsort by the chancellery that will represent the case before court.
The incident took place past Thursday, when all nine judges met to a meeting, in order over the petitions for examination to advise.
One of the too treated cases was a complaint, which 26 states raised against the extensive reform of the health service, which past year by the congress were decided, a law, which became with the conservative activists everywhere in the USA the key word.
The judges agreed the hearing. Actually in March 5 1/2-hour basic discussion expected, which will probably set their result probably the presidency fight in motion 2012, will be that at the time, on which the judicial ruling is announced, in the full course.
The lawyer, who stands before court and that the law is to be tilted, probably Paul Clement will maintain will be, once prosecutor general under the government of George W. Bush.
Clements chancellery, Bancroft PLLC, was one that nearly two dozen of enterprises, which supported the annual Dinner of the Föderalisti society, an old-established group, which dedicates itself to the defense of conservative right principles.
Another enterprise, which sponsorte the Dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations, national the Federation OF Independent Businesses, which contest the law.
A further sponsor was the pharmacy giant Pfizer Inc., which is enormously involved financially in the result of the process.
The Dinner took place few hours, after the court had advised over the case, in one Washington hotel.
Service had among other things Mitch McConnell, the party head of the republicans in the senate and an explained opponent of the health reform
The guests of the Dinners? Scalia and Thomas.
That is not anything new: The two judges visit meetings of the Föderalisti society for years.
And does not offend against moral rules.
Indeed judge of the code of conduct frees itself, which regulates the actions of the low Federal High Court Judges.
If they would be it, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the code, which means the following: “A judge can participate in Benefizveranstaltungen of law details and other organizations, whereby the judge may not be a spokesman, honor guest or according to program no guest such meetings.”
Nevertheless the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas were sufficient to two of the chancelleries standing with the case in connection as well as to an enterprise with a substantial financial interest in this, in order to alarm Moral-und-Regierungsaktivisten.
“This astonishing break with moral and the contrast to the code lie, the court punishes the complaints of some judges adheres to the same rules, which are valid for Bob Edgar, Präsident of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the USA for all other Federal High Court Judges”, said.
“The judges won and dinnierten during a Benefiziveranstaltung with attorneys with floating procedures at the court.”
Their occurrence and their support of a fund-raising campaign for this meeting undermine any requirement on impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics, who say, it affair of court too easily with groups, which are guided by the agenda, like for example the Föderalisti society, would mix.
And the Thomas' wife Ginni is well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand it states the conservative that it is not a judge Elena Kagan, which has a moral problem Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was prosecutor general under the Obama government, when the first law contestations came in first instance before court.
Their critics pushed Kagan to withdraw itself from the hearing of the case because of prepossession since them were too much in the defense of the law committed, in order to be impartial.
Kagan does not make institutes to do this.
Boeing draws order for record of to 18 trillion dollar ashore
Airline of emirates orders 50 two-usual airplanes of the type Boeing 777 with an option on 20 further airplanes.
In addition Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliner at Oman Air, a business in the value of to more than 1 trillion dollar.
It is really a rare message that an enterprise gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a large business, if the enterprise of the aircraft manufacturers Boeing Co. is and the list price for these 50 airplanes altogether with a record sum of 18 trillion dollar lies.
The client of Boeing is just as unusual: the middle east, an increasing gold mine of future airplane orders.
In a prognosis, which was published on Monday, the Chicagoer estimates enterprises that airlines from the middle east in the coming 20 years 2,520 airplanes in the value of 450 trillion dollar needs.
Boeing announced on the weekend its largest order of all times for commercial airplanes, based on the value of the order: 50 two-usual Boeing 777 jets.
The order for hammer came from the airline of emirate from Dubai.
In addition the airline has, then Boeing announced it to 2011 on the Dubai Air Show, an option on the purchase of 20 further airplanes, which the entire list price to 26 trillion dollar lets rise.
On Monday ordered then according to Boeing Oman Air six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which improves the fuel consumption and the comfort of the passengers enormously.
The list price for six of these airplanes is with more than 1 trillion dollar.
“That is absolutely positive for Boeing”, said Neal Dihora, stock exchange specialist of Morningstar.
“The quality of these special customers is very high.”
Many airlines of the middle east are in the possession that oil of producing countries.
Thus they do not only have the money, in order to pay the airplanes. Rather is a rise of the oil prices, which usually harms the airlines, since this is one of their largest matters of expense, not so harmful, since the country at a higher oil price earns.
That is important, since they tend less than other airlines to cancellation or shift airplane orders, if the oil prices rise, said to Dihora.
“You have a natural security”, said it.
The order of emirate affirms of Boeing leading position on the market for large-capacity aircraft and helps to hold the airbus competitor SAS in chess which attacks the supremacy with the A350.
Of Boeing victory on the Air Show comes four months after airbus announced, one the introduction of the largest A350 would shift, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
One shifted the introduction, in order to win more confidence, after the customers had demanded a higher payload and range.
The Boeing shares rose around 1,5% to $ 67,94.
Sister Mexican president loses apparently choice in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon states, whom drug dealers opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in running around the governor post supported.
The sister of president Felipe Calderon apparently lost her application around the office of the governor von Muchoacan during the violent state elections. It stated on Monday, drug dealer a running in favor of one of their opponents would have affected.
After the provisional results Fausto Vallejo of the institutional party of the revolution, won the PRI, a running around the governor post in the western state.
“The intervention of the organized crime during entire choice elections and on the day of yesterday is particularly alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country”, Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview said one day after the choice on Sunday.
“You threatened our candidates, our employees in the surveys… you polling booths occupied, road blockades developed… and humans assigned to be correct [for the PRI].”
The PRI governed seven decades in Mexico, until they lost the presidency in the year 2000.
But they strive for a return and the victory in Michoacan are an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have struck Claderon only scarcely, which had still led in the surveys before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of the conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN of their brother, refused, recognizing Vallejo as winners.
Silvano Aureole, the candidate of the left democratic revolution party PRD, at present still acting governor, came at place three, a heavy defeat for the split and luckless left guidance for the presidential election 2012.
Also Aureole refused recognizing the provisional results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies connections to drug dealers and pushes the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan was controlled long time by drug trusts, which in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines to have specialized.
It is the homeland of president Calderon and it Michoacan chose to start in December 2006 a militarily led offensive against drug dealers.
The force persists still.
A PAN mayor was killed one week before the choice during an election meeting for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates of fear of the local elections stepped out.
For the PRI a victory the party, no matter, strengthens as distastefully the elections in Michoacan also appear.
The man, who will probably represent the PRI in running around the presidential office, is Enrique Pena Nieto, which congratulated and said to Vallejo from Washington: “I think that this victory lets us look courageously in the next year.”
ADB pushes Asia on assistance in the rescue of the Eurozone
The development bank of Asia (Asian development bank, ADB) calls India and China to support the rescue of the Eurozone in its heavy debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downtrend, which will brake the growth of the economy of Asia.
Rajat gnaw, administrative manager of the ADB with seat in Manila, said that the two fastest increasing economic nations of the world must do “all” in your power, in order to accelerate the recovery of the currency block either by the international currency fund or by direct mutual agreements.
It warned of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), which “dispassionately” on the difficulties in Europe looks, and said that the financial support helps to prevent the European guidance and European resources by Asia a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We sit all in the same boat.”
“Thus everyone is helpful, which can help Europe from this crisis”, said it Financial Times in an interview at the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be to some degree protected, but it is not immune.”
“If China and India thus to help can, then with all means.”
Of Europe monetary union turned out in the past months into a heavy debt crisis.
In the past days of Italy rose interest costs dangerously and the prime ministers both from Italy and from Greece withdrew.
The arising heavy debt crisis in Europe stirs fears up the fact that the global economy could fall into the recession and led to calls, prominent developing countries would have itself to put together, in order to support the Eurozone.
Mr. gnawing forecast that each support of Asia is canalized by the IMF, said however that mutual agreements - like for example the purchase of bonds of the European Union-Rettungsfonds, which European financial stabilization facility (EFSF) - which to European partners in Asia larger bargaining power offers.
Anand Sharma, which Indian Ministers of Trade, said that “India everything will do, what in its power stands”, in order to help the Eurozone, since the own economy suffers now from the sinking exports and draining foreign capital river.
“Nobody wants that the Eurozone remains, said further unstable and turbulent” it.
“We stand before large challenges and we must a high growth level receive.”
“It is not an option, it is an order, because where otherwise we find work for our millions of young men and women.”
Others argue that itself developing managing such as India have no reason to help the rich Europeans if they stand before large economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at US-American Brown University, said that it would be politically very heavy to sell 1.2 trillion humans in India assistance for Europe of those more than 800 million of 2 dollar or still less on the day alive.
“They will find out sometime that the Greeks with 50 go into pension and holidays at the beach to spend. Then one has a problem”, said he.
Lee Howell, administrative manager of the world economy forum, asked similarly, why of India should be used reserves, in order in Greece the numerous and well paid employees in the public service to kept, with jobs in bad accompanied, facilities bringing in losses as for instance the railway.
Mr. gnawing said that the crises in the Eurozone will have “significant domino effects” on all of Asia.
The prognosis of the ADB with an economic growth around 7,5 percent in Asia for the years 2011/droht now “the risk of the gradation” due to the threatening danger from Europe.
He said, vulnerable threshold markets would have “crisis plans” to provide, in order to protect itself for a downtrend and significant capital drift of their Wortschaften.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon before possible cut in the defense nature
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta heated the congress on Monday, when he warned of the fact that automatic budget shortening would weaken national security unnoticed. With it released a financial nuclear chain reaction of the halls of the Pentagon up to the theaters in Afghanistan and the civilian assembly-lines.
The Pentagon already thinks shortening out at a value of 450 trillion dollar in the course of the coming decade, is afraid now however that further shortening become more necessary around 600 trillion dollar or, if the congress cannot obtain a conclusion in the expenditures.
“The effects of these shortening would be devastating for the Ministry”, wrote Panetta in a letter to the republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said, a failure of the congress in obtaining a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, to 23% general shortening as well as a stop of numerous new projects would lead.
“Such a high shortening, accomplished in such thoughtless way, would make most of our ship and building projects impracticable - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and other modernization efforts seriously harm”, wrote Panetta the senators.
“In addition we would be compelling to separate us involuntarily from a majority of our civilian personnel and, since the reduction would so fast be converted, would have we at security of bordering probability civilians to also give time off to be able to reach around the goal.”
“These changes would destroy the faith of those, damage those our military upright receive and our alert stand-by seriously.”
The shortening became finally the combat troops to meet”, said Panetta.
“During the wartime contingents in the anti-terror fight by the seizure are not directly concerned, the serious interference into the basic budget the war efforts unfavorably would affect”, warned Panetta.
“Personnel attitudes to be shortened, which to delays in the attitudes and the supervision of attitude, which support the war, would lead.”
“The salaries of the personnel were shortened, which leads to late payments at wartime resellers and who would be legal like also political support disturbed.”
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details concerning the potential influence of the automatic shortening on the Ministry of Defense.
“The consequences of a seizure of the Ministry of Defense would introduce a fast fall of the United States as prominent military power of the world.”
“We are vehement against this Draconian action”, said the senators in a common explanation on Monday afternoon, when they published Panettas letter.
“This is a result, with which we cannot live, and it surely is none that one would thrust us upon should.”
“The seizure is a threat of the national safety interests united and their entering should not be permitted.”
Whether Panettas letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase the pressure to a compromise in the budget or will strengthen demands to exclude the Pentagon from shortening remains awaiting.
Panetta expressed increasingly bluntly the possible shortening, although he could collect many years experiences with the budget in the congress and in the white house, before he came to the point of the Pentagon, and white that he stands in relation to heavy decisions.
At a press conference in the past week the Secretary of Defense painted a dark picture, which could be approaching - a military with bowl, but without core.
“It is a ship without sailors.”
“It is a brigade without ammunition.”
“It is a Air Force squadron without sufficiently trained pilots.”
“It is a paper tiger, an army of the barracks to fulfill buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers, who are able, the mission”, said Panetta in its opening speech in the Pentagon.
“An armed force, which it lacks moral and alert stand-by and which are not able, is it with potential opponents to be taken up.”
“You leaves one become actually furious.”
In an appendix to its letters at McCain and Graham Panetta stated new details, how creates reductions “significant operational risks: Delays in crisis periods, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions our world-wide employment and of intervention ability, which leads to an unacceptable risk in future war operations.”
And Panetta said that some the largest defense projects of the cancellation to the victim could fall, including those, which were already tested and in the early planning phase to already be.
To this list belongs also the combat flier F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber aircraft, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new suffer-orally Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle, which Army and navy need, in order to replace the Humvee.
If one would stop the further development and the tests of the F35, this would save in the next 10 years up to 80 trillion dollar, but the proponents to say that it is an important next step for armament, so that possible dangers can be avoided by China and other opponents.
As one a lie unmasks
A view of the current headlines shows, how precariously and far deception and lie spread in the daily life are.
The presidential candidate of the republicans, Herman Cain, is busy to become the accusations of sexual annoyance on the part of several women gentleman. Both sides accuse themselves mutually of the lie.
The line of doss State the perjury one accuses of, since one held back allegedly reports, after which a retired football coach boy sexual abused.
Heard in the past week over an open microphone, when the French president Nikolas Sarkozy the American president opposite Barack Obama stated, the Israeli prime ministers Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
The New Yorker congressional representative and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made themselves the fool, when he brought denials in circulation, which were disproved very fast by irrefutable proofs.
The earlier presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of the offenses in the campaign financing, which stands in connection with the cover-up of a except-conjugal affair.
And then naturally nobody, which experienced it, forgets the medium circus, president Bill Clinton released, when it lied during its second term of office in the oval Office concerning its sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories over cheating at school and with college examinations are far common.
There were incidents, with which teachers gave their student the test answers, so that they stood there with their achievement examinations well.
Mentors, who should teach the opposite, dispatch a message that lies and cheating okay are.
How do we experience much deception?
As studies occupy, we lie each day between 10 and 200 times.
Many these lies are considered however as emergency lies.
Another study shows that mutually three times deceive themselves foreigner during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Lies to recognize and/or “lies uncover” is one, which are important for each humans to learn, and this both from personal as well as for vocational reasons.
Far from a parlor game like for example charades, in which it is the goal, “have you!” to call, unmasking a deception a respectable knowledge range, which is based on scientific data, is, which were collected in the course of the past of six decades at respected universities, which accomplished extensive research projects, in particular within the ranges psychology and physiology.
A result of the research is that most old myths were unmasked over lying.
Lies look one into the eyes.
They stutter, stammer, blush and wriggle not always.
From this one may not close however that these liars are to uncover with difficulty and be unmasked.
An experienced Lügenenttarner can penetrate to the truth, by he something over the structure of the statement, which purifies facial expressions, over question and timing learns.
I spent several years to examine the scientific results of the comprehensive and constantly growing range of unmasking. And it is clear that unmasking a deception is a modern ability, which is to be learned easily and us in getting along in our complex world helps particularly, if adjusting or the questioning from persons or negotiations or administration belongs to the own vocational responsibilities.
Good liars are very good to estimate other humans to wake whose interest and to control the own emotions. And they feel intuitively, how they are noticed by others.
Owing to the research know we, which extroverted humans lie more frequently than introverted humans that men more frequently “oriented” lies serve than women, their lies more “at others orient themselves” - usually they want to protect thereby the feelings of others - that married humans lie their partners less frequently than unmarried humans (however the lies, which tell them are usually “fat lies”).
We know also that, if a person were unmasked as an evil perpetrator other itself less guiltily feels this person to have lain.
How does one recognize whether someone lies?
First, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
One calls that “Baselining”, the starting position.
It gives a point of reference for later evaluating of changes.
Observe the attitude, the laughter, the voting quality of their test subject.
They should know better, when someone normally constantly patters with the foot, so that they do not accuse it of to injustice, if it patters during a meeting with the foot.
Then you pay attention to accumulations of remarkable verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Regard these accumulations as alarm bells, which shrill, not as proof of a unmasking.
Perhaps humans, who are deceptive, solidify, if they try to remember their history. Perhaps their feet point toward door or them lean toward exit, change their position to significant way or show a “relaxation after the attitude discussion”, this deep, relaxing breathing out and the change in the attitude, if all hard questions past are.
Asking ones often falsely signal that an attitude discussion past is to only hold in order after this relaxation after the attitude discussion look out.
Pay attention in addition to the language of your test subject.
The slip of Scott Peterson is famous, when it used the past form, when it stated, its killed wife is still alive and a national search for it released.
Deceptive persons can use also a dissociating language: “I did not have sexual relationship with this woman… Measure Lewinsky” or if one repeats a tricky question in the entire one.
The most frequent verbal signs are subtle.
Some humans use “qualifying language”, if they answer a tricky question: “Now admits… over to you the truth to say… so far me is… after best knowledge and certain.”
Thereby the answer becomes rather perceptive as material, whereby often the alarm bells shrill.
There is no magic charm for unmasking lies, but one can learn abilities, owing to which a unmasking is possible.
Owing to these abilities can become rarer each the victim of cheats, both in the private and in the working life.
Disputed plan of an oil pipeline is revised after endangerment by delayed US-approval
Few days, after the Obama government threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline of Canada into the gulf from Mexico to with which one annoyed the trade unions and calmed environmentalists down at the same time, is the pipeline building enterprises endeavored to plan the project again so that one can return again to normality.
TransCanada said evening on Monday that one will reroute the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The enterprise announced the decision at a press conference in parliament building of Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the enterprise was further confident, which is finally approved the pipeline although with another process.
For this it came to an announcement of the State Department in the past week, after which one would postpone one a decision concerning a federal permission for the project, until the new possible process was examined, that the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska as well as the Ogallala Aquifer, a large underwater supply, avoids.
“This is a genuine step ahead”, said the republican Lee Terry, a republican from Nebraska, opposite Fox News.
The new environmental examination, which arranged the State Department, may postpone a decision to 2013, after the elections in the coming year, even if an official denial that politicians were involved into the decision.
Obama explained past week in a written explanation the fact that the decision was a task of the State Department and assured its support.
The 1700-Meilen-Pipeline became Canada with the gulf of Mexico to connect.
It would pump 700,000 barrels oil per day from the province Alberta to the refineries to Texas.
For this the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate it, but job markets love her, because them estimate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the legislators of Nebraska, that are against the plan, weigh the laws, in order to force a break with the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study to the influence on the environment of the State Department found out that the project would have only little influence on the environment, but the source of the energy industry meant that requested main examiners of the Ministry a separate probe of the examination procedure, on two questions concentrates.
One is whether a lobbyist, which was adjusted by TransCanada is Paul Elliott, who was a 2008 adviser of Hillary Clinton in a clash of interests.
The other one is whether an enterprise, which was assigned to accomplish the original study was an inadequate choice, since it stands with TransCanada in connection.
Patti LaBelle accused, since they forced allegedly an infant from fear to vomit
A New Yorker family states that the disco diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of their Manhattaner of building would have gotten a raving madness accumulation, which would have shifted its small daughter in such a way in fear that she handed herself over before fear.
The tirade of the “lady Marmalade” - singer made the 18 for months such fear that she suffers from “changes of personality, sleep disturbance” and “increased fear of strangers”, old Genevieve Monk said her family before the supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on 10 November of year, when the stagehand Kevin Monk, passed, and Genevieve to a family trip wanted to break his wife open rose Anna, a child gardener.
While Kevin Monk got the car, rose Anna Monk with the luggage and Genevieve went on the arm into the lobby in her building at the Riverside boulevard.
Rose Anna Monk said, in the proximity of the door and had set off her daughter had stopped it for one moment.
“Someone appeared behind me and said: “Knowledge it, which does its daughter straight?” I said, “yes”, and went taking around it the arm”, said her.
LaBelle admonished the pregnant woman furiously.
“You said in an aggressive tone: “You should set your daughter off not in the proximity of the door”, said rose Anna Monk.
“I said it: “It does not interest me, which you say or think”.”
It became furious and began to grumble - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud…
It had a bottle water in the hand and began to tilt water from the bottle on me.
She said, Genevieve would have become hysterically.
“I said to this woman: “Seeing it, what you made, said with my daughter” the mother of the child.
LaBelle fell itself on the mother, that carried still Genevieve on the arm, and had to be held back by its company and be pulled to a waiting car, said rose Anna Monk.
The baby cried so much that it had to hand itself over, said it.
Later the family LaBelle asked in writing for an apology, however no answer received.
LaBelles attorney and representative did not answer to calls, in which for a statement one asked.
The complaint is expressed in not determined a payment of damages, but the lawyer of the family, a more near, SAM Davis, said that he a fee do not charge for and the family flat, which will donate money, which gets it, the child cancer assistance.
“We want that Patti LaBelle takes, said the responsibility for her behavior” Davis.
“This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, particularly, if it is put to a child gardener opposite on the day, the one 18 months old baby on the arm carries.”
Climatic adversities braked the economy
In the first year, in which Mario López Valdez at the government is, unemployment and the moonlighting rose in Sinaloa, while the foreign investments decreased and the economy stagnated.
2011 will remain in the economic history Sinaloas in memory. It is the first year, on which Mario López Valdez, which calls itself as the initiator of the change and stirred large hopes up concerning the economic growth, at the government is. However due to the climatic adversities the speech cannot be from growth, but on the contrary the most important economic indicators worsened.
The low temperatures in February did not only cause losses in million height in the agriculture, but put beyond that for the growth of the political economy close borders and caused in the first quarter a general decrease of the economic activity by 3,6 percent of these decrease mainly on the historical dismantling of the agricultural development by 31,16 percent, which braking further sectors of the economy affected.
In accordance with a report on the effects of the Frosts, published from the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (dt. Mexican advice for lasting agricultural development), 582,000 hectares of agriculturally used estates were damaged, about which 78.03 percent perfectly and the remaining 21.07 percent were partly destroyed. Affected were above all the vegetable, corn and cultivation of chickpea.
The decrease of the economic activity until November let unemployment rise in the Mexican state continuously. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a fast rise of unemployment in the first quarter, because from January to March 55,053 inhabitants Sinaloas did not have occupation, which corresponds to 4.53 percent of the population of acquisition. In the second quarter the unemployment rate rose to 5,28 percent and from July to Septembers to 6,19 percent, which entails 74,000 unemployed persons in Sinaloa. Those are 18,969 persons more than in the first quarter.
Smaller liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year decreases to several factors. The economist Gerardo López Cervantes, dean of the faculty for economic and social sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), commentated, the policy of the public institutions explains indirectly increasing unemployment.
“Which we at present observe, are a rise of unemployment, to which with several factors has to do. Among other things with liquidity losses on the market due to the cuts in support by the legislation, which was adopted for the fight of the money laundering in the congress, because for those, which forbid-proves dollar accumulates, it is not easy to let these work for itself it to invest or for otherwise something not use”, explained it.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that also a demographic factor is inherent in to increasing unemployment.
“The number of persons, who leave the country on search for work abroad, in particular in the United States, decreased. That is to be due on the one hand to the entry problems and on the other hand, because it is difficult also there work to find. These people remain looking for here and here work, which lets unemployment rise”, means it.
Moonlighting
The analysis of the job market in Sinaloa is still more serious, if one considers the high portion of the moonlighting. This covers 60.38 percent in the country of the persons employed, who work, without depositing into the cashes of the social security in accordance with INEGI.
To unemployment and moonlighting the low wages, the lowest come into all of Mexico, in accordance with the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican institute for social security) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (government authority for work and social welfare service into Mexico).
The average monthly income of the employees in Sinaloa amounted to until Septembers 5352 pesos\; that is very much less as the national average, which is with 7375 pesos.
Decrease of the ADI
Apart from the dismantling of the economic activity and increasing unemployment in the year 2011 the strongest decrease of the foreign direct investment (ADI) of the last ten years is registered. According to Secretaría de Economía (national economic authority) amounted to the ADI from January to June 630,597 dollar, which corresponds to a decrease of 87,74 percent compared with the 5,143,312 dollar in the same period in the previous year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (government authority for economic development) registers for its part a total investment at a value of 17,280,000 pesos in the year 2011, which originate first of all from enterprises from the tertiary sector.
The debts
In view of the economic crisis the federal state government requested a credit at a value of 3,000,000,000 pesos, which should be invested for the reactivation of the economy into infrastructure projects in the 18 communities in July at the national congress. The national congress approved an amount at a value of 200,600,000 pesos, however no positive effects of the indebtedness could be determined on any of the industries in the country until November.
Reactions
For the representatives the entrepreneur shank made the first government year Mario López Valdés government inability obvious.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (national chamber of the processing industry in Mexico) represented the fact that in the year 2011 no efforts toward the harmonization of the opinions of the different sectors including which federal state government, was made.
“The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor in this year. It must be worked hard, around which in this year lost terrain to regain and 2012 we must exert doubly. The efforts of all and in particular the progress already government teams joined in well one on the other were co-ordinated not sufficiently one on the other”, explained it.
Slow economic development
Loredo López expressed that events, as the frost made more difficult and slowed the economic development down of the country to beginning of the year.
“The small economic river is the result of several events, among other things the Frosts. One of the most important effects is a slowed down economy, which is not sufficient in motion, in order to cause economic dynamics, which could produce an acceptable river of processes, products and services. Therefore we will conclude, meant the year far below our expectations” it.
Appointment redefine
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (trade association of Mexico) in Sinaloa explained, one had to arrange the state to more dynamic productive activities.
“Generally we observed that one worked. We believe that it is necessary a long-term program for the new regulation of the economic appointment and line of the country to develop, because it is importantly all material and human resources Sinaloas to activate”, he said.
There is much to do
The chairman von Coparmex stressed, how important it was to develop a future prospect which directs the efforts of the government into better courses.
“Generally I would say that the government within different ranges obtained good results. The economic development came in front, but it is importantly a long-term program to develop”, explained it.
It stressed that the present power of the state had made progress at the government.
“There are ranges, regarding which one can say that the government acted more comprehensively. Which I can say, it is that it was worked and that the government is conscious that still another quantity of work before it lies, expressed” it.
Arrest because of 8 kg marijuana
To five years prison and 100 daily corroding an inhabitant was condemned by Navolato because of the possession of eight Kilos marijuana.
The public prosecutor's office of the republic announced, the drug merchant was Omar Alexis Valenzuela sand oval, which for a criminal offense against the public health - here the possession of marijuana, intended for the trade - was punished.
In accordance with the document AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I Valenzuela sand oval at the 7th Junio was arrested 2010 by Mexican military during the monitoring the road Cipriano Valdez opposite the guard No. 80 in the locality El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug merchant drove in a white delivery van, in which he kept a black bag in a crate in the car and on the passenger seat a small backpack, in which the military eight the Kilos and 23 gram marijuana found.
For this reason the seized commodity was transferred to the judge of the district and the punished one is further in the penal institution.
Debts for construction work
The social welfare buildings for migrants, planned in the programs Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1, run the risk because of missing means to be finished or only with large delay, meant Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director/conductor of the urban authority for social development explained that, although the schedules of work already progressed they float now in danger, since the state government did not pay it being entitled means, which exceed for the three programs 11 million peso.
He said, which amounted to total investment into these three programs nearly 50 million peso, from which 25 percent on the state fell. Up to now only the Federación and the community would have contributed to the construction work means, why a delay of the building completion was to be expected.
“12 million must contribute it, and although the year goes already in the end, they did not give us a Pfennig, and that, although they would have already had to pay us in July a part”, meant it. “Around too to be, we did not already begin late with the construction work, and they progressed already far, but we need the money.”
It main headers out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla the state did not follow its obligations, why the community had to take up its reign a credit at the beginning at a value of 7 million. That would correspond to the amount, which the center government would have had to apply.
“That had already been able be done to us in such a way in the last legislative period, because the state did not have sufficient economical means. The programs continued to run and in this year had we the means to procure, which the state had not applied, over in these programs to participate”, implemented themselves it.
Even if the national authorities are obligated to the disbursement of these means, it commentated that with the Minister for administration and finances, one requested, to accelerate the clerical works and to disburse the pending portion as fast as possible.
“Nearly 12 million must contribute it, and although the year goes already in the end, they did not give us a Pfennig.”
The court approves the transition to the digital television to Mexico for 2015
The conversion of the similar to digital signals belongs in the last years world-wide to the most important changes.
The highest Court of Justice of Mexico (SCJN) pointed the constitutional challenges, which from the senate and the Lower House against presidential-let were submitted, and strength that the change-over of similar on digital signals from 2021 on 2015 to be brought forward must, due to missing eight voices, which are necessary for the law contestation, back.
A minority of four Ministers, under it also the president of the highest Court of Justice, Juan Silva Meza, was the opinion, which president Felipe Calderón did not have his competencies exceeded, when he published the law decree with the details over the change-over on the terrestrial digital television.
With this resolution the condition controversy called by the senate in the life was rejected, since it did not receive the necessary qualified majority from eight voices, so that the court could decide on the constitutionality or the non--constitutionality. Thus the law remains.
In the project for the complaint, which was prepared by the minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, was suggested, explaining the law decree for unconstitutional since for the radio and the television adjustments concerned the Comisión federal one de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (federal commission for telecommunications in Mexico) it is responsible why the law decree would contradict the hierarchical principles and the legal reservations.
In favor of the project only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero were correct.
With this argument both the senate and the chamber of deputies submitted constitutional complaints against the law decree. After acceptance of the complaints the minister Sánchez Cordero would not use the law decree and stopped all activities for the facility of the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers rejected also the complaint submitted by the chamber of deputies, without entering thereby into the debate over the project, for which the minister Sánchez Cordero was responsible likewise.
In his contribution the Prime Minister expressed not to agree with the arguments of the project in the sense that the land government may not adjust the measures, which the public administration is to seize with general regulations.
“I do not believe also that, if one would do that, which was impaired independence of the adjustment place”. It reminded also of the fact that for the planning of strategic politics policies, as for example the sector of telecommunications, from constitutional reasons the centralnational government is responsible, because this leads the state affairs.
The replacement of the similar signals by digital is one of the most important changes, which took place in the last years in the whole world, and she causes a better use of the radio-electrical spectrum, a increased quality of the signal and more channels.
Postponing the conversion, meant it, is postponing the usufruct of the digitization, which was a decision in the public interest, which does not only have technical criteria, “it covers economic, social, political and aspects in terms of safety.”
These affairs, it stressed, “made an acting of the entire system necessary, in accordance with the principle of the economic line by the state contained it a group of characteristics, those the condition into the hands of the centralnational government puts.”
She called in the memory that many countries would have already accomplished world-wide the digital conversion, over the government, although they ordered over highly specialized facilities.
One cannot conclude that the government with the publication of the contested law decree intervenes in the authority of the congress, because the laws adopted by the legislation were kept”, insured them.
The possibility the voting cards in Michoacán will count out separately considered
In accordance with the information of PREP the difference between first and the second place amounts to with the choice of the governor scarcely 27 percent, whereby 879 voices were not counted out of altogether 6074 yet.
The possibility of the single counting of the voting cards is in this year with the elections in Michoacán a reality, because amounts to in accordance with the data spent by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP) the difference between the first and second place with the governor elections scarcely 27 percent, whereby 879 voices were not counted out of altogether 6074 yet.
In this sense the president of the Consejo general del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM) reminded, María de loosely Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, of the fact that straight had adopted the choice place a set from regulations once on past 9 November to the harmonization of the local regulations with the reforms of the Federal States in choice elections.
It is reminded of the fact that Michoacán had adapted neither its political condition nor its electoral law still its law over the choice law to the reforms adopted by the congress, so that these had not stepped with this choice round into force. The governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided its publication in the official gazette within the periods with the argument, planned for it to have still objections against it.
On 9 November the highest Court of Justice of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional challenge submitted by the local legislation and judged the voice of the state-assigned to the constitutional reforms as “invalidly and illegally”, since this did not have the right, over it “decides or a veto against it to insert”.
María de Ángeles Llanderal explained loosely with an interview over the possibility of the single counting of the voices that owing to the acceptance of the guidelines by the Consejo general would exist del IEM now the possibility that the local election commission could partly or completely count out the voting cards.
So the results in minutes can be partly counted out to be correct not under the following conditions in one or more choice elections contained voices\; the protocol on the counting of votes and - computation is not present documentary or it is not in the possession of the chairman of the election commitee or it gives obvious errors or alterations in minutes.
In addition the total counting of completely filled out ballot papers can take place if there is a difference between the presumed winner and that, who stand on the second place, which is same or smaller than a percent, provided at the beginning of the meeting lies an express request Partei-bzw. Coalition chairman forwards, who is second of the candidates mentioned.
The counting of votes can take place also in its whole, if after conclusion of tidy calculation is determined that the difference between the presumed winner and the candidate at the second place is same or smaller than a percent, presupposed it is present an express request of a representative of the party, whose candidate became second. In this case the choice elections, which were exposed to a partial counting, were excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections are in Morelia in the same situation, where in accordance with PREP the difference between first and the second place amounts to scarcely 0.16 percent, although the voices were not counted out of 129 of altogether 923 choice elections yet.

On Wednesday education of the new Italian government
The designate prime ministers, Mario Monti, meets tomorrow with the president of Italy, in order to present to this the new government, that is to offer the forehead to the crisis, which led Italy to the edge of the economic collapse.
The designate prime ministers, Mario Monti, meets tomorrow with the president of Italy, in order to present to this the new government, that is to offer the forehead to the crisis, which led Italy to the edge of the economic collapse.
A report from the presidency palace announced that on Sunday the appointed Monti would meet on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, in order to confirm the formation of a government.
One assumes it will present a cabinet by the majority built up from technocrats, although is not yet clear, when the new Prime Minister will begin his office.
Monti said, it to the president the results of the discussions with the political parties to the formation of a government would present.
“I would like my absolute confidence into the ability of our country to become finished affirm by these difficult times”, said the former European Union-commissioner to the journalists.
Monti confirmed not expressly the formation of a government, but from its comments it comes out that the obstacles are overcome.
The “framework is now well marked out”, added it.
Monti created it less in as three days to educate a government that is much less time than normal. Meanwhile Italy fights against a political and financial crisis, which drove the costs of the debts into an intolerable height.
The new, from which Monti led government must discharge former European Union-commissioner a hard savings package, which was demanded by the euro politicians, in order to recover the fastened confidence in Italy.
The pressure to the hurry, which on Monti rests, still strengthened by the varying market situation, due to which the Italian government loans were loaded for 10 years with 7 percent of interest. That corresponds to the conditions, with which Greece and Ireland saw themselves in a forced manner to request the European emergency parachute.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian trade association Confindustria divided the press after a meeting with Monti with: “We said we this government after all forces would support.”
We believe that this government is the last opportunity, so that Italy from this emergency situation comes out.
The chances of success Montis were increased by the support of the party PDL of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to withdraw on Saturday due to the crisis, substantially.
“We believe to cause that the efforts of professor Monti are intended for it, good results”, said Angelino Alfano, Sekretär of the center right-wing party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party of Italy, is substantial, because up to now many of their members expressed themselves existing government, that forms Monti straight, against one by the majority from technocrats.
Support of the parliament
The new government of Monti needs a strong parliamentary support for the conversion of the probably unpopular economy measures.
Resistance against its efforts or delaying the reforms could cause a devastating attack of the financial markets again.
The Italian federation of foreign banks practices with its reference, a failure Montis is a disaster, likewise pressure out.
Monti began on Monday with its debates with political parties, trade unions and trade associations as well as with youth and woman organizations.
Tuesday evening should be final the meeting round.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, which set an extremely fast change of government as answer to the crisis on.
After short drawing a deep breath toward end of the last week, to be familiar that Berlusconi would withdraw it was reached, to have due to the uncertainty by means of the success of the new Prime Minister the costs of the Italian government loans again critical borders.
A rescue of Italy with a national debt at a value of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the present European Union-emergency parachute.
Monti said, its government it had up to the next elections, which are presumably held in the year 2013, lasts, despite the forecasts that the politicians will give him only time for the conversion of the reforms to prefer in place of the elections.
Monti expressed, it gladly politicians to its cabinet would accept, but it insists the large parties on it that this should consist only of technicians, a reference to their doubts in view of the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that the mutual distrust and the dividednesses between the portions make the inclusion complicated by persons from the political life.

The quintet referred Costa Rica into its tour for the celebration of its twenty-year-old existence
“In Costa Rica to play is a dream, which realizes itself”
In the exclusive discussion with Viva the bassist Jeff Ament von Pearl Jam says that those is preparatory volume to give on next Sunday in the national stadium one of their best concerts.
More than 20 years were expected it, but it insures the volume that for them a dream realizes itself, if they play in Costa Rica.
The insured bassist and joint founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva last week of Brazil from an exclusive interview.
The volume is in the South American part of its tour for the celebration of its twenty-year-old existence and on Sunday, the 20. , they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day they step starting from 19.30 o'clock in the national stadium as well as the volumes The X from Los Angeles and picked Robertas up from Costa Rica.
They read an excerpt from the discussion, whose complete copy in the online edition of La Nación is to be found.
For your Costa Rican fans a dream realizes itself, if Pearl Jam in Costa Rica plays: Are conscious to it you, which means for your fans?
In Costa Rica to play is a dream, which realizes itself also for us.
Up to now that is straight once the second time that we play in south and Central America, and it was great.
I was only once to the vacation in Costa Rica. It is a so beautiful country that we will remain certainly still a few days there.
For us it is exciting to bring our music there.
I ask you that, because the fans that are completely devoted volume. They experience the days before the concert intensivst.
What says it to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thanks to stand all these years at our side.
We used nearly 21 years, until we came to Costa Rica. Thanks to have so for a long time waited and suffering does to us to have so for a long time used until we came here.
Some people are even the opinion that your concert will become the largest show of the year.
Doesn't that exert a little pressure from your visit?
Some the greatest shows, which we put down in the last 21 years, took place in the last two weeks.
We played for a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we to hope that for this concert in Costa Rica made us fit.
Really, we have to play desire there.
We love this country, we surf and are enthusiastic from the jungle. But Costa Rica belongs to the best countries in the world.
How their Costa Rica and their waves for surfing became acquainted with?
Many our friend are surfers and I have a great friend, who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply inconceivable.
My friends always drove for surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico that is outstanding areas for surfing. In this way, over people, which love a surfing, we experienced of it.
With a view of the tour giant shows with many songs to it ordered.
Which plans have you for the meeting in Costa Rica?
Since we did not play there ever, we sit down also no borders.
We will try to give the optimum show with many different songs. We want to play a few song from each album and to our fans a good and versatile repertoire offer.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I believe, that am partially like that, because we can have and over 120 songs play nine plates. Another song pleases everyone, so that the decision, which we will play in each case, falls not easily.
If we two or three of song, whom we did not play already longer no more, take up, to the repertoire, we can receive our concentration better upright and them to surprise us, because they call us the reasons in the memory, why us this song to have fallen. Otherwise they could come into oblivion.
That makes the show more interesting for us and I believes, therefore also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty-year-old history.
If you look back, does it fall you heavily in your success to believe?
Yes, totally.
First of all I believe that nobody from us itself presented to play once in great rock band and also still over 20 years long. That works like a dream.
We continue to set also on this benedictions and find it great to be able to still make still together music.
We like us and are enthusiastic to bring music out.
We have luck to be able to drive to the places of the world which we wanted to visit always once.
The things could not stand better.
What meant it for you in the birth of the Grunge to have participated actively?
It was always an honor to belong to this group large volume.
We are well friendly with the people of sound guards, Mudhoney and Alice in chains.
It is surprising and plentifully unusual, if a movement comes out from a group of friends.
Now and then a volume comes out from a city, but it is already unusual, if five or ten groups come at the same time from the same city.
We are proud and feel honoured to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we would interaction still.
In the last year we were on a festival with Alice in chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw sound guards on their tour. We are pleased to be friendly still with them all and it honour us to be part of this arisen Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a volume stayed together like your a time so long with the same musicians.
Yes, four of us would interaction already for 21 years and matte (Cameron) pushed before 13 years to us. Alone already is much more time, than many volume outlast.
First of all I that we estimate ourselves all happy, believe to be still alive and in addition worry we over each other.
We all are confine friend, why musical ways opened, which give the freedom to each particular for experimenting.
One trusts the other one and its music. We could not be better.
Your relationship with the fame was not always simple. On the other side could always make owing to your success that for it, what their most wanting.
How do you find a balance?
The kind, how we grew, made it simpler for us to find a balance.
We guarantee to not often be too on tour because it is too easy to purge to this play with enormous human being masses, which love your music.
As long as one remembers that the people came because of the music, reminds you that of it that you must respect the music and what brought her into being, without obsessed on it to be a famous rock star to be. That anyway never interested us.
Which memories do you have to your other project Mother Love Bone?
I believe, we have very good of song written and at the beginning was it great.
We were three years long a volume, which had never published a plate up to the death of Andy (Andrew Wood).
We were disappointed to have so for a long time used. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), which with us the volume constructs, gets used to. If I hear a song or see photos, I remember, what for unbelievable humans were Andy and how he brought me to the laughter. It was always a joy to go to the work to laugh and at music and football and many other topics talk together.
He was an extraordinary person and we misses him.
The domestic volume read Robertas is responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Does it that you know her work, tune in particular Eddie Vedder, and the volume therefore for the opening selected?
Yes, production sent videos of several groups and this volume to us pleased us best. Therefore we are to be seen curiously, what read Robertas live offer can. That certainly stretching.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter, if you play live?
That is a question for OD (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
It sings it, and I believe, he sing first, which occurs to him.
Were you affected of whom as bassist?
Of so many +
To first, which occur to me, Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. to J. Ramone, belong John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski…
There is so many that I could talk the whole afternoon about the bassists, which please me.
How did it create Pearl Jam to hold the Grunge alive although it does not concern no more a temporary fashion?
I believe, we all do not feel us not much obliged with the word Grunge.
If I think about it, occur to me the volume, which I mentioned before, for example the Mudhoney, sound guards, nirvana and all different, which arose at the same time. Even if they are still important today, I find that great, because it is worthwhile itself to hear and volume such as Mudhoney make this music now improves music as ever before.
At first their music was more darkly, now is more positive it.
Why?
That is interesting, because I believe, it give a few song on the new album, which could work somewhat thoughtlessly. But there are also different songs such as The ends or just Breathe, which are classified as very dark song, although they also something positive have actually.
To both me the tears came, when I heard like OD them played. There is much darkens song.
I believe, if you older and somewhat traumatic in your life happened actual e.g. loses if one a relative or a friend - your artistic work and your music affects and this both song embodies clearly for me.
In addition, I am the opinion that one can make happy humans its and nevertheless dark music.

Whereupon stand countries, which introduced not all international standards to co-operation into tax affairs.
On business level a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which contributed to an increasing exchange of goods between the two countries, insists.

Álvarez confirmed that “super Mario 3D country” would contain two plays in one: The first part is “easy”, in order to catch the fewer geschckten users.
Afterwards the experts know a “second round over the different play levels, which to become ever more difficult, turn”.
In addition the users in real time between a “aggressive D” or one, which affects themselves only the depth of the action, can select. For the overcoming of the obstacles, without becoming victims of the “optical effects”, must be played however always three-dimensional.
This trip super Marios into the three-dimensional world means also the return of the figure to a portable console, which since 2005 no more the case was not.
With this video game Nintendo the fan of the Saga zwinkert too and repeats the recipe for success of the last expenditures: The schnurrbärtige plumber must overcome platforms with dangers cribbed, in order to free the princess Peach.

After the evacuation was replaced the door lock, in order to avoid a similar situation.

Park or mountain?
The architects agree apart from the rowing over the fees with the advertisement.
The urban advertisement over the 16 gates opens the debate over the meaning of Collserola in Barcelona on the new.
Center of the 1980er years, for the high point of the Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), disappeared in the meantime, published this administration their libellous pamphlet over the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as an enormous park in Barcelona city.
It was compared even in figures with the Central Park of New York.
With the fall of the CMB in the year 1987 the park in the eyes of many became again the upper limit of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia belongs to the few, which does not spread in north south direction, but upward (mountains) and down (sea).
The classification Collserolas as nature park plays with this idea.
As model now no longer the Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild pigs in the role of the Yogibärs served.
One was so far, when the city spent a giant advertisement, consisting of 16 competitions, in September for further entrance gates after Collserola.
Certainly a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either is then, or someone intends to place gates on the country.
The question arises automatically: Collserola, park or mountain?
The advertisement is not only from organizational view, but also regarding a reflection over the city the topic for discussion in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is already nearly a rekurrentes topic, to which two members of these can fall back old served a sentence caste, which meet in the elevator.
And exactly this fact offers the material for one of the rare agreements between what three architects from Barcelona think of it, and unites university professors, who applied on the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The advertisement is appropriate.
For Roldán “it is necessary” to speak after the attack on the coast about the “front at the mountains” as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which was not delivered over the green apples.
“One should proceed from the principle that of Barcelona is largest park the beach.
Among other things, because it is well accessible.
Collserola is more complex”, judges the architect, for whom the title “of gates of Collserola holds” “a lexical trap”: One may introduce themselves it not “as entrances to a park, but be acted as containment of areas, on those must.”
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience concerning town construction, regards the proposal as a “intellectual challenge”, which holds “some dangers”.
Driven due to the “uncertainty, those the organization of a public area nowadays with itself brings” after the experiences from the 1980er years, which had their “swan singing” within the range of the forum.
The first fear is the own containment on what may be cultivated.
“Something to limit always means to specify the next step” to exceed i.e. it.
“One must think about new planning instruments concerning town construction, because the current [referring to the plan general Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a genuine disaster.”
Modol, which adheres closer to the question, does not mean simplified, the side of Collserola, which goes toward Vallesana, “can as a park be understood, those toward Barcelona”, for purely topographic reasons.
Modol reminds of the fact that there is already a study of the patronage de Collserola, whom “deaf ears should not discover”, although he is grateful to the city administration that she gave the possibility to its committee to participate in this project “from the first moment”.
In addition it marks that the proximity of the mountains is to the city the letter of consignment, which makes it for the architect possible to participate in the debate although it expresses its “doubts” whether this technical profile the multidiscipline teams brought into being (“, he says exactly the correct”) should train “we architects should only one tool be.”
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the heading of this article is complex, since in the advertisement conditions a global view of Collserola is missing: “16 competitions in the cross section were written out”, say it, “on the axle mountain sea. But there is no profile perspective, those the area in its whole regarded.”
That led at least in its case to the fact that he participates in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate beside it.
According to its opinion the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip is so equipped directly over the Ronda de Dalt in its whole length, who a soft transition between city and green belts develops.
Casino assigns Jonás Larrazábal, which comes freely

While the judicial hearing asked Ramiro Arias, the official the court assigned Ministerio Público, García Gómez whether this had repaired the damage and which expressed the owner of the house its forgiveness. The lawyer held back the name however.
In accordance with the legal matter 197/2011 Jonás Larrazábal is freely spoken. Also in the following no objections can be inserted against the process, in addition no payment of damages is required.
After the hearing of the authorized person of the house around 15.50 o'clock Larrazabal Bretón was set immediately on free foot.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, drove de Garza loosely to the urban prison from San Nicolás, in order to communicate Jonás that it had been acquitted and its case to the documents was put.

At a press conference mentioned Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary for communication and transport that the pilot before the start would have confirmed, the climatic conditions was suitable for the flight.
“Circumstances that the propeller blades into 25 meters height contact with trees had, whereby the helicopter lost the trunk seems to point out that the helicopter had had several ground contacts.”
He explained also that the helicopter for 19 passengers was built, why it fulfilled all conditions for the transport of the personnel.
In addition said it that during the investigations in the area, in which the machine had come down no helicopter parts were found.
“With the search no airplane parts in other places were found, the impact concerned the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, why it fulfilled all conditions for the transportation of passengers.
The area exhibits a diagonal from 7 to 30 degrees.
At present it is priority to get the test results as soon as possible however can these several months, perhaps even one year take.
_for his part insure Gilberto López Meyer, general manager of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (secretariat for airplane and emergency service in Mexico), that the helicopter of Estado Mayor Presidencial with impact with speed fly and the airplane on a soft slope please be.
“This information strengthens the acceptance that it concerned at the time of the impact a normal flight operation.”
At a press conference the director/conductor of SCT, Pérez Jácome, six relevant points, enumerated which should be considered during the investigation:
Visual flight:
In conformity with the flight standards it acted around a flight according to the rules of the visual flight. That means that the crew must have had sufficient view during the flight and at the ground.
Climatic conditions:
The AICM registered suitable climatic conditions when starting. During the far flight in the direction of the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico state some deeply hanging clouds drew up.
Selected air lanes:
It is possible that the crew had selected a lower area with better view because of the clouds in the direction of the Cuernavaca valley.
Impact place:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter agree. Possibly it gave a control loss over the airplane still another deviation from the air lane before the impact neither.
Scattering the remnants of the airplane in a limited area:
Up to the current time these information points to the fact that the helicopter had struck out straight lines and lateral direction.
It lets the sample of the scattered airplane remains assume that the helicopter with its intact structure had struck the ground.
No referring to fire or explosion:
The remnants of the airplane offer at the site of the accident suggest neither on fire nor explosion.
The last test results point to several ground contacts.
During the investigations locally airplane parts on a height of 9200 foot over the sea level were found. The area descends and exhibits a diagonal from seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence, in which the helicopter probably went to break.
Some information points to the fact that the helicopter could have had several ground contacts.
After a minuziösen search in an area, which went beyond the locked range at the site of the accident, no scattered airplane parts could be found, what strengthens the acceptance that the intact airplane structure had hit against the ground.
MSS announces research minutes for finding the gene for obesity
It institute for social security of Mexico leads a research project for finding the gene for obesity with children and young people, which is supported by specialists of the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (institute for social security of Mexico) announced that it leads a research project for the discovery of the gene for obesity with children and young person under the title “genetics of obesity in childhood and youth”, with which the genetic markers in connection with predominance to be found is.
Miguel Cruz López, director/conductor of the Unidad de Investigación Médica EN Bioquímica (department for medical research, emphasis biochemistry) at the hospital hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI explained that an interdisciplinary team, consisting of physicians, was developed male nurses, nourishing specialists and social workers.
This team supported of specialists and students of the post office graduation course of studies at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and at the center de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to the participation in the study. Prospective customers can come to the sports fields of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where each Saturday starting from 8.00 o'clock test with children and young people are accomplished.
It stressed that the investigation on the sports field of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the Federal State México) began and is continued since 8 October at the sports field by Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the Federal State México).
If the goal is reached from 500 to 600 investigation persons, the study is continued at the sports field by Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and locked on by Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained, the goal of the study was becoming acquainted with the factors and the role of the genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of factors of risk of Mexican children and young people for the prevention of chronic degenerative illnesses.
On the occasion of the diabetes he, it explained world-wide tags is aimed at that three thousand children and young person at the age should fill out questionnaires nourish-referred from six to 14 years with agreement and under supervision of their parents.
Also questions are placed to them over their physical activity and their family illness prehistory, in order factors of risk, which could entail diabetes or kidney insufficiency to control.
It implemented the moreover that on Saturdays mentioned the investigation persons were controlled measured (weight, size, waist extent), their blood pressure and blood values were determined like the glucose mirror, Triglyceride, Cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt of the identification of genes in connection with obesity in the infancy).
Cruz López stressed, this investigation was accomplished on the occasion of the concern of the health personnel over the alarming weight gain of young people.
“The health surveys from the years 1999 and 2006 showed that in scarcely six years the portion of obese boys by 77 percent and that of the girls with obesity had increased by 47 percent. Also the overweightness rose dramatically”, stressed the specialist of the IMSS.
It indicated, those search for genetic markers was justified, because the genetic history of the population of Mexico itself of the other peoples of differences.
It indicated that (e) Mexican (in) on the average to 65 percent Indian-more American, to 30 percent more European and to 5 percent of African descent was, which itself in the genes, which with diabetes and predominance in the connection reflects.
Completely generally explained it, the genetics of obesity expresses itself in the inability to burn the surplus of the energy (calories), taken to us, so that this is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained, who would exist direct benefits for the investigation participants in a comprehensive investigation of the children, with which it was determined whether these exhibited a degree of overweightness or obesity.
It even the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and at the interior arm (Akanthosis), which to the probability of metabolic disturbances and diabetes in the preliminary state refer, examined.
All information was confidentially treated and communicated to parents in writing by the physicians. The physicians explain all results of measurement to parents and propose changes of the lifestyle, which are appropriate for the prevention of illnesses.
Cruz López explained, there would be three basic factors, which are responsible for predominance, obesity and other chronic diseases: Lack of movement to go i.e. missing movement in the everyday life to spend most time of the day before the television and use means of transport, in place of short ways to foot.
The high calorie admission, that is, a increased consumption of gezuckerten beverages and carbohydrats (Tamales, bread, pizza, a Hamburger etc.) together with a high fat and protein admission as well as the genetics, which are to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt of the UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the faculty for chemistry at the Mexican University of UNAM developed with polymers modified Asphalte, in order to make the mixture more resistant in relation to climatic conditions and variations in temperature
It became on the indications which proceed from the road surfacing, respected, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 potholes if the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city range of the valley of Mexico) breaks out, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the faculty for chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and insured that if laying and the maintenance of the asphaltic surfacing out would happen appropriately, which number of potholes is substantially decreased or avoided even completely.
In its lecture of “potholes from technical view”, which it held on the occasion of the international year to chemistry, announced it that the laboratory, for which it is responsible with polymers modified Asphalte develops, in order to manufacture the asphalt similar a mixture, which exhibits however a larger mechanical resistance both with high as well as at low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera meant that this kind of modified Asphalte in areas with extremely hot climate should be used to improve as for example in some cities in the north of the country, in order the behavior of the road surfacing and to avoid thus the occurrence from potholes to.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon connection, of the one part a high molecular weight has - the so-called Asphaltene - and the other part a low - the so-called Malthene. They lend its characteristic of tough reading table behavior together to the road surfacing.
Tough reading table behavior of the asphalt meant that this behaves at high temperatures of nearly 180°C like a liquid, with 120°C it is very viscous and with 50°C nearly firm, while he becomes fragile at very low temperatures.
“That is, that the ruggedness of the asphalt on the roads is not homogeneous, but on one day as a function of the climatic conditions and variations in temperature”, implemented chemistry engineer changes.
The researcher of the FQ noticed, which would have roads of Mexico City by the majority a flexible road surfacing, which consists of six material layers, from which the last three asphalt contained.
Between the highest layers lies a wear course from asphalt, which consists of small and then solidified stones bathed in asphalt.
Each individual little stone of this wear course, was bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles move themselves on it and forces are produced, this layer makes a good strength distribution possible in the road surfacing.
“If it modified asphalt would be, the forces still better would distribute”, meant themselves a chemistry engineer.
“Over the wear course”, he implemented, “a last layer is laid out, the so-called base, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. from sand, which was bathed also in asphalt.
Since this layer in the contact with the vehicle tires are, they need a larger mechanical strength than the wear course and them must manufacture friction.
This road surfacing most forces receives and distributed, needs the base in addition an appropriate thickness and the material, of which it consists, must be held.
The climatic conditions, in particular humidity and variations in temperature, are further, important factors, first of all the water”, which can be considered, said it, “it impair the behavior of the wear course substantially.
If the area becomes damp, water penetrates into the layer and steps only with difficulty. A softening of all layers of the road surfacing causes and consequently the occurrence of potholes.
If a pothole develops, said” it, “first cleared away the surface layer, while the wear course is only impaired thereafter. But the damage results, but this concerns a process, to that not immediately with the first signs from appropriate maintenance programs to be held would have.”
The member in the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (national research system of Mexico) explained that the vehicle load was a further important cause for the occurrence of potholes. Therefore the thickness of each layer of the road surfacing must always stand in relation to the vehicle load and it must be guaranteed that for the avoidance of frequent potholes this regulation is kept.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that still many research work took time, for example over asphalt emulsions, which even already were in other countries on the market, and with which the potholes let themselves repair simply and without application of high temperatures.
What was missing to the candidate del Valle, in order the new measures Colombia to be?
Analysis of the factors, which affected that Melina Ramírez Serna the crown measure Colombia did not get.
El Valle receives to its 14. Measurement title.
Once again Valle del Cauca went empty with the assignment of the crown for measures Colombia.
This mark had to give itself Melina Ramírez Serna contently to stand on the winner podium to place a silver crown and the volume, which it as new measure Colombia proves, to the exhibition.
With this night received result in Cartagena, where measure Atlántico the crown and the cedar actually took, comes the Departamento already on 14 measurement titles and Melina associates with the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had held the crown almost in the hands. To the proclaimed Misses belong: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The large question, which today many ask themselves, reads: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the fall large favorite, which had shown with each demonstration that her over all ordered, to be in order the new measures Colombia. She had been selected not in vain to the queen of the police and to the Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles, which had received also the beauty queens valley IANA Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and which the crown measure Colombia with home took.
The first factor, that as crucial is valid for the resolution of the jury, it to first measures to appoint, is that it has the answer to the question “which book you most strongly affected and why? ”, which by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos had been placed to it, had not convinced.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered to the interrogator:
“I read much, I believe quite in the literature, I believe, it am a kind to be civilized, in the long run believe myself I that the book, which coined for my childhood most strongly is “a small prince”, a quite deeply going book.
At present I read “debt and atonement”. It is a book of the universal culture, which we all should read. I read a straight book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book, ` the Leidenschaften'heißt.
An answer, which encountered little approval, first of all because of the term ` zivilisieren'und secondly, because she had not explained concretely, in which way of everyone of it book specified it had affected itself.
But after conclusion of the ceremony Melina explained to feel calmly and happy with the result: “The universe is points, it happens, what must happen.
And for all people: Read please a little “the small prince”. It is a great book.
Among other things it is said that the favorite of El Valle is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that it was the preferential one, collected the all Beifälle and before all prices had gotten (catering trade competition Easter, audience vote over best hand-tailored costume and Reina the Madre), “the other candidates had made jealous, what the queen stressed, therefore on the stage could not shine.”
And one noticed with its first conception in the bathing suit at the beach of the Hilton hotel and with her two elevators with the coronation celebration.
Although it arose with both reliably, you were missing nevertheless the strength and the momentum, which the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico displayed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program “Como EN casa” with the channel RCN meant that the fact that Melina to measure one crowned, shows “that the candidate, who wins most prices during the competition becomes finally nevertheless not queen”.
In addition Valle went in the end of the press out of the way - a mistake.
A further hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the Jurie concerning its interest in the social work, what in the long run the substantial of the national beauty competition is.
It will already have its reason that Lucy Doughty explained two days before the composition of the international jury, it looked for a woman, who engaged herself for the social affairs of its country.
“Beauty alone is enough for one does not measure Colombia not. One must look over the physical and concentrate on social feeling, on it that she had already cooperated, explained before the participation in the competition in projects” her.
One also speculates that Valle with its defects of the Derriere and the Fibrose, which one marked to it in the gastric region had transgressed. But that is contradictory, because the jury selected her as a candidate for “natural beauty” with a healthy body, good nourishing habits and a responsible manual labor.
The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that however Melina did not have the best body that it improved would give, “its problem with the Fibrose at the belly, which was honestly said hardly to be noticed for me pressed their score on the last day.”
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos of the opinion is, the error of the woman from Valle del Cauca the surgical interferences, to which she had undergone, was.
“The operations are ok, but Valle did not know, how she should let her make correct.
Their body was never their strong side, and it had to pay this place.”
Because of this price, which is assigned the first time by the national beauty competition, a cruel forecast after the appearance in the bathing suit, which should become true at the night, developed. It was gossiped secretly that Raymundo Melina had given a comfort price, in order not to let it come into the benefit of the crown.
No matter whether tunes or is not, fact that Melina from today on its rule year start, not as a queen, but when princess to represent a position, which offers it the possibility, on appointment of the national beauty competition Colombia with one of the international competitions.
However it will enter as one of the queens, which despite its overwhelming appearance for Cartagena the crown had escaped, history.
Like that was the work of the physician, who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A Lophoskopist from Cali entered as the man, who identified “Alfonso Cano”, history.
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On past 4 November was received a Lophoskopist the determination unit of the public prosecutor's office (CTI) from Cali as the man, who the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - revolutionaries of armed forces of Colombia) confirmed: “Alfonso Cano” by comparison of the fingerprints.
From the seven Lophoskopisten in the department of the CTI, this week had Eliazar González on-call service, a man from Puerto Tejada since 21 years with criminal preliminary investigations cooperates.
At the beginning of its career González worked in communities of Chocó, where he had to go frequently five days long into the jungle, in order to reach the place, on which the corpses was, whom he should identify.
2000 it settled after Valle over and after the completion of the necessary courses specialized it in Lophoskopie, that is the investigation of the skin, which are exposed to frictions, i.e. the hand and foot surfaces.
In the week of the employment against the so-called Alfonso Cano Eliazar was referred to pack up clothes for at least three days.
Something large expected it.
Friday night flew it in the helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two corpses, and that the suspicion existed that one can be those of the man, who had led those oldest guerilla of the world. Therefore it should carry the ten-fingerprint sheet forward of Guillermo León Sáenz (its actual name).
When it reached however with the Untersuchungste the place, at which the corpse was, could not it due to its physical appearance not identify, because this resembled the illustrations, which he had seen in the mass media, not in the slightest.
It did not have beard, was dressed like a farmer of the area, carried no eyeglasses and was very many thinner.
But fingerprints do not lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a planting spoon and a flashlight Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those on the casting sheet.
He had seen correctly: It was “Alfonso Cano”.
Still the same night was responsible this man originating from Puerto Tejada for it the Secretary of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, to communicate that it actually concerned the boss of the FARC.
On tracing
For a Daktyloskopen of the Sijín in Cali the appreciation, which the president to Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference over the employment against “Cano” assign become let, was very important.
Many humans do not know our work.
The Daktyloskopie is an accurate science without error rate, which can be a key factor with the dissolution of a criminal offense.
Lophoskopisten do not only identify corpses, it support also investigations in murder and robbery things and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
With their arrest many offenders do not submit wrong identity papers or them to have.
We remove the fingerprints from them and look for these in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to tear a piece of wall from a house with a theft, because the thief had rested exactly here with his hand, when he pulled a safe-deposit box out fully plugged with decoration and money.
“Walls are difficult, because their surfaces for the decrease of fingerprints are unsuitable. But in this case we could the casting of the whole hand take and the offender, who had participated in several thefts, identify”, remembered it.
Assistance of the fingerprints also murder suspects can be relieved or loaded.
Recently a dead was found surrounded by liquor bottles.
With the determination assumed that a relative could be do suspicious, and actually agreed a fingerprint on the bottle.
Although that does not guarantee that it concerns the murderer, then it is brought nevertheless with the place, at which the criminal offense was committed, in connection.
A Daktyloskopist of the CTI explained that “the fingerprints with chemical or physical Reagenzen were taken by the object.”
If they appear, a planting spoon or a volume is used for the taking along.
Afterwards the castings are sent to the Asif, that are the criminal database, or to the office for person condition.
“The problem is that there are, explained still many Colombians without identity papers” the expert of the CTI.
He meant, everything was like that, as it was represented in the TV-series SCI.
As all gold, which shines, is also not everything that one touches, is not a fingerprint.
But nevertheless it can be used, if one accomplishes an appropriate comparison.
Provoke the authorities in New York “infuriated”
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded together in tents at the Zuccotti place.
A majority followed the eviction order and changed its location into a close convenient park.
The members of the movement Ocupy Wall Street provoked new Yorks on this Tuesday the authorities, when they tried again with a judicial arrangement, the one having place to enter, after they had been vacated in the daybreak by the place and had tried to occupy another place at the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded together before the Zuccotti place, on which they wanted to provide with a judicial arrangement, which “infuriated” renewed tents here permitted, admission. Meanwhile another part of the movement adhered to the eviction order and occupied a park further north in the city, where it came to nine arrests.
“Our idea is that, if the court does not permit us at the place to campen, we come together at another place and the battle with legal means around the return to the Zuccotti would continue, also sit in and peaceful demonstrations”, said Marks of Bray, one the spokesman of the movement “Ocupy Wall Street”.
Bray implemented the fact that the answer “infuriated” on the evacuation of its camp, which directly of Michael Bloomberg, who mayor had been arranged of New York, until before court came, where the judge Lucy Billings spent an arrangement, which forbade the evacuation by force of the place and which demonstrators to the tents approved.
In addition occupied “infuriated” a new park, which itself at the crossing of the Canal Street lain central and the Sixth Avenue close by the entry into the Holland tunnel, which connects, finds New York and New Jersey and property of the Trinity Church is.
They could occupy the place at least one hour long. But afterwards the police arrived and arrested some the demonstrators, although Bray cannot give exact numbers. It insured the press agency Efe that he had seen under it also several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization insured, hundreds of humans would here have appeared themselves, at whom also a delegation of religious leaders as indications of their support of the members of the movement and for switching with the police had arrived.
In the meantime the Zuccotti place (an area in private property) remains closed in expectation of a judicial hearing, which is set for this Tuesday still, and with which the legal standard the evacuation taken place in the daybreak is to be analyzed.
Some the demonstrators driven by the place carried photocopies of this judicial arrangement with itself and distributed them. They gave it even unite policemen, who guarded the place, which entailed “some small collisions”, as Bray reported, which had indicated, some policemen would have demonstrators struck.
The judicial instruction forbids to the authorities to vacate members by Occupy Wall Street from the place to as well as the use of “laws, according to occupation it was discharged and to forbid that the demonstrators with their tents and other things, which had used them already before return to the park.”
Mayor Bloomberg gets straight before the press, which was waived due to this judicial arrangement the renewed opening of the place for audience traffic and the demonstrators. The demonstrators pointed out it that the city laws did not permit them to furnish itself again with tents and sleeping bags at this place.
The mayor defended personally the evacuation of the Zuccotti place accomplished in the daybreak, with which nearly 200 persons were arrested, and which was decided, because the demonstrators offended “against the right.”
Bloomberg explained, it would have given the arrangement to evacuation of the place, because this had transformed “into a place, to which humans to demonstrating did not come, but for breaking the laws and in some cases, around other persons damage to cause”, because “some business would have threats received” and the adjacents resident feared for “their quality of life”.
“The evacuation in the daybreak was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is interested in the reason in the protection of the financial interests and not in the protection of the interests of the North American workers”, did not add the spokesman of the movement, the mayor accused “freedom of the press not to respect”.
It informed the responsible persons of “Occupy Wall Street” that they would think to organize “large actions” for Thursday together with community organizations and trade unions, in order the two months, which already last the protests since 17 September now to intend.
Pamela Anderson is into the TV-Weihnachtsshow the virgin Maria
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian famousnesses it will arise on 1 December in the TV program “It's A Russell Peter Christmas”
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's female assistant in “Home Improvement”, rescue swimmer in “Baywatch”, rabbits with “Playboy”, the woman of the rock musician Tommy Lee and an actress and model during a Christmas transmission of the Canadian television the virgin Maria will be now.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson one as well as “more crooner” (ballad singers) Michael Bublé and other Canadian famousnesses will breathe on 1 December in the TV program “It's A Russell Peter Christmas” to arise and a completely special virgin Maria Leben.
CTV spread today pictures of the television programme, in the Anderson one - which also for the spreading in the Internet of a porn, in which it together with their former husband, even turned, who appears drums player of “Mötley Crüe”, Tommy Lee, - when virgin Maria with a doll in the lap, which is to represent Jesus, arises.
In the scene Peter, a well-known Canadian comedian appears to Indian origin, which recently as moderator at the transmission “My Violent torpedo OF Truth” worked from Charlie Sheen, as a Jesus child.
The Christmas program of CTV does not only set on Anderson and Peter, beyond that also on the Canadian singer Bublé, at the end of March in Buenos Aires the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato married, and for which this controversy far does not stand.
Recently Bublé had called the north American Kim Kardashian with one of its concerts in New York “whore”.
Japan is again-born after the earthquake
The Gross Domestic Product grows by 1,5% owing to the inland consumption and terminates the spiral of the free case starting from at the beginning of March
Since last March was the Japanese economy paralyzed, itself still in the recovery after the destructive earthquake, which led into an atomic crisis, and which worst the disaster, which is Japan the 2nd world war had experienced.
The first estimations of the government in Tokyo evaluated the damages to property on 300,000 dollar, an impact, which seems to weaken itself despite the difficult world economy situation.
After three quarter of continuing case the information served on the gross domestic product from July to Septembers to finally conclude this chapter: the Gross Domestic Product grew by 1,5% in the comparison to the previous quarter and by 6% to on the year the projected ratio.
The value - in Japan the financial year begins in March 2012 -, measured in the second quarter, in addition means fastest growth for the period of January until March 2010.
The resurgence can be partly explained by the machine sale for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the following tsunami.
The enterprises actually increased their investments by 1,1% compared with the decrease by 0,9% for investments, which were registered from January to March, the first decrease after six months of inexorable rises.
Nevertheless the actual reversal of the Japanese economy is based not exclusively from keynsianischen impacts, which use the crisis, in order to develop or build infrastructures again.
Woke up Japan in particular owing to the development of the inland consumption, which constitutes 60% of the Japanese BIPs at present.
This variable rose around 1%, knocked against from the increasing expenditures for vehicles, journeys and leisure activities.
The stigma the yen
Tokyo entrusted itself to the home market, after the yen - the Japanese currency - itself into one of the “refuge currencies” of the investors, who flee before the debt crisis of the Eurozone and the gloomy prognoses for the U.S.A., a privilege, which like a gravestone rests on the accounts of the export enterprises.
With a harder currency the products are abroad more expensive, a serious problem for a country, whose economy is based on the health of the large technology producers.
Toyota and Sony for example attributed their weak business results from July to Septembers to the quotation the yen.
While the markets also further besieges the peripheral European Union-countries, the government Yoshihiko Noda remains watchful.
“One must pay attention to the continuous risks, for example on the degradation of some foreign Ökonomien, the effects of the inundations in Thailand and the fast revaluation the yen”, yesterday the Secretary of State for economic policy, Motohisa Furukawa meant.
The perspectives are really not much cheering up.
The organization for economic co-operation and development (OECD) explained that most member states would have exhibited clearer signs for a slowing down of the economic development in September.
The indicator, which ahead-takes the turning points of the world economy, brought to the light that with the largest economic powers the brake would have pulled.
Because it sank around four tenths up to loosely 100.4 points compared with the 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone lies even underneath this average value, which is about 100, after she sank around eight tenths on 99,13 points.
Athens lets doubts arise again
Papadimos says, which economy measures discharged, but the conservative no written agreement will sign
With risk premiums of the peripheral countries and the driven up broadly making uncertainty continues to get lost Greece also in the labyrinth that from the large European debt crisis leads out.
The impression that the “consent” of the new Greek interim government is rather a reaction to the pressure from Brussels as a genuine conviction of the political forces, slowly by facts occupied.
While the new prime minister, pointed out Lukas Papadimos, yesterday that there would be no alternatives to the structural reforms and that during its appointment arranged for their conversion was too short hundred days possibly, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras insured that he the new economy measures to support and under no circumstances its demand of new elections to the intended date, which 19 February, will take back.
“The most important task of this government is the conversion of the resolutions, which were met on the summit from 26 October”, insured Papadimos yesterday for the opening of a parliamentary debate, which will tomorrow reach its high point with the confidence vote for the new government.
A package with 24 programs for the occupation promotion, for the reform of the disciplinary right for officials and new measures against the tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless Samaras report does not eliminate the doubts about its attitude: “We have ourselves for the support of the interim government obligate, but otherwise to nothing.”
Conservative leaders went step too far with its challenge European Union and IMF, which organism, which must the 8000 million, which needs Athens urgently, unblocking. It got straight that he would not approve an undertaking over the fulfillment of the economy measures.
But the European commission, that is still irritated because of the effects of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, affirmed yesterday again, at its demand was not to be shaken: The economic aid was not signed, if the new government and the leaders of the most important Greek parties would sign “a clear written agreement not as soon as possible”.
The spokesman of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the Troika would return “very soon” to Athens, in order to discuss with the new government, “which for the payment of the sixth section” at a value of 8000 million euros “necessary is”, although there is still no final date.
The Greek ball has still for one while threads.
Queen Sofía: “Those are instruments for progress and hope”
The queen stressed the “predominating” position of Spain regarding this way of financing
Spain “achieved world-wide a predominating position with the role of the kleinst financings”.
The queen Sofía of Spain reminded yesterday of the fact that Spain had developed in the last two decades world-wide to the second donor for this means to the international cooperation. Its “natures” is based on the fact that it concerns a “instrument for the social progress, justice and hope for a better future for entire mankind on the basis of the confidence in humans”.
The queen dedicated yesterday the fifth world summit over kleinst credits in Valladolid. It was convinced that there would be “no doubts” to it that this kind of business would be “absolutely essential”, over millenium goals to reach and “in particular the goal, the number of persons fitted from the United Nations to the year 2015, which must living with incomes of less than a dollar on the day thus below “the poverty line”.
Spain “works also further” to expansion favouring net “to in last corner world and it leads this task responsibly through”, noticed queen Sofia, which hopes that the initiatives and contributions, which from the summit, which it will proceed lasts until Thursday, “the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest ones and in particular for women” than main beneficiaries of these loans are guaranteed.
“We have many successes registered” and “to stand in relation to many challenges.”
The summit over kleinst credits is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform for the impact of “two fundamental goals”.
The queen explained, it is aimed at that until approximately the end of the year 2015 175 million poor families entrance to these financial services to have been supposed and that ten million of these households will exceed the poverty line.
The conception of the kleinst credits decreases in Spain and the remaining world on from Muhammad Yunus's “years ago initiated way”, which the queen Sofia judges as a “act of the justice and acknowledgment”.
It described the father of this financing instrument as a “admirable idealists, which had used up itself the fight against the poverty” and its work knows it for 15 years, when the queen traveled to Bangladesh, in order to become acquainted with the loan strategy locally.
After this experience one year followed later the first world summit in Washington and further meetings at the Ivory Coast in the year 1999 and Canada in the year 2006. With all “we could observe a continuous advancement”, explained the queen, whose commitment for this project brought it yesterday the evaluation as “family head” into Valladolid and as a “advocate the arms”.
Finally the queen Sofia terminated her lecture, by animating the present ones to the participation in the debate and to the search for solutions in the fight against the poverty.
“Ethical requirement”
The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is “an ethical requirement” for the entire democratic state.
In this sense stressed it, it is an error to bind development assistance at times economic booms because it concerns a “permanent obligation”.
Jiménez was the opinion that the kleinst credits a “serious and radical policy was for the extermination of the poverty”, and that the governments of the industrial nations would have to work now “more than ever” according to solidary criteria, and not to permit might that the solidarity of the crisis falls to the victim.
For Spain the kleinst credits are one of the “most important forms of development assistance”.
The Secretary of State for international cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded “success”, humans “marginalized”, “before locked doors always stand” for “hope” to lend and the mayor von Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, were called the present ones in a city welcome, which opens “its gates, stuck on from the spirit of the solidarity”.
The CDU suggests selecting the European Union-president due to general casting of votes
The first day of the congress of the Christian democrats (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig ran for Angela Merkel, Kanzlerin and chairman of the Christian democratic party, without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally in the program intended, but has itself in the autumn implemented, in particular in order that activists out is sufficient to carry, which estimate the government policy tomorrow regarding the Greeks today and possibly Italy as too lax.
The presidency request of the European commission suggested by the presidency was nearly unanimously accepted.
Under 1001 nine delegated against it had been correct, ten of the voice had only contained.
The several minutes continuous standing ovation, which were valid for Angela Merkel as well as some hours of late Wolfgang Schäuble due to their intervention decrees first, do not lieβen on the part of the three to Europeancourse-bend Ministers of Finance any doubt openly.
The main idea of the chancellor carries - just like the request - the following slogan: the answer to the crisis reads " not less, but more Europes”.
Alone, because Europe peace means, but also there " nine million jobs are not directly on the euro dependent”.
For the chancellor " the time for a break-through came into Europe”.
This could come by control of the European union encouraging modification of the Lissabonner of contract regarding the budget politics of the countries in the Eurozone to the expression\; likewise this could flow however in the choice of the president of the European commission on basis of general casting of votes” to lend around Europe a face”.
This is however in any case one of the request proposals adopted by the congress, which clearly Wolfgang Schäuble godfather.
Surely it is only little probable that the 47 agrees rapidly on this revolution: Groβ Britain is faces the thing rejecting, and the directions of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy of the same opinion is.
The milestone is however put.
Likewise the delegated ones in an overwhelming majority rejected the proposal of the weighting of each country in the EZB executive committee according to the weighting of the individual Ökonomien, which would bring obviously a Erstarkung to the position of Germany with itself.
The chancellor considered on calming of the climate within its party from there to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl strengthened the points of reference. It did not try however no more to win itself their congress at the expense of the " small” or the European countries in difficulties which would criticize arrogant Germany immediately.
As far as the European request dedicates a paragraph to the significance of the " French-German friendship”, Angela Merkel France does not call on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this reminds of the fact that Leipzig stood two centuries ago in the center of a bloody battle.
Actually one zuhöchst humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What represents the fraud with sick notes?
After the family allowance UMP and government tackle now the sick notes.
Nicolas Sarkozy becomes on the Tuesday, which 15 November in Bordeaux arrive, in order to visit a family allowance cash and to state a speech over - already since 2007 always recurring - the topic of the fight against social fraud as well as economic dependence on the state.
In order to accompany this attack, which proceeds from the tendency to submit the economy in a hardness test on which however not less harbinger of an axle of the right presidency campaign represents other side, wants the majority on employee sick notes to concentrate.
First with an household-economical goal: the government visiert the introduction of a fourth Karenztages before consideration of a sick note at employees in the private sector on.
On well German this that a gotten sick employee without grant of the specific company would lose the wages of four days, means thus thus at least 15% of its monthly income.
A Maβnahme, which threatens to cause according to the daily paper of " Les Echos” anger, would help however to bring in 280 million euro.
And with another Maβnahme of a rather symbolic character would go: the civil servant a unvergüteten Karenztag in the medical case to grant (so far there is no waiting period for it, in contrast to the three waiting periods in the private sector,).
Meanwhile these questions in the discussion stand, kindle the majority likewise again the fraud topic, whereby this time the abuse connected with work absence one aims at.
“Controls will be substantially more important, and beyond that these are to be backrecompensed, if this is demanded”, warned Xavier edge of praying on Sunday, 13 November before the microphone of the transmitter RTL.
As also in other cases the effects of this message seem a little disproportionate regarding the reality of fraudulent actions in ranges of the sick notes.
This is indeed already since 2002 article of permanent observation as well as more politically offensive ones, which carried most frequently fruits.
The Frenchmen are not more frequently ill any longer than persons of other place one in Europe.
We stay however first with the country-wide numbers.
According to the national health insurance company CNAM in the year 2006 more than 237 million euro daily compensations were disbursed.
Gemäβ of the economic research and institute for documentation of the health service represented the daily compensations in the year 2008 with 11.3 billion euro 5% of the expenditures for health.
Under this amount 46% fell concerning maternity leave as well as concerning industrial accidents and 54% illness vacation, heiβt 6.2 billion euros.
And therefore 2.5% expenditures for health.
In the year 2010 in relation to the 17.8 days in the year 2009 according to a study of Alma Consulting group of on the average only 14.5 patient days were entitled to the Frenchman.
An average value, which hushes up certain differences: another, in the year 2007 by Monster.com, was published Website for career management, pointed that 75% of the 40. 000 asked, French employee out indicated, not one patient day to have taken.
Another, this time of the health insurance seized study gets straight that 37% of the sick notes were in the year 2010 of shorter duration than 8 days\; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between and three months and 11% over it.
Compared to their European neighbors the French employees do not tend thus any longer than elsewhere to inability to work.
One in the year 2010 of two researchers of the French, national center for science research (CNRS) led long-term study showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absence ratio (illness or otherwise justified) reciprocated, in France between 10% and 11% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the united kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud with sick notes represents a infinitesimal small portion regarding the moonlighting.
Concerning the fraud only a weak Ausmaβ is reached here.
Encouraging the legislation since 2002 brings with itself that there are systmatische controls with sick notes, which exceed 45 days.
In the year 2008 the CNAM (public university for out and further training of technicians and engineers) under 1.5 million controls determined that 13% of the 285,000 of the realized, short term sick notes, which was heiβt in 37.050 cases”, unjustified or too long”.
With the systematically controlled cases of sick note of more than 45 days duration counted one under 1.2 million 11% at " maladjusted or unjustified” cases, heiβt 132.000.
Altogether this makes thus 169,000 " unjustified” cases on several millions employees, which made a sick note valid.
A number, which only a weak Ausmaβ represents opposite for example that the moonlighting.
According to the UMP delegate Dominique Tian, author in July of a special report regarding this question, appeared, represents this between 9 and 15 billion euro tax loss of earnings per year, i.e. more as the total costs at daily remuneration, and thus substantially more than the fraud with latter.
Dad demo: Greece should a new adjustment plan would bring in
Greece has a new post processor necessarily for interception of its economics.
This had on Monday, which 14 November of the prime ministers Lucas dad demo before the parliament under adding the fact announced that those were not sufficient its government on the part of the union granted one hundred days, in order to settle this task.
“Around the efforts toward a Erstarkung of the economy, need we would continue being able support of our European partners as well as a new program for the budget adjustment”, explained the head of government in its first public speech during the Eröffung the debate over the confidence vote of the parliament on Wednesday.
The conversion of the decisions made on the occasion of the euro summit on 27 October is the " main task” of the new government, since the co-operation of the country would stand within the Eurozone " on the play”, as it added.
Accordingly M. Papademos planned to lower the state deficit of the country " around the 9%” of the gross domestic product today up to the end of the year after this was in the year 2010 10.6% and in the year 2009 about 15,7%.
The new Sparmaβnahmen rejects the rights
Antonis Samaras, boss of the right wing, had given, had however ahead-sent its agreement on Monday to the Maβnahmen already approved regarding escaping from the debt crisis serving an attempt that its party would not erkären itself ready for an additional Sparmaβnahme.
“We will co-ordinate not in favor of new Maβnahmen”, said it on the occasion of a diet of its party new democracy.
He had ready explained himself with the defaults of the reduction of budgetary deficit and debts, just as to the fight against the wasting, faced however jedweder policy hostilely, which would prevent the economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, with economic and tasks of currency of European Union-Kommisar entrusted, which had prevented that IMF and European Union do not release the necessary loan over 8 billion euros without written warranty of all parties over their support of the planned Maβnahmen, had Antonio Samaras answered that its word is sufficient and it would not sign anything under pressure of Auβen.
Euthanasia and accompanied suicide must be legalized, such a braintrust
The Canadians live in refusal of death, as comes out from a report of the royal society of Canada
The committee explained that governments, institutions of hygiene and physicians co-operated regarding schmerzlindernder treatment around the best schmerzlindernden means ready to place, and this also going beyond the cases of cancer.
The Canadian society lives in a refusal attitude in relation to death.
Only 9% the Canadian admit themselves actually to speak with their physician about conditions die under those them would like and to meet arrangements for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report of the royal society of Canada, in which six experts were involved, who are on different fields of activity, among other things ethics, right and medicine, with one another linked.
This committee recommends to the government to amend the penal law in such a manner in order accompanied suicide and euthanasia to permit, where this choice places itself, with patients, whom as in the situation is regarded, such a decision to meet.
As prelude the experts quote a recently published survey of the independent society EIU, which had with one another compared the death quality in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada placed itself here on 10th rank, the study that “the medical dying support brought a culture out in Canada, notices in which humans fear has, the topic death to begin to cut”.
Medical support or not: 77% the Canadian do not have an entrance to pain killing means, then report to us the experts ordered by the royal society of Canada.
And despite the majority desire of the Canadians to die at home then however finally 68.6% of these die in the hospital.
Regarded from the entire country the rate with 86% is on in the hospital entered deaths in the Quebec highest.
In the delicate question concerning euthanasia and accompanied suicide come the authors of the report to conclusions, those the position of the federal government, that already geäuβert to want to make no changes of the penal law concerning euthanasia and accompanied suicide are against-directed.
Now however it gives according to the experts, who gleichermaβen all those countries examined, whose approach euthanasia and it accompanied suicide legalized or decriminalized no proof that such a decriminalization Miβbräuche in their application, thus practice execution by euthanasia or accompanied suicide of unkompetenten or not consenting persons would lead to.
On the contrary one meets substantially more cases of such infringements straight in the countries, in which euthanasia and accompanied suicides are not legalized, like yesterday Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, in a teleconference confirmed.
To “in Canada, where she is clearly illegal it is practiced euthanasia.”
“One practices suicides also accompanied in Canada, although here clearly illegaly”, Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians endorse the euthanasia
We realize that according to in the year 2010 an accomplished Angus Reid survey 85% the Canadian had already geäuβert themselves in favor of the euthanasia, since they the opinion are these permit it persons in the end their journey through life to moderate their suffering.
And 66% believe that circumstances of a legalization of the euthanasia do not have as a consequence to obtain the message that the life of older or handicapped humans less value besäβe.
Regarding the persons, who already practiced to accompanied suicide, the asked ones hold the opinion to 41% that these should not be criminally pursued.
Which or attitude of the means concerns maintenance with patients, situation presents itself so the authors of the report as less clear.
Likewise these put in their recommendation listing close that in the penal law it is not to be indicated that setting the means off, for which a legal refusal was present when criminally is to be valid.
The braintrust demands beyond that specialists of the health service in the task should be trained to respect a setting of the means off at the end of life and this without criminal pursuit to be afraid to have.
The committee explained that governments, institutions of hygiene and physicians co-operated regarding schmerzlindernder treatment, in order to place the best schmerzlindernden means ready and this also going beyond the cases of cancer.
The committee last demands regarding the means extensively used already in the Canadian institutions to hygiene to pain relief or lebensabschlieβender Maβnahmen to consider these at least since these just as few served as the euthanasia for it, physical pain to reduce and these to the same procedures would refer.
Reserves other experts
Some experts on the area of law of the health service already stated reservations regarding the conclusions of the expert report of the royal society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in the health right, called the attitude of the report-signing experts among other things " extremely”, since this does not set with patients in the final phase any limits to euthanasia practice.
“This opens the gates for a situation, in which everyone, which is world-weary and older than 18 years, another person to ask, it helpful in its suicide to be”, so RA Deschamps, which had examined a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps stressed likewise, the authors of the report seemed to place the sole responsibility of the particular over all other values, which are involved in the social Gewirke of the society.
Now however, then he says, would give it " guidelines and obligations in a society”.
Margaret Somerville, specialist for health right, likewise expressed " a strong resistance” in relation to the conclusions of the report, which she dubbed as " pro euthanasia manifest”.
Margaret Somerville, which is even member of the royal society of Canada, doubts in particular the information of report concerning the Nichtvorliegens of abuses in certain countries, in which euthanasia and accompanied suicides are legalized, as for example in the Netherlands and in Oregon.

“Those in the middle east, which cannot be in peacetime with their people and not to please this, must go”, explained it into allusion on Syria, which neighboring country, to which Turkey takes a constantly more roughly becoming attitude.
The United States begrüβt for their part the " aggravation of the Konsensus against Assad as well as the machinations of the Syrian regime” due to the decisions of the Arab league as well as the European union.
“International community, United States, European Union, Arab league and countries like Turkey fastened ever more sharply becoming tone in view of repressions in Syria one”, then Mark observes toner, a spokesman of the state department.
During this time 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government power came in the region of Dar'a in the south of Syria to death, then the Syrian observatory for human right OSDH announced.
Two further civilians were according to these NGO with " shootings and heavy bomb attacks around Jobar” in besieged city Homs around the life come.

It has by the way with reproduction on the resolution of the Arab league to suspend Damascus from its tasks to reacted, which represents according to its estimate a “dangerous step”.
Syria " will would not fail giving way”, added it under the asseveration, “against Syria of forged plot”.
After the resolution to the suspension of Syria the Arab league examines at present now a " protective mechanism for civilians” and wishes the delegation of 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media as well as military observers into the country.
The French Auβenhandelsminister Alain Juppé had likewise expressed itself in favor of the delegation of UN observers, in order to stand for civilians protecting against repressions of the regime that it after into its " paranoia” encapsulates itself, to the side.

Russian scientist helps the Iranian nuclear energy program
A Russian scientist, Wjatscheslaw Danilenko, helped Iran to develop a blasting cap usable with a nuclear weapon then one confirmed specialized, American NGO on atomic risks on Monday.
Institut for science and international security ISIS is based the result on recent the report of the international agency for atomic security AIEA as well as other one, of this UN agency outgoing documents, appeared, for the determination of this scientist.
The AIEA had communicated last week their " serious concern” on the occasion of a " possible military dimension” of the Iranian nuclear program.
According to detailed study of the AIEA documents on the part of ISIS the 1934 born Danilenko obviously since beginning of the 60's over three decades long in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (the Urals) had worked and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
1989 or 1991 he is to have left the center, in order to create an enterprise in Kiev, which manufactures " nano-diamonds”.
The economic difficulties of its enterprise would have led it in the year 1995 to contact the Iranian message in Ukraine.
Before its return to Russia it participated then from 1996 to 2002 in an Iranian program.
In its last report the AIEA did not only mention " strong references on it that the Iranian development” of a nuclear explosive system had been supported " by the work of a foreign expert, that in this technology äuβerst bewandert seie, but beyond that, like a state member communicated to the agency, its entire vocational career over essential on this technology directly on the military nuclear energy program of its country of origin had worked.”

The Microblogging website Twitter introduced on Monday changes in the presentation of its platform, in order to make possible for its users in particular to observe the activities of those which follow their entries, what the service once more that from Facebook resemble lets.

Austria
Entry of a " golden household rule” into the condition
Itself the government of the groβen social-democratic/Christian-democratic coalition in Austria on power decided on Tuesday to take up a " golden household rule” to the condition in order to reduce and avoid also a possible degradation on the part of rating agencies in the Top creditworthiness of Austria (AAA) public deficits.
It was most personal social-democratic chancellor Werner Faymann, which had announced this resolution of the exit of the Council of Ministers, although the public Austrian state debt is with 74,6%, thus by far over by the of Maastricht contract determined the criterion of 60%, however clearly below the debt level of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“The solvency of Austria would not have been reduced at one blow from AAA to AA+, then we would have to pay each year three billion euro interest additionally”, to argued Michael Spindelegger, vice-chancellor and Christian-democratic Auβenminister.
Austria allows likewise to a demand Brussels summits of the member states of the Eurozone from 26 October: The heads of state and government would have required at that time the admission of the reduction of public deficits until the end of the year 2012 as well as a return to the public account balance to the condition or by decree of an equivalent law.
The Maβnahme for this seized by the Austrian government resembles the " German model”, since Germany had been the first European country, which had taken up such a " rule” to the condition.
Up to the year 2017 the structural budgetary deficit should lower itself each year around 0,75% of the gross domestic product (Gross Domestic Product), starting from 2017 should the structural budgetary deficit of the Federal State the 0,35%-Grenze of the Gross Domestic Product not exceed, whereas the regional states should exhibit balanced households just like the communities.
A goal is it to eliminate in the horizon of 2020/21 the household debts under by the of Maastricht agreement the determined 60%-Kriteriums.
Strong yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention on the currency markets
The Japanese prime minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday before the fact that the Japanese office force would intervene again on the currency markets, if the yen should rise further.
“We should determine an excessive volatility” in the rate of exchange the yen ", then we will have likewise intervened, like we it the last mark doing”, explained M. Noda in the senate.
On Tuesday the yen had up-snapped again close to the historical levels, which had forced the Japanese authorities on 31 October to intervening.
On this day Tokyo had sold substantial yen against dollar to head for in order to lower the Japanese foreign exchange value, which is thereby, a new record value since 1945 in relation to the dollar.
The yen rose however regelmäβig over it, doped by purchases of investors, who regard the yen as “refuge value” in these uncertain times of world economy wing over and indebtedness crisis in Europe.
The dollar is on Tuesday under 77 yen pleases, which is euro under the symbolic slat of 105 yen into the proximity of the levels slipped, which had triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis 2008-2009 more noted the dollar around the 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This flash in the pan of the Japanese foreign exchange harms the exports of the archipelago, there it the costs of the " larvae in Japan” - the income value drawn by Japanese companies from the foreign country, there this raises the price of and reduces products these it in national currency conversions.
“Japan fights after the earthquake as well as the tsunami at the 11. March, which devastated the region Tohoku (northeast), for its reconstruction”, stresses M. Noda, who fears, this price increase the yen can weak recovery already in the germ kill.
Third economic world power has with growth in the third quarter -1.5% in the comparison to the preceeding quarter to the first time in this year owing to the precipitous export increases and the consumption by the disaster “lead-sealed” households again at traction power won.
The prime minister estimates however that the price increase " the economic foundations of Japan” does not reflect the yen.
The Minister of Finance Jun Azumi requested for his part the bank OF (BoJ) Japan, which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary committee on Tuesday, to seize all conceivable Maβnahmen in order to weaken the yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the institute, informed the BoJ however over it, already " suitable Maβnahmen” introduced, with which he let announce that on Wednesday no additional currency loosening was to be expected.
On the occasion of the last meeting at the end of Octobers had increased the issuing bank their state obligation purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros), in order to erase the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euro) gross margins, which she had spent on different purchases of financial titles, in order to inundate the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rates fast into the height, stock exchanges make backdowns
The infection risk of the debt crisis undermines steadily European characteristic numbers.
Despite the office admission of the new heads of government in Greece and Italy as well as the best growth numbers in France and Germany the rates of the weakened Länders continue to rise steadily.
The stock exchanges, which are anxious still around the stability of the Eurozone, drift also this Tuesday, 15 November still a little more into negative realm off.
In Paris the CAC lost o'clock at 10 1.4% and fell on 3.064 points.
The DAX in Frankfurt decreased around 0,4%, London around 0,1%.
“Due to the new tensions concerning the net yields of the government loans in itself the Eurozone in difficulties the world-wide stock markets continue publishing a part their recent profits.
“The capital investors are nervous and only to well the infection risk conscious”, explain themselves Terry Pratt, institutional broker with IG Markets, quoted by the press agency Reuters.
The stock exchange in Tokyo, which suffers for its part from the renewed fear of the market players regarding the capacity in Europe that the debt crisis continues to persist, had with a fall of prices of 0,7% closed.
"" Japan directed its eyes just like the rest of the world toward Europe, and the trade moves on limited variation passage, as long as the investors do not have proofs for it that the situation stabilized, estimates” Mitsushige Akino, fund manager with Ichiyoshi investment management.
This resurgence of the concern over the future of the Eurozone damages the single currency, which continues its Baiss at on Tuesday.
The euro moves for one and a half months on its lowest level.
Around 10 o'clock the European validity was worth 1.3570 Doller, it gave way thus around 0,4%.
According to the stock brokers it decreased, after the CDU, a party of the chancellor Angela Merkel, who had met on Monday in the congress, had allowed to a request, which plans in particular the possibility for itself in difficulties present countries of withdrawing from the Eurozone without the European union to leave at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are the far under 6%-Grenze.
The interests on loans of Italy and Spain are further on very disturbing level.
This Tuesday mornings reached the net yield of the Italian obligations on 10 years 6.85%, that of the Spanish titles matured on 6,2% near.
These tensions of the interest rates in the southerners, in addition, in France, feed further the fears of the investors.
The future Italian head of government Mario Monti called more time in from the markets, in order to repair the situation in Italy, threatened by paralysis by the burden of debts.
The new Greek prime minister Lucas dad demo had for his part confirmed, the conversion on the occasion of on 27 October of summit of the Eurozone made decisions were " the main task” of his government.
Spain is in the Visir of the markets, since on Sunday the parliamentary elections in the country take place.
The interest shears (“spread”) between the German and Spanish 10-yearly obligations achieved again a new, historical high.
In expectation of growth numbers of the Eurozone
Statistically seen booked France an economic growth of 0,4% in the third quarter, carried by the household consumption, ergo a little better than the expected 0.3%.
The Federal Statistical Office INSEE had revised however the fall of prices of the numbers of the second quarter, with a minus of 0,1% of the gross domestic product (Gross Domestic Product) in place of a stagnation.
In truth it is the fourth quarter, which worries the economics experts at most.
Germany had to register for his part during the same period a growth from 0,5% to.
A first computer forecast of the entire Eurozone is expected at 11 o'clock, whereby the European Commission before the risk of a renewed recession warns.
Energy policy:
Facts should triumph over dogmas
If a topic exists that on basis by short term views or due to emotions may not be treated, then this is surely the energy policy.
Availability and costs of the electricity affect the purchasing power as well as the competitive power of the enterprises in direct Maβe.
Reasonably, a choice meeting is to be taken to the cause to think about this topic as well as about the position of the nuclear energy.
The debate will carry fruits only if it sounds out the whole of economic, social and ecological consequences of the suggested options.
The Frenchmen should found their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although 7 billion humans on this planet are, the demographic evolution advances a duplication of the electricity demand up to the year 2050, is not an enormous portion of the world population without a vital element to do to have.
At the same time one must moderate the shortage of fossil resources, in order to be able to produce electricity further steadily, without forgetting the compelling necessity for the decrease of the greenhouse gas missions, a topic, disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to fight against climatic Unregelmäβigkeiten.
The accident of Fukushima does not change this parameter.
Therefore Germany blebt further in its decision in an isolated manner to do without nuclear power.
This is neither the case in Belgium, which subjects its decision of the necessity to find a substitutionable spare source still in Switzerland, which intends just to only build nuclear power stations of the last generation.
Groβbritannien, Finland, Poland, the Czech republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, in order to call only some states, pursue their projects against it further with determination.
The United States decided for their part after Fukushima to attach their park a further unit by taking the work Three Mile Island shut down after the atomic accident again in enterprise.
Even if, the German model aligned to renewable energy sources is put occasionally as model, then however the reality contradicts the discourse.
The choice in Berlin will settle in form of a rise in price of the electricity price, an energetic dependence intensified by the increased resort to import gas in particular of the CO2 emissions caused by Russia, a rise by gas and coal-fired power stations.
The whole of these unpleasant effects will become apparent already within a few months.
The case Denmark gives cause for thinking.
Denmark is on the one hand European table leader regarding wind energy, from which it refers 30% of its electricity, on the other hand one is the country of one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternating used with wind energy\; due to its are its CO2 emissions as well as its electricity price higher around 65% and 50% in each case than the appropriate European average value.
Owing to the stability of our energy policy our neighbors pay an electricity bill higher contrary to our French households around 40%.
Since the energy price in the globalized economy represents a key role of the competitive power as well as a stability pledge of the industry on national ground, the French enterprises have an advantage due to the most favorable electricity in Europe.
Each significant reduction concerning the nuclear power would draw from there a strong increasing of the energy price, which would let the noble statements about the Reindustrialisierung of our country and the defense of the purchasing power become the illusion.
Surveys showed that the one price was, which is ready the groβe majority of the Frenchmen just as few to pay, as she shows resistance against the principle of this energy source.
We realize that the energy policy of our country made it possible to construct a branch of industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character it brings an enormous amount of specialized small and medium-size enterprises on the international markets and makes this creators of innumerable jobs.
If France should seize the resolution to step out of the nuclear power then a Groβteil of these KMU would fall to the victim, and that would shrink annual 6 billion euros at capital goods and nuclear energy export more and more.
Which electrician would assign a EPR conceived for functioning on sixty years, if the fall pre-programmes its producer is?
Around the energetic equation to solve one must grant that there is just as little as a devil's work a miracle drug for the production of electricity.
Of the company Areva developed, to CO2 arms solutions for the application of nuclear power and renewable energy witnesses from the complementarity of the energy sources.
The highest possible safety level upright too received is for the nuclear power an absolute imperative.
In France we have a security authority, which accomplishes uncompromising and transparent controls in works already existing as for example at the building in Flamanville.
Their teams, which made themselves due to their professionalism a name, straight are too possessed of the safety conception.
Within 50 years the nuclear industry experienced three serious incidents.
More only one, in Three Mile Island, under normal operation conditions entered\; thus it ran without consequences for humans and environment.
In Chernobyl the drama was caused by reactor construction as well as unendschuldbares, human failure.
With Fukushima it seems to forget some that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented extent, the death of several ten thousand humans caused.
The nuclear industry will draw its teachings likewise from this accident, as it had done this after the two preceeding.
When, the EPR a draft represents fruit of this approach as well as a co-operation of the security authorities of the French and German operators and technical designers of nuclear power stations, which makes ruggedness for it possible in relation to such phenomena.
Since it is judged among the electrical engineers as desirable to build a nuclear power station then a suspension of building work would be in Flamanville a marvelous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF, by leaving free course to them to actually tear the leading position in the inevitable nuclear power development.
It is inevitable and legitimate to look for the best Energiebouquet for our country however it would be irresponsible, emotions, to let dogmas and Parteimanöber dominate a debate the just as economic, social and financial situation of our country determined.
Is immigration load or opportunity for the economy?
The immigration politics led among Nicolas Sarkozy were criticized from various angles - overloading of police, court and administrative organs due to the numbers subjected a policy, compatibility of this politics with the status of a “country of the human rights”, as France had called itself.
Recently the annoyance from official side, directed against foreign students, had coined the newsreels, the Minister of the Interior had casually (see Libération of 23. May) announces that France does not have " talents, bricklayers or waiters from the foreign country necessarily”.
But this politics were analyzed only rarely from the economic criterion.
Over this topic an extensive consent between rights and linking prevails.
The tone of Jacques Chirac was fastened from right side, who had explained 1976 that " 900,000 unemployed persons, among them over 2 million immigrierte workers, might not represent a problem for a country”, from left side by Michel Rocard, who had stated 1990 to France " could not the entire poverty of the world take up”.
Only difference exists in the degree of the Groβzügigkeit
The fear of the invasion of the national ground by hordes of Polish plumbers was divided in the year 2005 both from right and from left.
The immigrants were noticed of both bearings as load for the economy and the French society.
The only difference exists in degrees of the Groβzügigkeit, which are determined one opposite the immigrants to admit.
Francois Hollande is limited its program to banalities, which refer to it, partnership development permits it to solve our " migration problems”.
This conception of immigration as load, as problem, can possibly affect the elections\; however it is economically costly.
Realize like us the economics experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in recent a work appeared, which summarizes the newest realizations concerning immigration (exceptional People: How migration Shaped Our World and wants DEFINE Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University presses, 352 S.), existed under the specialist a broad consent regarding the positive influence of the immigrant flood on economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.
The immigration to limit would weaken growth and would damage the job market situation.
The fears in relation to the influence of the migrants are based on the conception that these threaten, which indigenous labor, in particular small qualified, to substitute by exerting pressure on their wages.
The experience shows however that the immigrants are in truth substantially complementary as as the native hired hands, since they exercise schwerpunktmäβig occupations in sectors, which are job-technically not fully utilized.
The small qualified immigrants work in sectors, which little provoke native hired hands, who work more qualified among the immigrants in dynamic sectors, in which the training is not adapted to the work offer.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon difficulties would have to work in a country in which a lack of Anästhesisten prevails, then causes this complementarity also between native ones and migrants a positive effect of the immigrant influx on wages and domestic job market situation.
Giovanni Peri computed in this way that a one percent rise of the immigrant flood causes a referred, long-term increase of real wages between 0,6% and 0,9%.
And these without consideration of the fact that the variety of the idea creation as well as the economic growth brought in by the immigrants is beneficial (high portion of nationalized immigrants under American Nobel Laureates\; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were created by immigrants).
The migrants contribute likewise net to the social welfare systems, in the European countries on average approximately at a value of 1% of the total budget.
The world Labor Organization estimates for example that a person immigrating in the age from 30 years to Germany on the average brings in over his lifetime a net contribution (incomes minus expenditures) of over for the public household the 150,000 euros.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to cause the missing intersections to start of his mandate " with the teeth”.
These mentioned teeth, which should deter the immigrants, obtained however exactly the contrary effect.
Europe has the democracy invented, now remains, to think the European democracy out
Democracy is a valuable property\; likewise a sensitive property.
The European continent should be able itself to remind of it, who after their invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago entire 20. Century over the tragedies of the First World War, the totalitarianism, the Holocaustes, the Gulag, in addition, Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the highest one in Greece over itself had let be issued.
Some had probably believed, it is sufficient to exercise the right to vote on possible way direktest, in order to see winning the democracy once and for all over its enemies.
One knows since Napoleon " the small one” that it concerned a characteristic of the attitude of mind.
The general right to vote, which represents necessary condition of the democracy, is not for this sufficient condition and can the " suppression instrument” become just as good, as it expressed the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot at that time.
No, democracy requires by far more: a public area, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of the force, training, clearing-up, economic and social team spirit, an jurisdiction.
The crisis in Europe, in which we are, is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and first of all politics and democracy crisis.
The convicition change of the Greek true wrong referendum would have had a doubly informative character in this regard: once that the necessity for a strong return of the policy, on the other side in addition, that of the disturbing feeling of their impossibility, their inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be judged as outdated.
Truth is that the front lines of the democratic fight shifted today, and that the republican soldiers, or at least most of them aim, to no more in the correct direction.
We do not have to win anything, over on a success of the domestic referendum to urge, which was organized in dependence of the necessities and in wrong order.
A free pass for the European autocrat or a leap with connected eyes into the emptiness of the nationalistic retreat: A groβartige choice for the citizen!
No, we want heel hatchet, but a collective task, from full right, clarified and constantly, a choice and a democracy, this time on European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - one does not know no more im Übrigen already, to terminate where enumerating - there it only one crisis gives, and this prevails in Europe.
It is completely Europe, which bends itself the dictation of the markets and the rating agencies, which suffers from its powerlessness and its lack of solidarity.
It is completely Europe, which is humiliated on international level.
One is concerned about sovereignty transfers toward Europe - it is whole Europe, which lose gradually its sovereignty, and thus each particular it attached nations.
The urgency consists of giving to sovereignty of the people the guidance of the European project back to the hand.
Because it is because of the whole been, whether the Europeans reduce the load of their debts, from the markets freely to make themselves and a future by investments to initiate can.
The exit from the crisis has resolutions on European level on the condition, which does not please without total democratic Rechtmäβigkeit become can, without leading us completely surely into spoiling.
After this proposal was over fought against Jacques Delors and the socialist long time, today everyone pushes the European business management in addition.
In agreement.
But itself this without political integration and a stronger democracy - how it is on his mind the citizens - to present, would be a renewed foolishness and a further dead end.
We must take a new stage of European structure on us.
In order to let in France the republic develop, required it the fact, republican “create”.
The revolution of the interests alone could here is not sufficient carries out.
This instruction remains further valid.
We must form Europe integrated better on economical level.
This can be only achieved, by creating politically seen more democratic Europe, a truthfully European sovereignty of the people.
We need Europeans, in order to create Europe.
“Contactless ones” smart cards become the common property/knowledge
The world fair for smart cards opens close Paris in optimistic attitude their gates on Tuesday in Villepinte.
The year 2011 should actually end according to euro Smart with a 11%-igen increase of world-wide sales units sold of microprocessor chips (kinds of hitting a corner, SIM map telephone), with more than 6 billion.
The basic segment is here the contactless technology, which makes payments in public means of transport or payment possible of purchases, by holding completely simply the map by a reader.
Opposite the one year before sold 320 million should this year 460 million contactless smart cards world-wide be sold!
Their market share should increase in the year 2012 still further (580 million expected units) and over 10% of the global smart card market (6.925 million maps) to represent.
Europe wins regarding the contactless payment at ground, after it lagged behind long time of the region Asia Pacific.
Some 26 million visa maps are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 Zahlungsterminals accept these.
In France the beginnings are rather modest: Only 400,000 contactless visa maps were spread.
The consumer markets make however steam.
Carrefour emitted from there this year 2.5 million contactless passport MasterCards.
In order to change over to higher speed, it is now necessary that the banks equip their customers with these maps.
“Two groβe French financial establishments committed themselves to hand to their customers out in the future systematically bank cards which are equipped with contactless chip, announce” Gérard Nébouy, general manager of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
That is however only a first stage on the way to the currency of the future: the mobile phone.
A infinitesimal small percentage at devices is so far equipped with the NFC technology necessary for the execution of these transactions (Near Field Communication).
“You are guessed/advised in delay”.
“However they should experience at least next year a genuine upward development.”
“We count in the year 2012 on the sale from 80 to 120 million units world-wide”, explain Marc Bertin, chairman von Eurosmart.
But the banks seize initiative.
Crédit Agricole had announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run off from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a cap, which permits contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also the Société Générale had yesterday stated to prepare the introduction on the market of an offer which makes its customer possible contactless payment by mobile phone.
Terrorist front understands itself, about Sahara until Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between Al Qaida in Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.
Those is already enough under suspicion standing relations between the terrorist group of Al Qaida in Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and seem to be confirmed to the Nigerian sect Boko Haram.
On Sunday the Algerian vice Auβenminister Abdelkader Messahel had confirmed that Algiers had now over it " certainty attained”.
“The way, with both organizations proceed as well as the relations of the secret services point to a clear co-operation”, explained it without further into the detail to go.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigations over in last January the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in the Niger, taken place, interfaces to day promoted.
The Antoine de Léocour kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey of supporters of the Aqmi and Vincent Delory are on the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of an operation accomplished by the French special-purpose forces getöten to be.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found in the rubble at the place of work several telephone chips, to the terrorist belonged.
Terrorist axle
The analysis of the led telephone calls leads to several interlocutors, who are stationed in Nigeria in Mali, in the Niger as well as.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI) the investigators interest in particular the numbers two interlocutors: A number leads to a Nigerian, the long time in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram had be\; the other one leads to a man, who is considered as the Aqmi and the sect close standing.
“This is a progress, one must however without a doubt clearer proofs await, before one can speak of an operational co-operation between Aqmi and Boko harem”.
“It is however conceivable”.
“One knows for years that the sect refers financial and intellectual support of Auβen and that this shows up increasingly actively, reduces” the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In these last months these " supporting benefits” became ever more obvious in their process, likewise the responding as well as the operation modes of Boko harem, which points now to consulting suicide bombers as well as the use of always more complex becoming explosives, which carry the same handwriting as those, which were used by Aqmi.
The international community, in order to begin with Washington, exerted pressure on Abuja for this time, so that one carries there for the problems of bill caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities judged the grouping indeed long time as community of Illuminaten, which does not have to be given special attention.
Fast success
The Boko Haram created in the year 2002 in Maiduguri in environment of a mosque, a school as well as the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which is meant a dishonor” in Haoussa so much as " the western education - the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria pursues.
In this region without means the union experiences rapid successes.
It politicizes itself and claims strict adherence to the sharia, while you use ourselves attached activists in the fight against the gottlose center government.
The activists has first churches, bar and authorities in the visor.
2009 showed up the activists their attacks against the Kommissariate, intensified by Boko Haram with, particularly actively.
The reaction on the part of Abuja is however as usual indifferenziert.
The army encircles the city, one counts 800 deads.
The Mohammed Yusuf taken in captivity is killed in the prison.
Consequently the sect becomes appreciably more radical and leaves its centers in the north.
Last Christmas well-known it itself to an assassination attempt in Jos, which claimed 80 human lives, then to a further in Abuja.
In June Boko Haram the debt of a suicide attack is assigned, which occurred in secured police headquarters in Abuja - first its art.
In August the local seat of the United Nations turns out to the priority international target.
The education of a terrorist axle in Africa, which is to lead from Mauritania across Nigeria until to Somalia, worries since then all security experts.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger occupied, which operates Somalier of Al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week hatta Alain Juppé on the occasion of a discussion with president Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria before Boko harem warned and itself ready shown” to communicate all references”.
Die Welt gemäβ the republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival to Iraq as well as the assistance for Israel in simplification and unawareness concerning China.
A crisis-weakened America knows a complex world with simple, in order not to say: naive ideas lead?
If one listens to the republican presidential candidate in such a way, the voters could get nearly this impression.
For some days Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their fellow combatant let their thundering explanations as well as their statements announce concerning the Auβenpolitik, traditional republican emphasis, repetitive.
Over China, Iran and the Israel assistance - supported frequently in no way - slogans fall.
Mitt Romney standing regarding the appointment of the “Grand old party” most highly in the course threatened the Chinese before the WTO to quote and them the " manipulation of the currency” - prominent topic in an America to accuse that by the drift of entire branches of industry to Asia on the Äuβerste attractive actual.
Stupidly run, if this were to imply an introducing of an economic war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador in China among Obama and only candidate, which seem to have a matured vision from Auβenpolitik to, pinched itself off almost regarding its emotions flattering of behavior air.
It had called to a strong, but constructional discussion exchange with Peking (likewise the current attitude of Obama).
But Huntsman is not answered, since he stagnates in the depths of the public opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney had praised likewise military impacts against Iran, if the sanctions should fail for stopping the nuclear program.
“Case I am selected, order I to Iran stop”, he had sounded.
“Obama is re-elected, gets her the bomb”.
Auβerdem has it Israel strengthened military assistance promised and Obama accused this partner in relation to obligations to have remained guilty.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, secondarymost placed candidate, carries for his part an shameful document unawareness to the exhibition.
Recently it called to give the Chinese military threat retort there Peking " tried to develop a nuclear power” - and seemed thereby the fact more auβer eight to leave that China already is since 1964 in the possession of military atomic weapons!
The Texan governor Rick Perry, which supports Israel and demands military impacts against Iran, äuβert for his part, to be ready for it the American army in Mexico against drug trusts in service to take.
The resort to Foltermaβnahmen opposite mutmaβlichen terrorists, forbidden by Obama 2009, was likewise endorsed by Cain, Perry as well as the Kandidation Michele Bachmann.
One is far to the republican candidate from John McCain, in the year 2008, a auβenpolitischen heavyweight.
Against the current presidency contractors, Reagan had likewise simple conceptions and won for all that the cold war.
They call in memory that also Obama is in amateur and water had to give into its wine, which concerned the topic anti-terror.
They persist rightfully in the failure of its naive conversation with Iran, the hasty departure of its " boys” from Iraq, to its indetermination in Libya, which likewise brought in the call of the weakness for it.
This meeting with hostility is however not completely so informally.
The population estimates rather the positive balance of national security under Obama, who switched Bin Laden off.
Since Iraq she guards against military interventions, which lead to tiring.
And Obama surprises more appropriately, by arguing, America must economically be rebuilt, in order to arouse its leading position to new life.
North stream, new gate to Russian gas in Europe
The gas pipeline north stream, which runs on the sea-bottom of the Baltic Sea and which western Europe connects directly with Russia, became in enterprise set.
It is gas for an equivalent of 30 million households to supply with.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to commit this event with gloss and Gloria.
Over 500 loaded guests, under it four heads of state and government, have last Tuesday at the Baltic Sea coast under orchestra acoustic irradiation and with Feinschmeckerbuffet of the inauguration of the new gas pipeline north stream attended, Russia and Germany under the sea level directly interconnect.
The German chancellor Angelika Merkel, who Russian president Dmitri Medwedew, which French prime ministers François Fillon as well as its colleague Mark of Rutte from the Netherlands has symbolic-proves together the steering wheel of the valve turned, which carries the Russian gas in the Western European net.
With the new gas pipeline are 27.5 billion cubic meter of additional Russian gas per year by a first piping by 1.224 km length, which connects the region Saint Petersburg with Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, to Western Europe to be produced.
Second piping, which a complete delivery of 55 billion cubic meter gas - which equivalent of the French total consumption - permits, is to at the end of 2012 to be finished placed.
And one lets the eventuality of the building of a third line on be reminiscent already to distance.
For Gazprom the punctual and very precise completion of this enormous building works like a victory.
The project was strongly disputed in Poland and the Baltic states.
The north stream pipeline will make a direct supply of gas possible to Germany, under avoidance of any route process by third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on that overland routes.
For this reason these two countries lose little their power: For it will it now more difficult to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close the admission to Western European markets.
Warsaw to compare most strongly committedly in the debate, was not shied away from it, the north stream pipeline with “new German as well as tables a pact” in binding to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in the year 1939.
This means that the topic is politically seen äuβerst sensitive.
Western Europe won a still higher supply security by the endorsement of this Russian project.
This however at the expense of an exhaustion of European energy, since the project struck a breach between west and east Europeans.
Russia brought it in hardly five years finished, its vision to a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries, which strong gas-uses exhibits and whose gas reserves to the slope go implementing.
“This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery, which connects us in organic way”, confirmed François Fillon during the inauguration of the gas pipeline, by referring to it, into which degrees the groβen gas contracts from more political and to economic side are important.
All this explains the broad smile of the Gazprom managers numerously represented in Lubmin regarding the gas inlet.
The building of this gas pipeline is likewise an outstanding technology.
The underwater pipeline consists of steel with concrete shroud, which is to protect it against anchors.
It rests on the sea-bottom, in approximately 200 m depth.
With its building had to be avoided to dating mine fields from the Second World War.
“About hundreds mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution”, gave Jens Müller, Sprecher of the society north stream, on.
Auβerdem had to be seized strengthened Maβnahmen for the protection of fauna and flora.
The line is heavy a long queue made of metal, like 242 Eiffel Towers, which is interrupted by nothing over the entire length: neither by valves, nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was intended before the coast of Sweden, but the project responsible persons from it distanced oneself, since those were Sweden a little on it eager, to see itself settling a Russian state company in permanent way on height of its coasts.
“In case of an accident we close the gas passage in less than one minute”, specified Jens Müller.
In case of a leakage the gas in the gas pipeline escapes itself thus into air.
This case is only little probably regarded of the technical designers however as, since the Schweiβnähte became estimated on a stability of a leakage per 100,000 year.
The national monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot, which is steered to external observation purposes from a seagoing vessel, as well as by equipment, which circulates inside the gas pipeline.
It possesses the form of a cigar, miβt a meter of diameters, the inside the piping is introduced and by the gas pressure moved.
After three complete days of progressive movement by the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the equipment supplies most exact information about possible deformations of the metal with its arrival.
The gas pipeline was conceived, in order to function to fifty years long, without having to be submitted only of the smallest repair.
The gas circulation is ensured completely simply with pressure.
This amounts to 200 bar at the admission, 100 bar at the discharge position.
Five societies united their forces to the implementation of this project.
Wiring remains however in the hand of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the portions.
Further here the German societies E are. attached ON and BASF (ever to 15.5%), just as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group of firms GDF Suez (ever to 9%).
These five societies formed an enterprise community, which north stream yourself calls and which is assigned the building as well as enterprise of the gas pipeline.
It has its seat in course in Switzerland, where the taxation is particularly favorable.
Gazprom rented then the entire capacity of its gas transport to this society, on verlängerbaren twenty-annual contract.
“Gazprom will pay specified Jens Müller for the overall capacity, no matter how groβ those really transports mass of gas fails”.
The financing of the building of gas pipelines was secured to 30% by shareholders as well as to 70% by bankers' loans.
Entire labor costs should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipings.
For GDF Suez the investment sum amounted to for example 240 million.
The minority shareholders are itself however gewiβ to bring their displays in again since Gazprom carries alone the liability risk.
The gas pipeline comes at a sandy coastal line wooded with jaws with Lubmin from the Baltic Sea to light.
The 4.5 meters of high valves form the gas release gate.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and further characteristic numbers of the arriving gas, before this is passed on into the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday this terminal is supplied with one million cubic meters of Russian gas per applying hour.
With full capacity would be this 3 million cubic meter per hour as well as 6 million in the year 2012.
Moleskine, a mark note book.
From an Italian enterprise before approximately fifteen years in the life called, Moleskine would like to lend now again new style to the letter.
It spent a flair of adventure, with candle light with the letter to hours.
The note book from Moleskine aged easily again recognizably, with its black, rectangular cover, its rubber band, the eierschalfarbenen sides, like over the time.
The Moleskine note book, as one knows it today is however in the year 1997 developed.
The Italian enterprise Modo Modo, which has its seat in Milan, decided to bring at that time a distinguished design note book on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, at that time technical adviser of the enterprise, is assigned the introduction on the market of the new product.
The note book was inspired mole Skin (mole skin) by a traditional production engineering, called, which designates a tree WOL lacquer, which is used for example for purchases of pad banks.
This kind of note book was very much in demand among writers and travelers.
“Moleskine let revive an old and nearly forgotten article again, to in 20. Century as icon of avant-garde artists was valid”, describes Maria Sebregondi, now mark responsible person with Modo Modo.
Success enters.
Between 2006 and 2010 the sales rise around 26% and are established with a paragraph of 12.7 million pieces.
This is far from the used to production of the first years, in which only 3,000 note books were conceived.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and into 70 countries is implemented, from France up to the United States.
It is difficult to make a phantom view of the buyers since the note book inspires likewise businessmen like also students and specialists.
Moleskine has the image of Cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-mental customers.
The small, Italian enterprise, which counted 12 employees in its beginnings, employs today over 100 employees and orders since 2008 over two offices\; one in Milan, the other one in New York.
The enterprise sells its note books in bookstores, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small fashion shops of the city centres and understands themselves on it, its identity to implement.
“We followed the spirit of the time and its new write need, which exist explained Maria Sebregondi despite the recovery of the emails”.
This cultural characteristic is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: Recently the mark launched an exposition named “Detour (detour)”, in which architects and artists issued their own note books.
In August the enterprise brought a cover on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno likewise with leopard sample on the market.
Moleskine profited from its success and this cultural spirit of the time and understood it to diversify its products: Bags, appointment calendar, filler, computer coverings… The mark exhibits the entire range of articles.

Why does the unemployment ratio of handicapped employed persons on so high level remain?
19% of the handicapped persons are approximate on search for a job.
Today begins the " 15. Week of the work for handicapped ones”.
Despite determined public politics, which were introduced in the year 2005, the unemployment ratio is always twice as high with handicapped persons like the average average value: 19% against 9% unemployment of the total population.
Discouraging?
“No, then Éric Blanchet, general manager of the combination Adapt stresses, those “the week of the work for handicapped ones” aligns.”
“Within fifteen years the obtained progress is considerable.”
“At that time the unemployment ratio was not double, but three-way so high.”
“Nevertheless still enormously much remains doing.”
It must be said however that for handicapped unemployed persons further numerous obstacles continue, before they get a job.
More frequently it meets the older ones: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on the average).
They have a small qualification level: 80% of them have no Abitur and it to find only 10,000 obstructed themselves under the 2.3 million student with higher education conclusion.
Finally also long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% with the handicapped ones opposite 38% in the total cut.
In short there are so many criteria, which make a renewed work entrance more difficult, and which the “core of the problem educate”, so Christian Grapin, general manager von Tremplin to enlist 1992 a created combination, which is helpful to enterprises in it, handicapped employed person.
So much to the material brakes.
That remains unexpressed one, which attitudes of mind, which develop further certainly, but nevertheless slowly.
In April a study accomplished by the combination IMS Entreprendre for the magazine La Cité indicated, the asked managers has “a weak knowledge level concerning obstructions”, is “over-represented” “from persons in wheelchairs, psychologically or intellectually to min-crude-averaged”.
Result is that those have private business with more than 20 employees still another far way before itself, in order the employment goal of 6% obstructed employed person, which was fixed in a law of 1987, to be obtained.
These latter, from the year 2008 coming numbers refer to a quotient of 2,6%.
“We are now with over the 3%”, report Pierre Blanc, general manager von Agefiph, the organization, which is assigned to drive contributions of enterprises which ignore this law.
The proof: The number of " fees more paying” business premises was reduced just like the sum of the deposited amounts between 2007 and 2011, zahlenmäβig from 59.000 to 46.000 (and of 606 to 480 million euros).
“The law of 2005, which plans contribution increases, created a strong pressure on the enterprises, explained Pierre Blanc.”
“However this improvement expresses likewise a genuine realization in particular with the groβen groups of firms.”
According to the Ministry for work only 59% of business premises between 20 and 49 employees obstructed employed person, enterprise employ with 100 to 199 employees against it 82%.
Hazard: “Which for a luck”
Already before they offered the forehead to " blue Tuesday evening (20:45 clock), Eden Hazard had and Georges Leekens their pleasure, which brought the friendship game them, does not hide.
It would be too far seized to state it had given a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks symbolic volumes.
Side by side sitting on the spectator podium of the Stade de France George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have closed well and gladly peace.
The Belgian national coach had harvested five months after the temperamental gesture of his attack player against Turkey nothing as praise concerning his person.
“I am very content with Eden, its progress and the fact that he is Belgian”.
“I would like to look forward”, insure the native Liller for his part.
Which concerns the contrast between its representation in club and soccer national team " it is a unit, justifies everything.”
“In Lille am I throughout the year, which the case is not in Belgium”.
“It is time for me, to the start to go”.
Hazard is caused Friday evening to Saint Denis to come, against Romania regarding the matches against France, over finally " to shine”.
Without omitting however the note of the “pleasure”.
It encourages the French national team since the age of 7 years, its victorious campaigns led it between 1998 and 2000.
“I was always supported”, then he confirmed.
This contributes inevitably to strengthen the " singular” character of this meeting still more.
So much in advance: “Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) thereby to be”, realizes it.
“We ran us straight over the way”.
“Against it to play to be allowed groβes luck means!”
Leekens let be reminiscent for his part with bonhomie " pride”.
To deliver “pride, a gala match”.
To confirm “pride” also over - in its characteristic as " neighbors” - that France became " again a crew on very high level”, and the little more than one year after the trauma of Knysna.
“Laurent Blanc carried out, said damn good work” he inspired.
Although Belgium in the next European championship will be missing, then the technician sees the airplane with the blue ones (the French soccer national team) very probably dividing… to direction Brazil in the year 2014.
“We small Belgian come groβ out”, stressed it.
“We participate, a thing to flat, the players are ambitious, them are hungry”.
“You will notice that with the forthcoming plays”. The play against France referred.
Portugal very confidently
The Portuguese crew of Paulo Bento expects to the replay with groβem optimism against Bosnia (22:00 clock) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
With the first leg both crews objectivity had been missing.
“In the end these 90 minutes we will be a happy crew and above all a happy country”.
Paulo Bento sees itself already in Poland and Ukraine.
For it gives it not smallest approach of doubts that “La Selecçao” becomes, its soccer national team, for which he has responsibility since September 2010 qualify for the European championship 2012.
For Portugal that means indeed only 90 minutes of beatificness.
But there is Bosnia to play a match to get rid of and an opponent.
Considering the first leg (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica it seems obvious that the cubes are not yet fallen.
Portugal dominated the portion over more than one hour clearly, but the crew was not capable of pushing the thing the so important stamp open which would have taken the pressure of it.
“That is a good result, which saves however a certain risk, there we no Auswärtstor obtained”.
At home however, in their brightly lighting up Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, is convinced the Portuguese of to pierce itself before an audience, which might be likewise heiβ on the play, if the portion were even announced naturally as " very scarcely”, said the optimistic, however clear-sighted Bento.
“We expect a very scarce match, are however perfectly convinced the upper hand to win to be able”, explained the 42-year old Portuguese coaches.
“We have further a 50%-ige opportunity with the European championship 2012 thereby to be”, related however the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The standoff on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to obtain and win a gate.
A standoff can be sufficient for the Bosnians, who have likewise a gate necessarily, already.
“That is a good result, which saves however a certain risk, there we no Auswärtstor obtained”, regrets Bento.
“We against a crew to begin, the high technical qualities possesses and had players with many individual qualities”, added it.
As already in Zenica the Portuguese would not intend to already exercise at the beginning maximum pressure on the Bosnians at " them time for thinking admit”.”
A good idea, under the condition that it is put this time into practice.
