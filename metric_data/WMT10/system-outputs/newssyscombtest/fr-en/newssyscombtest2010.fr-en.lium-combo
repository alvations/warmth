The lack of snow in mountain tracasse hoteliers
runways trails are not a problem that operators of remonte-pentes.
lack of snow discourages people book their stays in skiing in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is still possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of hits on our site.
Internet users roam the tender, asking prices but dare not commit to set aside for the moment.
And if they call, they want immediately if there is snow or mud at Christmas, "said Martin Jandura, operator of the information portal Spindl.Info.
If you want to spend the New Year of his dreams for Špindlerův Mlýn, better not too shy to book.
If the to the economies and that the quality of accommodation only then, then we can try to wait a few more days
hoteliers of Špindler suggest for the moment that stays a week for the New Year.
I think they will try one more time place, but they also themselves and accept shorter periods
And then the number of free rooms will rapidly diminish, "said Jandura.
The Ingtours of the of Ingtours Vrchlabí also proposes yet beds of free for all periods of winter.
The week of Christmas we are most interested at the moment, it is not completely sold.
He remains free, say, half the rooms in our offer.
That is why we have already prepared some last minute Christmas less, "said the director of Petr Ingtours Schiefert.
The agency Vrchlabí tourism may also propose the New Year at Krkonoše, but there are fewer empty seats.
The first fourteen days of February go well, the remaining winter trips are moderately.
This year, the interest for stays of winter has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow Krkonoše.
People expect it to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the runways covered during the Christmas week, also will be complete, "believes Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupation of the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
It was an improvement of almost five percent.
We still have a few places for the New Year as for Christmas.
There is great interest during the holidays in January and February of Polish sells well too, "advises Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
Omnia Hotel near the central parking Jánské Lázně is also full eighty percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most in Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already sixty percent occupancy at present.
February is a bit lower for the moment, but as soon as the snow will fall, interest for stays in the Krkonoše grows certainly said the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
hoteliers of Krkonoše, however, should not expect more snow.
Thursday, it will be fresher and if there is, they should be neigeuses in the mountains.
But thereafter, the weather should warm, informed Jiří Jakubský of Hradec station in the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
United States: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It becomes even funny, the diligence with which Barack Obama, president at the reputation of wise, reproduced the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan issue, he regarded himself as simple
When he eventually leave sweat its doctrine so eagerly awaited, it he had recopiée with carbon paper since the Iraq scenario Bush three years ago
Not content to use in the text itself several times "as in Iraq," he has not hesitated, more importantly, to use the title of the speech Bush in January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new way
At the same time, he has personally criticized the idea of Bush to send reinforcements in Iraq is consumed by civil war as "irresponsible and a disastrous decision in its consequences."
The following month, however, showed that the strategy of Bush, who was the recommendations of the commanders of campaigns, was the only possible and likely success at this point that the newspapers today do not speak of any of Iraq.
This has not enhanced the reputation of Bush, however, objectively speaking, it was left to his successor a final situation much more favourable than anyone could hope.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen
This are the commanders campaigns have requested an increase of military contingent, including the commander of the operation in Afghanistan, General Stanley McCristal, which even has criticized the reluctance of the White House in the patterns of subordination
He claimed 40,000 troops in order to make the situation more favourable.
The President has hesitated for three months but lack of a better alternative, at least he had the General 10,000 soldiers.
He has managed to pull the promise of additional 5,000 from Europe, even if it had at the outset.
This brings the most problems throughout the strategy of Obama seems to be his intention to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan within 18 months and complete this process within three years. The doctrine of Obama raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that an increase of half will bring the same fruits that progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is fairly well organized and its leaders to honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation characterized by the exact opposite - we cannot rely on anyone and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to change from day to day depending on what suits them.
political institutions, although based officially, will remain a smokescreen behind which proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is difficult to balance the interests of various ethnic groups given the lack of clarity about the reports, which are further complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the founding of a "state quick to act," which is the aim of the operation, does not appear to be very real.
The time horizon of the strategy of Obama makes puzzled by his determination.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has worsened and she is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely heart romantic and outside reality can be confident that the soldiers sent in the tumult of the war for their return to the home "will bring a miracle.
From a political point of view, set a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible because the Taliban see as the indirect admission of defeat.
The last NATO summit has shown that the European desire to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving toward the negative.
European politicians do or do not want to explain to their constituents why security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor that can radically alter the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and strengthened sanctions have no effect on Iran, the Americans will face the very difficult issue a resolution of the problem by the use of military force.
It will respond, for example when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Each solution of this type will, however, a dramatic reversal of the situation in Afghanistan.
The only rustine for Obama is the fact that there are still three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for it is working on a new strategy, if it would be a flop.
The leaders of the bank Goldman Sachs will not receive bonuses in cash
The senior leaders of the US bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced in response to heavy criticism of its pay practices.
The group of 30 senior leaders will receive shares instead of cash, they cannot resell within five years.
shares may be withdrawn to leaders in case they take too many risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs and is leading the effort to link payments with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I suppose that Wall Street is well aware of the general sense that we need to, said the former investment banker Douglas Elliott of society JPMorgan
The concern is in the details, "he added.
The bank Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after being set aside almost $17 billion in premiums in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will probably 20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.

The Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus has invited at the Chateau
President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning, the Finance Minister Eduard Janota, which weighs his stay in government because of his disagreement with the state budget for next year as it has been passed by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also Janota's position in the cabinet will be on the agenda of the meeting on Friday.
Klaus also of the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which widens the public finance crisis.
It is the presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat who informed the meeting.
Janota wants then discuss its function Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget, which will be submitted to the signature of Vaclav Klaus is a deficit of $163 billion that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies approved Wednesday the proposals of the left about money transfers and increased payments of officials, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government accuses the proposals of the Social Democrats, because they would indirectly increase the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left the government,, Klaus and the right to disagree, calling into question the future of the cabinet of Fischer, who had been trained by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics argue that the budget, as it was voted by MPs, removes the package of measures passed by the Government of Fischer and that it should halt the indebtedness of the state.
Klaus, who can ratify the law on the state budget, but that no requirement, said today at a breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs, that politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "irréfrénable disability" of public finances.
Now there is, according to him, no positive solution.
Only a strong government could bring an improvement, if he could rely on a consensus among political parties, according to the president.
The chairman of the ODS Mirek Topolánek has indicated that the budget is staggering and that the government should rethink its existence.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas ČTK said that the idea of an administrative office supported by the ČSSD, ODS and the Greens is clearly more.
In his response, Prime Minister Fischer described such words of "drastic" verdicts.
The head of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek has to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit for this year by the former government of Topolánek is amazing and it will exceed 200 billion kronor.
On Wednesday, the ČSSD called the ratification of the state budget for the next year.
The Popular Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film
Despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans say the new Hollywood movie Invictus - Invaincu will present to the world a lot of things about the country, its struggles and victories.
story speaks of sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, U.S. actor rewarded the Oscars, embodies the film on the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the racist regime of apartheid in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said that it is a Mandela, 91 years of age who asked him to embody in the film.
Matt Damon plays an important role.
I told him: "If I embody, I should be able to see you personally..
The actor aged 72 years who has been awarded a prize for his role in the drama Milion Dollar Baby Clint Eastwood located in the middle of boxing, for example, embodied the leader of a movement against slavery, slave, became a of the president, even God in the film "Evan Almighty but never someone alive and so important to so many people as Mandela.
The State ex-homme South Africa was jailed for 27 years for his hard work in favour of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning unbeaten and it is the title of a poem in the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team Francois to unify the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country resteencore and always divided racially and economically after apartheid.
He was persuaded to unite his people through sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world.
The African team will eventually move in World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years to bring the history of Mandela on screen.
I had no other purpose if not play this role to the closest to the reality, "said Freeman.
The biggest challenge for me it was, of course, talk like him
The actor said that if he and the international politics were in the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, dinner with him, of being behind before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake hands.
I realized that when I shake hands, I recover your energy, it transmits and I had the impression of how you feel, "he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there was a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the middle rugby
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I come to the door of the house, he opened and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was: 'I have a lot bigger in the movie ".
Despite the differences between the actual actors and models Invictus, under the leadership of the Eastwood received positive opinions and there is even talk of ambitions for the Oscars.
The film critic Todd McCarthy of Daily Variety summed up his assessment in these words: "This is a very good story, a film very well done."
In the evaluations of films on the site rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive feedback.
The mystery of the will in Norway is committed: a Russian rocket testing
It has been observed a strange phenomenon of unknown origin over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence acknowledged that yesterday have tested an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
The launch has still been a failure and the type of missile "Bulava" which was originally scheduled to be the pride of the Russian army is gradually becoming a nightmare Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His presence repeated the test of the rocket has not had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Most of the time, or Bulava has not disappeared, or it was damaged in flight.
The Russian newspapers talk of "Bulava" as the missile "do not steal"
A missile that is not flying but shining
This 13th test took place early normally.
It was not until the end of the flight that there was new damage on the equipment.
This is clearly the engine of the third stage of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be fired from a moving boat and submerged
This is why the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object specifically has likely been a "Bulava" defective.
rest, the Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot speak in complete failure.
The first two stages of the rocket have resisted and damage was confined to the third.
In the previous cases, the drivers have been failures on the first floor.
Although none of the test launches went smoothly, the leadership of the Ministry of Defence considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of almost 50 percent fills the general optimism and they therefore argue that one day "Bulava" fly without problems and that she will win even ten nuclear of hypersoniques a total weight of 1.15 tonnes.

Hyundai has listened to the unions and supersedes all overtime
The leadership of the Hyundai plant Nošovice has agreed with unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of overtime frequent that unions have declared a state of emergency strike Monday.
The spokesman Petr Vaněk of the Hyundai plant confirmed.
The management wants to get agreement yet with unions on a Saturday worked again this year.
We cannot abandon our production plan, it is essential, which is why voluntary overtime were proposed on Saturday, 19 December, knowing that there would be two teams, "said Vaněk.
The site Sedmička.cz said that the company has proposed a bonus 400 Czech to employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will be also has a posteriori for the day worked on 28 November.
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change the way to its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for hours, or they may pose a replacement leave on 28 December and extend their year-end holidays aindiqué Vaněk.
In addition to this all employees present Saturday will receive compensation for the costs of transport and for their lunch.
Given the fact that overtime were the most urgent and the hottest in the comments and the demands of the unions as employees who have voluntarily stopped production last week, management has the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, employees at the automotive plant were forced to work almost daily two hours in addition to their eight hours.
unions to cancel the state of strike after signing the agreement.
The negotiations between management at the car factory and trade to take place Friday afternoon
The union leader Petr Kuchař said Wednesday that they were ready to stop the state to strike if agreement on their claims and signing of a joint document.
The situation in the plant peaked last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of incessant overtime.
They were protesting against poor conditions in salary and so-called bizutages.
leadership is defending. with the fact that employees had to work as a supplement to meet the requirements of production.
In announcing the strike Monday, unions have also asked that employees who ceased production will not be subject to any sanction.
The unions are asking the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want this year compensation of 5,000 kroner (approximately) €) for them.
The Nošovice Hyundai car plant currently employs 2,000 people.
She started series production last year in November.
It has produced about 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech Discovery: a substance that operates on the HIV virus "endurants"
A team of German and Czech test new combinations that can slow the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it is also on the viruses that have already developed an immunity to the drugs.
reality is, in some cases, the top on the fact that the combination is not as intensely on the common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at the moment.
can nevertheless can prolong the lives of patients through a mixture of drugs to prevent the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
Consumption is, however, a number of side effects.
, the of this proliferation effect to the development of so-called resistant viruses on which the drugs are no longer effective.
The work of three institutions, the National Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way for a way to cope with the resistance to the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalocarboranes on the protein responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are an assembly of boron, carbon, hydrogen and cobalt.
This combination is blocking the development of the virus in a different way of all drugs used until now and that is why they could overcome the resistance problem.
The work of researchers leads them to discover new substances "improved", on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their routes on the protein from the virus.
The metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two cages for multiple walls are formed by atoms of hydrogen and boron, carbon and connected by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A virus traitor and resilient.
HIV protease is a protein from the HIV virus which is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of HIV protease caused by HIV there would be no mature birth of infectious particles of the virus.
If you stop HIV protease, will stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the researchers in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their study, published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic link, which is then systematically altered.
A little smaller but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on the HIV protease was tested in test tubes and its variants resistant, obtained from patients with HIV.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as on the clinical medicine, however it is not on the resistant versions against which current drugs are often ineffective.
The metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and their other properties as their biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are therefore to consider more interesting combinations to move towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, "says Pavlína Řezáčová, director of the structural biology laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics Institute of the National Academy of Sciences.
Dispute around the budget. The ODS is Fischer, who defends
The president of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), Mirek Topolánek has described as "staggering" the budget ratified for the following year, and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The prime minister called the remarks of the ODS of drastic verdict.
He said take time to analyze.
The spokesman of the ODS Petr Nečas said that the idea of an administrative office supported by the ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party was clearly more.
to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether ilprend in the Chamber of Deputies support on the minority who cares to combat the growing deficit, or if it is to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas has warned that the positions of the ODS and Social Democrats over the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, but with the proposed amendments to the tune of 12 billion included by the left.
The House has increased the money for the salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's grievance against the proposals of the Social Democrats was the fact that they increased indirectly the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should run a deficit of $163 billion kronor.
ODS has left the chamber before the vote, to the wishes of the government as a budget as amended is a variant less bad than an interim budget.
Deception and uselessness
The Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still consider the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office in the case of ratification of the proposed changes, the situation could be different.
to the Czech Television Janota took on Monday with Prime Minister after its passage in government:
He said at the same time, he wondered whether he would stay in office.
His disappointment with the budget negotiations is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, which have imposed the budget changes, have no place in government.
The Prime Minister should also make clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other laws increasing the deficit, such as those affecting the insurance, pensions, or reform of the law on services.
Topolánek: ministers appointed by the ODS is not in question.
This is the case of the head of government Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing wrong, said in a statement Topolánek text from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some departments are TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas said that if Fischer decides to give his resignation in the face of conducting a fight against the amount of the deficit in the public finances, "it is entirely logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House."
That said, it should not expect the support and tolerance of Democrats.
I have not thought about it and that it will be on the agenda when I want, "said since the House to journalists, the Defence Minister Martin Barták, elected government by the Democrats.
The Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon for a discussion of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS has backtracked on the request of the prime minister.
Nečas stressed at the same time as the ODS would probably have voted Wednesday against the amended budget if he had not specifically asked Members to allow Democrats voting for the budget.
We don't have the feeling of being orphaned, it is no small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not suffered criticism from the chairman of the Party in the House or in the country during the negotiation of the budget.
I haven't noticed that my vote would have been.
I already knew when I renounced my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a bolchévisation House and destruction of everything that was positive, reacted Topolánek in person.
According to the new schedules of the ČD there will be fewer trains for the same charges.
Czech Railways will remove or limit on 13 December some express trains regional or less responsible, and instead would increase some.
The total coverage of transport will fall on the day of entry into force of the new schedule of two percent compared to today.
Most of the charges will not change, including the basic rate and the reduced rate.
For example, the inhabitants of the region Ostrava who have more routes to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino train.
On the contrary, an expressway will cease to Bratislava.
There will also be less fast trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, the direct line Letohrad Prague - will be dramatically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decline in transportation for the region of Hradec Králové eight percent in total,, Prague and its environs can rejoice an increase.
Two night trains on the line Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice are also cancelled and the movement of some express trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice is reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the greatest change, you can see the introduction of a new line of direct Milovice in Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice must change at Lysá nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of Esko the, the opening of which is possible thanks to the completion of electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The lines distant to the capital will have their final destination at the main railway station nádraží Hlavní Prague (nádraží).
The HC ČD will introduce more lines between Prague and Ostrava and Pendolino trains to Šumperk / Jeseník will depart by every two hours.
Travelers can no longer take the Pendolino in Bratislava on 13 December.
The bill this year for regional railways: 200 million kronor.
express trains are ordered and paid by the Department of Transportation and will pay the Railways next year in all four billion kroner to the losses visible, the same amount as this year. The regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for their by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will be up to nearly three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
railways have newly signed a contract for ten years, until now, the length was still a year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they have not used a price increase of the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will affect only tickets a day ČD Net and eLiška tickets at reduced prices.
For travelers without a map of reduction, the price of ČD Net increase from 450 to 600 kronor.
The price of eLiška newly will depend on the journey, whereas previously it was valid between the from one region to choice and was at a single rate of 160 kronor.
The Filipino rebels still hold more than 50 people, children have been released
The rebels have kidnapped today 75 people in the southern Philippines, some of a primary school students and their teachers.
It is the AFP Agency who informed, but who spoke at the origin of 65 hostages only.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels have used hostages as human shields during a leak to the police.
local negotiators are trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP Agency, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CCrP).
According to the AFP Agency, police initially pursued the kidnappers following violence caused during a settling of accounts between two family clans.
Martial law was declared in the province of Maguindanao in the southern Philippines because of a recent massacre during which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November linked to the election of the administration of Governor there avait30 journalists.

They have however renewed peace talks with the Philippine government Tuesday.
The history of South Africa for everyone, according to Morgan Freeman a.k.a Mandela
The new Hollywood movie Clint Eastwood arrives in U.S. theaters in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the official title is Czech Invictus: Neporažený), and narrae part of the life of former South African president Nelson Mandela.
The role of the fight against apartheid globally known returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody.
The second male role of the legendary champion South African rugby has been attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in cinemas, returns of critics and the public are heard.
Nelson Mandela
its full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, born on 18 June 1918 in Mvezu in South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for freedom of spirit, in 1993, he then received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside de Klerk.
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great expectations since he arrived at a time when the South Africa is in full preparations for the World Cup, and secondly because the media are stirred by disturbing news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of people on the part of the black majority to power.
According to AP, reactions to the new film are for the moment rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations to the main roles where "pavanent" of Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is nevertheless, in his own words, proud of the film.

I also repeatedly personally met Nelson Mandela to power - as they say - recover his energy, "he said at the premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it is a good thing if we had the opportunity to via the film personality and the message from Mandela.

Jančura will sue for defamation against three prefects to the ČSSD
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, will file today a complaint for slander against three prefects Social Democrats.
And specifically against Michal Hašek region of southern Moravia, against Radko Martínka of Pardubice region and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesařík.
Jančura indicated in Dvacet MINUT of Radiožurnál.
The complaint is linked to the attempt by the company to operate regional railways in some regions.
All regions have eventually sign long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three were attacked and say we are doing fine mouths, while it was only made an offer for what they wanted to themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than Czech Railways which is not true because we know the price of Czech Railways which were signed last week.
So we have to defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for slander on society Student Agency, said the Jančura Radiožurnál.
Similarly, he said he had evidence that no region has proceeded in accordance with European law.
We are preparing for that a complaint to the European Commission.
Hašek considers that the complaint of Mr. Jančura is a result of its media spectacle that provides free publicity for his company and his person.
of course I am prepared to defend my name and the name of my region and I urge other prefects to do the same.
I assume that this will be an opportunity to show clearly that it is precisely Mr. Jančura manipulating public opinion and use of false and misleading arguments about the regional rail transport, "says Hašek
Jančura has already informed last week that it will invest a few million kroner in an advertisement that indicate the steps against regions.
He told Radiožurnál that will interrupt the campaign after Christmas and it intends to resume after the New Year.
He said that the campaign will target corruption in the broadest sense.
Jančura launched his campaign after the regions agreed to give the Czech Railways operate rail links to an order of about 150 billion kronor, without issuing a call for tenders.
to Jančura, such action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions Jančura has even led to threats of a member of ČSSD.
The only threat was that if it does not stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I don't know who he is, but I would not say his name, said Jančura today at Radiožurnál.
Vaccination against pneumococcal is free and voluntary
Vaccination against will reverse the old habits since January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Voices are already, saying that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
preparations for the introduction of vaccination against pneumococcus peak.
Pharmaceutical Institute for vaccines already defines the maximum prices that will pay the insurance.
The experts also see clear in the process of vaccination.
A new vaccination.
The free for children of August.
Since January, children born last year on 2 August can be vaccinated for free pneumococcal bacteria.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If you started vaccination last year or earlier, you must pay yourself the vaccinations.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the third and the fifth month of the child.
Last year a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated children against pneumococcus.
Yet parents paid 1,600 crowns even more for a dose.
vaccination of young requires four doses.
Experts estimate that each year the insurance spend 300 to 450 000 kroons in doses of vaccine.
however they save on medical care that unvaccinated children require.
now, the state was approximately 500,000 kronor per year for the vaccination of children.
vaccination repaid was introduced with the "Janota package."
Pneumococcal bacteria are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including inflammation of the brain and blood poisoning.
to investigations in hospitals, there are even 28 deaths of children under 10 years caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced vaccination repaid.
Vaccination will be mandatory?
There is advice on an eventual vaccination of in the future.
From January, it must be resolved by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský said that compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
The association has long promoted the pneumococcal vaccination.
At an international conference in which our association participated, experts were not really satisfied with the fact that we have a vaccination optional.
It is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased to be able to impose at least this.
I think it is a direction that we must now follow Kalovský said.
But the health ministry not to change the process of pneumococcal vaccination.
We do absolutely not for the moment, "said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, say doctors.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Society of pediatricians, acknowledges that a vaccine based on the volontariata its shortcomings.
If all children were vaccinated, it could be a reduction of renewals vaccinations "In the situation where the vaccine is such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination," said Cabrnochová.
experts predict that by next year, more than 80 per cent of new parents will vaccinate their infants.
Vaccination against also marks a break from the fact that this is the first vaccination of children, which is funded by insurance and not the rule.
Cabrnochová explained that insurance should free up funds for prevention, and save on possible future medical care.
Doctors have to buy their products themselves
This is linked to the concerns of pediatricians practitioners, which relate to the purchase of vaccines.
The original intent was to buy vaccines by insurance companies, doctors in receiving the same way as other vaccine products provided by the state.
Some Members concerned, however, that this would allow insurance companies to deduct the amounts of health insurance. "
Thus, doctors will buy the products and wait for the reimburse them.
According to estimates, pediatricians to individually invest nearly 40 000 SEK per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.

Islam can be French?
pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be lured by this new book, fans of the author's latest book, "Why the French do not like the headscarf" (2006), an elegant and well documented on an issue that has divided and troubled the country for 15 years and whose effects are still being felt today.
The latest book by Mr Bowen presents a much broader and more ambitious.
Good anthropologist, would not only know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes in France now provide queM. Muslim spaces Bozen called "5m-6m" for the Muslims.
He knows very well listen and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on issues that concern them most.
A Muslim should marry in a mosque or at the town hall (or both)?
The evolution and the rights should be taught to young Muslims?
A Muslim woman can marry a non-Muslim?
A Muslim can use a banking system based on the interests for a loan?
It is practical problems, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than political dramas concern to the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate until the end.
Lesconservateurs do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts lawyers of a purist Sunni Islam linked to Saudi Arabia that today, are a small part of Muslims in Europe.
M Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the nature of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can be obtained with the efforts of each side.
He wondered how the French politicians (and the intellectual elite guardian if virulent secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims have not been spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also had to make compromises with historic secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, he detects a "of core values."
Islam can be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The dismal view of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other place on the planet.
The ice is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipments and new fishing boats in open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a thin layer of ice," Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the symbol of the north polar bears.
the history and complicated political whaling, he described the long tradition of Arctic explorers who were their evidence in polar bears.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then courageous aspiring to 14-year-olds who had to fight the tip of his mousquet, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young cubs, caught as they swam alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a show celebrating 75 gathered at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo is generally a millionth of the area required an adult in freedom. climate is rarely mentioned: a polar bear living in Singapore became because green algae that grew in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians, is often on the threat posed by hunters on the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada, where hunters by helicopter and the Indian and Inuit use of powerful fusilsd 'assault to oust their game.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of these two nations of the that ice will stay longer.
In his new book, "After the ice," Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, provides a clear summary and frightening Arctic science and a fascinating insight into what may be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither the atmosphéristes nor oceanographers can tell exactly the speed of change.
This is not for lack of trying.
late 19th and early 20th, travel pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen gave the first report on the melting of the ice cap.
The submarines in the Cold War were then mapped changes in sous-celle-ci relief.
surveillance satellites and probes placed on icebergs are of great help, but the bulk of the work is done by men hardened, camped out in the cold.
Mr Anderson at the extraordinary world and tiny system depends on the Arctic ice, formed by the nets of brackish water rushed in freezing.
But the bear mentioned above the microscopic marvels contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the ice, was between 2013 and 2050.

The Marines, among the 6,000 people who have laid wreaths on the graves in Arlington
The first 'ﬁrst-class Angello Robinson, 19, made a journey of seven hours by bus to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and for other Marines who made the trip to Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina Cemetery at Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was devoted to salute the men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In recent months, where we will be sent, we will be in their place, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If it to me, I would like someone to do the same thing for me, so I just try to show respect.
It was one of 6,000 volunteers to be gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of the veterans in different sections of the Arlington Cemetery Ceremony.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company to Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others have decided to decorate hundreds of graves in the cemetery in Arlington Ceremony.
Now, to continue a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife Karen, are each year the journey, stopping in different cities on their way to organize celebrations in honour of the victims of terrorism.
The Worcester have also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America (Some wreaths across America), which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers have placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves of Arlington cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the cemetery Fayetteville National Cemetery enArkansas, in Battery Park in New York City and on the site of the memorial to the victims of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation has given more than $150,000 to buy and carry the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she had made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a career soldier died.
While her husband is not buried at Arlington, Hunt said that for her, it was a way to those who had sacrificed.
It is a small gesture that can make the civilians to support our troops, "she said.
It is like visiting a family tomb.
Emmitouflée in layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked between lawns and hills tracts of the cemetery.
The have chosen ancient tombs, dating from the First and Second World Wars and the Vietnam War, because they are not often visited the new graves, organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, while children played and couples stood by the hand, the fresh pine wreaths on the graves grey.
Each krona round was a dark green, with a small red knot on the top.
Nearby, the silence on Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations has given 1,000 kroner to decorate the section but the somber mood of the current wars filled the area.
People were crying without hiding, others praying and families and friends have in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in stone while others looked to see small black and white maps, steeped in the wetland for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers in tears on the grave of her son.

A US citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested an American citizen who was mobile phones and laptop computers in the country, said the services of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana trying to gain access to the inmate who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested under the pretext of being "dangerous".
All activities, including protests revolutionary so-called moderate and critical writing, raise the risk of arrest.
The anti-gouvernementaux graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a community of bloggers, conducted by Yoani Sánchez, popular commentator who writes often about how she and her husband were followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards, but the authorities have always been denied.
The detention of an American citizen may increase tensions between the brothers of communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration pursues a "soft" approach to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times, Friday evening.
The new US policy insists that the Cuban government advance by concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and create more space for the opposition, so that the United States to reciprocate.
Mobile phones and laptops are permitted to Cuba, although this is of desired new and in a country where the average salary of an employee is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are primarily used for messages or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a day's pay.
On the island, Internet use is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often must provide their name to the government.
Access to some Web sites is limited.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few jailed in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, "said Gloria Berbena, press officer with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any open society, would be allowed -- to distribute free mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, "said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas program director of the group Human Rights Watch, who recently published a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba, called" New Castro, Cuba, "referring to the installation of Raul Castro as leader of the country to replace Fidel, his older brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, put on trial and jailed on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be policy and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, when the two begin to initiate a dialogue.
The Pakistani authorities prevented a plot to send troops to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities have identified an organisation supposed to prepare a plot to send five men of Northern Virginia in Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, saying they hoped that the case would demonstrate an extensive network of terrorist recruiters in the Internet searching for young men radicalised.
Investigators said they hunted a hidden insurgente personality, known as Saifullah, who invited these men in Pakistan after discovered when one of them comments endorsing the waves terrorists on the Internet video site YouTube.
Once in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah, who tried to help reach the remote area of the tribal belt of Pakistan, home of al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the Pakistani intelligence service had been informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince the al-Qaida commanders that these men were not involved in the plot the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network
As a result, they have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the mountains of northeastern banned become a haven for terrorism.
They have been considered undercover agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities said that the men were identified and they were always to obtain the necessary approvals for entry into the camps al-Qaeda when they were arrested by the forces of Pakistani law.
these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and who are interviewed by the FBI -- insist on the crucial role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and perhaps more importantly, in the determination of the people who trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US secret services have priority to infiltrate men in al-Qaeda.
Recruiters from the organization play the role of firewalls, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who can be spies.
According to analysts, the U.S. potential recruits are being studied closely by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and propagandaire of their value.
However Evan Kohlmann, an expert from the NEFA Foundation, based in the United States, said that the terrorist groups must also do more attention in recent years in the choice of people they accept because the US secret services have become experts in relation to their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow his recruitment model that many other people have already undergone? said Kohlmann.
The model is one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen for an "action" the climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants marched in the streets here Saturday, calling for more action on the climate of the negotiators working in the conference hall Bella Convention Center in the city
The number was estimated at 100,000 people, but 25,000 according to estimates of the police.
The event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked militants has lit a few explosives near a set of government buildings in downtown.
On a day when little has happened during discussions on climate sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists marched through the city, clutching signs in English saying, 'There is no planet B "and in Spanish, saying," The Earth said she has had enough. "
Several celebrities have joined the protests, including the top Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travel to the home of his mother, Peru, has opened our eyes to the tough issues facing the country because of the impact of climate change are already happening. "
That is one reason why I decided to join the march -- to get the word, and launching an appeal to world leaders to take decisions that are fair, ambitious and involved, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police prevented the protestors from coming too close to the Bella Center and said that it had arrested 19 people on the ground that they were and / or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
Police prevented the protestors from coming too close to the Bella Center and said that it had arrested 19 people on the ground that they were and / or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passer-by who requested anonymity because of his involvement in discussions on climate, the activists who wore masks and black clothes, started several explosives near the main channel in Copenhagen, which is surrounded by some departments
launched near the buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, followed later by "a few big explosions."
Within the Palais des Congrès, people gathered around television screens to follow the march, throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the have failed to awaken the conscience of key authorities such as Su Wei, China's representative for climate change.
When asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English: "In fact, it is something that I had no conscience.
He then continued in Mandarin, saying, "The event is important, I cannot hear what happens outside."
He noted that the march could be harmful or helpful to the outlook.
It shows the interest of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, "he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or that they undermine the freedom of others."
The results of tests revealed persistent differences between races
The federal report last week on the results in math has brought good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the District is still far behind the leading institutions, the report shows that the Grade 4 Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are much greater progress over the past two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of the progress of education) is the persistent gap between the scores of white and African-American, at both locally and nationally.
The scores of white children Grade 4 (cm1) WashingtonD.C. increased over the last two years, 262 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their classmates Afro-américaines increased by three points, 209 to 212.
The gap of success has actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) generally remains steady, falling just one point, 245 244.
The average score for, was not included in the results of the tests because the sample was not large enough.
The overview over a period of six years is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in a class of Grade 4 (4), when the first report was published District NAEP, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District have expressed concern that rising celebrated by the Director of group educational institutions, Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were propelled by white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we have raised the aggregate considering the elements at the top of the ladder, which is problematic and embarrassing, "said Jeff Smith, Director of DC Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equality in education in the District.
I don't jump for joy for one or two points earned, "said Kwame R. Brown (related Democrat), member of the D.C. Council and whose daughter is in Grade 4, Eaton Elementary (elementary school).
Often critical of the management style of Rhee, Brown said that the message of the test results is that the middle schools (colleges) of the city desperately need attention.
Really, you always see the positive signs and I respect that.
But what is, is that we don't spend enough time and energy to our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee said the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, for schoolchildren in grades late cycle elementary and early college who have not built the foundations of reading earlier in their school and who are lagging behind their peers.
Every day, the mathematics curriculum for grades of (Kindergarten to Grade 6 (6th) focuses on the games and real life experiences, as they have been put in place in the District by the former superintendent Clifford Janey, who must also be credited to the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I simply believe that we must continue to work to provide better responses to these students than that of the class, said Rhee.
Others believe that the NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less successful in order to reduce the gap.
That is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a trainer of education at the University of California, Berkeley who studied the results of tests of cities.
The conventional political solution is to spend your resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
So this targeting may have political repercussions that impede this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that the Superintendent of Schools, she is to use the middle class whites and blacks.
Our focus is to ensure the development of a system of good schools.
We must strengthen our schools districts so that all families, regardless of where they come from, are confident that their children to obtain an excellent public education.
Janey, now of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the essential elements for success is the duration of the traditional public school, today to 180 days in the District of Washington, to compete with the Charter schools.
must obtain approximately 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with the union of its teachers last year for 185 days, he considers a "starting point" for an increase in the next contract.

The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, and a time cligne eyes at the sight of white columns, facades and verdoyantes lawns.
parents of Graciela had only been able to finish the school, àEl Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
, when she and other students in Grade 8 (4) Group explored Gettysburg where tuition fees are $38 690 per year, his attitude was less than a new student impressed that enthusiastic.
Super That's where I study! Gushed Graciela wishing to study medicine, while the guide heading towards the entrance to the building of science.
Youpi, really? "she says, when he said the low ratio law professor - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that visiting children during their voyage of discovery, and now they have fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to university
The question is where.
Although this question is still largely to the large number of American children born to parents Hispanic migrants who have left the school where became parents to adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands of university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, a "Hispanic" second generation "on cinqpoursuit his studies at school -- a notable success considering that many of their immigrant parents, most from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without having completed high school.
Their success is important, the researchers say, they pave the way for future generations who will play an important role in the workforce of the country.
Researchers studying the battants say that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
There are also those whose parents set high expectations for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach the university -- in particular, whether its efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, does not help, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who has studied the American students.
We need to a support network for these children from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that has funded the visit universities of Graciela is a good example.
Known as the GEAR UP (prépares you), it provides more than $300 million per year on systems of local schools to organize the university preparation programs that begin when students from low income families are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of years of school.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
The Department of Iraqi oil obtained agreements with foreign oil companies.
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auction that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that oil companies from China, Russia and Europe are poised to play a major role in the rehabilitation of the oil industry of Iraq, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies are left with an interest in only two of 10 fields auctioned.
Seven American companies had paid to attend the second auction that began Friday.
The only one who had set an auction has lost.
Two US companies have won contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, are European and Asian companies are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the forum Iraq Oil Forum, a site for information on the Internet.
It will take a long time before another offer being made in Iraq.
concerns about security, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings Tuesday, and political instability, while the U.S. military troops withdraw U.S. oil companies have slowed, preventing them from entering more force in Iraq, which has the third largest oil reserve in the world, say analysts.
American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, especially the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, including labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they had not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the department.
The largest US companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong links with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and brought their technical advice, came away empty-handed.
Russian companies, Lukoil and Gazprom were the two major shareholders in two contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the state, has more on contracts that other companies and emerged with significant holdings in contracts for two main areas.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesman for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that Chinese society will be on an equal footing with its competitors and carry out its commitments in Iraq.

One of the main organizers of al-Qaeda was killed in Pakistan
It appears that a U.S. missile, which hit along the border with Afghanistan killed one of the organizers of the operations of al-Qaeda, this week, U.S. authorities said Friday counter-espionage.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack against a terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected to have been killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah, in North Waziristan, according to U.S. and Pakistani authorities in the
Local authorities have said that the missiles were fired by a pilotless aircraft of the type used by the CIA inside Pakistan's lawless tribal border.
They were driving a white car, heading toward the Afghan border, where the car was hit, "said a member of the secret services Pakistani civilians, speaking by telephone from Miran Shah.
the authority said that local activists suspects rushed on site and were quickly confiscated what remained of "body completely torn apart.
It was totally impossible to local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but both U.S. counterterrorism officials have given not evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of the organizers of military ran the al-Qaeda terrorist operations group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Her role was to organize conspiracies in the world, "said one of the authorities who requested anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of air inside Pakistani territory.
Given its role, this probably included conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe.
It followed the strategic direction of al-Qaeda leaders and were translated into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the U.S. authority said that Somali had grown rapidly in the ranks of al-Qaida 'and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It is not known to the general public, but this does not diminish the threat he poses to us and our allies, "said the second official representative.
If her death is confirmed, Somali would be the second important figure of al-Qaeda or the Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks carried out by CIA drones has declined since the summer, about six transactions per month to two, according to the figures by the Long War Journal, a Web site tempered by a non-profit group.
This decline could be due to improved tactics terrorist groups who have risen to reduce their vulnerability in killing also ruthlessly suspected informants, says the site.
The UN envoy to Kabul withdrew
The UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous tenure marred by allegations of widespread corruption in the presidential elections, backed by the United Nations.
The departure of Eide comes at a time when the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan.
UN envoy said he supported the increase, but it has expressed its concern about the timetable for a withdrawal of troops that would begin within 18 months and that would require other NATO governments withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, "said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials helping the political transition in Afghanistan.
The increase should be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said that he was resigning but that it will honour the commitment it had made to his family in March, will spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows he has time to find a replacement.
I simply said that it was better to start looking for my replacement, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a gap between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to the representatives of the United Nations, Ban has already begun to look for a replacement.
The representatives said that the name of Staffan di Mistura has been; it is a Italo-Suisse citizen recently chaired a U.N. mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who had previously led the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan has been put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, was accused in September, President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and to conceal evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations, but he said that the accusations of Galbraith -- who was thanked -- "have harmed the mission because there was already a healthy dose of skepticism regarding the international observation of elections".
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the rescue of US forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the Heads of the UN to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries that it is assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that it would give them more confidence about how their money is spent.
Eide has expressed his frustration about the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy hiring the UN hampered his ability to bring new talent.
The UN rules are such that I could not to recruit one person since May, he said.
It is catastrophic and it cannot last.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on the nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking before a crowd of 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq, during a week-long visit in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, has played down the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a question from a soldier on the possibility of such an outcome.
One of the things that weighs the most, is that I've learned one thing in Iraq over the past six years, it is the unpredictability inherent in the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions against the military and political elite in Iran, but Gates indicated that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians in the street.
He said that "a package of incentives and punishments" may be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would in fact be good security with nuclear weapons "because" his people would suffer a lot of these sanctions.
Friday, in a statement from the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the administration has joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face consequences "probable" if it does not back its nuclear program in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran insists it wants to develop its nuclear experience only in a peaceful purposes.
In the Geneva talks on October 1, he indicated that he would resume dialogue on the its nuclear program and agreed to surrender a substantial part of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has prompted such an agreement, medium build confidence on both sides and win time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to be away attempts to - part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, I think the raidissement of Iran to address some of the proposals of the international community to which they had given their agreement in early October, has prompted the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese to join what they had not considered, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, "said Gates.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals before it turns to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was once called "increasing sanctions".
In a statement made Thursday in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations has denounced what it called "baseless allegations" of some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and said it was willing to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "to obtain a satisfactory solution in the long term."
Gates, who was to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before flying to the oil rich region of Kurdish to derencontrer troops, officials in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Kurdish.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly concerning borders, property rights and revenue sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays of US plans to reduce the number of American troops to 115,000 to 50,000 before the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm anxiety of Kurds concerning the withdrawal pending. The US authorities were quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We preserve your security, prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq."
We will not let you down. "
aging in China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by the propaganda poster "The Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "A baby it is a tomb in more".
have so far learned the lesson that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the lack of birth rates in their city and the ageing of the population, have dramatically changed direction this summer and began to encourage couples to have more than one child; their response instant and firm: Never
We have already given all our time and energy to only one child.
There is no second, said Wang, 31, Director of Human Resources, who has a son months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating unique notoriously Two-generation children with good cheeks and spoiled, dubbed "little emperors", a crisis of the population threatens the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and over will explode, 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This figure is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in the rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, those aged 60 and over accounted for 22 percent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission of Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning) stated that fertile couples to have babies in order "to reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a lack of manpower in the future."
Shanghai is on the verge of becoming "too old - but not as rich, however - that developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual mitigation
in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is to this day, without doubt, the most controversial introduced by the Communist government.
couples who violate this policy may have to pay huge fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and suffer discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have attributed to the police on duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while the human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority have forced women pregnant with a second child to have.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high ratio of boys to girls.
In recent years, the authorities of the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they have been more exceptions to the rule -- including for residents of cities, members of ethnic minorities, and cases in which the man and woman are already only children -- and 2007, they have softened their slogans hard.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research (Institute of Population Research at Peking University, said that the authorities of the central government recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child have been replaced by copies of regulations detailing who has the right to have a second child and how to make the application.
The city government has dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples at home, and slipping leaflets under their door.
He has also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response has been disappointing.
A disappointing
While officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for records of couples wanting a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000 people, for example, not only four to five requests per month.
Officials in Shanghai, disappointed, said that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher in 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Family Planning Committee in the municipality of Shanghai, Caolu said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want more children.
They want to fill their first child, she said.
Yang Sage, 27 years and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and they are legally entitled.
But like many Chinese, they have only minimum health insurance and life assurance given by the government.
Without a social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
believe, incorrectly, that the one-child policy is an issue, "said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
It is true we flew the chance of having more than one child.
But the problem is not only the law.
It is money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their reluctance.
Wang, Human Resources, said she only wanted a single child because she was one herself. "We were at the centre of the family and had the habit that everyone cares."
We don't have the habit of taking care of someone else and we do not take care of others. "
Chen Zijian, 42 years and owner of a translation company puts it more bluntly.
For couples working at two, class, to lower the birth rate, he says, he must be selfish pourbien succeed.
people of 20 or 30 years grew up watching their parents struggle in the early days of China capitalist and don't want to have this style, "he says.
Even one child a lot of his parents, "he says.
A mother must abandon at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the problems of space -- "You must change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child has only nine months, you must write his CV for a place in the best tongue."
Most of his friends are willing to this experience again, said Chen, but not both.
Our generation is the first to enjoy a higher standard of living, "he says.
We do not want too many sacrifices.
The Group of the United Nations draft plans for reducing emissions
The climate conference, sponsored by the United Nations -- characterized so far by mutual recriminations and disorganized and -- is back in the spotlight Friday, because of the publication of a document outlining the ambitious cuts in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations supporting most of the burden in the coming years.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, said the remaining obstacles, as it has informed the path to take.
But it was seen as an important step forward in the negotiations that lack of time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Prepared by a special working group of the United Nations, the text did not say how rich countries would give the poor to cope with climate change, short and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and emerging economies news could reduce their output of carbon and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature increase that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It gives greater flexibility in the process, said John Coequyt, Representative àWashington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has six pages of the document, studied a negotiating text of 180 pages to concentrate on what was described by the Executive Secretary General on climate change, Yvo de Boer, as "the full picture."
It shows the guidelines of a possible agreement in which the industrial nations reduce their emissions by 2020, from 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries, during the same period, reduced from 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union has also revived negotiations Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion per year over the next three years to help poor countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, Friday, the same verbal altercation occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, US Representative to the climate negotiations has rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, in comparison with the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not financed by developed countries.
This change is a signal that the Obama administration becomes harder to China that the Bush administration has been two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of major developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text does not enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs He Yafei has said that the chief negotiator, lacked "common sense", was "extremely irresponsible" for having said earlier in the week that the US did not financially China to combat global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of major world powers involved, defects occurred both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more concerned with the rescue of individual economies that saving the planet, with China and the United States querellant on their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore scientific imperatives to act more boldly.
Ricardo ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of the greenhouse gases, even if vulnerable countries become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major emitters accountable for their actions.
It is really a game in which has developed a new economic hegemony, said ulate, who is also on climate adviser for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have said they would continue to put pressure to obtain a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say that negotiations will lead to a minimum, a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States which brings together 43 members, has drafted a proposal for a Treaty of 24 pages, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of the CRCM unit of the European Commission, said that the action of small island states has "put political pressure on the political process," in part by what they are now united and they require to emerging economies such as China and India, to act.
The debates have become a matter of urgency, while delegates focused on the fact that they should solve most problems pending before the heads of governments come to an agreement.
high-level officials such as the Indian environment minister Jairam Ramesh and the Deputy Minister Chinese are descended from the plane and rushed into the building of the Bella Center to attend meetings in camera and conferences of information, in order to make claims to be reviewed during the following week.
The real image of the gathering -- during which 13,000 people entering and exiting the Palais des Congrès every day -- activists guitar players present performances mocking the country which they betray and that proposals are developed and distributed on paper rather than by emails -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is growing: almost all key Ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the big boys, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of Conservation International.
Lorries arrive.
In Britain, the first train to 225 km / h will redefine syndrome Monday
A 5h13, Monday morning, a whistle the night to signal the start of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in Britain.
The first commuter train in the country will reach 225 km / h, when he filera from Ashford in Kent to London St Pancras, covering the 93-like km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Minister, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first commuter train Javelin outside London.
He hoped that the new service will allow Britain to join an international network of fast trains and reliable and large conurbations of North, Midlands and Scotland in London.
small holes lost become thriving suburbs, the business travel will be shorter and the passage of the plane and train car to reduce national emissions of carbon while reducing congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhering to this project.
But the 10 billion pounds needed to build a new rail network, the battle of planning and fears of environmental hazards to delay the high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January for the government to conduct a feasibility report, will make his report to Lord Adonis 30 December.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact studies can be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres from the final itinerary.
It is also expected that HS2 offers three options for a high-speed network, from the.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are put forward in a Y configuration in which a high-speed line will go up to the West Midlands.
The line is in two at or near Birmingham, with a branch of the Pennines àManchester and Scotland and another to the northeast, near Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne
A single line through Scotland.
"It appears that this will be the best option for performance has said a professional rail.
When this is complete, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to an hour now.
The proposals will allow the train to travel 400km / h, making the UK network the fastest in the world.
The original route is designed to allow trains to 400-meter in length and can carry 1,100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a line London - Birmingham.
A terminal can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the constraints of space, it is anticipated that an existing station will be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
from experts say that the rail only St Pancras International or Euston offer this option.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he feels that the project should be put in place, but public consultations longer and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will be built part by part.
The trains will first be forced to roll out high-speed lines on existing track north of Birmingham, retaining journey times between London and Scotland more than three hours.
This seems to be the best way to ensure the passage of planes, trains, constituting a reference point for the revolution of railways.
Taxpayers repaying the loan of £75,000 for the orangerie of Tory
Alan Duncan, the Tory member of parliament, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year to repay the cost of a orangerie he has built in his home in his constituency.
The head of the party has been demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were "maintained", has increased its loan of £75,000 to build an extension in oak at his second home in Rutland.
He had been allowed to pay the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities have received complaints at the time and have not been interviewed by Sir Thomas Legg, who has a review of expenses of members. Last night, Mr Duncan said that complaints could not be "clearer or more."
Mr Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of parliament, the a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland - Melton.
nearby homes were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor contains a kitchen, a living room and dining room, but the fees office said that Mr Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a porch at home, outlining his plans as a orangeraie.
The neighbors describe as a "porch for fun."
It has not been asked Mr Duncan to give an explanation for the increase borrowing during a recent investigation by the Committee on standards and privileges of the Commons, concerning its provisions for loans.
The Committee has cleared last month of all charges of breach of the rules, after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan has changed the legal certainty of borrowing of £271.406 London his property at the house in his constituency he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents released this week show that Mr Duncan claimed about £1,400 a month for mortgage interest until March last year.
In April, its demands have increased more than 1,800 GBP per month.
The interest rate on the loan RBS of Mr Duncan has not been changed at that time, suggesting that all the increases were designed to finance the loan of £75,000.
The standard variable interest rates RBS rose 7,94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, without moving since.
The last publication of Commons authorities showed that Mr Duncan continued to claim £1,250 in May.
Mr Duncan lost his position as Head of the shadow cabinet in September, after an undercover journalist was allegedly filmed saying that members of parliament were to survive "on budget" after the expenses scandal.
"In fact, it is now national, you must live" on budget "and you are treated as" the m... "
He said: "I spent my money in my garden and I asked a small part, based on what was right.
and I have been claim well, but I do that. "
The member of parliament, a millionaire from his former position as an oil trader, has begun to explain its spending in May, after it emerged that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before agreeing with the fees office that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist has dug a hole in the form of £in the lawn of Mr Duncan to protest after it was revealed that he had claimed £4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing, last night, Mr Duncan said: "It was for improvements capitals, approved at the time by the fees office then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem of evasion or development or use of rules or anything.
It was quite clear in the rules, authorized, etc.
This could not be clearer or more. "

Brighton is a place where creative and, and we try to experiment and to represent it through spirituality. "

Thirty-two years is enough ".
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on a U.S. arrest warrant.

The singer was "placed in an artificial coma that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort to prevent suffering and be able to administer treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted Monday for an infection following surgery for a herniated disc on 26 November in Paris.
The singer had to be on Wednesday night to Thursday because of major damage resulting from this intervention.
His wife went Laeticia Friday morning at the French Lycée in Los Angeles where is educated their daughter Jade, to attend a school,, an AFP photographer.
The head of trauma and orthopaedic surgery at the hospital in the Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel Monday in Los Angeles with the singer.
The producer has vehemently challenged Dr Stephane Delajoux, neurosurgeon who operated the singer on 26 November at the International Park Monceau Clinic in Paris.
We were told that it was a massacre.
surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, "said Mr Camus.
I heard talk of a possible judicial proceedings to come, "he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday was "party much too fast for Los Angeles, with the permission of the surgeon in Paris."

Shortly before on RTL, he had said that the singer was apparently "party without drain, without anything," after his operation in Paris.
Dr. Stephane Delajoux is well known in the artistic community.
It had made the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was at the time.
In 2007, he had also made the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to eliminate hematoma following a brain hemorrhage.
But it is also a doctor at the sulfureuse reputation, repeatedly condemned by justice, in cases of medical liability and for tax evasion and fraud.
Mr. Olivier Metzner, counsel for the Order of Doctors, was accused of being a "man without scruples" pursued "regularly" before the Council of the order, and that is "not recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stephane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
He said that the intervention was "quite well" and that the post-operative tests were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and does not require the installation of a drain," he added.
In any event, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, appears in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (Amiens) as planned, it seems very short, "said Mr Camus.
The association UDF increase the tone and the New Centre not to use its logo
The association UDF, controlled by the MoDem party of François Bayrou, responded Friday to the attempted takeover of the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, the symbol of the ex-parti giscardien, warning not be used on any support, under penalty of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the acronym UDF, ruling that Francois Bayrou did not deserve to his political legacy after having reached out to the left.
The defense minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy Saturday before the National Council of NC.
To support his approach, he received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP past the NC), which claims ownership of the trademark UDF for having been the first to file in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But Friday evening, the office of the association UDF, controlled by friends of François Bayrou, who do not intend to let strip, has broken his silence to launch a formal notice to the Minister and MP, demanding to no longer use the logo and the ownership of the trademark, under penalty of prosecution.
You have multiplied in recent days, the statements indicating that you are going to your political movement + resume + the acronym UDF, the association wrote in a letter signed by 19 of 24 members of the office, including Francois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez the MoDem, as well as Senator Jean ARTHUIS centrist Alliance.
You also have to follow up on your equipment activist and on the front page of your site, the name of this movement, the + New Center, the slogan 'the UDF today +, also found the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to the use of the acronym, said the office of the UDF that remains the NC to withdraw "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF any medium and (its) website."
It also asks Herve de Charette "to convey the property of (the) marks its legitimate right."
If you do not, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, prevent signatories.
In their letter they specify that the UDF "is a full-fledged political movement since 1978" and noted that Mr. Morin and his friends had been made the choice of leaving in 2007 "to create a movement competitor, as others have done in 2002, to create the UMP."
The New Center was therefore, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 accession to the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "the moral and material interests" training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, says the office, "when he filed the mark," there was "no longer a member of the UDF for three years," but the UMP.
It is scandalous and fraudulently the abscence of deposit of the acronym for the UDF to his account.
This indélicatesse is turning into crime, dénoncent-ils, before, on the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more fit to make a name for yourself to out of anonymity by using a false name to which it was not right."
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The tribunal of Nanterre decided Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine if, as the acknowledges the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, it has benefited from a state of weakness of the s to rob a portion of his fortune.

But the 15th Criminal Chamber also ordered a medical examination of Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87 years, should be waged collectively by three doctors.

I think it will.
I am going to talk about, "said at the end of the hearing, counsel for Mrs Bettencourt, Georges Kiejman.
For his part, counsel for Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, lawyer Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is great news... The expertise will show that he (Mr Banier) has handled this elderly lady that we must protect, he said.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has committed criminal case against François-Marie Banier, photographer and artist entertainer, which it accuses of having benefited for years from the weakness of his mother to obtain one billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, insurance contracts or paintings by masters.
For his part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, which it sees as a longtime friend.
While the court to examine the admissibility of the action taken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, arguments from lawyers have sometimes turned to the family unpacking Friday
Thus, lawyer Liliane Bettencourt has reported three letters sent by his client (1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary, in which she said wary of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to lawyer: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for 15 years.
Françoise, I have never been able to talk since her marriage ".
For its part, the prosecutor in Nanterre took the view that the complainant was not entitled to act, especially as a guardianship judge refused in recent days of his application to open a procedure for judicial protection for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has the ability to court, it is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one person has to act in his place, "said the representative of the public, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court decided that it would once the trial will be on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers

The internal polls – as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its salariés- will incite a revolution in the managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I fear not.
First because I could see that, faced with a new situation, any structure is finally, after many twists, priority... what it has always done.!
- Second, because authoritarianism – the pathologies of the increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most of the leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
Issus of major engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old theory behaviourist, revived recently by the "American" neuroscience and widely disseminated, them, by the institutes and the media.
Thus, suggesting that it is possible to handle "levers" (sic) the commitment of executives, a recent survey by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr conforte-t-elle leaders in a mechanistic governance posture, inadequate in today's world.
Identify and measure the factors of
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the functioning of modern business, is a finalist vision of human behaviour.
It is to integrate, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: for employees, the commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means of achieving a portion of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only studies from motifonctionnelle Analysis adopt this design of motivations of employees.
These studies have shown that they feel their company based on a predetermined DOXA which allows them through their image of the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their life projects.
to the identification and measurement of these factors of mobilization, business leaders can control, forecast and anticipate their "social performance" and put their management of human resources "."
They create a breeding ground for joint development of a robust and effective economic intelligence.
by Oslo: the "just war" is right to praise to Obama
The American right has Friday the speech the day in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had brocardé awarding the prize to Mr Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential address, like Sarah Palin, the former vice-presidential candidate in the election of 2008.
I liked what he said, "said Mrs Palin, égérie from the right wing of the Republican Party, the USA Today, adding that she herself addressed the issue of the war" sometimes necessary "in his memoirs that have been published.
The war, is the last thing in my view that Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We must stop these terrorists out there, she said.
Mr Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, has sought Thursday to Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr Obama, Newt Gingrich, said that the president had made in Oslo "a very good job."
I found that the speech was very well, welcomed the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, which has particularly liked the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of
For some side, I found this quite historic, "said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed for the radio show" The Takeaway ".
The former elected, regarded by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012, said he was glad to have seen "a leftist president" to remind members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not give a price for peace if the use of force did not exist.
For Michael Gerson, former pen of George W. Bush turned columnist for the Washington Post, Mr Obama has delivered a very American ".
present themselves in a "citizen of the world", as it always does, "he spoke as an American president," reminding Europeans "they live in a bubble of security they have not created and that they do little to preserve it," said Mr. Gerson.
Among the few right not to be convinced, a hawk in the Bush era, the former ambassador to the UN, John Bolton, called the speech "dull, ampoulé and without inspiration" on the National Review Online.
To the left of the president, Rep. Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When envelope the war in the concept of justice, it can easily justify the killing of innocent people, "he warned.
The center-left press remained at the the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that the Nobel prize was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, called the speech "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo discourse "should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," has inflamed the California newspaper.
Mr. Obama "gave the speech he was," said the New York Times, saying "both dark and uplifting."
Road: three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas
After three sessions of négociations-marathon talks, the road sector unions and employers' organisation TLF, only to be stayed until the end, arrived Friday evening in an agreement that puts an end to the strike and the threat to the supply of Christmas.
At the meeting of signatures Friday evening, the secretary of state for transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "delighted" of this agreement, after several rounds of negotiations, which began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions negotiators were left in the morning Friday, with the hope of signing quickly in late morning the text of the agreement.
And even if three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had slammed the door.
But it took more than six hours a meeting which began at 1100 so that everyone is in agreement and at 6 p.m. the text should be signed.
The conflict "would have been very damaging for business" and "it was feared that would disrupt the celebrations for years," said Mr BUSSEREAU.
The text provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and euro2.9% for the highest (international).
In hourly rate for the bas-salaires, "spend 8,72 euros to 9,06.
It is not a great thing, but it is very far, said Patrice Clos (TF).
we will give the order to our supporters that there are no obstacles, not blockade centres of supplies.
But we can always be a few holdouts who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, has a "good agreement", even if it was "difficult to concede the increases on salaries given international competition..
According to him, the increases will be the order of 170 euros a month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the top.
It is the agreement of good sense and respect of employees, "said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) hailed a" historic agreement ".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) has to "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for the upgrading of travel costs of 3%, and the general state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will help to address the issue of a 13th month and modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr BUSSEREAU recalled that "a drop of 100 million in employer contributions" has been the subject of a Government amendment to the bill amending budget for 2009, passed Thursday night by the National Assembly
The government will ask the Senate vote "in identical terms".
The signing of TLF provides that the agreement applies first to the member companies to this organization, and in a second time, the entire profession, in case of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be "in the shortest possible time," said Mr BUSSEREAU.
The opposition of employers' organisations may only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "fool" because the 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to offset a portion of the carbon tax."
The Secretary of State for Transport has obliged us to negotiate in an emergency, not in the conclusion of a shared analysis, but not to thwart the turkey eaters next New Year, deplored the Unostra.
For the Otre, the agreement risk "to the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months..
RER A: disruption this weekend, unions unhappy with proposals of the RATP
The disruption on the RER A, the largest urban transit line of France, will continue over the weekend, when a meeting Friday on the second day of strike between unions and management of the RATP left on their hunger for their application of premium.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there will be trains between 1000 and 2000, on a train on two on the central portion (between Defence and Nation) and one train in four outside the central section.
interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, requiring passengers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette, who expect 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP efforts to serve the big stores."
The RER A crosses in the city of Paris.
The stretch RATP short of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre in Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
Friday, about one train in two was circulated at peak hours, and almost no paddle in off-peak hours, as planned.
on Thursday, there were no crowds on the docks, Franciliens is being organised.
And in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, especially because of high school students.
A Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, 29-year-old engineer, to be lifted "a half hour earlier, so be sure to arrive on time."
The Saint-Lazare station has not been saturation, said SNCF, which had provided a framework of agents and security forces.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare Saint-Lazare to join the subways.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held Saturday and Sunday, which will review the results, be "meagre" by the unions, a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the RER A on all aspects, working time, career etc.
This is not what we want drivers, who are a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP puts even its proposed premium brackets, has outraged the CGT, noting that management was "not fichue to fix a problem while in the road and the SNCF is done."
A new meeting is scheduled Monday for "a broader review of conditions for the exercise of the profession," said the RATP.
What did also say the unions that the company "of users of the weekend."
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded a committee of establishment at the headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the leadership, which refused until then any discussion during the strike, had suggested "in a spirit of appeasement" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to widen the RER B Tuesday, after the filing of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
The unions are demanding a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to EUR 150 euro30 variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line the million daily passengers.
drivers of RSP, all in the second part of their career, to 2,700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros in bonuses for the shifts, Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish courts dissolved the pro-Kurdish party, decision consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled Friday the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision which was immediately followed by anger in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which is to reach out to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was disbanded because it had become a "centre of activities prejudicial to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," said the press, the President Hasim Kilic, after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to advise the dissolution, said Mr Kiliç, adding that 37 the party, including its President Ahmet Turk and Aysel Tugluk MP, are banned from politics for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Mrs Tugluk and confiscation of the property of the party.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MEPs would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without a label.
The decision follows a process launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accused the DTP to obey the "of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), blacklisted as a terrorist group by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political wing of the PKK rebels..
The party maintains, however, that there was "no organic links" with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with him.
The verdict of the Court comes at a time when the government comes out to the Kurdish community in proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, to try to cut off support to the PKK Kurds and put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP had said that a dissolution could lead to an escalation of tensions in the southeast, where many protests against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, a thousand protesters gathered in front of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the largest city in the southeast populated mainly by Kurds.
The police fired tear gas and used water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails and stones with fronds.
About 100 people have in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr Türk said that the decision of Justice would "deepen despair."
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish) banning a party, "he told reporters.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of parties.
does not resolve, "said Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total of democratic openness launched by the government, "said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, "he added.
On Thursday, the PKK has claimed an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the Turkey, one of the most in recent months.
The new "Silicon-valley"
For a long time it had the reputation of city secret, off-limits to visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the 10 districts in Moscow, was under the Soviet regime, a place of secret weapons research, under strict supervision.
Today with its 216 000 inhabitants to 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the "Silicon Valley".
Significant production sites and research into micro and nanoelectronics.
In September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, place science francfortois – with academic institutions, and in the centre innovations in Frankfurt (FIZ).
There were meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd Riedberg signed a "Memorandum of close cooperation."
The signatories were the mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the prefect of Zelenograd Anatoly Smimov to the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz section chief project for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strong point is scientific research, will Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific Exchange
It is a scientific exchange sustainable.
But of economic relations.
It will allow companies to the FIZ to enter the Russian market.
Conversely the Russian scientists to obtain contracts in Germany.
institutes Zelenograd is the seat of Soviet research companies and celebrities.
There is the Institute of Electrical Engineering from Moscow, the major firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The town was founded in 1958 as "socialist planned city" to weapons research.
Zelenograd (literal translation "Green City") gets its name from forested hills in the heart of which research centres are located.
The project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
Cannot be placed high enough the magnitude of the project Stuttgart 21.
To its supporters it is nothing less than a "new heart of Europe".
If you want. S21 is far more than the land-filling of a railway station, a massive construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of BadenWürttemberg, chaos in a despairing yards for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born of the spirit of the 1980s.
The stations, with routes which ended in town, had a reputation at the time of the relics of the art of transport in the 19th century that were effect of brake shoe modern rail traffic because it was once a lot of time to get the locomotives back to the front.
Arrival, stopping short, departure – that is what needed to be done.
That is why the stations to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And Stuttgart too: a train station, which is about halfway on the the trans-European rail between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava where the slogan "heart of Europe".
The project S21 will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners have acknowledged that the cost to bury the station in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
Indeed, the head of the line does not really pose the entry and exit problems since there are modern trains, reversible with railcars and voiture-pilote at both ends.
However it is now the Stuttgart 21 of the new line towards
The regional policies won the day.
The railway is part, because it is the taxpayer who is the cost of the risks of the largest infrastructure project of the Federal Republic and not a public company.
From the point of view planning this project is relatively well justified.
There is an urban area that – if we are to believe the computer-generated graphics planners – will be very green.
For the system of rail transport the S21 is harmful.
The station and enlargement of the section are designed for a human trafficking which was - and this is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth.
At the time, there was no competition from cheap flights.
The modern traffic policy should concentrate on strengthening the traffic of goods transport by rail is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new route, with its leanings, is for freight trains.
The S21, and it is much more serious indirectly affects many other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be submerged in the draft the Bolzano.
It is the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is for sure, in the next decade this money for other junctions and congestion in the network
The list of the Department of Transportation said in all 60 major projects.
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section across the Rhine Valley 180 good kilometres.
Since 1987 the line is built at idle.
It would be really urgent support here to build on the fungus.
But the project S21 had the effect of a hoof brakes.
The itinerary of the Rhine Valley is becoming the bottleneck international freight traffic, and this in the heart of Europe.
The Government is considering the judgment on the airport
the regional parliament in Wiesbaden, the Land Government raised the possibility of appealing to the Supreme Administrative Court of Hesse concerning the prohibition of night flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the coalition of CDU / FDP had entrusted experts to examine the legal point of view the ruling by the Administrative Court, which is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Tribunal of Kassel was justified in writing that the Land should adapt the regulation on the prohibition of night flights in the case or the construction of the trail of aterrissage northwest of Frankfurt airport was reached.
The approval of attérir for 17 aircraft between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as envisaged by the Land Government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against air pollution.
The coalition must have decided for January 4, if it wants to make an appeal against the judgment.
The opposition criticism this time and attempts to put pressure on the government representative for celui-cirenonce to appeal to the Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise before the elections and which was to prohibit night flights. Otherwise, it will be considered a failure in a word.
That is darn hard to be allowed to keep its word, said the leader of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir referring to the éléctoral slogan of the FDP "We keep our promises."
The Minister Dieter Posch denies accusations of Schäfer-Gümbel who claims that the Land Government attempts to authorize still night flights using avocasserie and roublardises. "
It takes time to make a legal review.
The coalition does not take a decision on the basis of a "first impression."
It is important that the decision is legally reliable, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition concerning the statements of his part on the prohibition of night flights is completely érronée.
American banks repay aid
large U.S. banks, very affected by the crisis, défont their ties to the state.
Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had fully repaid to the Treasury $45 billion (more than 30 billion Euros), corresponding to aid through the Tarp rescue plan.
The US television channel NBC reported a report that Citigroup was also planning to repay the aid received.
The banking institutions seek to get rid of restrictions, which accompanied the acceptance of money, such as limiting bonuses awarded to the officer and Regulation of higher costs.
The Bank of Americaa launched a capital increase through the sale of securities to investors, which reported $19 billion of fresh money.
The rest comes from the coffers of the bank who are satisfied with the sale of several branches of other sectors.
On Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis, the Director General of the Bank of America held specifically to thank U.S. taxpayers: the injection of capital has significantly helped overcome a difficult period.
The bank had assumed its capacity by buying the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup also plans to get money in the financial markets to be free from the tutelage of the state.
The U.S. bank could launch as early as Thursday a capital increase of 20 billion, reported the chain CNBC, quoting banking community.
The spokesman for Citigroup did not wish to comment on this information.
In June the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they received.
accelerated Election
Finally it is still spent more quickly than expected.
Barely two weeks after the sacking of the current position of the chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German channel ZDF, a successor is appointed.
The committee wanted to vote yesterday evening to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who heads the drafting in Berlin on ZDF was the odds-on favorite.
The chain, however, did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote so as not to pre-empt the proceedings.
However, it appears that there was also a desire not to further undermine the steward of ZDF Markus Schächter in the event that the proposal would not be accepted by the Council of.
Frey, who is the candidate of Schächter, needed the votes of nine members of the Commission on 14.
The outcome of the vote was not yet known at the end of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Council of Administration to extend for five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender, but this was rejected.
Only seven Council members had supported the renewal of Brender and 7 others had voted against. The dismissal by vote of Brender represented a failure while predictable for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which has a majority in the Council of Administration had already suggested several weeks before the vote, not wanting to renew Brender at his position.
This is Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse who had organized a league against the editor.
He had denied that the contract of the esteemed chief is extended, citing the fact that the rate of to the news of the ZDF had fallen below Brender.
This is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, denouncing the growing political influence exerted on ZDF.
At the end there was even 35 experts in public law which had immiscés in the debate and who felt that the way to Koch was unconstitutional.
But it will have been in vain.
Peter Frey: Who is it?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 at Bingen.
He has studied the science-policy, pedagogy and Romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked in radio body Südwestfunk (Rhineland-Palatinate) and the German newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau (national).
In 1983 he became editor in the ZDF first the news magazine "heute-journal" (newspaper today).
Then his journey continues: from 1988 to 1990, he was the deputy editor of the time; then Washington correspondent in 1991 / 1992, then in 1998 he was head and presenter of "Morgenmagazins" (fortnightly information presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the service of foreign policy of ZDF and of the drafting in Berlin
After the disgrace of Brender, when he had just been elected journalist of the year by the journal Medium Magazin, the Greens have announced that they would a constitutional complaint
The opponent of Koch in the Council of Administration, the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the states should transform the Treaty the ZDF so that the staff of the Intendant could not be blocked by a political majority biased.
However, Beck has no plans to seek the removal of political, members of the committees of the ZDF.
Peter Frey, the likely successor to Brender had deftly maneuvered to the Council of Administration criticizing the Commission vehemently in his decision to sack Brender.
to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose for the position of editor without losing face, as well as the Council of Administration could elect without being put in the position of being a supporter.
In the representations of the parties, Frey is classified liberal left.
Grand in the university education
success for students: After a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliatory: At a meeting between Ministers and delegates to the Conference of Presidents, an agreement has been developed stipulating that the working conditions of students Bachelor or Master should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to end their studies.
They are particularly, to reduce the weight of accordpour reviews: a single examination is expected to close the module of study.
In addition, the workload will be reconsidée to ensure "proportions, realistic and acceptable."
political authorities and institutions of higher education to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also agreed to hold joint structural requirements more flexible for the of Bachelor and Master.
At the regional level, there should be different rules from one state to another.
Less reviews
Since the beginning of student protests in June, the Minister of Education of the Länder and the university rectors have repeatedly in the mouth the buzzword: "Étudiabilité."
But for the first time this expression seems to take a specific meaning.
The accreditation council decided to reduce the number of tests: "Each module should normally be concluded by a single exam," it said in a document of 33-odd pages on the requirements for admission to the university
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Board of Certification said that by significantly reducing the burden of we should be able to stop the slippage, which interfered considerably with the étudiabilité.
The "étudiabilité" should be considered in the future, the decisive criterion for the organization of studies.
The modules like the bottom should be carefully examined to see if you can't avoid this of sensation that are sometimes in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge on RAID Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and the flexibility to allow and encourage the personal initiative".
The new rules will affect access to new students but will also be adapted to the existing cycles.
These cycles must "réaccrédités" every five years, which means, however, that it was not until 2015 that all cycles have been reviewed.
There are 10 accreditation agencies competent in the federal territory who depend on the accreditation council created by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had exerted some pressure on the Länder to weigh on agencies so that the programmes are not too loaded and the regime of exams not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and graduate schools have already agreed with their regional departments to take the appropriate measures.
The Rhineland-Palatinate is so far the only Land have agreed to grant more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize programs tutorielset strengthen the educational guidance offices as well as the offices of reviews and the International Relations Department
The Länder and universities provide a budget of 10 million.
In early 2010, the government wants to submit to Parliament an amendment to the law on higher education institutions.
After that it will take more than a single examination to complete his studies.
The organization of studies will be more flexible, more must be able to guarantee the recognition of transcripts of other institutions of higher education and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "étudiabilité" of all students will be reviewed.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition have again discussed the issue of study conditions in the country.
The décisionsont welcomed but there have been some criticisms.
The Federal President of the Socialist student has indicated that he would like the organization of educational policy does not happen in the future "behind closed doors" of Ministers and presidents of universities.
after the strike, students as people concerned should be able to speak a little.
future of higher education we received the support of the President of delegates to the Conference of Presidents (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "the experience is very useful," she said Thursday during a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with which the HRK is working on a common reform project.
the union of Education and Science (GEW) decisions made in Bonn does not go far enough. He claims the right and the opportunity for each Bachelor degree to enroll in a cycle of Master.
Andreas Keller, a member of the steering committee of the GEW asked that the Länder provide students Bachelor today, tomorrow there will be enough places for studies in Master and of conditions as good as possible.
The Länder must hire more lecturers.
By contrast, the Ministers of Education have not raised the possibility of easing access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is these words "Arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins the poet Werner Söllner, in which he thématise in snippets of sentences troubling, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who won freedom but lost at the same time its linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat in Romania, was first teacher of German and English in Bucharest and, subsequently, director of collection in a publishing house for youth before moving to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner received various literary prizes; in 1993 he took the highly coveted poetry of Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002, he was director of the Forum for literature of Hesse in the house of artist Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
It has been a lot of him in literary circles not last Tuesday, at a conference in Munich, whose theme was "The German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your files Securitate."
Visibly upset and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he admitted to his fellow writers such as Richard Wagner germano-roumains, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had worked as an informant for the Securitate political police.
Söllner received in 1989, the price of the German language in with some of the participants.
The enrolment trials began insidiously in 1971.
I am, "Söllner" someone who has not sufficiently resisted auxessais intimidation of the Securitate. "
Poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (MI Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honoration award of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and his literary run-ins with the mechanisms of power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, in a case that clearly shows the pitfalls and bassesse of a political system based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say with the current knowledge, not only guilty but also a victim.
In its own Securitate file, MI Walter played a role, ensures the specialist literature Michael Markel after the confession of Söllner and it refers to the positive influence of IM Walter, who had interceded on his behalf.
"had been drawn from all difficult situations at the time," says Markel.
Moralde Markel has felt the need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before the public was unexpected, however the confession of a former dissident its collaboration with the Romanian secret service is not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant for spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper Die Zeit, "after reading the 914 pages of his own record.
assume that the victims have made speculation and may have guessed what real names hiding last names borrowing Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
Unlike Germany, where between the consultation of the Stasi files is a highly-reliable process, the attitude to the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confused.
A systematic clarification was constantly frustrated and depressed in past years.
It was not until 1999 that a national council corresponding to the institution Birthler was created to work to the assimilation of the Securitate Archives (CNSAS) but the restitution of files instead has dragged on since.
Since 2005, there is a law that defines the management of'archives.
the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very high, was confirmed by an interview with a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expressed a very dismissive of the winner.
She had a psychosis, and in it had interviewed only once.
The infamy of power thought he could speak here, without any gene, under the guise of freedom of expression.
course, many questions are inevitably the case Söllner as so often happens in a context of guilt hidden.
Why now? Who has been despoiled? The weighted response from listeners, the admission of Söllner hope that the rest of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge that by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a footnote.
in the Champions League
It was felt that a representative arrived here, fired four pins from a Christmas party sexy, on which the maker of sportswear had spread its goods when the new BFV coach Christian Gross, at midnight the shift in a Mercedes Class C, he had just called, an orange plastic bag supplier in hand.
The man, whose skull bald drew attention, was driving in the city that was still foreign.
Otherwise our peers could take the wheel – it had not been drinking, and he was not drunk with happiness.
He had spent a pleasant evening but tomorrow it would resume work.
As it is now that it would begin.
The words of we had to hire three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth of," that is to say in the Champions League to our 3: 1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania "but we must not allow ourselves to be blinded by success. This will be a brutal battle for not going."
The "big job" lies ahead Sunday.
Here, it is repeated in Mainz, the results of the Champions League.
And it will overcome the weaknesses that resurfaced after the three goals of expeditious Marica (5.), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Drawing of lots
The eighth final of the Champions League (first. 16 / 17. + 23 / 24 February / return match. 9 / 10. + 16 / 17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of the inauguration of the successor of fulminant Babbel was moderate.
And the joy was not only moderate who had brought luck, which was sent to professionals in Stuttgart destabilized, highly motivated and fun to play.
I was seeing the players and I told them that they should focus on their strengths, I told them to be more courageous, explained the "plumber souls" – Gross - the recipe for success that sonnait if bienmais was no longer the trainer Babbel.
It has triggered a certain magic, confessed Jens Lehmann - supporter of Babbel, "in football when there is a new impetus it happens sometimes things we would never have thought possible.".
And Sami Khedira, after weeks break for injury, advanced to the ranks of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" found by a proverbial "wind" and working methods of the new leader: "someone who goes to the action and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation. "
But apparently Babbel had failed.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet turned the corner, warned the manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart in need of tenacity.
as Gross, the players and the manager not to overstate the victory against a defence completely outdated and weakened from guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before they have had four days later a bad awakening in Leverkusen with 0: 4, Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved the goal of the season, but there were others who were still far off.
We have not yet passed the difficult course.
That Heldt the day of his 40th birthday does not have the heart to make the party, even after the first victory at home over the past three months, the events of the weekend that a television interview goalkeeper Jens Lehmann was bouncing back just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that are contrecarrait and not Jens, Heldt, in response to the criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the management of weakness of style and said it had decided to change coaches under pressure from pubertaires fans.
Lehmann had seen also as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jalousiele fact that his day of freedom after matches had been deleted.
The statements by Lehmann was "marked by a pure selfishness" enfonça Heldt and announced the consequences for the goalie.
They were more likely to become friends for life these two quadragénaires.
In any cast, they agreed to everything else, that is to say that without the work of the group by the coach replaced, strong and combative sports representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "for a large part in the success" rétorquèrent Heldt and Lehmann in chorus – and even the plastic bag.
World Championship heavy
Hot hot in Bern: Kevin Johnson caused the Challenger constantly verbally and gestuellement world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after 12 rounds difficult Ukrainian defended his title of world heavyweight champion from the version of the WBC federation.
The unanimity of judges he imposed points.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko retained his title of world heavyweight champion.
The federation WBC announced that on the night of Saturday, 38 years, had won a victory pts. at the unaminité judges against American Kevin Johnson (120: 10).
For the third time Klitschko with honour defends his title since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously the Ukrainian had already won twice the title of world champion federations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately it has not the KB.
Klitschko, walked 39 times winner in 41 professional fights, had to admit twice its defeat because of injuries.
The challenger Johnson has accepted its first defeat in the 24th fight.
In the arena of Berne, before 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko has mainly wanted to dictate the fight, the top of his 2.02 metres, by his against the left.
Johnson, 11 inches smaller, which before the duel, announced the end of the era of Klitschko, managed to avoid the empéchant champion, and Klitschko bring into its game against right-wing dangeureuse.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, has tried to move the rounds.
Although he continued to cause Klitschko words and deeds reached his shots only very rarely champion.
It is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, have exceeded with Klitschko distance of 12 rounds.
The Challenger had done a lot of noise in the capital Switzerland before the fight.
The insulta Klitschko was a "villain" zombie "is not really capable."
During weighing on Friday, the champion could not prevent cause Johnson in him removing his sunglasses nose "to see his eyes."
comeback victory since the Fourth of Klitschko.
Klitschko has emerged again at his fourth fight since his comeback on 11 October 2008
After a break of almost four years ago, he was beaten at the time the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" Ring that it had previously abandoned without a fight.
This year, defending his title of champion, he won the battle against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and September against Chris Arreola the USA.
"I just took a blow in this fight, and am in perfect shape," said Klitschko to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring in the family all four major titles.
His brother Wladimir is the IBF and WBO champion federations.
But it is Britain's David Haye, who the great détroné Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 metres - in November, is the WBA belt.
This summer, Hague had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko scheduled to take place in September.
It would appear that his development company plans to play this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
frontal attack opposition: the head of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, has accused the Defence Minister Guttenberg of lying in the case of the Case Kunduz.
The SPD and The Left Party (Die Linke) demanded Chancellor explanations.
Hamburg / Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on the air attack in Kunduz, the opposition has accused the Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) have délibérémentdissimulé some facts.
The Minister has intentionally "made an untruth" on the deadly strike two trucks last September, said the leader of the Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, Saturday during the broadcast of information chain ARD Tagesschau "(the newspaper p.m.).
Clearly, this means he lied.
The order to kill was given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
It is, in essence, the contents of the report available to NATO and which was read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new revelations of media, the objective of lafrappe was in reality, not to destroy the stolen trucks, but was intended to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to report of NATO, 142 people had been killed or injured in the US air strike was launched at the request of Colonel German Goerg Klein, commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left Saturday urged Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to decide as soon as possible before the federal parliament and reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Green Party Renate Künast are of the opinion that Mrs Merkel must say clearly whether the strategy of targeted killings is part of the Government of Afghan politics if the chancery, the army and intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejects the criticism.
The Chancery has in any way influenced the army action in Afghanistan, he said.
Saturday, the were increasingly strong to express doutesquant real reasons for the dismissal of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as it had been presented by the department.
According to information SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had provided to Guttenberg concerning the attack trucks were both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the report of NATO and hid the Minister some embarrassing details.
In the entourage of two senior officials suggests, however, that they informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein as well as a military police report.
"The Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert would meanwhile demanded in a letter clarifying facts.
So far, it has not received a response
Saturday, the department did not wish to comment on the charges and referred to the Committee of Inquiry of the federal parliament which would be the next Wednesday so the light on the facts in question.
The worlds of dream
Some see, while awake, images and hear voices that nobody else sees or hears.
It is not only among the mental patients, or under the influence of drugs, that the boundaries between fantasy and reality blur.
As these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is going very well.
When we are lying in our rooms clouded, we can do without hindrance to the dreams and wildest fantasies.
However, awake, the state of dream, hear and see things that others do not perceive, has a reputation in the Western world to be mad or drugged, or at least be an original.
Such images and voices do not appear in the mental ill or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination that is at stake: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, painting pictures or write novels, but sometimes prompts the boundaries between the dream, madness and reality merge.
A state of arousal aware, taking the form of a dream, can take various forms, in the best case we call it visions, at worst madness.
But even if the trigger and effect the, the, visions of Hildegard von Bingen, the experiences of drugs of the Prophet of the New Age Carlos Castaneda, the chamanes, the second of hallucinations and psychosis are attributable to process very similar.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance of neurotransmettrices substances in the brain - primarily dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and achétylcholine - breaks and that the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
délirantes complex thoughts and hallucinations occur very often for a schizophrenic psychosis.
The pull of the Earth has no power over the individual.
Since antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between the madness and the dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of rêve-éveillé; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 "great similarity between the madness and the dream," Sigmund Freud the dream was even "psychosis with all irregularities, imagination, sensory illusions and delusions of the".
We are in the 2001 when Henning T turns into a comic strip character.
His body has two dimensions to the criardes colours.
The pull of the Earth has more power over him, he is the wave of the ceiling.
He feels a coup.
Behind him creatures of devil ailées, grimaçantes, his mouth bloodied, showing teeth.
They continue, give him kicking with heavy boots, the cast against the walls, he feels pain throughout the body.
A thundering voice, nasty howl, leaving the walls and radio.
It can no longer tolerate these voices who insult and humiliate.
Henning T. rip two cables his stereo, in fact a loop and attached to a hook attached to the ceiling.
It goes on a baffle and happens the loop around his neck.
It jumps.
The loop.
That this will serve as a lesson, the voice in a chorus to extract the burst. "Go in a clinic and fais-toi treat!"
Today Henning T. was 40 years he has lived six acute psychosis, the last date of 2 years, the first in nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
The diagnosis: schizo-affective, paranoid psychosis, furthermore it is maniaco-dépressif, he takes medication for depression, mania and schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he was married for three years.
During the psychosis I experienced terrible fear and deep despair.
The illusions are a cruel reality.
one percent of the population suffers at least once in her life with schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics is the most common illness after depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, people can no longer tell the difference between the inside and the outside world, they are in a state of "hyper arousal, which they may suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices - voice command, who comment or dialogue.
optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the large and the small, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the conscious is drowned in the sensations.
Just as the dream, psychosis opens the locks in a tide of ideas and fantasies of deeper layers of conscience.
The perception of reality into psychosis is focused on the issue, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the department of psychiatry at the University of Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is located in the centre of the situation, at a service focused on him.
At the same time he found himself in a passive role, it is a dream, overcome by events and not act on them active.
This is why people with schizophrenia often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general they don't have the opportunity to adjust the reality, the illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
the experience once in a lifetime of a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory structure and to the reality that is seen during the psychosis is basically maintained."
The thoughts and hallucinations délirantes are based on reality, the alienation of the lived in a real framework.
Why our brains doing this kind of cabrioles, is still a mystery to researchers.
exceptional situations can bring everyone to momentarily lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people develop psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determinants.
researchers speculate that those involved are tiny brain damage.
It is assumed that the maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, "Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained is how the anomaly of the neural system occurs and the fact that it is not seen for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis, if there is a predisposition.
Similarly the hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brains heating.
This is crazy, "said psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck, that suffer from their hallucinations and psychotic drugs expensive to, while others buy drugs expensive to obtain.
The perception pleasant or unpleasant illusions is often just a matter of perspective.
Kasten brings together for ten years reports of hallucinations and phenomena of images illusory: last year published his findings in a book entitled "The unreal world in our heads."
The hallucinations are indeed part of concurrent phenomena typical psychoses but also an impressive number of many other diseases.
them or psychological problems borderline or depression but also migraine headaches, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's or head trauma
It is surprising that under certain conditions even the brains of healthy people is prone to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take form when the areas of the brain that the sensory perceptions are not, hyperactives or refrénées; when our brains heats but also when there is lack of stimulation.
The drugs can trigger this state as a brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, the chagrins of love or other mental states.
In recent studies, one-third of participants acknowledged having made at least once in a lifetime experience a hallucination.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. 16 years ago, she lives in a small town Pomerania and it goes to the school.
A young girl to be normal to say.
If there were the images and voices.
During the break, that a young boy, thin, with long châtain hair, to address the floor.
When she meets his comrades watch, surprised - nobody sees or hears this boy.
They believe that this is a shy girl rêveuse lunatic but Sarah K does not dream, it is certain.
She is awake, hear and see the boy as she sees and hears the girl who is sitting beside her on the bench.
It can even collect his presence temporarily.
It is a good feeling, she found this young sympathetic.
Am I crazy?, t-elle sometimes.
But she knows that this young and other visions are not real and they will disappear again.
The night appearances, in frightening.
Often the visions are cumbersome.
When it is in the classroom, that it can monitor the course because the teacher is just to present a new student in his eyes and ears when it is invisible to others and that the professor is clearly trying to explain the equations in table.
The night appearances, in frightening.
When, in the darkness of his bedroom, it expects sleep too little and too late, it often cannot distinguish if she is awake or dream already, if the images she sees, faces grimaçants or the girl with bloody cuts on his arms and legs are before his eyes open or closed.
Let me alone, shouts to these creatures.
It does not speak or his parents or friends, they would take to a mad.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. now has 20 years.
It had his car last year and she lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago the hallucinations have ceased.
Since she came in contact via the Internet with the psychologist Kasten she knows very well that it is not crazy.
The madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or did not sufficient incentives, the likelihood is high that he has hallucinations after a certain period of time.
I assume that the brain is not quite busy, ensures that there is animation.
Sarah K., single girl, was afraid of other children when she was small and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when she learned at 13, that the man she called Daddy, since she was old enough to think, was not his real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active in the acoustic and visual hallucinations, and for the impressions and actual, therefore, it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to differentiate between illusion and reality. "Every experience," according to Kasten "takes place in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real. "
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those in acute psychosis.
the schizophrenia, mentally healthy person is able to recognize that the ghosts are not real images.
That is why Kasten advises her patients to cherish the hallucinations as a special talent.
There is only one step from the dream and the hallucination.
In our world too focused on the conscience has unfortunately been quickly tend to take the imaginary experiences for illnesses, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and physician in chief of the psychiatry and psychotherapy Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
psychosis is a serious disease, painful but which also contains something positive, creator - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has studied the so-called oniroïde experience, one particular form of modifying the conscience awakened by the dream.
The experienced oniroïdes semi-rêves are very complex which are perceived as real by the lives and that it cannot differentiate the dream even when he is in a state of arousal.
The state of consciousness oniroïde occurs during trauma or in situations of extreme conditions as for patients who polyradiculopathie fully aware, experience paralysis engine.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to total disability and sustainable move, it replaces the real situation that affects his life, by his own imaginary world who is divorced from reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between the dream and the hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change in the world, but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, a form of intensive methods and interpretation, in a situation intolerable itself, a capacity that is given to us men, not to sink into the abyss of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurichois Peter Cornelius Classen, art historian also describes his experiences oniroïdes in his book "Change of Heart" as action to safeguard the soul.
It was 49 years, when his conscious leaves for a trip of several days after the operation of a heart valve transplant followed; during that time, his body was sentenced to remain motionless in resuscitation.
Claussen plunged into a world he created from scratch, visit places foreigners, travel back in time. He is an old man in a sanatorium rail, a robot at his bedside care about his health.
He lived in the Middle Ages among nobles who manufacture drugs based on blood.
He was abducted by a Greek motorcycles which takes in his country, he is riding with his hospital bed in the Alps and faces a Korean mafia.
It absorbed completely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
to Claussen these domestic trips are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a quite different, "he wrote in describing what he lived.
Instead of dreams, memories from mental trips are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
We can even say that they are much more distinct and more extensive than the lived experience.
The intensity of this experience burst the horizon of our other everyday experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, the oniroïdes, psychoses delusions, hallucinations and psychédéliques experiences show us how our representations of external reality is fragile, even in a state.
Any change in consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten "may cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience can also be very rewarding.
The first snow can fall
Burda
27 years, children will be the result of the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen as CEO of editions Burda is an intermediate solution: the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children use the press group, he told the newspaper Spiegel.
The company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - long term, the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of its children
The two children will inherit at 27 and are firmly committed to integrate into society, said Hubert Burda, 69, Spiegel.
All the details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they are active in the company will arise.
It will also see if they are able.
We cannot impose its children to 7,500 staff without knowing whether they have the capacity to deal with it.
This the children as well as the company.
Burda said last Thursday that he was withdrawing from the position of President and CEO in January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, is a member of the Board since 1999.
it was responsible for the technology sector.
he served in the sector Treasury that is to say that he was responsible for the company's capital and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took the helm of marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
For the first time, this is not a member of the family who is the head of Burda editions.
children of Burda have respectively 19 and 17 years, his son Felix, who allegedly today 42 years, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to make the connection of 10 to 15 years "
Burda said that the company must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always occurred in families that are left to lead by one bulimia capital, who have made huge speculation unfortunate thinking they could rise still higher.
It was never my strategy.
I've never had a rêvede global power Burda said.
I don't really see in the role of a as the country could be Springer and I do not intend to be part of these leagues such as Time, these firms have taken too much weight.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that allows only to watch his e-mail, without providing the possibility only see certain types of attachments or surf the Internet.
It took its five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine designated as one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see in the streets, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek offers a monthly subscription price and a very low, less than half of what it costs, for example, the subscription data iPhone.
Given its success, the company launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free service data to life, to six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event, The Web is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is also limited his grand-frère American, but includes a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes the roaming across Europe.
Those travelling with a smartphone already know what represents the fact of the data when it crosses a border or desperately seeking a cafeteria on the (or a connection of Fon) to consult his mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and it is a long time that it should work.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I need to have a thesis in physics for the understanding and good glasses to read the small print.
reminders of the European Commission to propose roaming fees affordable throughout Europe have had a barely perceptible.
Outside his country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and it was not wrong.
A a device like the FonPeek (it is still curious that it is Fon when he has no Wi-Fi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators are beginning to think differently and are studying various proposals to make their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other research on the Internet.
Without subscription and without boat.
It is a device connected and pay during its purchase and not every month.
And that is what I hope one day to the FonPeek: a purchase option with access to life as Peek is already in the United States.
I do not want to buy it.
I watch my mail on my phone, thank you.
I would simply because I think it is a more for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The favorite color of Michelle
Yellow is, without doubt, the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
If she went to the inauguration of Barack Obama to the presidency of the United States with a dress and a coat of the color, it has chosen the same to accompany him for the second time, without doubt, the most important of his life: the surrender in Oslo Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a model very similar in both occasions: in addition to ressemblante, a yellow colour to green with bright, both times, the SafeguardTM consisted of three parts: the dress, the jacket and coat, in the same fabric, and was decorated with a large embroidery or a necklace.
although a first glance, it would seem that the first lady of the United States to follow in the wake of Princess of Asturias and chose to return the same required.
But the fabric in which are cut both sets them very different.
If for the inauguration of a thick lace, however, she was a printed velvet in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: shoes to heel means for the first time, and a similar model, but golden, this time.
The headgear has also changed: hair are now records when it was released last time.
75% of mothers who have had professional problems because of their maternity
Discrimination in the workplace has increased in recent years, especially for women younger generations who want to be mothers.
what shows the study "Fertility and career women in Spain," conducted by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, conducted on 9 737 women aged 15 to 75 years, leaves no room for doubt: 75 percent of working mothers saw their careers limited due to motherhood.
The study indicates that there are many differences about the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, whether or not the work and the type of job.
Those who do not work outside the home, working part-time or have a stable job, start earlier in the couple, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
In contrast, women with a stable job, mainly in the public sector, pushing the entry into life as a couple and the first pregnancy, and having fewer children.
Women aged between 35 and 49 with a fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after being installed as a couple. This figure rises to 4.9-million-hectare among those who work in the public sector. "These figures show that women with a stable job needed more time in their lives for it, which led to push the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised considerable influence motherhood, but less than the start date of common life, "said the researcher CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widens the gap in the age of marriage for women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training is high, the more they marry and have their first child later.
The difference is also among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group aged between 35 and 49 years, those who have some elementary and higher, respectively were first-time mothers to 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
"Another is also discrimination between women, according to their level of education.
While those who have completed elementary school marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those with higher average level studies or reverse this program and give priority to obtaining a stable work as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child, "said Ms. Delgado.
Diane Kruger also well worth
L'Oreal Paris to add a new name to his list jalousée ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will embody the image of several products of the mark, singing the common currency, "Because I'm worth it."
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, and join other celebrities listed in L'Oreal Paris, like Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before that, the last to enter this club if select were actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
Among men, the brand of cosmetics are also ambassadors of luxury: Patrick Dempsey (Dr. Grey, lessons anatomy) and Matthew Fox (the companion of Evangeline in Lost).
price of the British

Nobody has missed the appointment.
The former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, elected Best dummy of the year.
The poker as Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer (Alfaguara ases, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) 33-odd "X-rays" writers who have crossed a literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
It does not the gender predictable and apprehended (summary sketch, and life), but by seeking something similar to the core of ignition of the character created.
The trip is exciting and Vincent spares neither the nor the illuminations.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also an invitation moving to readings and relectures.
I leave you here a few snapshots.

A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years, walking in our neighborhood of the town of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent beside her and our dog, a sang-mélé, saved the S.A.P. and not weighing more than six pounds, and without saying a word, they assenèrent behind -foot who left the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is great because we do not see as there are fun to attack a defenceless animal which, moreover, was on-leash.
Add to the indignation of a woman who was walking calmly and who, when these individuals came to fear for his physical integrity, since a énergumène which an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, any lower than him.
The episode took place at around 5 p.m., Tuesday as another in a normally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was gémi throughout the day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint to the police station in the neighborhood, even if we doubt it much and not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We don't understand what's going on among the people so that they find amusing to mistreat a defenceless animal that gives us love, friendship and we held company.
We don't know where the good education and respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for helmets
The tire maker Michelin, in collaboration with the Spaniard for the Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to encourage the helmet, mainly among motorcyclists younger, as reported today the two structures.
this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of helmets, since it is the only element of protection to avoid injuries to the head, or even death, in the event of an two wheels.
Michelin said that the campaign was in line with his commitment to road safety, "which goes beyond the design and manufacture of products always safer" and said it contributed to this objective by other actions to educational and informative.
This new campaign of the in two wheels, under the motto "To be or not to be," will have a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 garages motorcycles, to ensure the widest possible dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main goals is to develop products always safer.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles are starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 10 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the manufacturers' trade union and Ganvam Anfac, the dealers.
It is, however, qualify the good news, since the reference to the comparison, the month of November 2008, was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
result, despite the rebound last month, registrations accumulated during the 11 months are 40 percent below those of the previous year.
Since January, if you add all vehicles into the category of light commercial vehicles (passenger cars, light trucks, vans, pick-up trucks and LDGTs chassis) 95 853 have been sold.
big clouds that most of their applications are not so much dissipated. Indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized companies, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external funding.
Thus, in addition to restrictions entailed by limiting bank loans, other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic climate.
Faced with this situation, and unlike cars, subsidies for the purchase of the 2000E have little used.
In addition to individuals, the self-employed and small businesses wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicle weighing less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, in Ganvam, it recalled again the need for the administration of attention to these vehicles and also to commercial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealers association provides a year 2010 similar to that which ends, for which she calculates a drop in sales (passenger cars and SUV) 19%.
the emergency braking is now mandatory
As has been with the ABS anti-lock system and as will happen with the ESP stability control systems to support emergency braking will be a compulsory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory in passenger cars and light commercial vehicles newly registered, while for the rest of vehicles a waiting period was set up at the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if, by its mode of action, it can also help prevent many rear shocks.
The assistant emergency braking is increasing the pressure on the brakes in emergency cases detected by the system through the kick given by the driver.
But it does not always maintained the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for cars Bosch, a third of drivers involved in an accident was not able to rely on the brakes before the collision, and half of them had not benefited all his.
Up to 100 accidents
The intervention of aid revancha, requires the maximum brake system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop
According to a study of the EU, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it calculates that an accident on four with casualties would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, thanks to a radar or a camera detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device is the effort on the brakes in order to minimize the damage.
General Motors pushing until January the plan for Opel
While workers at the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably 8 – after Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, means that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may mean that the final document, which will be submitted to workers and the governments of countries where factories, be postponed until early 2010.
By contrast, GM, it ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the next few days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the US manufacturer in order to a decision soon.
GM admits being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of the Dutch-based manufacturer of sports cars Skyper, supported by the Russian group becomes more important.
where there would agree with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab in the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
the wheel of a Porsche Boxster Spyder
In designing their last and valuable jewelry, engineers from Porsche had left the BOXSTER S and have to amincir of nothing less than 80 kilos, which the balance to only 1 275 kilograms.
This has led to happen, first, the automatic roof has been replaced by a bâché roof manual, to reduce 21 kilos, use of aluminum doors as the GT3, another 15 pounds less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the gas tank of 64 54 litres, 7 kilograms of earned, climbing bacquets to sport-governing, still 12 kilograms, and with LDGTs tires, 19 inches, five kilograms.
Finally, they have renounced the CDR-30 audio system, earning six other kilograms and have replaced the poignéesdes door handles in fabrics, saving the kilo remaining.
Although the model also exists with the box with dual clutch, the test was carried on a model with manual of six speeds, mainly on secondary roads in California, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous.
His behaviour cannot be qualified as beyond reproach.
The the weight does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: it was a long time that we had not tested a model as small and light, at the same time, guarantees of security in turns, including at high speed.
It is a small athlete, able to heat its musclesà small speed for as long as necessary, until we ask of sprinter, curb, recover and grow back its engine...
It is out what we wanted. Through his leadership, communicative also said that, the car will do what will indicate our hands on the steering wheel.
And it will do so with a surgical precision.
His engine to
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the BOXSTER S) is particularly successful and can be strengthened with option "sport" or through a system that alters the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The ability to is brutal, to the judgment or during recoveries.
The suspensions are firm but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The of roads we have travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged but the car was well managed potholes.
The electronic assistants were barely act of presence on the journey, while some curves we found ice in the morning and gravel, later in the morning.
Ultimately, a ultralégère car, more fun to drive and is much more than a simple amendment of the BOXSTER S.
The car will be put on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70 831 euros.

Teletovic was already beginning to stand out as the best player of his team, with 13 points, while the "least six" Splitter assessment of suggest that this night would not be the best of the Brazilian.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, and the team of Avala wanted to remind the Vitoria that it does not win so easily on their land, and thanks to the "hand of Elias," they managed to the game
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to yellow take the advantage on the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
players of Ivanovic, wounded but far from dead, needed to take appropriate actions to take the air, and it is at this point that the Teletovic gun Mirza, who, with three baskets to three consecutive points and of English and Ribas gave the meter to score a reassuring (54-67), and that the premises were to increase at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The team of Avala out to play everything on the line in the final period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) avisèrent that they would get their person what they had earned during the first 30 minutes.
Nevertheless, including Pnini Eidson, the best of their team, did not résignèrent and tried to support it in line with the three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for mistakes, players from Ivanovic did not précipitèrent, defended well, and although the Israelis have together at the last minute (80-85), the party was a foregone conclusion and victory was outside Tel Aviv for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented the to fight
The UNICAJA lost loudly in Greece with Olympiacos and has, the top of Group B of the Euroligue, in a match marked by the absence of players in the UNICAJA, especially in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The team of Malaga was not intimidated by the atmosphere of the flag of Peace and Friendship nor by the scale of the rival, probably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a big budget.
The game of the first quarter, helped make the dream Andalusia. An aggressive defense and three baskets on three consecutive points, two of the leader Omar Cook and Guillem Rubio who ébloui the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.

Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president will abandon the diplomatic legation no later than January 27, 2010, the date of the official end of his mandate.
Francisco Catunda, charge d'affaires at the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, has confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he fled since 21 September, before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on 27 January, at the end of his mandate, it must seek another destination."
The chain has also cited the former agent, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the period established: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically, with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the elections of 29 November (during which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would stay in the embassy of Brazil until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed, since Zelaya refused the condition of exiled policy that would impose the de facto government headed by Roberto Micheletti.

After days roses since last spring, during which asset inflation was the dominant note on the markets, uncertainty arises there again, which is not surprising since it to their natural state, in an environment where officers make decisions on a future inherently uncertain.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize the debt by the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by providing ample liquidity rates close to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to
central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets were virtually finalized and without jeopardising their policy of liquidity, begin to put a bit of sand in the wheels, as did the ECB, with their award to a year next week.
Accordingly, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain an economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are seeing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility awards and in the obligations are rising again, although they remain very distant paranormaux levels they have achieved at the beginning of the year.
states were forced to socialize the risk private and public debt is affected.
There is a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany were shelters chosen by investors, an increase of differences between the countries in the euro zone and Germany.
Spain has been barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor threatened a new downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a bit of uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of moral hazard, trying to provoke a matter of conscience among lesresponsables of global economic policy that had hampered the destructive effects of the limiting credit on the destruction of employment, whereas what we should do is impose a new day of Thanksgiving
However, the situation in Dubai resembles a fight between the tribal sheiks to restore its place in power in the emirates and we have already seen in the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government that uncovered the ruse.
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be totally irrational that Ecofin saves Hungary to a breach of its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a member country of the euro area not to meet its commitments.
What makes sense is that the Ecofin has prompted the Greek government transparency and make its citizens for the need of extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its finances.
If, as we hope, we face an episode of normalization of risk premiums transitional, after some excesses in senior positions, it would be predictable.
In the case, as long as our differences in public debt increases to the extent of the obligations of European companies, nousn not to worry.
If the in Europe decreased and that our people continued to increase, it would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
The Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our indicators require most services studies to anticipate their models of recovery and to revise their forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, who returned to the office with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not much hope for their warning.
Again, this has seem to be an excellent opportunity to buy assets in Spain, although for the moment "caution is the mother of safety."
Sectors sectors
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where is discussed these days the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades.
After his speech, which was followed by the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Galán has outlined to what he had mentioned before the subcommittee, to huit-clos.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 000 million euros by 2020 and 60 000 million between that date and 2030, where nuclear plants now in operation would remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments do not amount to 60 000 million but to 95,000.
However, Iberdola believes that for the next decade, investments should not be used to increase production capacity, but distribution networks and interconnections.
From 2020, the question is changing, and it will increase the power.
His gamble focuses too much on power plants to gas, with recovery mechanisms of carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that 18,000 MW are necessary, along with other "energies of support."
Galán, who believes that the draft Law of sustainable economy that the government has approved is in line with what the company, did not wish to attack the royal decree aimed at encouraging the use of coal, which contradicts the policies to combat climate change.
According to him, there was "a clear long-term" in this direction, despite the measures "one-off", as the chairman of Iberdrola.
Anyway, Galán believes that investment decisions, while they are in the long term, should start to be taken, because they take some time before they reach maturity and a permanent remunerative framework is needed to address them.

Acciona dispute his first motorway in Australia to Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona fighting for his first highway concession in Australia, market on which it is already working as a manager of energy and water.
The site is a tunnel estimated at $700 million Australian dollars (about 1 047 million euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A of 5 kilometres long in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, such is the option to allow Acciona to settle in the country as a company of public works and highway concessionaire.
The mayor of the city wants to the in 2014.
After choosing the public-private partnership (PPP for its initials in French) to complete the project, as part of a business plan under the tutelage of Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the submission of bids in May, the planned investment amounted to 1 700 million Australian dollars (about 1 047 million euros) and in the last phase face three consortia, with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the Spanish company in smooth, and his associates are MDBs and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest manufacturers in Australia, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists of underground work.

The Australian market infrastructure promises major shipyards and privatisation, but there is a big challenge, whether it is through acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that followed the Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and that is a milestone not validated for the Spanish giants of the sector.
ACS is just win a place on the market by its 30 percent stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Assets millionaires
Acciona on a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, on which it already has a large presence through its energy supplier and activity in the area of desalination.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, the Waubra (192-kilometer MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for building and managing the dessalinisateur Adelaide, with a budget of $700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter markets in the construction and management of infrastructure.
The underground route, promoted by the Office of the infrastructure of the city of Brisbane and the Northern Link (north), is expected to link highway in the Toowong western peripheral route to Kelvin Grove (see map) by 4 miles of tunnel. It is the largest existing project to reduce congestion in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the administration said that the auction will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work would begin in December next year.
Despite the fact that this toll road will be open to traffic late 2014, it is not anticipated that the site is completed before 2016.
The tunnel has to be conceived in 2005.
It will include two two tracks, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane already provides work for Hochtief
Australia continues to be widely largely Hochtief, which yesterday obtaining a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the national network infrastructure fiber-optic broadband.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people have high-speed Internet access and will work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company transferred the construction of the King George Tower, 27 floors, in the city of Brisbane. Work has not yet started and Hochtief concluded the sale to 129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.

A fine of to France Telecom to curb competition
The French competition regulator fined million euros for France Telecom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region in the country.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition in the fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and loyalty programs to consumers on the sidelines of the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and even state enterprise, accumulating more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it makes its competitors.
The sanction imposed yesterday has been increased because the authority which oversees competition considers that France Telecom has committed similar offences in the past and it is therefore offender.
A shop applications
On the other hand, the mobile phone subsidiary of the French company has followed in the wake of other operators and opened a shop Internet applications, with the aim of which do not come from the transmission of voice.

Their participation in the Champions League reported 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barca since its creation
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs, since its birth in 1992.
Indeed, Real Madrid and FC Barcelona earned 467,4 million, which puts them in third and fifth position of clubs who have pocketed the most money in this competition.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League does not only fame. It is also one of the main sources of income for big clubs.
Indeed, the competition has allocated 5 362,5 million euros to 105 teams (including 12) who participated in the event since the inception of the tournament, during the 1992-93 season, according to information from UEFA.
The Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have been well served during this distribution.
The club was the third of the continent to receive the most money for his participation, and the only one with the A.C. Milan, has won three times the trophy.
The Catalan club, taking the title and last winner of the old European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
Top of the list are the Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams, in addition, have the more money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, although they have lost to Barca.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, as regards the money generated by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England and Germany two).
distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure of allocation of money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the body chaired by Michel Platini expects to earn 1,090 million from the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will spend 413,1 million in payments fixed: each of the 20 clubs who participated in the classification matches (including the Atlético Madrid) received.
In, those who were able to participate received 3.8 million just to be there, in addition to 550 00 euros for each match.
There is also a bonus in the event of victory (800,000 euros) and equality (400 000 for each team). Those who arrive in quarter finals receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in the reçoivent3,3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will win $9 million, to 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, of fixed payments, a club will win at least 7.1 million, and the maximum 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the has pocketed $2.5 million for winning the Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are the variables payments, which are allocated 337,8 million.
This money is distributed according to the value of each market.
The Spanish market is one of the most, and has four seats.
