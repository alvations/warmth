The republican strategy of the resistance to the repeated election Obamy
The republicans' leaders justified their policy with the necessity of the fight against the falsifications on elections.
However they consider the last one myth in the Center Brennana asserting that the cases of the falsifications are rarer than cases are deaths from the lightning stroke on the elections in the United States.
Moreover the republicans' jurists had only 300 cases of the electoral falsifications in the United States in ten years.
One can say one with confidence: these new tendencies will exert the negative influence upon the voters' appearance.
In this sense the similar actions partially discredit the system of the American democracy.
In contrast to Canada the American staff are bearing the responsibility for the organization of the federal elections to the USA.
Namely therefore the majorities of the governments of the staff are taking on laws, registrations which complicate a process or votes since 2009.
This phenomenon received the new amplitude after the elections in November 2010, which brought the republicans 675 new places in 26 staff.
In result only in one 2011 was taken 180 bills that limit right to vote to 41 staff.
The new laws on elections are requiring of the voter to show the identity card with the photograph and proof of the presence of the American nationality.
Moreover, these laws reduce the period of the early vote, the voter's registrations are abolishing a right on a day of will and they are taking right to vote from the citizens who have prior conviction.
Up to the elections of 2006 voters were being obliged to show the identity card with the photograph by not a single American staff.
Indiana became the first staff which brought the similar demand.
The Supreme Court of the USA confirmed the constitutionality of the law accepted in Indiana in 2008.
The republican authorities rushed to extend this practice also to some other staff.
For the two last years they have initiated the bills which are obliged voters to show the identity cards with the photograph, in 34 staff.
It is important to note that in contrast to Quebec the American citizens do not have such a universal identity card as the card of the health insurance.
Indeed, 11% of the American citizens, that is to say 21 million people a million attained the age that is necessary for vote do not have the identity card with the photograph, issued by the governmental organ their staff.
Moreover, five million new voters do not have a similar document in 2012.
At the same time a cost of the receipt of the identity card to be demanded often exceeds a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect the young people, the minorities and the people with low level of income.
Indeed, less than 35 000 dollars earning 25% of the Afro-Americans, 15% of the people, 18% of the citizens do not have in a older way than 65 years and 20% of the voters from 18 to 29 years the identity card with the photograph being demanded.
But these are not yet all of them.
The students - voter who are voting for the candidates from the democrats as that is taking into consideration in a few staff are not let use the identity card with the photograph issued by their educational establishment.
But the same staff are resolving ones delivered by these clubs for the members of the fishing and hunting clubs who are voting in the main thing behind the republicans to use certificates for the vote.
Until 2004 not a single staff demanded proof of the presence of the American nationality for vote.
The similar demand was brought in Arizona for the first time.
Starting in 2011 more than ten staff accepted the laws which are requiring of the voters to prove that they are the citizens of the USA.
These measures are aimed, evidently, at limiting the emigrants' vote from Latin America.
It is considered that two thirds of the Latin-American voters vote for the benefit of the Democratic party.
Moreover, the republican legislators initiated in 2011 the laws which abolish the voters' registration on a day of the vote in eight staff.
They also limited the right of the individuals or groups to provide the aid to those who want to register.
This restriction was not going on without consequences.
So, for example, during the elections of 2004 the campaign for the voters' registration helped to bring in about 10 million citizens into the lists.
At the same time the measures taken starting in 2009 led the new voters to the fall by 17% of the level of the registration in 2010 in comparison with 2006.
The republican legislators in addition accepted in five other staff the laws aimed at the reduction of the period of the early vote.
So, during the common elections of 2008 in Florida 33% of the voters voted ahead of schedule were Afro-Americans although the last ones were only 13% from the common number of the voters of the staff.
The the same came from Latin America also with the emigrants.
Introducing only 11% of the voters, they were 24% of the citizens who voted ahead of schedule.
In contrast to the white ones which were only 46% forming 76% of the voters among the voters ahead of schedule.
Of course the legislators democrat and their supporters actively appear against the passage of the laws that limit the voters' registration.
The democrat-governors vetirovano a few law drafts.
The action of the most ambiguous laws was stopped on the intrusion of the General Public Prosecutor of the United States.
This allowed partially limiting the negative consequences.
So, for example, only 16 of 34 staff accepted the laws which are requiring the presentation of the identity card with the photograph.
Nevertheless, the new rules which came into the action undoubtedly, will make the carrying out of the voting right difficult on the elections of 2012.
The critics from the democrats are condemning the evident direction seeing the prejudice of the laws which were accepted in it on that, in order to influence the election results of 2012 in key staff.
The report of the center Brennana from 2011 shows that the staff which accepted these laws are presenting 171 of 270 necessary voices in vyborqikov board in order to win the presidential elections.
It is too early to assert with confidence that these legislative changes will have the essential influence on the results of the presidential elections of 2012 at the level of the electoral system.
Only one is indubitable: these new positions will exert the negative influence upon the voters' appearance.
In this sense the similar actions partially discredit the system of the American democracy.
Skrining of the cancer of the prostate: to pass a test or not?
As a matter of fact, the test for THE DOG gives sometimes the mistaken, lie-negative, and sometimes also lie-positive, results which lead to the useless medical intrusion.
The men anyhow that are unwillingly going the clinical observation to eat from what to begin to doubt even more.
To pass a test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two specialists.
In the researches conducted in the United States numerous cases of contamination were observed among the groups of those being investigated, to interpret therefore received given in a difficult way and to draw up some precise recommendations in a difficult way.
This time, another research, is a European one, discovered a different death rate with those patients who went skrining, and those who did not study it.
This research also showed, after the 12-year-old observation, that the probability of appearance is a metastasis 30-40% higher with those who did not go skrining.
Therefore, I would recommend to pass the test starting in 50 years, or with 40 if one of the direct relatives had the cancer of the prostate gland.
The men of the afroamerikanskogo origin are also prone to the increased risk.
A taking of the right decision is key moment as soon as the crawfish is discovered.
Cancer can be both aggressive and be flabby-current.
The patient should clarify the degree of the risk of his cancer offering him possible versions, without obligatory treatment of the cancer of the prostate gland which has not been presenting danger in the long term, and making the choice, in these cases, for the benefit of the active observation of the disease.
Currently, many men with whom the crawfish is discovered will not attend the course of treatment since their crawfish is not aggressive and is not presenting threat for life.
We will offer them an active observation, and if the disease will begin to progress, we will begin the treatment.
We with precision determine the criteria for the decision making more and more about that who owes or does not have to attend the course of treatment.
In this way, I would recommend all the same to pass the test.
But it is also necessary if to consult importantly with its doctor in order to determine or not to pass this test.
In the cooperation with the International association of the urology, Movember an instrument that allows appraising all the pros and cons of the passage of dough to THE DOG created.

You have to avert an illness
Unfortunately, wonder does not exist-the prescription in order to avert a crawfish.
Despite the progress of the researches, the observance of the healthy way of life remains the better way to reduce the risk of disease.
He is taking into consideration, what if all lived the people healthy and they moved sufficiently, one would be able to avert 30% of the cases of rako.
"If no one smoked any more, this number would have reached at the minimum 50%", is emphasizing Andrew Bolje, the press spokesman of the Canadian association of crawfish.
However, 10% of cases of crawfish are called by some evaluations, by the heredity.
A few types of crawfish remain absolutely inexplicable.
For the Canadian association of crawfish the fight against smoking remains priority, despite the decrease of the quantity of the smokers.
Smoking is connected to 85% of the cases of the lung cancer.
Also it is the factor of the risk for many other ones.
It is causing the colossal harm to the people's health.
"Even today Quebec contains" 1.5 million "smokers", is saying press spokesman Andrew Bolje.
The assuring fact: 10 years after the refusal of smoking the risk to die of a crawfish is diminishing half.
Weight
According to data THE CIRQUE, the excess weight and the adiposity are also contributing to the appearance of disease.
They are increasing the risk of the beginnings of the cancer of the mamma, the thick and direct gut, the esophagus, the pancreas and the uterus.
They are adding "The researches show that the regular physical activity has protected from the cancer of the thick gut for the whole life" in Association.
Nourishment
The association is also recommending to limit the consumption of the red meat.
It is improving the risks of the beginnings of the cancer of the thick intestines in the oversize numbers.
One should also avoid the sausage products.
The conservation of the meat with a way can lead kopcheniya, the drying or salting, to the formation of the carcinogenic substances.
They are explaining, "the last ones can cause the harm to the cells of the organism and lead to the development of crawfish", in Association.
Vitamins
In the last years many scientists dealt with the research of the influence of the vitamin additions on the development of crawfish.
But at the present time it is impossible to name the results of these researches unambiguous.
An opinion apiece of SCC, the research of vitamin E gives contradictory results.
If one of them showed the reduction of the risk of the development of the cancer of the prostate gland, other things gave the opposite result.
In the evaluation of the influence on the development of the crawfish of D vitamin there is also no complete clarity.
However Mr Bolje is emphasizing, that their alarms and the family anamnesis are important to discuss with the doctor.
"The change of analysis does not lead to a crawfish".
The boson Xiggsa in components
The last summer the message about what the scientists managed to discover the boson Xiggsa, possibly, called the real agiotage - also not without bases.
It is considered that this boson is explaining the mass of all the particles in the Universe, neither a lot nor few.
Moreover, this the last particle the existence of which was predicted within the framework of Standard model is not ours better, or, at any rate, the "least imperfect" description of nature and the behavior of matter, is but which earlier managed to discover by way of experiment.
But physics is not convinced yet until the end that the talk is namely about the boson Xiggsa.
We know, without shade of the doubt that we are dealing with the really new particle and that she is strongly reminiscent of the boson Xiggsa predicted Standard model.
Moreover, the new ones given, presented are confirming this, apparently, although for the complete confidence some data are not had enough yet this week on one big physical congress in Kyoto.
Nevertheless we will present that the talk is about the boson Xiggsa because the chances to be mistaken seem minimum, and we will watch chto zhe this means.
Has, in this peace one law is an absolutely inevitable saying that two things can not lie in the same place in the same time.
There is no possibility it to avoid this rule, do even not try too zealously, otherwise will harm himself.
But although the elementary particle physics is quite strange peace, it is turning out that there is one law of the similar character in it also: the principle of the exception Pauli which postulates that two particles are not able to take up the same space at the same instant if they are in "the same quantum state" - this "state" consists is in some common ways, in some their characteristics.
Based on this, physics they are dividing particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find the respectable citizens being called fermions who are sensibly yielding to principle Pauli.
INTO the friend after all bustle about the bosons, the vile gang of the anarchists who do not have the respect for anything - at least to this principle what it means, that they can lie calmly in the same place in the same time.
As the site is announcing (by the way absolutely extraordinary) Particle Adventure of Laboratory Berkli, these bosons are divided, for their part, into two groups: the mesons, about which we will not be here to speak, also "the particles" of the power by means of which the main forces of nature are spreading and to which in some kind the boson Xiggsa belongs.
These very bosons, one should emphasize, not all the such exotic essences, as one would be able to think.
As a matter of fact if you are managing to read this chronicle this is thanks to one incredibly banal boson: to the photon, or "to the particle of the light which is a "courier" of the electromagnetic power.
Indeed when one particle which has an electric charge is quickening or is changing a direction this "is disturbing" the electromagnetic field in this concrete place, approximately like stone thrown into the pond.
From this "violation" the electromagnetic wave is born is (the light, or the infrared emanation, or the ultraviolet, etc.), also this wave is not what other as the photon and, therefore, one of the bosons of "the transmitters of the power".
More stable field
The the same is occurring also with the boson Xiggsa from that only the difference that in order that this boson appeared another field, the field Xiggsa "should be disturbed".
However the field Xiggsa is much, much more stable than electromagnetic field; in order to upset it, it is necessary to attain the high energies very and very, how if speech went about the pond which froze the surface of which only very big stone could have shaken.
This is the reason a huge accelerator of the particles is necessary as that which is being operated in CERNe is - Big Adronnyij Kollaijder being a ring with the diameter of 27 km! - for the achievement of such huge energies.
The analogy to electromagnetic field is useful as well for the explanation of the relation between the boson Xiggsa and mass.
As a matter of fact, not all the particles and all the materials do not interact with an electromagnetic field.
Some as for example the magnets, they are interacting, other after all is not no: for example, the refrigerator will never be held itself up by the sheet of paper.
Just as, not all the particles are interacting with a field Xiggsa: those which interact have mass while ones other (as the photon, by the way) do not have it.
Thus, is Mrs Plamondon asking chto zhe these researches "can bring" everything?
In science they are being employed for the validation of the Standard Model (SM), allows also this also to feel the divergence among the results of the observations and forecasts the physicists WATCH.
Moreover some of them are passionately thirsting so that such a divergence would appear, because the least disparity can open a door for "new physics" and stop up some holes of the Model.
Last, it is necessary to say, it has still had essential shortages without offering any explanation for gravity (oij!) or for dark matter which approximately 80% of the Universe (oij-oij!) forms.
But they have not found such divergences in CERNe yet.
Consequences
To predict the benefit from these researches for everyday life of the middle-statistical person is more difficult, but would be mistake to suppose that there is it.
Look: at the very beginning of the sixties the pioneers of the researches of the laser would be able to suppose even in Bell's laboratories what revolution their work will cause.
They anticipated their supplements in science, but at most that.
Indeed, already late physicist Uillard Boijl who worked in Bell's Laboratories is a laser where was invented in 1960, and which worked out himself the first continuous laser (the previous ones were pulsed) in 1962, I/you/he said that initially the laser was rather being considered as "laboratory gadzhet".
Present...
Also moreover, the supplement can turn up for the equipment which accompanies a research.
For example, the same Uilliard Boijl worked the small sensor of the light out during his optical researches in 1969.
This sensor is serving "as an eye" although this was his initial assignment not at all for all the numerical cameras of the peace now and deserved prize Nobelevskuyu on physics of 2009.
Of course, this does not mean, that the work will change Big Adronnogo Kollaijdera certainly our life, but, as a matter of fact, this shows that everything can be only.
The palliative help is the better way to die... | "debt"
In Commission for the worthy death in Quebec the tactful issue of the end of life was being discussed recently.
The debates soon have to vozobnovitjsya, and at that time the bill is in the making.
That less in this most important field a great deal still does not lie ahead to do.
"Debt" tried to look more close by.
A few weeks in total ago Mr L lived. Else one in his apartment with Monterezhi.
Rak of prostate gland destroying it from within granted him grace for two years.
"Five years have given to me, I lived for seven", he is saying, among life and death, lying in the bed in the asylum of the palliative departure of Viktor-Gadbua v Beleij, where I/you/he arrived the day before.
"But he" is saying "this is a shock always, to this it is impossible to prepare", it.
Illness does its work: the improbable weakness which does not let independently go into the toilet and even be independently fed.
Working at the table on which an appetizing lunch costs he is giving up itself and is agreeing that they helped it to take the food.
It is being stimulated, is even managing to smile, to talk to the unfamiliar people who are working around it, are bringing him medicines, are leading it into the bath.
Courage is in front of the normal death.
My greatest desire for they to cure me of diarrhea, this wish humiliating" , - he is confessing.
A few hours later the personnel found medicine for this disease.
"For life" they "have been teaching to us:, that the man has to mochitjsya while being", Pierre Broder is saying, the psychologist is in the asylum Viktora-Gadbua.
Regress before the child's state unbearable humiliation is for several things.
"Everything depends from the person's proficiency" to come to terms with a decline, he is reconfirming.
Because, according to many people that are dealing with the palliative departure significant events sluchayayutsya also into the very height of this decline.
The patients who are entering the palliative asylum Viktor-Gadbua are always sick with crawfish.
They allot them the forecasts at most three months of life.
On this stage, the team of the doctors and the nurses is not granting more the aid, to the "medical" one being called.
Mrs A., 89 years, most of all has been afraid to die "in consciousness of the asthma".
But but the illness allowed me to recognize my children.
"I have good children", she is adding.
"I do not want anything more in life", she is saying before to allow putting the mask which eases breathing for her.
It has been waiting for the last visit of her son who came from Italy as before within the next few days.
They are granting personal hygiene and help on the nourishment in the asylum Viktor-Gadbua with the help of a group of the volunteers.
This is also a palliative departure which is left behind when is not impossible more nothing to do.
In order you have to make death more comfortable.
In Quebec on each 11 700 inhabitants fall one place in the institutions of the palliative help.
This is little really, taking into consideration, that sooner or later all of us will die.
Here life is going on under better conditions, doctor Kristian Martelj - one of the doctors of the asylum is explaining what are possible.
Whether comfort is physical, emotional or mental.
Dying we will agree we to grant the oral rinsings of brandy or you pepsi depending that he will ask for.
We are not forcing the diabetics to check the level of sugar any more.
Also the death is the part of povsednevnosti.
Yesterday evening we brought Mr X the beers., which died tonight.
In the morning his son drank up this beer in the deceased's feet.
"We help the kins, in the same way as also the patients": Natali Savar, the director on nursing for the sick, is saying.
In the asylum Viktor-Gadbua not a single day looks like the previous one.
After next to the 93-year-old old man who is enjoying his last meeting with family in the yard settling on his cushions during toast in his honor, the young man of 36 years surrounded by the parents, the wife and two small children of also pereprobovawiij always so that to survive is tragically dying.
"Into the last half-year from three to five beds, up to 45 years have always been employed by the cancerous patients at the age", is Dr Kristian Martelj is worriedly speaking.
53% of the patients who are received into the asylum Viktor-Gadbua are arriving from the house, and 47% of the hospital.
The problem of the access to the palliative departure
It is considered that 77% of the Canadians do not have the access to the palliative departure, that is to say to the departure which is being granted so that to ease the sufferings of the patients that included into the final stage of their life simply whether at home, in the hospital or in the asylum.
Both some institutions such as the asylum Viktor-Gadbua and the Society of the palliative departure are on the house of Big Montreal, are specializing more or less exceptionally in care of the cancerous patients.
Namely this big gap in the health services of Quebec forces many medical specialists on the palliative departure to be afraid the passage of the law legalizing euthanasia and help in the suicide.
Starting in October a manifesto signed by the luminaries in the field of the palliative departure, doctor Balfurom Mauntom and Dr Bernarom Lyapuantom and testifying to their disagreement with similar initiative circulates.
According to the doctor Kristian Martelj, the health services of Quebec are insufficiently effective to provide the right to palliative departure of quality before will be allowed the transition to the euthanasia.
Recently, - she is speaking, - I saw the patient who has spent 14 days in the department of the ambulance, in terrible pains, and took necessary measures so that to ease them.
I am afraid that the patients want only to die because they are not receiving the adequate departure.
At the same time, many oncologists are trying to save the patients, despite pessimistic forecasts, up to the last day.
The hopes of the survival Ehlen Richard have already been minimum when it stopped the chemotherapy wearing out.
After I had informed my oncologist, she answered me that I am stopping a treatment, which is sorry that I am stopping the fight: she is saying.
At the same time she said to me that my days are counted herself!
The all-powerful departure is not here
Dr Martelj thinks that 90% of the patients who are asking for death thank medical personnel behind that that they did not fulfill their request, after the team is easing their pain on the palliative departure.
However it is necessary to note that the palliative departure is not absolutely all-powerful in the fight against pain.
In words Ehlsi is Monro, directors on the palliative departure in the Society of the palliative departure at home of Big Montreal, the patients are not susceptible to an anesthetization of 8% of cases.
At the very end of life doctors resort often to palliative sedacii on which the patient is sleeping until the moment of his death, or from time to time or constantly.
Impossibly more pretend, which we do not know about these sufferings.
The patients to whom pain being eased is not possible will be able to have the access to palliative sedacii more and more.
Patients who are suffering from pain have always said the same phrase: "I want to die".
But certainly this does not mean "I want them to organize me euthanasia" this means "I want to become me it easier".
The creation of this report became possible thanks to journalistic grant from the Institute of the researches of the health of Canada.
Large-scale scandals with the real estate in Quebec
The officials, responsible for the construction of the roads, the building contractors, the installers of the resources of the political parties and the specialists in Italian mafia a day behind a day are telling what they know about the colossal "system" which entangles a building industry, civil servants, the politicians, the union officials and mafiozi.
The "industry" which turned out for the taxpayers of Quebec very expensively, in especially 1990 and 2000.
It "is curious as this system is being strewed after the resources were put to matter all, Jacques Dyuweno is playing around, the deputy and the former boss of the police of Montreal".
Namely thanks to it in 2011 the scandal like the secondary result of the investigation into the official crimes connected to the road construction contracts in Quebec on which the prime minister of that time from the liberals is burst out, Jean the Ball, I/you/he agreed very unwillingly.
"The report Dyuweno" established direct coupling among industry, the secret financing of the political parties and corruption.
"Since a beginning investigations have been in 2010, he is emphasizing, one only Ministry of Transport kept a billion dollars on the contracts", if several things held back their instincts to take the share.
The commission Warbonno "has already displaced two mayors", he is adding "the costing ones behind the separate personalities" hoping to "dissect" what will be a success for her "the schemes".
The constant subdivision in the fight against corruption created in 2011
The Constant subdivision created in 2011 in the fight against corruption the ranks of whose a vast staff of the governmental accountants, the investigators and the analysts joined was joined to a matter.
AND, moreover, the co-workers of special subdivision "Hammer" who forced "the waste syndicate" of Montreal after 2009 to stop the superelevation of the cost of the contracts.
During the last weeks the series of searches was made, and the accusations of swindle and corruption were made to some municipal officials, in particular Frank Zampino and Richard Markottu - mayor of small small town.
Zhilj Vaijyankur is on a line, recently the going one is Quebec into retirement from the post of the mayor of Lavalya, the third town according to the size the provinces.
They are suspecting it of the repeated receipt of the bribes on the allocation of the state orders.
Moreover, the official accusation was made to a few engineers of the service of the traffic routes of Montreal and building contractors of the Italian origin, including Tony Akkurso i Lino Zambito.
The last one blew up the real bomb after telling to the consequence about the "system" of the receipt of the state contracts.
For a few years Zambito has given 3% from the cost of the contracts concluded in Montreal certain mediator connected to a mafia who, for its part, "United Montreal" took the money of the party of the mayor Zheraljda Tramble.
In 2000 Zambito soril to the money to the right and to the left. He transferred more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euros) to the different province parties, mainly the liberals that were at an authority at that time.
Moreover, he confessed that I/you/he unlawfully gathered the remedies for the prime minister's former deputy for the Liberal party Natali Normando.
The sewer contracts in which set too high the cost
The "system" of corruption worked in Montreal faultlessly.
Zhilj Syurprenan, the former engineer for civil construction, described it in detail in front of commission: all in all in ten years he has received from the building firms of gifts, invitations on the trips, on the tournaments on golf, to the restaurants, on matches on hockey and the bribes of 736 000 dollars in exchange for the sewer contracts the value of which he set too high.
Other officials, responsible for the construction of the roads, they confessed, that received on the paw, setting too high the bills by 30-40% with the help of false complements.
Then one organizer is from the party of the mayor, Martan Dyumon, accused Mr Tramble of he intentionally shutting his eyes to the existence of parallel budget which filled party funds with dirty money.
After these revelations Mr Tramble went into retirement after dipping Montreal into a deep crisis at the beginning of November.
Wantalj Rulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal driving alarm.
The mayor Rivjer-de-Prehri the neighborhood in the east of the island, it is withstanding the sale of municipal area, za bought for 5 million dollars and resold since 2010... 1.6 million the building contractors into the height of the building boom.
70% of dirty money in the election campaigns
She says that in the investigation which will ultimately be begun it will "pull behind the thread allowing understanding the functioning of the system, crawling with the ants in order to stop the gangrene and to determine the culprits".
It xarakterezuet this process how "unhealthy, but positive".
We are in the course of the cleaning of the wound, but its own investigatory group will be necessary for Montreal and the observer, in order to avoid the return questionable the practical person.
How are we tidying up at home.
Regularly.
Jacques Dyuweno is noting from its side, that "the officials stole away hundreds of millions of the dollars", but the role of "the elective officials that knew about this scheme", but not participating in artifices worries especially it.
Taking into consideration, that the share of dirty money in the financing of the election campaign in Quebec reaches 70%, he is playing around: "They told me that this was an only pale reflection of reality".
The government of Quebec is offering for the parties to limit up to 100 dollar of the donation, but, according to his statement, this will not change the situation: There will be dirty money in a policy, while we will not be limiting the elective expenses strictly.
He is demanding the complete reconstruction of the system of the granting of the state contracts and the financing of the parties: "We can not fall more low; it is courageous after it inquiring into the essence of the things, we will be able to build the house on a firmer foundation, with the better control and legitimacy".
If this history also gives up the shade on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr Dyuweno is calling upon those who are laughing to look into his own yard...
"PSZh is not Barcelona FK"!
In this season you achieved the extraordinary amplitude in PSZh.
How will you explain this growth?
This can be explained by the individual consciousness, but can - also new measurement PSZh.
Great players arrived.
Next to them I grow up every day.
The technical personnel also privnes many things.
These factors force me to raise the level of my game daily.
Also during match this is simpler.
In soccer everything is going on very fast.
But I am not being sparked.
From the outset in the center of the preliminary preparation in NIF in Klerfontene also before my receipts in Sent-Ehtjen I always took a step ahead.
In this way, you are deriving the use from the competition established by Karlo Anchelotti...
The replenishment of this summer will not be able to play novelty matches very high urovnya.
They also know that every training is really important.
This leads to such a player thirsting for being at the level and giving his best on maximum as I.
Moreover, Karlo Anchelotti is showing the support in my positioning.
Such deputies as Klod Makelele who was playing in the same position help it what and I.
Is Anchelotti the proprietor of the position?
Of course.
Anchelotti inspires respect in the whole technical personnel.
Today into the First League for it no the equals and it is ranking among the best trainers of Europe.
The vast experience, and it won quite a lot of titles with the clubs of high classes from it.
It worked with the great players.
I think, it will bring the new titles to Paris.
In January an assuring talk was had it and I.
At that time I left from the whole series of traumas.
The trust which it is trusting me is also explaining my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the season PSZh?
In the First League Lyons took the place of the leader away from us.
But we as before readily.
The Champions' League is one of our main purposes: we spectacularly qualified into one eighth the final.
What is the goal of the club in this tournament?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on everything can be.
We will be able to say our word face to face with very good European teams.
We want at first to finish with the first in our group, in front of Porto in order to have the opportunity to take on the reciprocal match of final in one eighth.
Will PSZh become will be able a first-class European club in short-term perspective?
It for this has already had a budget...
In order to become a big European club, Paris needs to win the titles and to secure the positions on long-term perspective.
Today this is not so.
Finansovo u PSZh is resources in order to make this project real.
Will not to take the title in the First League as in the past season be big collapse?
Of course, this would be big disappointment.
In this year we heatedly want the real one to secure this champion's title.
In the past season we were close to this.
In May, disappointment was because we had everything, in order to come to the finish the first.
This was very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, the champion's rank presupposes 79 points.
But another team, Monpelje, played even more fantastic season.
In this year, I think, everything will be OK.
In spite of the fact that such strong teams as Marseille, Lyons and Bordeaux entered the struggle for title, I think that we have forces so that to win.
You do not think, that the mass media are waiting too a great deal from PSZh?
This is normal, which they expect from us much, taking into consideration, how many were put and what we have players.
We are completely ready to this.
On the other hand, when we are winning 4-0 against Trua at home and nevertheless find us, of course, for what we should castigate this some upsets.
We are setting ourselves a question, what after all first of all wait from us the people.
He will never be able to win every exit with account 4-0.
We not Barcelona FK!
We are trying to introduce the project of the game.
The team has been developing with time.
We proved in the Champions' League that we can answer some modern calls.
Look at Manchester Yunaijted, who has not managed to go into one eighth already two seasons the final, although they also spent the huge money!
Taking into consideration the put amounts, we recommended you for 15 points already to a winter break ahead.
This would be neglect to our opponents and to the championship of France.
Lyons and Marseille which were not at a height in the past season, "were woken" by this new PSZh.
This shows how much the First League is fascinating.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and to tell ourselves that as a result, despite all the difficulties, we won.
Apparently, PSZh completely depends on some feats Zlatana Ibragimovicha.
Of course and what, if they say that certain "Zlatanozavisimostj" exists.
This only means that it is Ibragimovich really successful and that it drives it many goals.
It came for this and it proves that it is the star of First League.
Everywhere where it was playing it showed that it is a great player and the star of world scale.
In a group we respect it as the person and as the player.
It also respects the people who are surrounding it.
What it made this is really exclusive.
This stimulates also the other ones to improve its game.
Tjyago Silva who is one of the best advocates in the peace it is also motivating everyone to move ahead.
How did you survive Evro-2012 from national team of France?
Like disappointment.
I heatedly wished to take in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my trauma prevented me from snatching a little play time.
I saw many things there, and I left from there more strongly.
Today I am managing to play good elimination matches.
This is that what I relied on from the moment of my baptism near the blue ones.
We learned the lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and must behave in a model way now.
What do you think about the first months of Didje Dewama at the head of the blue ones?
They are effective for it.
He has good positions in elimination group to the world championship.
It is a severe trainer, it is close to the players and it is inspiring to victory.
What was Loran Blan.
But I would not want to compare.
Blan attained his goal, it qualified us in the Euro.
I hope that Didje Dewam will bring the blue ones into Brasilia.
Is deserved good one nobody's (1-1) torn in Spain on 16th October the fundamental match?
This match gave us faith into himself.
Each fought for all.
Before this shock there were in Spain, in my career no similar matches.
You have to pay and you have to sell without help of the banks - with Bitcoin
The complete contrast the current financial exchange based on centrobankax, the numbered transactions between the receiving sides with c agent fees on their processing.
Moreover, as that often happens to these technologies, a political sight is evident: the conviction that the present exchange system which consists of bank monopolies is leading by some financial crises.
As a matter of fact, Bitcoin invented by Satowi Nakamoto (pseudonym) is a virtual currency (but being converted of dollars, euro...) simultaneously also protected by the minutes of the exchange according to type of BitTorrent who is allowing carrying out the exchange of the files among the participants of one level.
About 200 000 operations had already been registered at a net with 15 000 computers.
A few thousand sites take bitkoijny for the carrying out of the donations or as means of payment.
Course bitkoijna, after reaching the maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, I/you/he fell down up to 2 dollars five months later before to return to approximately ten dollars (the courses are indicated on the site bitcoincharts.com) today.
Nothing of the particular one in the comparison to the world exchange of the real money or the financial products.
Nevertheless, the European central bank (ECB) was interested in this system in its report published in October about the virtual currency.
He is describing bitkoijn as "the most "successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or a euro" and "similar to the normal currencies".
Bitkoin is different from the other types of the virtual currencies as "credits" are used for the advancement in video game which zarabatyvayutsya in the course of game or which possible buy (but sometimes also to exchange).
The social net Facebook also developed the similar system.
But he has always checked the operations of exchange and some central organ is working.
In Bitkoijn all the network nodes are simultaneous the holders of the account book, the accountants, the emitters of the currency, also the pokupatelymi sellers.
How does this net function?
Every transaction is going on, like the e-mail, among two users as a matter of fact among two mailing addresses.
Only for every new payment the user can choose another address providing in this way anonymity.
The typesetting of the information which belongs to this transaction is being signed electronically, with the use of the system of the encoding with double key.
The net can also check the authenticity of transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is possible to check what bitkoijny, used for a transaction, they really exist in the public accounting book distributed according to all the net.
A registration of the new transaction is key stage in this book.
It is fitting through the solution to the mathematical task distributed to the computers deciding which like the temporary central bank, receives privilege to add this new line.
The talk is about the phase of the randomization of the file, that is the transformation of the big file into digital signature, the short and unique signature.
The computers "are taking" a new transaction and are adding for it the number, before "to xehwirovatj" all.
The goal is in finding a number which will give the unique numerical signature (many zeros at beginning).
As soon as this number is found, they are checking other knots easily, that it is right.
Transaction in this way turns out nerarzryvno be connected to the chain of all the other transactions; just any modification will change the numerical signature.
If with the aim of deceit the user very fast is (less what in ten minutes) I/you/he would have wanted to pay two times one also topic after all the money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the net but another would remain unconfirmed because they have different electronic signatures.
The computer which solved the problem is receiving 50 bitkoijnov.
In order to avoid the inflation, the reward is regularly divided in half, probably, until the end of 2012.
Therefore the number of bitkoijnov is limited to a circulation by 21 million, but they are divisible until one hundred-millionth one, which has still been leaving the reserve...
The complexity of the task also rises with the increase of the computing power.
Life of the net has already survived the take-offs and the falls.
The sites that provide the services to Bitcoin were exposed to the attack, also bitkoijny were stolen away from reserves.
"The used defect is not touching himself on minutes", - Pierre Nuaza who recently threw Paymium is certifying - company carrying out payments by the real money with the use of the net Bitcoin.
ECB announced also the possibility of the money laundering across this this anonymous service.
But the cash also possesses this shortage.
The big players such as Wikipedia, they are refusing to take donations like that.
Other after all such as blog platform WordPress, they are resolving them.
Recently Adi Wamir and Dorit Ron from the Institute Veijcmana are in Israel, they analyzed the accounting book and they discovered that there are not almost 80% of bitkoijnov in the turnover.
"Gigantic the sale" were declared in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars are obmeneny", Ijon Xolmkvist working in Coinabul which is dealing with the conversion of bitkoijnov into gold is happy.
Pierre Nuaza, another author of the aid for this currency, believes in the potential of this technology as operating net hard.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of credit card (in the real money) or non-contact payment across the car telephone, but she is using Bitcoin for transaction check, which in this way is coming out more cheaply.
The owner is better checking his personal data and in this way can be anonymous.
The system is simple in the realization for the businessmen who do not need to install the new devices or the software.
It can photograph, it is enough to announce the address only, which and to recognize with the telephone, Pierre Nuaza is specifying certifying that it has already had thousands of users.
A common tendency towards the revision of the hierarchical systems exists for the benefit of the more horizontal ones.
"Before Bitcoin will be asserted, some time will pass, but 2013 become can turning moment", he is predicting.
ECB in his report is intending, by the way, to review the diverse risks which are considered increased today, in the event of the success of this system.
We left Afghanistan.
What is further?
The French troops abandoned their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa i Surobi).
The NATO and the Americans have to follow them at the end of 2014.
For the Afghan army the time to return himself control of its territory, and for the Afghans to choose future its one without relying only on us came.
Mainly Afghan peasants who we were considering as a terrorist suffered from us.
Also we ourselves, with 88 killed by the soldiers, and the injured persons and crippled.
The Taliban consist of the foreign extremists, the former commanders that are hiding in Pakistan but also often of the peasants who are turning down the presence of the foreign army as this was attached to the USSR.
They want to defend their, old and archaic traditions, dzhixadisty, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks will let even them join.
They are standing them, local rebels help them sometimes, but they will not be any more as soon as the West will become to behave more tactfully.
The departure of the French troops from the base Nidzhrab, which I watched from the height of the hills planted by the almond trees thanks to French credits, I/you/he went in order.
The escorts of the trucks and the armor plating technology in the accompaniment of the helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
Since the end of 2014 there will be no invasion of the Taliban on Kabul.
Circumstances have changed from 1994 to 1996 since the times of their insurmountable advancement for a year.
At that time Kabul was empty, the country was between some different groupings in the fire and blood due to the fight.
The taking by them under the control of the country was being perceived as svoego roda liberation, return to security at that time.
The Afghan women paid for these peasants' mrakobesie which Al-Qaeda surpassed them in, but their position did not improve also during our days.
The former Mujahedins, the Afghan government and the present Taliban are agreeing about their wish to retain women in a subordinate position.
The main personages of the anti--Soviet war returned to an authority in 2001.
They turned into the businessmen who are capturing state earth using the huge American contracts of the subcontract in order to resell them under the building to the repatriates who returned from Iran and Pakistan.
They are discredited; majority is of them, is appropriate, did not fight even himself.
The people want the government which would consist not of the thieves as I was hearing in the country side.
Many young people want to leave as those will leave who could with American generosity: the outflow of the capitals is considerable.
The young people got tired of war and her ideology.
They lived in a modern peace during the banishment in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated his advantages.
About 65% of population are at the age up to 25 years; Kabul contains 5 million inhabitants, one fifth common population now.
Simply the state schools in the towns are filled in as the boys, the girls.
It is necessary to provide these young people who will not want to return neither to mrakobesiyu of the old parties, nor to some leaders' corruption with the jobs.
All, including the armed guerillas, car telephones, a television and Turkish soap operas which introduce a modern peace, and which look everywhere like.
At present moment the army is.
Will the authorities which will command it be considered legitimate?
The old commanders who carried out the anti--Soviet fight have already taken measures to the reconstruction of the provincial squads which would not yield to central authority.
Afghanistan, the mountainous country, with strong local distinctions, is decentralized one has to be before a certain degree, on the model of the western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into the centralized state with strong presidential authority eliminating the prime minister's post which has existed since the times of the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzaij does not want foreign control, in particular before the elections planned for April 2014.
But his country, starting in the fifties, and even earlier, it depends on a foreign help.
The industry was not helped to the feet, not a single dam functions, there is repaired not a single irrigation system.
Everything is being imported; nothing is not being caused, besides the vegetables and the fruits.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In the country destroyed by thirty years of war the state control of infrastructure would be necessary.
The rumors that Afghanistan possesses huge mineral fortunes circulated.
This strengthened sensation only, that the western countries attended there in order to take possession of them only.
There is no loot of the mineral resources without energy for the processing of the iron ore or copper on the spot, without resources of transportation in order to export them across the mountains.
The Chinese have almost already abandoned the deposit of the copper Mes Aijnak after leaving the international archeologists (the World Bank to be financed) to dig up a huge Buddhist complex and to remain the biggest employers of the province.
It is necessary also that on one beautiful day equally Afghanistan and Pakistan which in a big degree an import and an export depend on restored the normal relationships.
The withdrawal of the French combat subdivisions was ended on 20th November.
The new agreement about the cooperation provides for the storage of the traditional help: the Lyceum for the girls, for the boys, the faculty of French in the university, is a French institute, the cooperation in one war, legal, the medical and agricultural spheres, support for archeological delegation.
Since 2009 in the efforts "to conquer the hearts and minds" also to fulfill the impossible task of the combination of the help with the offensive operations, the service of "the soldier-civil activity" attached to Ministry of Defense (Cimic) abolished in 2012, together with small French public organization contributed to numerous public relations and the activity directed towards the reinstatement of the agriculture in dozens of the mountainous settlements.
This work, with the intensive attraction of the local workforce, they have managed to help to hold back the rebellion: the irrigation, the wells, potable water, the reconstruction of the forests, the fruit trees, the defense of the grounds and the increase are the areas of the arable earth.
What will we leave as a memento about ourselves after spending two billion euros on some war expenses?
The much more frugal budget would have made for the improvement of the living conditions of the native population, very the severe ones, in these valleys located at a height of more than 2 000 meters often above a sea level.
The embassy received dozens of the written requests for the carrying out of the small agricultural work which are coming from some local communities in the province Kapisa.
In order to get rid of the rebellions which are guided by the foreign groupings they said what farmers wish as they to me, I should show them small civil support which would be checked well and would enter outright towards them.
The difficult deliveries of the Constitution of Egypt
This is a new risky step of Mohammed Mursi president.
While Egypt is divided more than some day, on the question about the constitutional declaration which temporarily gives him emergency powers he decided to play recklessly.
After finding everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constitutive meeting will vote on the final text for a next day.
The head of the state has granted two additional months to the Meeting in order to finish the work a week ago exactly.
Soon two years are narrower as Egypt is relying on the preliminary text which repeatedly the corrections were entered in which is weakening institution stability and which it is leading to some legal contradictions.
This new initiative only strengthened the separation of the country.
According to his opponents, the President is persisting I am "strolling" in my "autocratic continuing "to break a present word and to violate a right".
In his followers' camp are convinced that this is a way to finish with an institution and political crisis after quickening the transitional process.
The referendum should be conducted in fifteen days.
The short time period which a text forces the Brothers to refuse the intention to explain to the Egyptians is an article really behind the article.
This is for the president also the way to restore the public and democratic legitimacy while dissatisfaction rages on the whole country.
Apparently, Mohammed Morsi is convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively as he declared a Half to the American weekly in one interview.
Especially as the appeal to the quickened vote is walking to an ultimatum Egyptian people: "Either you are voting for my text or I am leaving to myself the emergency powers" which as supposes the Constitutions have to be ended after the acceptance.
In this strange atmosphere 85 members of the Constitutive meeting, mainly the Islamists, voted for the text yesterday.
The majority of the liberals did not respond to a call.
In the middle of November, shortly before constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling not in the state to bring its opinion.
The representatives of the advocates of human rights, religious minorities or civil society did the the same.
That the necessary quorum was attained, 11 people, spare participants, were added hurriedly yesterday morning.
Several things are really close to the Moslem-Brothers.
It is natural that in the majority of cases the articles are progolosovany unanimously.
By the way, that fact that one of few differences of the day arose all around pozabavil the commentators... the time for the prayer, in so far as some members of the committee considered that the hours of the Constitutive meeting were incited wrongly.
The text which yesterday already the vote went as for consists of 234 articles.
The object of the common attention, article 2 ultimately remained the identical article from the Constitution 1971 that say that "the principles of shariah are the main source of the right".
The Salafistskie parties for which the introduction of the Islamic right is one of the main demands hoped to replace "principles" on "some rules", which would have given the chance of their stricter application.
For the Islamists that fact that this article was not changed is an evidence of their good will and respect for other participants of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", liberals who see only piar in this are answering.
Because, in their opinion, islamizaciya of Constitution occurs through other articles.
They are pointing out in particular article 220, which grants the university Alj-Azxar consultative role, in particular, in that, as for the check of the correspondence of the laws with shariah.
According to the specialist in Egypt Sofi Pomje, this causes alarm, because "the people called upon to make the decisions are not elected and they do not have any democratic legitimacy".
We can watch the generation of the theocracy".
Moreover, many liberals are worried by the fact, that the following rector of this university, similarly, will be where less moderate than the present one.
"At a present moment" it "no not no a concrete religious intrusion.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of civil law.
The majority of the jurists who worked on this text are not ulemy, but the people with university education, some people were learning in a French system": Aleksis Bloe is calming down who is preparing the dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes that "around article 220 ambiguity can arise because the terms which were being used for it are taken over from the religious vocabulary.
This belongs in particular to "fikx" [Islamic jurisprudence, - prim of editorial office].
Also in future the question how much the civil judges are competent to pronounce the judgements about this can arise".
Apart from its religious aspect, the text taken yesterday is exposed to the critique in so far as it is giving a wide power to the President of the Republic.
The brothers Moslem are reconfirming, that they decreased considerably in comparison with what were on an old regime.
Another controversial moment: a power of the army.
In accordance with wishes it will go the soldiers, the examination of defense budget not in the Parliament, but in the National counsel of the defense.
Also trial against the civilians in courts martial, despite the requests of the associations on the defense of the human rights will not be prohibited from.
The last ones also expressed the uneasiness concerning the text which they consider to be ruinous to freedom.
The responsibility for blasphemy is kept, and from now on insult is prohibited, which can have the serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for the freedom of the press.
Moreover, no one of the articles is talking about the woman's defense any more, is emphasizing Xeba Moraef, of Xjyuman Raijts Votch.
According to her statement, a ban of tortures yavlyaet with the only positive moment in article 36.
The word which did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to appear on a television yesterday evening, the demonstrations are planned today in the afternoon.
The head's of the state supporters will go the outsides, for their part, on Saturday.
In Israel of the Ukrainian tourists sacred places, a Navel wait for Earth and the sea of brine
The earth Obetovannaya joins the greatness of the biblical truths, modern comfort and pervozdannostj of nature into herself.
"AiF" picked out the five most important reasons as for which it is necessary to be in Israel.
We will greet sacred places
It is it to be near the Jordan river in which Jesus was christened worth.
What is on all who are dropping by this "font" is considered, a Simple bliss condescends.
And Galilei - the place of Jesus' miracles: the changes are at the wedding of water into wine, the walking on water, the calm of the storm and the filling of the nets.
Here after all Jesus came in front of the pupils also after the resurrection.
But svyatynj is most of all in Jerusalem.
The believers are approved by the Path of Sorrow here or the Godfather is Jesus' Path (on a Latin Via Doloroza is).
It is starting near the castle of Antoniya - Pretoriume, - where the court was, and is bringing Gospodnya into the Church of the Coffin along the streets of the Old Town on the Calvary mountain - to the place of the Crucifix, the Stone of Anointing and the place of Jesus' burial.
Here after all the symbolic Christian Navel of the Earth is located symbolizing the rescue of the mankind.
And the cloister of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem is erected on the spot, where, on the Christian legend, a tree grew which they made the cross for Jesus' crucifix out of.
There is it in Jerusalem and the most sacred place for iudeev is a Wall of Crying, remaining from the church, destroyed by the Romans at 70 yr n.eh.
According to tradition the people of different confessions are leaving the notes with wishes which then are performed here.
You have to carry out the trip in the perpendicular
The ruins of the castle Massada were left behind from the secret refuge from the enemies, which Irod Velikiij built to 25 towns until n.eh. for its family.
They are put in the sheer rocks above the level of the ocean in the mountains at a height of 450 m.
Also to reach to their place can with their development only those who are enthusiastic about alpinism.
An elevator brings the remaining ones on the cable railway on this historic top.
BUT in the north of the country at a height of 1600-2040 m the famous ski health resort Xermon is located, on which in winter months - the tourists' huge influx.
To his place a bus-shuttle is bringing the mountains from the foot.
The overall length of the ski runs is 45 km.
Supposedly, on an ancient legend, on the top of the mountain pagan gods lived.
You have to visit the unique museums
In this country about the 300 museums.
For one trip into all you will not be.
But it is it even though five are of them, most interesting, to visit worth.
There is the Museum of Israel located close to Knesseta (the parliament) among them.
In it the most ancient Kumranskie manuscripts, or the scrolls of Dead Sea, the deserts which were found Jewish in the caves are kept, also about 500 000 archeological ones and anthropological exhibits.
It is it to be also in the Museum of the arts in Tel Aviv worth.
The paintings of the impressionists and the expressionists are presented to Mone, Pissarro, Renuara, Sezanna, Sisleya, Matissa, Modiljyani to his expositions widely, Took, Pikasso.
In Akko one can be in the museum-bath of the Alj Bawa being a few halls of the ancient Turkish baths with mulyazhami of the visitors and the bath-house attendants of that time.
In Keijsarii it is it to drop by the unique chast-nyij Museum of Rallye worth, where one can admire the sculptures also Rodena Gave.
There are not tour guides and souvenir stores.
Free admission, and the donations are categorically not being taken.
The fifth - holocaust's museum or Yad-Vawem in Tel Aviv - is talking about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic part - the children's memorial - is built in the memory of 1.5 million children destroyed in the concentration camps and the gas chambers.
You are getting yourself into it is and you are turning up in absolute darkness.
Stars are twinkling.
Also the Jew-children's names and names of the countries in which they died are heard.
Ukraine is also being mentioned there.
Has to be improved
The three main resort zones of Israel are located at the coasts of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead seas.
There are pools, water parks, dolphinariums and okeanariumy on each of them.
It is interesting that they are bathing in Red Sea in even winter months in so far as the temperature of the water is not falling beneath 21 degree of heat there, and air is being warmed up up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea still is warmer, and there they are bathing a round year.
By the way, this most extraordinary sea is located in the peace - 417 m more low the level of the ocean, in the lowest point of the planet.
Azure water in it - brine, even in general that keeps afloat those not being able to swim easily.
The landscapes are all around unreally beautiful.
They are going here in order to complete the course of the treatment with the application of the salt-water is the brine, and healing gryazeij, and to treat health with dermatitis, the allergies, astmax, the eczemas, artritax, bronchitis, sugar diabetes, in order to bring the nerves which were shaken into an order.
Touch to the secrets of the antiquity
An ancient part of Tel Aviv is protecting them - the small town Yaffo in the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.
Through it I/you/he was approved by a famous Shipping Lane, joining Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The town is being mentioned in the Grecian and ancient-Egyptian legends.
Built on legends, namely here Noij its ark, and Perseij saved the beauty the Andromeda with which here after all they lived for long and happy life.
The tourists very like pobroditj on uzenjkim ulochkam named in honor of the signs of the Zodiac.
They are speaking if you will touch the walls in the street of "your" sign, the Fate will become favorable.
In Yaffo one can meet the newlyweds who are coming for fotosessii from the whole Israel and even other countries.
BUT in Keijsarii - the town of the tsar Iroda - can pobroditj on the Roman theater, "to take" the crusaders' castle.
In the Roman period Keijsariya was the main town Iudei and a residence of the Roman procurators, including Punty Pilata.
The restored theater is carefully being used for some evening concerts and some opera performances now.
To the tourist on the note
When setting out to Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: in the country about 30% of population know Russian.
The money on the trip is better take not in a euro, but in the dollars which it is easy to exchange for the shekels (soon 1 $ is 3.8 shekels).
Mainly the city transport is buses, but there is a high-speed streetcar in Jerusalem, and there is the line of the subway, only in the country, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower town to the upper one in Haifa.
In essence, this the underground funicular.
A passage costs 6 shekels for which one can go with changes for 1 a.m. in all the types of city transport.
In Israel according to Jewish tradition on Saturday note sabbath.
From evening of Friday before the sunset on Saturday stop work the markets, the shops, public transport.
And on Sunday a working week is beginning with the morning.
There are only a kosher food that excludes pork, moreprodukty, the fish without the scale and the dish, in many coffee bars, the restaurants and the hotels in which are integrated milk with meat.
There they are offering the big choice of the dishes from the mutton and beef, soups and the desserts, the traditional Jewish paste of xumus, the diverse sauces, the balls from the milled chickpea - falalelj, the fruits and the vegetables, prepared on coconut milk.
In the streets of the Israeli towns are not stray dogs.
There are really many cats fattened up which "in itself" are imposingly "walking" but.
In the evening one can see them as even sleeping on the roofs of the parked cars.
Murlyki likes crowded places and is not refusing the entertainments.
The rent of the car, depending on a mark, up to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) will cost the day (Hyundai Getz) from 37 $.
Plus is insurance - 15 $ per day.
And the lease of the bicycle will cost 15 wek. per day.
The tickets to the museums are on average for 30 shekels.
The language of the numbers
In 2012 more than three million tourists from the whole world visited Israel.
Most of All it is to travel and to rest came the citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
On Obetovannoij Earth from January until October 2012, 118800 Ukrainian tourists have been, which is of 51% more than the analogous index of 2010, before the abolition of the visas of February 9, 2011.
"Great and powerful" will bring to Moscow: the migrants are saving up money for a language
While the deputies and the human rights activists are arguing, that the law on obligatory linguistic test will give, in the country the swindlers that are dealing in the "linden" certificates have already appeared
Annually to Moscow, St. Petersburg and the other towns of Russia come 13 million gastarbaijterov.
Mainly these are the citizens of Middle Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenia.
Their only goal is to earn the money for the maintenance of the families which stayed in the home.
Since the 1st December a law according to which every labor migrant will be obliged to take the examination for the knowledge of Russian came into effect.
This rule has worked only for those who are intending to work in services sector, housing-communal economy, way of life and retail trade yet.
However with time, is promise in FMS: the tests will become obligatory for all the visitors.
One not only will have to hand in the language, however, Russian history, and the principles of the legislation moreover.
One will have to confirm the knowledge of the language both for the receipt and for the prolongation of the work permit.
The exception works only for the citizens of those countries, where Russian is state language.
Also people who had time to receive the certificates and the diplomas about education before the break-up of the USSR in 1991 are not falling under the action of the law.
The use, despair and the defense are right
The net of the examination points will work under the aegis of the Russian Institute yazyka the name of Pushkin, the University of the friendship of people, MGU, SPbGU and other Russian colleges.
Migrants will be able to take tests in all the towns; already now in Russia more than 160 such centers opened.
Both the deputies of Duma and FMS maintained the initiative for the introduction of test.
And here the human rights activists often had time before the law came into effect to ask the question in the press: and what, in fact, will give this?
What will change the binding force of the knowledge of the language both for the Russians and for visitors themselves?
Above all, - the representatives of the migratory service are answering, - this will allow reducing the quantity of the people that are suffering from "labor slavery".
Very many people are talking about the defense of the rights of the labor migrants now, is explaining the head of the representation FMS of Russia in Tajikistan Victor Sebelev.
The defense of their rights has to begin before their departure.
Only the system of the organized typesetting will allow resolving the foreign workers' problems of 90%.
The problems appear with the migrants without occupation, education not knowing language, not having a medical examination.
Without understanding of the language, - Sebelev is convinced, - the future migrant is condemned to come across with the careless people who will put the help under look sticking the "voucher" for the weird narrow barrack his into a day where it is and dozens of the ones similar to it tomitjsya without food and documents for months for 12 p.m..
We are receiving the mass of the complaints from our migrants.
"In the home" they "are promising them one, deceive but on the arrival of them, they are taking passports, they are not paying promised wages", a boss of the Head Office of the labor migration MS of Tajikistan Tolib Waripov is confirming.
Do not swear, nasyaljnika!
Nevertheless, yet many citizens of the Central Asian republics going on payments to Russia will confess that they not only do not know language of the country into which they are striving, however, to which they are writing with difficulty on the own ones.
Of course, this not so much their guilt, as trouble: few Turkomans, the Uzbeks, the Tajiks can allow themselves to receive even the clear primary education.
However, it is not even allowed at their families to feed the children with anything, without speaking really about in order respectably providing clothes for them, putting shoes and equipping for the school.
Reaching a podrostkovogo age, such children set out under the first after all possibilities on some payments.
It is difficult if it is bad with the knowledge of the language: they are confessing.
"You feel humiliated and defective".
The human rights activists have been celebrating one important moment really, with regard to law on language.
The test will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status.
If status is not here: there will be neither an examination, nor a following official work.
Meanwhile, the big part of gastarbaijterov as before live in Russia illegal.
"You are welcome, or the entrance is prohibited by the foreign one"
Many of visitors are asserting what the official status not so simply to receive in our country.
Reason is also everything in bureaucratic impediments the same linguistic difficulties.
Moreover, legalization costs money: from 12 000 to 16 000 roubles.
And here one can do the false registration for a thousand five hundred fast and in total.
The co-workers of Russian police know, what with us mainly the false documents, there is no registration, from here and the cases of blackmail.
"They are inviting a hundred, two on the cigarettes, tea": the citizen of Tajikistan Umed Xuwkadamov shared with the journalists.
"Naletaij, do not scrimp, buy the painting"
Into the first after all it turned out a day of the attachment of the law on language that not only migrantskie documents about registration are false sometimes.
A few "linden" certificates of the passage of the linguistic tests have already been confiscated by the co-workers of FMS.
The counterfeit papers are printed on the normal colored printer.
Of course, they were passed down to the new owners not for nothing: each of the migrants who hoped in this way to ease themselves task of the passage of tests paid seven thousand roubles for the document.
This into two with the unnecessary one a time more expensively than the procedure of the official test: it will cost the labor migrant three thousands.
In that, what is main task for the near future both the representatives of the authority and human rights activists are getting together to defend the system against corruption so that it would be impossible to buy "the crusts" simply.
After all the authorities can promise yet time for the research of the basic linguistic course to gastarbaijteram not being able from the start successfully to go the test.
Moreover, the work in the spheres which do not suppose the active contact with the people will be offered by the visitor who does not know Russian.
The Department of the Interior of the Interior is not taking the illegal market of the weapons into the turnover
The share of the crimes of application of the legal weapons is extremely low
The Department of the Interior of the Interior of Russia is offering to stiffen the law with regard to the owners of the civil weapons.
This is a reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: To press the shots at the weddings after it had turned out without the victims and To Press the massacre organized by the Moscow jurist Dmitri Vinogradov as a result of which died seven people.
The police officers want to forbid the carrying travmatiki also to improve the age which one can receive the license for the weapons from - from 18 years until 21 in some public places.
The head of the Duma security and action against corruption committee Irina Yarovaya maintained the idea and promised that they will bring in the corrections into law of the weapons to Duma in the future fast one.
Not everyone is not content with the Russian authorities trying to fight a problem by means of "the twisting of the nuts".
Into some nets the opened letter the authors of which are the representatives of the different public infantry organizations emerged - they are demanding to refuse "absurd stiffening".
The percentage of hooliganism with the registered weapons is minimum, declared Basil's jurist-criminalist the Foresters the Russian service of the BBC.
On the statistics of the Department of the Interior of the Interior, in six months of 2012 142 crimes of application of the firearm registered at the organs of the home matters while in total during the same period 1168 000 crimes are being fixed have been committed.
The authors of the opened letter are convinced, that the stiffening of the legislation does not put the civil weapons in the sphere the criminal to go to the "black" market.
Now one can find just any weapons at low price in Moscow, in their words.
Meanwhile they assert in the Department of the Interior of the Interior that they are checking the situation with the spreading of the illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from the factories before the officers
The "black" market of the weapons is replenished on a few canals.
Main such canals five, a colonel is saying v otstavke Victor the Chicory that has worked in the structure of the Department of Education and General Staff ten years.
Skrinwot of site which takes on orders on the weapons
The first is "army or war trace", that is to say weapons which was stolen away during the combat operations in Caucasus.
He is saying, "Both the Russian officers and even the Caucasians dragged the weapons", the Chicory.
The following type of "black weapons" is stolen away from the representatives by the criminals power structures.
The chicory is explaining, that they here are entering both taken away from the police stockrooms and stolen away near direct the co-workers of law-enforcement agencies.
The illegal "trunks" are going into the sale of the war stockrooms.
On many war stockrooms the explosions often happened.
"There are proved versions, what were done the part of arsons special: in order to cover a lack", a former soldier is speaking.
The producers of the weapons are bringing in their bit, according to the Chicory.
"Now the private weapon factories plodyatsya" which are not withstanding competition in the international market and are throwing out weapons from under the skirt on the black market, including Moscow: an expert is saying.
Yet another source of the "black" market is smuggling.
Acts especially a lot the pistols and the automats from the poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan.
"There are their production, sometimes primitive one, and the mafia which organized a flow was formed", is explaining a former soldier.
From where are weapons?
The experts counted, what an approximate share of the each of the sources of the deliveries of the illegal weapons on the "black" market is.
The report about this prepared the Center of the problem analysis and state-administrative design in 2011.
The specialists analyzed the accounts of the Department of the Interior of the Interior and Rosstata, the criminologic literature and the open data of the portals on weapon subject matter.
The suppressing part of the illegal weapons, researchers are writing, it is acting from the army and some power departments.
Half of all the weapons turned up on the black market "due to the officials whose work is connected to the weapons" there, are being said in report.
The weapons are coming under the researchers' data, 17% of cases from the places of the armed conflicts, of 14% of cases thefts are going on on the stage of the production of the weapons, 5% fall on "a black archeology".
The seller-consultant of one of the weapon shops requested not to call his surname swears that no one is buying the weapons found by the black excavators for a long time - it is too old.
As he is speaking the sellers mostly go for the new party to the war stockroom.
Through the warrant officer the person is buying a unit, for example a pistol TT.
They are copying it to him, are submitting across zaborchik.
"He is transporting it to the town and is selling 900 euros each for a piece with two shops here": he is saying
"Pravda, the police are knowing the latest about all the matters, therefore periodically when the plan of solving of crimes burns, he is conducting the check purchasing with the dealers the illegal weapons", a consultant is adding.
"How in the luxurious shop"
A seller and a customer find each other through the acquaintances mostly.
I looked on the sites, into blogi while the comrade was not responding who offered for the platform "running", where a person who will take me into "the corner" will be where we will haggle, to come.
I recognized the price of the trunk only there
the war correspondent Victor is a Chicory
In order to get a trunk for me necessary the acquaintance who has an exit is a seller consultant is saying. - I have such an acquaintance, but I am not convinced of it.
There are the sellers in the markets, but there it is also necessary to come, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich who requested to pass on that with the daughter the cog fell".
I am getting even a pair of the brass knuckles now through the person who I/you/he is confident of.
He is also delivering them only to me because he knows that I will not hand it in.
The beginners are looking for weapons different roads.
The former war Victor tested the Chicory himself in the role of the customer of the illegal weapons in the middle the 1990th, when I/you/he was cooking to the publication the article about this.
According to his statement, the schemes did not change.
They gave him an album from the photographs, where all was "that it wishes".
"I felt as in the luxurious shop", a soldier remembers.
They are not offering the customer the tomcat, according to the Chicory, in the bag - one can try everything.
I, the potential client, I am not buying simply - we are going with the seller to the forest, we are standing a target up there.
They "are giving me the chance to shoot:, when I also make sure that the weapons are beating well" we begin "to haggle", an expert is describing a procedure.
The shop on the sofa
Poiskoviki in internet are taking the weapons "for different goals" on the sites and some groups in "Vkontakte", where they are offering to buy.
No documents and personal meetings are not necessary for this.
They are writing, "It is enough to have a certain sum of money", in the advertising cap on the site "To buy the combat pistol or the automat".
In it the users are leaving their applications and are asking questions.
But to the minors will sell?
"Without license it is final", is asking a user "Ivan" (the orthography is kept).
"I will buy TT.Moskva" - he is laconically formulating the inquiry "Fedorenkov".
The federal security service razbrosila the huge net of the false sites now and is raking those wanting to buy the combat weapons with the spade.
The people are going, like the hungry fish on feeding, but then they are extracting coal in Siberia
the war correspondent and the former war Victor the Chicory
I heard about such schemes: the site is normally registered beyond the limits of the action of the Russian laws.
The people are taking on orders.
The customer across the Bancomat is making payment.
"They are sending a photograph and instructions into an answer where the weapons are hidden": a press spokesman is telling "The right to weapons" to public organization Dmitri Kislov.
Victor is asserting the Chicory, what left the application on the site, one can remain without the weapons and hit behind the bars.
The federal security service razbrosila the huge net of the false sites now and is raking those wanting to buy the combat weapons with the spade.
"The people are going, like the hungry fish on feeding, but then they are extracting coal in Siberia", he is reconfirming.
Makarov is for 100 dollars
On the purchase of the illegal infantry weapons one can confine oneself to the amount, according to the experts' estimates, from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitri Kislova from organization one for 100-300 dollars can acquire "The right to weapons", Makarov's pistol.
One will have to wait for a month-полтора.
It is being shipped from the stockrooms of the long storage instruction of these stockrooms of the middle unit.
On official stastistike of department, in comparison with January - October 2011, the number of such crimes as a whole on Russia decreased of 7% and 22900 were, and the quantity of the discovered facts of theft and the blackmail of the weapons, the ammunitions, the explosives and the explosives decreased by 7.8%.
IN THE USA workers of fastfuda and the supermarkets are striking
Up to quarter of all the American teenagers is fitting through the work in the booking office desk "Makdonalds"
During the last days on America the wave of actions of protest against the low wages in the department stores of the corporation Walmart and the restaurants of the popular nets of the fast nourishment such as "Makdonalds", "Burger king", "Tako bell", "Uehndis" and "Kentucky was taken "fraijd of chiken".
While no one is touching not to predict, this wave will turn into the ninth bank or it is predestined to vydoxnutjsya on early stages.
The actions support unions and the series of the left public organizations.
Besides the rise in the frugal wages in the goal of the organizers of protests which row workers Walmart and systems of the fast nourishment are receiving a creation in them of the trade union organizations is.
This sector of the economy has almost not been being encompassed by the labor movement yet.
46 cents per year?
The actions began last week after a Day of thanksgiving on so-called "Black Friday" after on America the orgy of cheap rasprodazh moving millions of the Philistines and being accompanied by the brawls sometimes had crashed down.
On this day some workers of the corporation Walmart in which 2.2 million people are working all over the world abandoned their jobs and picketed the shops of the corporation together with unions and the left activists, whose product be raschitan on the people of the modest and average prosperity.
Walmart is dealing in all in the light, from the diapers, the hunting guns and automobile batteries to the vacuum cleaners, the eggs and milk.
The products are on average cheaper than in the big supermarkets in his shops from 8% to 27%.
Therefore many workers Walmart being low-pai are stocking up only with themselves at work.
Accessibility and the assortment made Walmart one of the biggest corporations of America.
According to the critics, Walmart can partly allow itself to sell the product of podewevke because few are paying to its workers.
The last ones are also complaining about difficult working conditions, for example, about the shortage of the fork lifts or the manual scanners.
The participants of the actions on "black Friday" demanded to raise the wages and were complaining on the cost of medical insurance which is granted by the corporation galloping from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
They said to the typical worker Walmart receiving 9.5 dollar per hour this expense is not affordable.
The scientists from the Californian university in Berkli are proving, what if Walmart will increase the srednuyuyu wages up to 12 dollars per hour, this will cost 3.2 billion dollars to the corporation.
This is spending on the wages more than it 1.1% approximately now.
If Walmart whole will transfer the growth of the wages to the customers' shoulders, every visit to the shop will more expensively of in total 46 cents turn out for them.
In a year they will spend more on some 12.39 dollars than soon.
The supporters Walmart quite note that the actions of protest occurred in in total nine staff and corporations did not cause a maleijqego damage.
"Black Friday" was going on in her shops from 8 o'clock of the evening on Thursday until the midnight of the next day, and meanwhile Walmart sold about 5000 product in a second.
All in all her cash registers made almost 100 million transactions on "black Friday".
The representative of the corporation Dehn Fogelman reconfirmed an interview the left site Huffington Post, that all in all the jobs abandoned "less than five" co-workers Walmart, and that the action of protest was "the" all in all "next piarovskim trick" of the union which organized it.
"The free booking office desk"!
The protests continued this week in New York, where not department stores Walmart (they are not granting them in this progressive town, and therefore they have not been here yet), but "Makdonaldsy" and other cheap restaurants were their object.
Makdonalds says that he is selling billions of the portions both after this it is even not giving you the ones hospital and is not paying you for an honest work!
Dzhumeijn Uiljyams, member of the city council of New York
At present moment the minimum wage is 7.25 dollar, according to federal and New York legislation, in hours.
The restaurants of the fast nourishment have increased it with time, but a little, and on average their ordinary workers are receiving in New York 8.90 dollar in hours.
No one is earning less than they in this expensive town.
How one inscrutably can exist in New York of such money, for me.
A quarter of the American teenagers who earned on the side behind their counters after the school at the same time living with the parents fit once through "Makdonaldsy" seemingly.
Hardly anyone saw the main source of food in this or planned on staying there for long.
I am constantly striking against the interview with the workers of "Makdonaldsov" which are complaining about their having to live off these wages and even to feed the children on it sometimes immediately.
On the other hand, in the forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal a comment the author of which is noting is hanging irresponsibly to bring the children if you do not know, on that you will feed them.
The participants of the actions of protest, which began near "Makdonaldsa" in the 40th street into 6.30 а.m. on Thursday also on Mehdison-avenyu, required that at the minimum 15 dollars began to pay the cashiers and the cooks of the system fast nourishment at an hour, doubled them that is more than the present minimum payment.
They also demanded that in the sphere of the fast nourishment the trade union organizations were created.
The American law prohibits to administration from hindering this and punishing the activists of the labor movement the faultfindings and dismissals.
On the other hand, an administration infrequently eases their life.
But surround with union the fast nourishment complicatedly and according to objective reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary fluctuation of the personnel.
Discordant
The noisy protests took place on this day and at the row of other cheap restaurants of Manxehttena.
A meeting was the culmination of the action in the middle of the day near "Makdonaldsa" next to Times public garden into details, the member of the city council Dzhumeijn Uiljyams declared on which a few local politicians democrat appeared: "Makdonalds" says that he is selling billions of the portions, and after this it is even not giving you the ones hospital and he is not paying you for an honest work"!.
For example, also other prominent New York democrats supported the demonstrators the candidate for post of the mayor of the town Bill De Blasio declaring that "we have to enter amicably the support of the workers of the fast nourishment so that they would achieve the fair payment and the economic well-being which every njyu-ijorkec deserves"!.
As New York Times described the occurring one, this was the biggest action like that in history of the American sphere of the fast nourishment.
But only a few hundred participated in it the person, were moreover by no means always of them workers of the fast obqepita in which in New York dozens of thousands of people are taken up.
While it is unclear, will this spark generate the flame of the mass movement.
"To deceive the brain yet turns out averagely"
The popular one among the admirers of the modern technologies is taken the topic of the supplemented reality recently mainly to perceive across the prism of the special glasses.
At first in its annual conference Google showed the functional model in the summer, and then in November it became known that I/you/she handed in the application to the appropriate patent also to Microsoft.
What for the scientists, however from a conversation with the leader of a group of the interactive 3D technologies in Microsoft Kehmbridzhskoij laboratory Waramom Izadi follows, given to the company the glasses - the gone stage.
A perspective of manipulation beckons them with virtual objects in air the bare hands, the creations of the virtual open spaces.
- Say, please, in common ways that your research group is doing?
- We are dealing with the interaction of the person with the cars, but at the same time are trying to move the borders of this interaction apart.
The mankind has stuck in mass yet on the stage of work with the pixels on the flat screen, sometimes tykanjya in them the finger.
After all we want to look of 5-10 years into forward and to foresee the fundamental changes in this interaction.
For example, the prefix Xbox and the sensors Kinect are step ahead, and hardly not a single Xbox is selling without Kinect today, but the zhestovoe department is interesting in all.
- What has still been waiting for us ahead?
- In spite of the fact that Kinect postponed the interaction until physical layer, many things occur on the flat screen up to now, sometimes in 3D.
The input of the information improved (the system is receiving more data), but conclusion has not been yet not really.
We are trying to change this, are working on the truly three-dimensional systems of representation on the basis of different technologies, including projecting.
It is necessary to let out the computer peace into ours, physical, it to make it be felt.
However, for this it is necessary to recognize the user not only, however, the space is around it.
At that time we will be able to supplement the real world with the virtual objects in much more comfortable form.
And first of all these idiotic helmets of the virtual reality are to the devil!
- What do you think about vocal department?
Popular piece, but they do not think of it too highly?
- It is impossible to name it panacea in a certain way - a question to privatnosti gets up because it is not always desirable the associates to be informed about its actions and intentions.
As a matter of fact all the types of interaction with the computers are good, but each is in his niche.
For example, for a control of the devices in places a project was within the framework of which we thought about some gestures but not over wide, but over such avaricious, short.
At the same time the gestures were being taken off not with the camera tube of the device, but the wrist bracelet which fixed the movements of the bones and the muscles.
It has been big yet, but one can theoretically diminish it to the size of the wrist-watches.
But, for example, in general, future behind the mixed type of the department is zhest+golos.
- This how?
- For example, ask as you me to pass you this can of gazirovki?
You will say and will point simultaneously.
- I am simply normally speaking.
- ABOUT, this will be really complicated to recognize.
- That is you want to force the users to adapt under that, what can not or can at the present time the car?
- It is quite optional, but this mutual approach.
I think, in the near future we will mainly have to work on the development of the new types of the sensors which will allow determining the person's reactions more more precisely.
For example, these can be laser sensors, they are giving the good permission for depth, this permission very importantly.
- If to talk about your work with the sensors Xbox Kinect, what you have claims on the modern cameras tubes?
Do the permission, the depth or still something not suffice?
- The basically present generation is that what one can dispense with in our work on three-dimensional identification.
Of course, it would be good 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 k/s to receive.
But matter not into themselves the megapixels, but into the quality of the matrix and depth.
From the last point of view all the present technologies are insufficiently good for us - this is adding a work the planners of the algorithms.
That is it is necessary to recall not only the permission for the X axes and Y, however, Z.
Also the speed is really important, the quantity of the personnel in a second.
The person's movements are quite dynamic, also present 30 k/s openly little, especially for gestures.
Stiven Betiwes made from our Rehdmondskoij laboratory the sensor of contact with the delay of processing being regulated is from 1 to 100 msec, and modern serial sensors nearer to the second (60-100) are index.
Not everyone does not understand as far as this influences the interaction of the person and the cars.
The equivalent of such a device not requiring the contacts only would have been very suitable for me in my work, so that the personnel in a second was more.
- And is it not necessary to increase the quantity of the cameras tubes?
- There are three "cameras tubes" one of which as a matter of fact is an infrared radiator in Kinect now, and the second is a receiver of the reverberation.
BUT already the third camera tube is this, in fact, the normal sensor of visible span.
It is not being used for the definition of the depth of the object.
They could have solved the potentially greater quantity of the cameras tubes problem...
Or you have to redouble it after increasing the amount of the calculations being demanded.
Were to create the flexible counterpart Kinect in a best way, to be played for a little while with the curvature of the arrangement of the cameras tubes and to look as this will help in three-dimensional definition of the position.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, in contrast to Google, I/you/she did not present to the public with her glasses.
Does it not seem to you that from the point of view of the everyday use of the technologies of the supplemented reality the glasses are one of the most prospective platforms?
- That I think about, of course, always walking holding smartfon in the raised hands not really comfortably, but here: a supplemented reality "crossing" would be the steepest version, when according to cloudy platform you could switch from glasses on smartfon, the projection display and then everywhere.
The glasses are a very personal device, there is their power (only you see the private things) in this, also simultaneously weakness is the supplemented reality will not allow according to the glasses you to work on some virtual objects jointly with other people.
- We will present that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects is accessible not only to Tony Starku of "the iron Person", but also to the mere mortal in air for the moment.
There is one problem which often the critics of such an idea point out: there is no tactile comment!
Nothing feels its arm!
What answers your group is preparing on this call?
- In my lectures I say often that the supplemented reality is the seventh on bill breakthrough in the person's interaction and cars.
I think, an addition of the tactile sensations completely become can the eighth.
After all one of interesting tricks has been the use of second arm as the original backing for the representation yet.
She is excellently registering the pressure!
But has and technologies, which are really directed on an addition here these "pictures in the air" of tangibility: for example, the interference of a few ultrasonic directed beams gives sensation in a certain point, where there is the finger, but it has been very weak yet as if they blew you on the pads.
Has and the bracelets on the wrists which influence some nervous endings in the fingers are also prospective direction.
- And did you try to deceive your brain?
To think that he feels that to force it what kind of must to feel at that moment when he sees something?
- This is good idea here, we have not tried yet so to make.
Here yet another task is lying which struggling with already for a long time is necessary: that it is going how to force the person that is physically in the space limited really to believe on opened, practically endless is we are working also on the conceptions of the bearing surfaces (not at all such as in the clubs), the moving platforms, as well as the huge balls.
To deceive the brain yet turns out averagely, work for already very many years.
Here what is making the work on virtual reality such attractive is many things in an absolutely rudimentary state for the researcher.
Vkusovqina is Rosbalt.ru instead of culture
"Rosbalt" continues the "St. Petersburg advanced guard" project dedicated to the town-dwellers who are ahead, in the advanced guard of culture and art.
The bright officials of the art-scene of St. Petersburg whose achievements are exceeding the frames of the town have often finding the acknowledgment in Europe leaving out the Russian publicity already hit on the present top-list.
The new hero "Rosbalta" - the grand artist Kirill Miller.
All the town knows Kirilla Millera - the bearded person dressed in all red one who is meeting now at the Russian museum, now near the Summer garden, now on the stylish parties and vernisazhax.
The spectators' crowds have always collected the paintings of the Kirilla Millera where they would not be posted.
Kirill Miller is one of the social-philosophical especially St. Petersburgs tellers of fairy tales, the founders of new mifologiij.
Kirill Miller is a bright person of the St. Petersburg advanced guard of the end of 80th - the beginnings of 90th.
Moreover, it is the person of the town causing the town-dwellers smile through his appearance in the streets, picking up spirits everyone.
Recently he took the barrel organ in his hands and became St. Petersburg warmanqikom, because I/you/he matured for this complicated role all of its bohemian existences, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, but why, for example, all the same you are going around the town in all red, and not in yellow or turquoise?
- I elected the red fashion designer who is engaged in look and image.
In this peace the red is compromise among the artist, imidzhmeijkerom and society.
Although there is everything in a society, what slightly not gray, it is causing an aggression and the stimulation of the hostile property.
But my provocations are directed towards the conversation beginning.
The whole history of my provocative actions is invitation to the discussion.
- And when did you understand that one has to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in DK Nevskom, where my work was put forward.
I understood that this is my road.
At that time the wave of the old free unofficial artists went away, but new, free type were me incomprehensible.
I started being friends with the artists of new wave, from postgazonevqinoij which led to "Puwkinskoij-10", and more wave was not.
He is throwing me into the theater, the clothes, music, into all the genres, besides word.
- Also все this one closed up into your Art-clinic... - It was to me important to find oneself in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg where all the better creative forces have to get together.
In 1995 I occupied the territory in Puwkinskoij-10, and there while there was no repair a musical-artistic club existed, the bohemian club, the house of the St. Petersburg bogemy.
Many people were born there: I remember NOMy, Tekila-dzhaz, as the Cord brought with project "Ear of Goga Van".
The cord and his friends were singing under the veneer light songs was, they were in the covering tricot, among them stylish nowadays composer Igor Vdovin.
After a group had played alive, it became "Leningrad".
Traxtenberg was a leading of many programs until the xali-galivskix times.
We gave them Traxtenberga, and his great career was going on, and it received the basic education and the education from us.
The gallery "D 137", "the" club "Griboyedov are otgoloski from Art-clinic.
There our workers and the habitués went.
I am the hero of yesterday's century, when culture meant something.
In 2000 the polling was in the press, the prize was "The people of our town".
In the nomination "Artist of the year" I was named, my culmination ended.
In the new times comfortlessly to work according to old rules, I am the person of the truth, honesty and the culture of the past century.
In our years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are being shared, one can be popular, but not very cultural.
- The manner to be recognized is inherent in your work.
- Many my pictures are hits, in them an expressed timeliness and an acuteness are bright.
I will have a program exhibition, "The Russian museum will be in the clown".
The clowns are timeless category.
I was earlier social, soon being is to such painful and is terrible.
But in the clown everything razmazyvaetsya, tragedy is being taken off.
I like a grotesque, I have groteskovye ideas.
For example, the rescue of the peace with a path of the totalitarian overdressing in prikaznom order.
Now they are meeting odezhke apiece orienting oneself towards the external mechanics, and not towards inner person.
BUT, can, he is not allowed to offer his arm and it is necessary to spit on the mug.
Also the deceit will be taken off with the help of overdressing.
- And recently we saw you in city's warmanqika role. - The cultural town has to have such a hero.
Who, as me, them not to be.
- Of course can and the commercial art can be beautiful?
- Soon the commercial art has to be accurate, tactful, sweet.
A disintegration of cultures is going on.
The people contradicted themselves earlier of flocks, bogema liked one, the fools other.
Everyone broke up into some micro-associations immediately, everyone will soon like in a difficult way.
I am a paper not a hundred-dollar in order to everyone be liked.
Now it is necessary to think who will like you.
Now with every cultic hero in 100 admirers.
- And to Michailov's Stasa come a few thousand each!
- Browenki are coming to it, there the sex-social sphere snaps into action.
And on cultural ground 300 people will come, and 10 000 will not come, and as a result less than management, the money, everything is withering.
I have admirers, a main thing: it not to be possible to deceive them, it is not possible to spoil earned.
I wrote such pictures in youth, that one collector has them on the wall next to Faljkom and Larionovym hanged.
I began with the pictures which finish with normally.
They now often mix up ideas.
They are speaking: culture is the last will, the culture of consumption.
There is no culture near the consumption, this from another opera.
I am the person of the culture of the yesterday, appeared on the artists' examples who lived in poverty and died in poverty, were refusing the money for the sake of the drawing of the pictures.
I in such a here culture.
- Kirill, which is not sufficing for St. Petersburg?
- The good cultural experts.
There is such an idea: the official is from culture.
But not each of them is able to be engaged in culture.
Under the right tsars all was not so, the tsars, can, they did not know something about culture not really, but they understood that it is necessary to hold the right experts.
Here in Moscow now the good consultants.
We have the people in St. Petersburg, which could be experts, but they are moved because the taller experts who will correctly appreciate these experts and will give them a road are necessary.
Now vkusovqinka thrives.
The same is distinguishing Ehrarta, but them that they are honestly speaking, that we are not taking on the whole modern art there are such artists who have to look themselves for the other museums.
- What for you is St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not not the cultural capital, there is ground in Moscow of culture much more, there.
And on our stones the art to grow in a difficult way.
We need a cultural ground, and we have more writers now than the readers, this reader wrong.
In Europe many people are really curious here. which go on the exhibitions, some concerts.
With us after all this layer is thin.
We should make the art stylish, as this it was at the beginning of the past century.
The project is sold on the resources of the grant of St Petersburg
You have to give birth in the cosmos
The earth in the danger.
The global warming or the clash with the assassin-asteroid.
The caravans of the spaceships with zemlyanami are leaving for the searches of the spare planet aboard.
In order to keep mankind, does the main question how to continue its kind with regard to weightlessness or in the same spare planet get up?
I think that the choice is not great.
Actually the real planets only two which one can settle at least hypothetically.
"This is Venus and Mars", thinks the older scientific co-worker of the astronomic State institute of the name of P.K. Wternberga (GAIW) Vladimir Surdin.
But if in Mars the conditions, more suitable for life, that on the surface of Venus are the temperatures of 500 degrees.
One can live only at a big height or on the orbit of Venus... in the cosmos.
They began to approach the questions of the reproduction in the cosmos from the flora.
They have still conducted the experiments on the plants half a century ago.
Four generations of the raised one did not differ by anything in the orbit of pea from their terrestrial types.
Then a discharge is on the orbit of the insects, the tiny fruit flies-drosophila.
In 1979 they sent the quails' eggs to the cosmos in order to check how the embryo is developing with regard to weightlessness.
We are receiving an absolutely normal chick on exit.
And here the problem is further beginning.
"Problem, connected to the fact that this chick has to find the support it has to walk up on his also to begin to move" the legs", the the laboratory of the Institute of the physician-biological problems (IMBP) of WOUNDS manager Vladimir Sychev is explaining.
Without having found the support, the chicks disorderly somersaulted.
And in 10 a.m. with the neonates the complete atrophy of instincts was going on.
The chicks did not react to the light and the sound.
There was trouble in in four days their simply dying.
"Also two times we vyluplyali chicks, refused after this because it is simply impossible there to work with them": Vladimir Sychev is stating the failure of the experiment with the chicks in the cosmos.
With the animals the last time the biological "mini-ark" flew on the orbit 16 years ago.
In spring of 2013 the experiments will continue.
However only unisexual individuals will be on the biocompanion "Bion".
An experiment was with the rats which have already been sent to the cosmos with the fruit.
Basically, they did not discover anything supernatural there.
"This just was on the biocompanions, but a single experiment is again, and it is necessary to see off such researches", is noting Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing at the cosmic rats descendants appeared.
But to approach the problem of reproduction directly in the cosmos yet does not turn out.
Complicated task.
The animals, los, the usual habitat, they are not able to realize their the chaff instinct simply.
The person after all in contrast to the wild animals, basically, can.
Homo sapiens possesses abstract thinking, and there is an emotional podobayuqiij background in the state to create.
According to ethical considerations the similar experiments are not being conducted.
But the women fly into the cosmos already 50 years.
Terewkovoij had the biggest risk.
But it is the most precious thing that a mankind has, a female organism is.
Our Gull flew away, and no one would be able to say on Earth: will it remain after the flight to cosmos.
Will it be able to give birth to a child after this flight.
"But no one answered this question", a veteran of the rocket-cosmic branch is saying Vaxtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, all in a year after the flight to cosmos, Valentine Tereshkov's first woman-astronaut gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child Andriyan was Nicholaev also an astronaut.
In 1988 the son was born in the second woman-astronaut Svetlana Savitsky being on the orbit twice and even working in the open cosmos.
However risk remains.
We contain few, a unit astronauts with whom after the long flights everything managed, and a healthy generation is growing.
"But if it is more, this is dangerously even on the orbital flights", is an astronaut, the Hero of the Soviet Union, the Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov is bringing result.
Also nevertheless, the mankind needs to look for some new roads in biotechnologies, a defense from the radiation, the creation of the artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory CPK is the obligatory stage of the preparation for the flight.
Here with regard to zero floatation the astronauts are paying off the skills of the work in the open cosmos.
Water is imitating weightlessness.
If water is for the adults, let a native element be also comfortable, but all the same foreign Wednesday, that for the chest children.
Apparently they are confirming small ixtiandry - life went to the continent from the ocean.
There is a connection between the kid having been in eye-fertile liquid the mom approximately 9 months, is it for him easier to get used to water then.
Basically this is logical because from a moment births are from the moment of that first bathing, 2 weeks in total pass.
This very few, so that something forget, the instructor of the grudnichkovogo cruise Aksyonov's Marina is speaking.
Word, if for the child who was born weightlessness is more natural state, that for the woman - gravity, a gravity are necessary.
In weightlessness the muscles of the stomach, the pelvis become decrepit very fast, the proficiency in ejection of the fruit falls.
Is of course all right, we will lower also this relying on the stimulators of the ancestral activity.
Of course, one can go in the special camera tube to the deliveries, it will push it out.
"But distant what"? - Valery Polyakov is asking untrivial questions.
On the other hand, the child also needs the artificial gravity.
Not fel the terrestrial attraction, the organism will not form the skeleton and a muscular system.
The neonate on the orbit impossible as the adult, to dress in the special loading suit for the training.
It will simply be deprived of what will be essential for him.
"Also this experiment which you and I will go to will lead after admitting the child's birth in alien Wednesday to our bringing the invalid, completely the dezadaptirovannogo person to the Earth": the head of the the bio-ethic IMBP OF WOUNDS committee Igor of the Pestles is anticipating.
The children's birth has been a matter of theory in the cosmos yet.
However, the time later this will be reality, will set out when zemlyane on its ships on the distant planet which will become a house for their descendants given birth to in the cosmos.
The boss of the Main department of check and auditing: The check of the wvarc-system fell through due to the politicians.
In the branch of the state purchasings good organs of control are available to the Czech Republic and is falling behind in his application, despite the presence of the qualitative legislation.
This is a statement of Miroslav of the Faeces, the vice-president of the supreme department of check and auditing, from interview for the site Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will be ideal never, but be used it должен right, which" is not "sufficing" with us, in my opinion, I/you/he commented the current situation of the Faeces.
A joint inspection of the Czech and German organs of control is granting the similar conclusions.
As the example of the wrong practice they are leading the approach of Peter of the non-hour to a so-called wvarc-system.
Recently the prime minister declared that GDP (the civil democratic party) will not worry the businessmen with the checks - this is leaving is prohibited or is allowed?
"There should somehow be established the law, and if it is suppressing something also the prime minister is not able to withstand the work of the institutions by which is being regarded as the duty to check and to attempt the fulfillment of the obligations" - states the Faeces.
On the session of the auditing committee in the Chamber of Deputies you talked about the joint project among the Czech and German sides within the framework of which the legislation about the state purchasings both of the countries was compared.
What was the talk specifically about?
Probably there is the parallel check which we began in a look, two years ago.
Simply said, speech about what the European legislation is reconfirming how the state purchasings have to turn out, a national legislation has then been following and then also an application is in practice.
The whole information was gathered is and, even under still the unfinished check, the interesting distinctions appeared simply said, legislation can be "precise and faultless", however we are inferior to Germany in the practice of application on some parameters.
It follows from this that it is insufficient to create the rules specified more and more, it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
And in fact can it help you like present project, which it means for you?
Namely such a joint control can bring in the deposit into some efforts on the stop of the detailed definition of laws, reduction and the improvement of restrictions because this does not lead to positive result.
The economy means the receipt of the appropriate thing in the rational one (but not always low) price, in order to avoid the enrichment and, it is possible, criminal behavior.
But not fact that we will attain this after reducing the restriction of the orders.
It is possible, this system will be overfilled "with the papers" so that those who will want to find the loopholes in the present system will much more easily find them than if the restriction did not come down.
You are talking about the inner problems of the practical application of the legislation about state purchasings.
And how is the system of control functioning in Germany?
Does such an organization exist as our KRU (department of check and auditing) there or does this work otherwise?
As for institutions, as ours Bundesrechnungshof organized according to our principle appears as KRU there, also the board which is working a little in another way exists, but mainly both of the institutions function analogously.
Moreover, a power before a certain degree is similar, but there are subdivisions of audit also at the level of the federal states in so far as Germany has a federal structure - their system is somewhat different in this from ours.
BRH can operate only the federal money, state resources are available to us.
The public funds in our regions and the municipal administrations are being checked at the level of the federal calculating chambers.
As for local legislation, is it simpler than with us there?
I would not want, at all, to compare without concrete data, but can take in some relationship Germany behind the model, but is impossible to say that it is better in all in a certain way.
This so, because they are better managing the control?
It no not no in a certain way, but I will repeat myself, I do not like the similar comparisons.
But it is necessary to say that even the model countries are coming up against many problems.
Otherwise, would they not receive any start from the cooperation with our office, right?
If to talk about an inner legislation, somehow as the corrections of Law on state purchasings affected your institution, do consequences appear?
Taking into consideration, that the legal power of these corrections is quite too short, it still by no means appeared in our work on control.
Since we are carrying out the control in actual fact, it is necessary to take some delay into consideration.
We are taking this into consideration only in the course of the preparation of the future checks - we began to use our new "discovery" instrument of the risk of wastefulness across which we drove almost 14000 state contracts away. We analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will appear, because the restrictions are changing, the conditions of some types of the tenders et cetera are changing.
As you are counting, will the assertion of this law bring the use or the additional burden on the system of the bureaucracy?
I think that this law is the strides in right direction, undoubtedly, and, I hope, this will be proved correct.
The problem which can arise is such, that the rules "will be stiffened" it will be impossible to observe also them.
The businesses on the functioning of the previous rules being checked are tied up with the supplier (for example, the regional functional programs are with a regional counsel) in just any inobservance of the law on state purchasings meaning the violation of the budgetary discipline.
Is it it in this way to stiffen the law worth in such a case?
I think, what not this way.
The system has to exclude those who want who to take away and who to abuse, but not to punish those, who are making the informality that does not influence a decision.
Such a system will only create the even greater pressure on bureaucracy.
AND then how we should withdraw from this situation?
Let's we will realize, which will not bring this way nowhere.
Recently the prime minister declared that GDP will not worry the businessmen with the checks of so-called wvarc-system. What does this mean?
Is "the Wvarc-system" suppressed or is resolved?
There should somehow be established the law, and if it is suppressing something also the prime minister is not able to withstand the work of the organs by which is being regarded as the duty to check and to attempt the fulfillment of the obligations.
One can say: "We will change this law and will resolve this", but is not allowed to say that we will pretend as if nothing is going on.
The law on state purchasings contains the quite strict rules as well as what should formally be conducted, and this is right. This will defend the state purchasings.
But, on the other hand, this is tragic when the candidate with the best proposal is disqualified only due to formal shortages.
The law will be ideal never, but be used it должен right, that, is not sufficing, with us in my opinion.
Slippery are expensive with places, but mainly is passable.
In some places for the Czech Republic freezing and snow-covered ones are expensive.
Mainly it is passable, but here and there with greater caution.
The Karlovarskiij edge
In the Karlovarskom edge the roads were passable this morning, but there are which froze and snow-covered ones here and there.

The snowfall in the region stopped, a small layer is only in the lowlands.
However on the mountain ranges of the Ore mountains are about 30 centimeters of snow.
From the information received from the regional road workers it became known that there was lower visibility due to a fog sometimes.
The high-speed highway R6 and the roads of first class in the region at present proxodimy without restrictions.
For example, however regard is necessary on the bridges, where the surface can be froz and slippery.
Also all the roads that belong to the second and third class, including the mountainous directions proxodimy.
But in some their areas rests of the snow freezing and worn out by the places are still.
Especially attentive should be in the roads located in some heights.
Pardubickiij and the Kralovegradeckiij edge
The department of the roads and the highways of the Czech Republic on its pages in internet is informing, that glazed frost is for some roads of the eastern Czech Republic in store, but he can in the mountainous roads and the roads located in some heights is the layer of snow worn out.

Especially the snow is in the roads of Krkonowe i Orlickix of the town.
The layer of snow worn out is in the roads, Rixnova-nad-Knezhnou put in heights in the districts and Trutnova.
There is variable cloudiness in the Eastern Czech Republic without the precipitation today.
The temperature normally varies in the limits from the minus three until the plus of one Celsius''s degree, the light wind.
The Pljzenskiij edge
The roads in the Pljzenskom edge this morning proxodimy, but sometimes it is necessary to observe caution also to adapt to weather.
In the morning it is frosty, the temperature is vibrating from three to nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and the following cooling in some places it can be slippery.
Sometimes the drivers can encounter a fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
Regional road workers provided the information.
The highway D5 now proxodimo practically without restrictions, however, road administrators are recommending to show caution with a kilometer among 80 and 131.
The majority of the roads of the first class has a surface dry and freezing to death.
Pljzni and Taxove can come across the areas which froze in the southern one.
The roads of second and third class damp, also in this case a warning in connection with the possibility of the appearance of the slippery areas also works.
The drivers have to be careful, especially on few the roads in the district Wumavy being used.
The Olomouckiij edge
The drivers who are going on the heights of the Olomouckogo edge have to take snow porridge into consideration in the road today.
It remained after the application of chemicals in the Chervenogorskom saddle and in the road in direction Videljskogo Krwizha.
At night the snowfall forced the road workers to go the outside, according to information from the department of the roads, in Wumperke about three centimeters of snow fell.
In other districts of the edge of the road is passable without restrictions, as a rule.
"Rests of the snow are in some heights Wumperka.
The drivers that is going to the side Esenika must mean the presence of the snow porridge of the Chervenogorskom saddle", CHIANG announced today (the Czech Agency of the News) the air-traffic controller of the wumperkskogo department of the roads.
At night also their co-workers set out for the clearing of the roads from Esenika, they swore that the roads stayed bare and wet in some heights after the processing with the chemicals.
In Olomouce of road is passable without restrictions, but in Wternberke the drivers have to be considerate in the forest areas, where dampness has still been kept.

According to information from the data base of the police, apart from some places with glazed frost or the snow which fell, the mountainous road in area from Teljnice is shut to Klinice v Usteckom the edge.
Also the temperature is staying negative in the lowlands, therefore in the roads the snow is kept and ice. In the lowland, especially to the southeast, conversely, it no not no any problems from Czech Srednegorjya, mainly the roads are dry ones.
Some complications are not being announced in the roads yet.
The road workers are announcing the appearance of glazed frost in neighborhoods Wteti.
According to the meteorologists, for his education the ideal conditions were created by the night - the whole day it rained and a snow melted, at night the sky cleared up and the night frost began.
Unfavorable conditions are being announced in the main highways and on the direction of I/13 on the border Usteckogo and the Libereckogo edge.
Due to the branches of the trees which are concerning road itself bent under the layer of snow they had to close the road to Telnice on Kninice.
Shimon Ornest: At the concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
That you think about that, that is smaller that in a month the end of the world has to occur?
This vsego-liwj is one of a lot of alarming news on which we, people are, we are caught so easily.
Together with a group The Tap Tap we constantly joke on this topic and we say that we are the only group in the peace which will be able to gather sufficiently positive energy in order to extend or to avert end of the world.
Furthermore, in December you are preparing to give the absolutely unique ones three concerts against end of the world.
Could you tell the readers about this in a more detailed way?
The talk is about the national measure for collection of the resources which we have been planning for already two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential which a calendar Maijya possesses against the end of which 21st December are declared into 11:10.
In a day before this event, the 20th December into 21:00 three concerts parallelly start in Prague, Brno and Ostrave.
They will end roughly speaking, at that moment when on the island the May calendar will be ended with Kiribati in the Pacific the time zone of which is 12 p.m. earlier than with us.
Who got this idea of head?
This was originally my idea, we further made everyone up together with our artist Gonzoij Augustoij.
Not to mention that we want to accumulate it is for the positive energy enough also to avert end of the world, we also want to think together with public about the fact in what state we will pass on this peace to our children once.
Because of the ending of the May calendar we created the unique collection of objects from shoes, the T-shirts, the bags and original klyuchikov against end of the world. One can buy these things on the site www.e-tap.cz and in this way at the same time show us support.
The group The Tap Tap also carried out the anthem against end of the world together with other musicians, which is called "End of the world is canceled".
It will already really sound polyubivwiijsya the listeners YouTube the anthem at these benefit concerts?
Final, at end itself, if as a result everything will come out and will not occur end of the world.
All the executors will begin to will sing it at all the concerts simultaneously.
The anthems zazvuchat television also in the direct ether of the Czech simultaneously.
I/you/he wrote the words to this song and Tomaw Ganak played Jesus' role in clip, he is also participating in the implementation X Xindl...
How did you begin to cooperate with them?
We are also cooperating with other personas of Czech cultural life in so far as we are organizing many charity measures and concerts.
We are trying actively to connect them to these projects.
Which likes because of many things we and to work turned up, to them is interesting.
What will the gain from concert against end of the world go to?
We are so working with civil association Tap for the purchase of the equipment the sixth year in an institute Edlichki for the bezbarjernogo educational center STUDEO, already.
The lecturers regularly visit the students of the schools of the institute Edlichki and are organizing cheerful and interesting measures with them.
Students themselves do not have any resources so that to set out to the lecturers, and we are trying in this way to grant them this possibility.
Within the framework of the project of the additional construction of the institute Edlichki in future the building to which we will move with this project will arise separately.
A few bands and executors will appear at every concert.
Were the criteria of selection?
We were trying to put together the program which will interest all the generations, including the children.
For example, in Prague Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere s Danom Barta, The Tap Tap, Marjyan Bango and Irzhi Suxi will appear.
One can hear about all the components on the site www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning some similar "grandiose measures" in future?
In May we will appear on the "Prague spring" festival and here for the first time, of course, we will prepare the interesting program with the interesting guests.
In the next year we would have conducted the presentation with pleasure in the Czech national house in New York, but I personally, the grass snake if we will be in the USA, I/you/he would want to appear in Washington and Chicago really.
About the foreign country you have serious plans, you have already appeared in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The group The Tap Tap is a group of the people with the limited possibilities.
How are you managing the road from the point of view of organization and logistics??
This not so terribly as apparently at first.
With us five participants on the electric wheelchairs, their carriages must travel in the luggage compartment, plus to all is the large number of load and boxes with instruments.
Nevertheless, they have been managing this without problems yet. The Czech airlines ČSA and British Airways British airlines have always been prepared excellently for us, which astonished me skoljko raz.
Even in Moscow, from where we returned recently, everything was going on without problems.
Thanks to exits abroad you can compare different countries from the point of view of accessibility, the relationship of the public to the invalids et cetera.
What were you encountering by present moment?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where everything is functioning better than with us, in Russia we became the witnesses of what there is still in the east at the basic level.
There are very many barriers in comparison with Prague in Moscow, and an independent movement of the person has here still been coming into the rarity on the electric wheelchair downtown.
There are not such banal things also in development, as the road to be made for the invalid in the elevator.
Fortunately, the public organizations which are trying to turn the people's attention to the people's problems with the limited possibilities arise also there already.
And in what, conversely, do we constantly have to catch up with the advanced countries?
There are very many things the level of the implementation of which is distant it behind.
But you importantly have to specify that an improvement and an improvement of situation have always depended from those people's efforts who this is concerning.
In London and Madrid it is completely normal that the people are independently moving with the heavy form of invalidity in the streets, they can go into the toilet, to the museum, yes where it is pleasing...
There not really that is not spread, that they are receiving the large number of the people with the limited possibilities the active participation in public life, we are surpassing The Tap Tap and it in this some!
The respect of the public or bezbarjernostj are one thing, but will begin to change always and really at the moment when among us the well known athletes, the artists, the actors, the politicians or the jurists will appear at that time.
These have been individual cases - the people with the strong will yet.
The group The Tap Tap is really popular at present, but we will return for two years ago, that in 1998 forced you to organize it?
I entered the institute Edlichki as the educator, many young people who wanted to begin something were around me.
BUT in so far as I myself the musician and I am playing including the saxophone, an interesting musical circle organized that together with the co-worker.
Is of course, and with time as our leading Ladya Angelovich is speaking emerged this a little from under the control (he is laughing).
After all did popularity come only in the last years, or am I hobbling something?
This is the truth, that helped us, that we began to join the famous singers and actively work on the propaganda of a group.
We came to a conclusion, what the work which no one can appreciate in essence as if it does not exist.
Thanks to the resources of the European Union we can allow ourselves qualified lecturers, an equipment et cetera.
Were you faced with the goal to untwist The Tap Tap so well?
From the outset I have felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.
In Show Business is full of things, imitating to another one.
This is logical, all new one is being taken with caution, and this has lasted for a long time.
Very few rare things exist, but I will take the liberty of saying that Tap Tap is one of them.
Of course, the first impression with the person who sees us is compassion, this is natural...
But this compassion is absolutely excessive because the people with the limited possibilities are not some personalities being damaged and всеми given up which we have to spare.
They are people who can live for full-fledged life and develop, final, provided they possess the necessary resources only.
I am speaking, what if with the people with invalidity something turns out, this the shift not only for them, but also for all the society.
Provided success that you are a severe leader what many people consider you?
If we want to do work qualitatively, we have to be uncompromising in many things and to hold a certain discipline.
But I think that this is normal.
Some people are coming to us with romantic presentation and are flying in the clouds, but when they will hear about two times a week their having to go by the rehearsal, to visit preparatory courses and to spend much time on the way they are losing enthusiasm very fast.
But so it is occurring in just any group which wants to work and to attain something.
At present numbering a group The Tap Tap is twenty people.
How many their were at beginning in 1998?
Only one Agree Angelovich.
We an open group, the people are coming and are leaving, it is impossible to avert this.
Our doors are always for those who have wish and a will power are opened.
It will take place in a day before the end of the world to be expected, on Thursday 20.12.2012 v 21.00.
The concert will take place, to Brno - in the club Fléda and Ostrave - in the center Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and the other musicians of the Czech Republic, in Prague on the stadium Incheba.
In the completion of concert all three towns are being joined into the moment of the singing of the song of a group The Tap Tap by the telebridge "End of the world is canceled".
The goal of the present project is to gather the financial resources of a volume of 25 million crowns on the purchasing of the multifunctional bezbarjernogo equipment for the educational center to STUDEO attached to the institute Edlichki in Prague.
The ticket for concert costs 400 crowns, for the children up to 12 years the entrance is a free one. One can buy the tickets in Bohemiaticket beforehand.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week on the session of the ministers of the European cosmic Poland agency was received by the twentieth member of European cosmic agency like the second country of an eastern block being from the countries (after the Czech Republic which became a full member EKA on September 12, 2008).
Poland began the narrow cooperation from EKA in 1994 and has taken on the active part in the series of the projects of the agency for following years.
But Poland began the way to the cosmos a lot earlier.
The Polish enthusiasts have still before the Second World War been dealing with the flights to the cosmos, but this has always not met with an understanding.
I will remind, to example, about the lecture of the A. Wternfeljda who presented on December 6, 1933 in the astronomic Warsaw observatory of the idea from his innovative work "Introduction to aeronautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (1905 g.r) they left an auditory indifferent, after a few years Wternfeljd remembered, what was interested only the doctor the Yang Gadomskiij in his work.
In 1934 in France Wternfeljd won the prize of Robert Ehsno-Peljtri and Andrew Luisa Xirwa for "introduction to aeronautics".
The doctor is the Yang of Gadomskiij (1899 - 1966) which people were talking about above, later became the great propagandist of astronomy and aeronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote the row of the books dedicated to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskiij became the well known world propagandist of the aeronautics, and his deposit was appreciated by one of the craters being named on the reverse side of the Moon in his honor among them.
The railway trolley, equipped the rocket engine, had already in 1925 in Poland been built.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, or the details of the project.
Even is not clear, the rocket was expected to be used for a run or for the braking of the trolley.
The information about this trolley is well known only from the press of that epoch.
Since 1933 the Polish artillery began to be thoughtful about the rocket arms.
I/you/she carried out the research the Section of the technique of the armament on the cooperation with the professors by Mechislavom Voljfke and by Gustavom Mokzhickim.
It is obvious from the materials which remained that the researches reached the stage of the practical tests.
But with the coming of the German troops the work was interrupted.
In 1937 in the specialized press the idea of the photoelectric rocket fighter plane which engineer Rogozinskiij offered appeared also in the next year left work "Air rocket torpedo and aircraft rocket bomb" of the author Lelivy-Kzhivoblockogo.
Both of the projects were developed for the war use of the rocket engines.
Before war itself the Temporary scientific-consultative committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) which coordinated the whole work dealt with all the projects of the war use of the rocketry.
The committee was created in 1937, but after two years of its activity the work ended due to the beginning of war.
The next scientific work dedicated to the aeronautics appeared in the Polish press after war, thanks to the work of the Polish of the society of the aeronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
A society is being mentioned for the first time in the November number of 1954 of magazine of "problem" in which four volumetric articles about aeronautics are being published.
In one of them the professor is the M. Subotovich offered to organize the society which will be engaged in aeronautics.
At that time already the revolutions gathered the projects of the artificial satellites, and it was clear that the cosmic researches are the prospective branch.
Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish society of the aeronautics (POA) has tried to enter the international federation of aeronautics (founded in 1951), and POA already became her full member in autumn.
And in the next year first chairperson POA Kazimezh Zarankevich (1902 - 1959) became the vice-chair of the International federation of aeronautics.
On this post it stayed before his death which began in 1959.
Since 1956 POA has brought in the considerable contribution to the development of the extremely successful meteorological rocket of RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) which became the first Polish rocket which fulfilled the research.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first startup took place on October 10, 1958.
Rocket, capable of overcoming the distance of 1800 m, was in length about 80 cm, and her weight was less than 5 kg.
The improved version RM-1A was subsequently formed, and the tests of the two-stage rocket RM-2 were carried out in the summer of 1959 on the Bledovskom wasteland.
This rocket was in length about 1.4 m, and her weight was about 11.5 kg.
The following version of the rocket has been already to do present scientific work in the state - the rocket RM-34 could overcome 14.5 km, and an observation of the high-level wind was her job.
But in 1962 the further development was stopped.
A rocket Meteor-1 worked out in the period between 1962 and 1965 became the heiress of first rockets of the type RM.
The rocket was conceived like the two-stage one, her common length was 510 cm, and the initial weight is 32.5 kg.
Three types were worked out (designated as Метеор-1A -1V and -1S), which differed with the size of the camera tube for the scientific equipment.
A space with a volume of 0.4 l was available to the rocket Метеор-1A, Метеор-1V is 0.34 l, and Метеор-1S is 0,62l.
All three types had the maximum flight range 37 km.
In the period between 1965 and 1968 at the Aircraft institute a development of the rocket Meteor-2 was going on, and her first flight tests began in October 1970.
The rocket Meteor-2 with the starting weight of 380 kg was capable of taking the payload with a weight of 10 kg on a height of about 60 km.
Then the versions Метеор-2N and a Meteor were formed-3.
It is it also to mention the entry of Poland in KOSPAR (the committee on cosmic researches) in 1960 and the creation of the national committee worth KOSPAR two years later.
Moreover, within the framework of program Interkosmos, Poland participated in the researches of the outer space on the Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Germawevskiij became second interkosmonavtom after Vladimir Remeka.
The abrogation of the law on public relations is not not the solution to the problem.
Last week the constitutional court annulled the law on public relations.
The decree caused the lively discussion in society.
Is without a doubt, it will be interesting to look at some present problems from wider point of view.
The economic liberal-oriented systems in the EU, also like also in the globalizovannom peace is based on the principle of the plural, nonadjustable economic competition.
In essence this means that separate economic subdivisions, national economic systems, are with each other in a constant conflict.
This is connected to the principle of the free trade and free, nothing together with unbridled financial speculation by the not limited movement of private capital.
As a result of considerable difference in the cost of the workforce (wage) the price effort arises.
It is necessary by this idea to understand the state with goal to take away himself the big part of the market and, in this way, to increase its own income when the producer by means of the delivery of the cheap product is trying to stand in economic competition to those which "is knocking" the competitor's cost down.
On mass scale this means either the transfer of the production abroad, or the cheap purchasings abroad or disappearance for the majority of the businessmen. As a result the unemployment in those is being improved in the countries, where a cost of the workforce is, in comparison with the other ones, high.
In so far as the private capital is not bearing any social responsibility, among them also for the unemployment which was made for them, the inevitable expenses of the state for social needs grow.
As a whole, the situation strengthens the businessmen's misters' reluctance to pay taxes and in this way to compensate for a public economic and the social damage that is caused by them in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to list the concrete statistical data.
The brusque methods of the quotient create the capital at the level of the economies of separate states of situation when the governments of the countries have to enter a competition with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their population with the aim of attraction to the country of foreign capital.
In other words, the governments are giving their own population to private capital to arbitrariness, despite social decline.
This finds its reflection above all in the changes of the current legislation.
It is goal economically to force its people to yield to the dictate of private capital, above all in the field of the wage.
This works like the system of the economic force in the event of long unemployment and serves as an instrument of cutting down of the workers' rights in the sphere of labor legislation at the same time.
As a result the level of poverty is improving, but at the same time also difference among poor and rich.
IN THE FRG already a few years exists the public dispensation of the products the poor ones which are not in the state to feed himself its own work.
The quantity of these people has already approached a million.
Within the framework of the rise in the competitiveness of the German economy the cases are constantly going on, when the people placed in a job are receiving such wages that the state has to pay them the remainder so that they would receive the bare subsistence level.
The similar scandal became well known public and in the event of the additional workers of Bundestag.
The economic measures practically in all the southern states of the EU, is without a doubt, they are leading to the same state, in which the people that are under the pressure of the catastrophic fall of the social status have to emigrate either as this was in the 19th century, or to exist on the starvation wages in the backyard of the society in the hope that sometime to the country the private investment capital will come.
However is the question arising from where it will have?
If the capital will arrive from other countries of the EU, that is poverty to move from one country into another, or it will not come at all, so how the Chinese, indus, the Brazilian, the Turk, the Moroccan, the Egyptian, the African has still been working for the share of European wage.
This is concerning the whole Latin America.
The liberal theory and the mass media before the nausea assert that the state is not able to participate in the capital of its own economy, which the controlled economy is leading to an economic disaster.
He is stubbornly drawing the private capital on the state not should be added to the economy by action administrators.
Then it should answer the question whether the private capital does not work conducting policy and that now practically very integers the state, in its own egoistic goals?
Unambiguous answer - yes.
An existence of the practically vsemoguqix and omnipresent lobbies is proof in all the states.
As result we have the perpetual situation showing in corruption, the securing of the mutual advantages, in a legislation where everything is deserving punishments practically, however it is not crime.
IN THE FRG the situation is such, that the state ministries due to the shortage of the financial resources are entrusting the development of the bills to the private legal firms which are densely connected to an industry.
Then Bundestag is confirming these bills.
All the authority is coming not from people, as the constitution of the western type says, but from the financial-powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that the liberal-oriented democracy is lying in such a situation fast now as this is described the Appianom one in the work "Crisis of the Roman empire during Caesar's days and Pompeya": "The state has been breaking up for a long time, and the departments are dealing with violence.
The bribes, the illegal receipt of the favors with the help of the stones and the swords.
Bribery and corruption throve without all bans, and the people went to some elections with sold beforehand people golosom""...poryadochnye in general did not run on the sovereign's post, finally the state for eight months lost the consul once".. .. They seriously began to talk about that, that autocracy and a necessity of choice are the only rescue in this terrible situation hustler".. Appian thought that this will be Pompeij, but Caesar who changed democracy by autocracy in a final way became it.
As well as anciently, in modern society their own reckless interests without account-taking of the public interests predominate.
The private capital has not been intended for the application in public goals anymore according to its essence.
The present result is not different from a past: the unprecedented decline of the elite without some effort to conduct the reforms of the deeper character.
Means the cause of the beginnings fascist and we have had to look for the communist regimes in the reckless liberalization of the economic systems of 19 and 20 centuries.
Currently one can perceive the absence of these regimes and the existence of the democracy of the liberal type as a certain break after which the next round is being expected.
It is above all tragic that that the present elite is ignoring the consequences of hundreds of thousands of victims completely in future, humanitarian and social catastrophes together with crimes against humanity which we are watching already now, as we know this from old and new history.
The abrogation of the law on public relations is not decision or, at least, not for ever.
Under the pressure of the competition as on the international one, simply at the national and European levels the government of the Czech Republic will have to continue to look for the ways for the further reduction of social level of the population.
In this way the present tendency has the system character.
Political and social goal reforms which will allow strengthening the rate of the state in the economy are decision, the citizens' role in management of the state will strengthen and an exclusive position of the quotient will weaken the capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: The laboratory of chaos.
"Nothing will withdraw from a violence, and never can leave is Sting, song "Fragile", where words are the main verse of the refrain: "we do not forget what we are fragile".
"If my sons did not want wars, there would not "be" they" - dying Gutelj Wnaper, the wife Meera Amwela Rotwiljda.
The last wave of violence caused the mass of the responses among Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual.
One are in favor of Israel, argu his position that it has the right to self-defense, and the Palestinians appear in the terrorists' role, the other ones support Palestinians argu this with the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide, be carried out above the Palestinian Arabs, but the role of the terrorist state is being attributed to the state of Israel.
I do not want to contemplate about the which in these waves of murders periodically repeating themselves a criminal is but who a victim is, finally, the today's citizens of Israel, including the self-controlled territories, were born on the moment of the current political situation, and no beginning of violence was witnesses.
My goal is to offer the readers this to look into the curtain, to look at that, who they are serving above all the effort having lasted already 95 years (counting from signature Declaration Baljfura is in November 1917) on the small plot of land of the Middle East.
Some my reasonings are reinforced by the historic facts, several things are taken out of them according to their my own understanding of that who or what group of the people are the main engine of the events of the modern history.
History of the mankind is history of the struggle for authority above all.
We can find the same Alexander Velikogo or Napoleon in every epoch.
That it is not so clear: these people have absolutely independently always undertaken their steps, or somebody was behind their throne, who directed their actions to beforehand planned targets.
Should admit that they live we in the hands of a few persons in the period, after the world fortune is concentrated, and that he could not occur this concentration of money and authority that is resulting from them in life of one generation.
Among astronomically rich families one who could be looked at like the head of octopus (I do not know whether somebody is above them, but this is not excluded) is standing out - Rotwiljdy.
They are not writing about them a lot.
Of course.
They have already in the nineties of the 19th centuries bought the first agency of the news (Reijters), in order to stop rumors more connecting their name to the criminal actions in the highest spheres in the shade of which there being they, and which always leading to the strengthening of their authority, the increase of the fortune or simultaneously both to a volume and to another.
There is the big share holding hardly in all the central banks of the peace, and against the countries with them, in whose central banks their share is not available to them, they are leading or are preparing war (before the invasion of Afghanistan 7 countries were all, after invasion of Iraq 5 countries began, after the overthrow Kaddafi only four remained, however at the same time the Russian government took the central bank of its country into its hands).
Any, who tried to oppose this family, died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to keep the status of the central bank behind Rotwiljdovskim Bank of America, during the civil war it began to let his own out (understand are governmental) the money and was killed in 1865 in the theater.
The John F. Kennedi began to issue his own money and wanted to reverse FED (the Federal Reserve), was killed in 1963. Deputy Luis Makfadden was poisoned in 1936 after how I/you/he wanted to take FED for the unbundling of the Great depression to the court in 1929.
Their thirst of the world authority in the period from 1859 for 1871 led to the development of the plan of three world wars, the 33rd level that was created by the great Freemason Albert Ration.
A destruction of the monarchic states was the task of first war in Europe, the second had to abolish the colonial supremacy, especially Great Britain, but the third has to lead to the reduction of the world population about to 0,5-1 of a billion people (such a quantity of the slaves will be for the securing of their comfort and luxury enough, and they will not use many resources), the creation of the single universal religion (ecumenicity is not able to be another anything besides as prerequisite to such a project) also the final capture of the absolute authority.
Method, with the help of which a group of the richest families is working at the head from Rotwiljdami, a call of crisis and a following proposal of the decisions (order ab chao - order from chaos) are.
But these decisions are false and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (watch the basis for FED which had to avert the repetition of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
In this way, after they had managed to unleash the First World War by means of the murder of the gabsburgskogo heir of Ferdinanda avstro-vengerskogo throne to Sarajevo, they destroyed czarist Russia after beginning bolshevist revolyuciiyu.
The First World War ended in sudden, unfounded in military and economic relationship the capitulation of Germany (there has been anymore no necessity of war for the destruction of czarist Russia) and as consequence, a comminution of the Central European power, Austria-Hungary occurred.
For the relief of the Second World War's unbundling the bankers and the politicians created the latent clash situation after laying the huge war reparations on Germany which they created the prerequisite to the radicalization the masses which grew poor, then Germans of sufficiently strong, blaming culprits and an offerer had to throw only the Chieftain's simple decisions, then to create multinational Czechoslovakia with strong German the minority which had to play and really played a function of fifth column, on the kindling of the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century Rotwiljdy they provoked the reason of the Zionist movement one branch of which strove to create the Jewish state, Iudei with Jerusalem as his capital (the return in Sion) is desirable in historic field.
The aforementioned declaration Baljfura created the prerequisite to the mass immigration of the Jews to Palestine, the first clashes with local Arabic population began to go on.
The terrorist attacks happened from both of the sides.
The Second World War blazed up, appraising whether Hitler broke out of the chains which the bankers, or everything originally held it in which he did was planned in a difficult way, the sufferings of the European Jews created the prerequisites to acknowledgment of the Jewish state with the world association in the concentration camps at any rate.
Israel was founded officially in 1948 and, in the same way as Germany was provoked by the war reparations on 2 world war, the State of Israel was proclaimed so that to create the seat of third war.
If the international bankers will manage to loosen it, Jewish people, like also in the Second World War will become the victim of the combat operations in front line, now already together with the Arabic or, simply said, the Moslem population of the Middle East.
Israel is practically a gigantic laboratory, the source of discord and chaos not only inside the country, but also at the international level (to take only the sharp separation of the people on the supporters and the opponents of Israel).
Who is guilty, and who is a victim in Palestine-Israeli conflict, where insult generates insult in the endless chain of violence if everything began with the greed of the individuals and their striving for world authority?
It is necessary here to distinguish the average people of Israel from their leaders, because as well as with us, the international bankers are shoving their exceptionally own candidates to the people for vote on elections.
The present prime minister of Israel Netanyahu's hawk is typical example will будет fascist, loyal the international bankers a politician, did everything to begin the war against Iran which, is thanks to the membership of Iran in the Shanghai organization of the cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), to threaten to develop into a world conflict, and taking into consideration the control of Iran over the strait Ormuzskim, all 20 containing% of the world reserves of mineral oil (the navigable corridor is only 2 miles the width): it will also lead to the destruction of world economy.
In what light do the words said by David Rokfellerom in 1994 appear now: "All that we need common crisis, and people will take on the new world order".
The new world order in their presentation is the peace of the misters and the slaves.
Peace, where the remaining part of the human population is serving a handful of the financial aristocracy that is enjoying comfort.
The target, where every organism on the birth which was born implant the chip with which it is becoming the essence that is under the total control.
"And it is forcing all small and big, rich and needy, free also the slaves to have on the right arm or on forehead the stamp could not, so so that the person, which is not marked with the name of that animal, or the number of his name, neither buy nor sell.
Here in what is the wisdom: every, who have reason, the number of the wild animal can calculate.
Because it corresponds to human name, and this number is six hundred and sixty-six.
Film is "Argo's" operation: When is worse nowhere, summon Hollywood
In November 1979, the crowd of the Islamist students-demonstrator captured the embassy of the USA in Tehran and 52 accepted the diplomat as hostage.
They must have been liberated in exchange for overthrown check Moxammeda Rezy Пехлеви running after the revolution in the USA which have been a protector of his regime for decades.
For the administration of the USA the positive issue of situation was not supposed - it could not allow herself to throw out the check overboard because this could undermine the allies' trust in the root in other countries.
It was not able however to attain the hostages' liberation in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of the theocratic regime.
This was a blow to prestige of the United States which was strengthened later by the unsuccessful attempt to liberate the hostages by force.
The concluded diplomats were liberated in a final way 444 days later, after the negotiations on the intervention of the government of Algeria.
Their fate caused the wave of solidarity and anti--Iranian moods at home.
The defeat contributed to defeat Kartera Dzhimmi to a considerable degree in Iran on the presidential elections of 1980, finishing up with the election of Ronaljda Reijgana.
Film, an actor Benom srezhessirovannyij Afflekom "Argo's" operation describes one of the episodes of that history who brought small victories to America.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy six workers managed to run.
After complicated peripetias they finished their road to the residences of the embassy of Canada.
The CIA in the cooperation with Canadian authorities managed to take them from Iran, at the same time an extravagant legend of the shelter helped according to which they left on the Canadian passports as the members of film crew seeking the place for the surveys of the science fiction epic in the country.
The combination of genres
The plan which the "evacuation" of Tony Mendes expert invented required the cooperation of Hollywood.
That the legend was reliable, people were writing in the specialized magazines about film draft, the press conferences were being arranged, the fictional industrial company had a real office.
Details have been held to the operation in a secret for a long time, film, are based on Tony Mendesa memoirs.
The film Affleka is a particular combination of a few genres.
On the one hand, the real political thriller, so-called "film-kinoopus" history of successful venture, affair is a series of the films about the friends Ouwena can be example.
Moods are constantly changing in a film - on the one hand, the conceived scenes are documentarily from Tehran (some captions are shown in the historic sign photographs of events and that how the same situations were shown in a film is the significant distinctions in this are not here).
On the other hand, the голливудские eased excerpts that are intersecting with irony and moderate overstatement.
BUT is with the sweat of the scene from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions still the men in the suits are discussing the situation behind the negotiating tables, on the stairs of the institutions, on the telephone...
Benu Affleku managed to do the реstart of career fabulously.
Of the vysmeyannogo actor I/you/he became a distinguished director, and his game stopped being the object of ridicules.
"His "Argo's" operation is the third full-length film, after the dark detective, detka, "forgive forgive" (2007) also the thriller "Town" (2010).
At the same time this is the first film of Affleka who is not acting in the director's home town - Boston.
At the same time the feeling of atmosphere of the place belongs to the qualities which raised the director's earlier films above голливудским standard.
Also Afflek is showing this in "Argo", where Canada "is playing" Tehran.
The better scenes occur in a film in the streets, on the reconstruction of the real events - they are impressing the incoming scenes of the fall of the embassy with their clarity which also passes on the emotions of muddle and nepredvidennosti which arise when history is somewhere suddenly changing.
The co-workers are attaining a similar effect of Afflek and it in scenes fictional (the counterfeit headquarters on the Tehran market).
Too Many processes are in too many places.
The director should deal with povestvovanie not supposing the mass of the moving scenes of the cinematographic importance.
It is quite successfully working with this little, sometimes something dodumyvaet - there all this is leaving not so elegantly (the scene in which the telephone bell is averting the approaching crisis in America in the airport of Tehran, and the pursuit on the runway look quite nadumanno).
A distraction connected to the necessity to show too many events in too many places is "Argo's" shortage.
Alan Arkin and the John Gudman in the role of the голливудских co-workers are really really charming, however their personages would deserve a greater space, and they are by no means only in film.
Film Affleka does not suffice a little drama, this the film which one can watch with moderate interest appreciating the organization and the retro style that recreates the thrillers of seventieth.
But it moves with difficulty.
However, this is for reminding of one enough, still in the certain sense of lively history, as well as for the evidence of the that, as the conceptions about vsemoguqix and omniscient special services are exaggerated.
I/you/she governed naduvaniya of balloons, bananas and a circus
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, is a leading polling about the most absurd bank fees annually, now the contest for "the most absurd decree or the project from the workshop of the EU" decided to declare.
"Spodviglo us to this" the organizer of the questionnaire Patrik Nager declared "Right" the last event in which the EC is planning on taking the 40-percent quota for the women of the European companies, big in the administration."
There is a recent decision of the European Court of Justice on the unification of the rate of the insurance premiums for the men and the women among absurdnosteij already had put forward on the nomination.
Up to now the women had the benefits for life assurance because for insurance companies they are objectively less prone to risk.
"The people can put forward the further improbable ideas on a contest from the EC workshop until the end of this year.
Himself the vote will go February 2013, until the end", said Nager.
For example, also the obligatory addition of the biocomponents into fuel belongs to some controversial disposals of the EU, that as a result the relatively small quantity of hazardous substances, or the guideline are bringing the harm to nature, as well as the ban on the use of the reliable mercuric thermometers because they contain only about the size of the cage for the chickens, as a result in this year the eggs went up substantially.
Also the actual ban on the use of the "sandwich butter" term or the withdrawal from the sale of the classical lamps were exposed to the critique.
The qualitative bananas have to be the length of 14 centimeters.
A European apparatus pronounces the judgement under the pressure of some trade or industrial lobby often, the positions of which are normally defending in Brussels some state or a group of the states (in this way the Czech Republic is asserting the demands of its banks even under threat to veta now).
The interests of the lobby are such: for example, the bananas of highest quality had to reach the length of 14 cm in the European Union and did not dare to show "the anomalous curvature".
At the same time the European Commission proved correct with what is only harmonizing the isolated national existing rules which complicated commerce.
Nevertheless the EC softened, despite the resistance of some states, the standards concerning fruits and vegetables referring to the existing guidelines leading to the dissipation of the products.
Also a previous year's decree of the EC according to which the selling air balls have to be equipped with warning about that certainly becomes can a candidate for win in the polling that the children are not able to be younger than eight years to blow them without the adults' care up.
The EC turned to the American researches in accordance with which the air balls are potential cause of the death of the children by means of the asthma on game.
The similar restriction is concerning the children now up to 14 years by which blowing dudelki into the ones market is prohibited.
The funny ideas are born also at home
It is sufficiently absurd and the rule that is touching themselves on European officials: every, who has some official post in the EU, can not, taking into consideration the tact of the topic for Greece, a name of Macedonia has to use, and "BYuRM" (former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia) to speak instead of this.
The portal Bankovnípoplatky.com is (Laissez Faire) in the cooperation with the unification of the "principle's of non-intervention's" liberal economists, for example, the EC about the volume of food reserves offered the rule for the territories of the membership state for vote, apart from a few above the absurd named rules.
The EC established the maximum extent of the reserves of the food which can be in the territory of the Czech Republic for a day of her entry into the European Union.
The Czech Republic subsequently exceeded, for example, the established volumes of the preserved mushrooms, for that a big penalty was for her in store.
Both the idea to pay to some countries behind their not having any sea and the idea of the granting of the subsidies to statement about the receipt of subsidies also interested the organizers of the questionnaire.
But these ideas arose in Prague, and not in Brussels.
"We are in handicap because we do not have any sea.
We will ask the European Union for the compensation", declared the then minister of the agriculture Jaroslav the Carpet (ChSDP) in autumn of 2004.
As an argument it pointed out that there was high grain harvest in the country, and as a result of so-called intervention purchasings the state had the full stockrooms of the reserves which was necessary to remove.
Behind the Czech Republic being located far from the ports, the EU I/you/he had to pay us hundreds of millions according to the Carpet, in a euro.
As a result the European commission went towards a Czech Republic after organizing the tender on the purchasing of the grain from the countries which do not have the exit to the sea.
Offered the subsidies for the receipt of subsidy the villages the Ministry on regional development being governed by minister Paul the German (US-DEU) they had to go to the composition of the statement about subsidies into details, such subsidies from Brussels.
EU: The quaint orders are exception
Although the decrees are becoming the object of critique, the effort of the EC on control, as well as on more effective functioning and the European Union's development, according to many experts in member states easily, the acknowledgments rather deserve.
Deriving of the grants of the EC for projects which do not have even the allusion on something in common with the cavity of the European integration is serious problem, according to the experts, however which member states achieved on the discussion of the budget.
It is causing the emotions among the Czechs and that, what like also in the European Union's other countries the Czech Republic has to fight in Brussels for right to specific identification of its traditional products and it has always not won in this competition.
Although the Czechs kept the designation after six years of the battles with the Germans and the Austrians " Olomouckie syrki", however " Tuzemskiij rum", the traditions of which are going in our country the roots into 19 eyelids, our producers had to rename on "Tuzemak".
Only the products can be called rum of reed distillate, and not from the sugar beet.
For example, in the official list of the registered EC products, together with the world-famous one karlovarskie crackers, a pogorzhelickiij and trwebonjskiij carp and a zhateckiij hop have turned out the cheeses of "feta" and "gorgondzola", the marzipan of German Lyubeka or parmskoij ham, already.
Also can be proud with the trade mark of the EU the pardubickiij gingerbread cookie and the gorzhickie small tubes.
The people want, that I protected a republic, but am a lover, is asserting Okamura.
Senator mister, it is coming as the person of head to run to the president's post?
I do not think about that, in order him to become a senator or a president.
If in our country everything functioned without problems, I would not run nowhere.
But I have not been able to look anymore as in the last 20 years the country is being robbed, as here the thieves are bustling about, they are improving the people taxes and retirement age.
With me was not to be a politician ambitions.
But when I see something, which I do not like, I am trying to find the solution how to change this.
BUT in so far as I was already forty years old and am an independent person that does not belong to any party, do not have another opportunity to influence some things, besides how we should run on the post of the senator or the president.
You wound up in the Senate, but soon set out into the presidential castle.
Are you not turning in this way not facing the people who chose you?
I have said that I will include myself in the fight for the presidential castle depending on election result to the Senate always.
I later specified, will be chosen what if the senator, I will run for the president.
A post, a post are not my goal - this is an instrument with the help of which I can carry out my views.
Therefore the largest influence and a widest power are necessary for me.
But difficulty not only in our being grumbling as nation with ourselves in the bar or near the television but at the same time are ready to crush whole, who will try to change something.
This is increased by the mass media which are blackening the person, and which are mixing freedom of speech up with the freedom of the lie.
For example, they talked about me, that I am giving the journalists the bribes, or that I was adviser Irzhi Paroubeka.
We will go to your views.
You began the fight for the presidential castle with theses about the politicians' financial and criminal responsibility and about opposite property declarations about the amount above twenty million.
In order to carry out this, it is necessary to change the law.
You as president do not have any such power, and only the whole senate can offer the laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I lobbied that that the carrying out of excursions became free business, this as citizen managed to move.
The problem is being concluded in politicking - when somebody is arriving with good proposal on the left or on the right, they are intentionally repairing the obstacles for him, and this holds back citizens.
As independent independent person I have the much greater potential for the receipt of the support from all the parliamentary parties.
My advantage in that, that I am without party putting away on polochkam, I can take what is best for our country from every party without looking back on dogmas also to use this.
You consider yourself to be a person, belonging more to right or to left?
From Czech point of view it seems to me, that the people are rather taking me to left.
For me at all is not important - a little to the left or a little to the right.
It is important for me that we go ahead.
Speech does not go about that, that somebody belongs to right, but somebody to left, I want to unite the people.
I always will support any the good one for society decision, KPChM or GDP will offer it, and I will be against a bad idea just as.
You become angry when somebody is speaking what you populist.
But are you not proving this by your saying?
When you are creating the business-plan for the firm, you also have some ideal goals and looks.
And to this you are trying to approach.
One can name this populism, but all the proposals which I am talking about have already functioned in the peace, or the prominent experts are talking about them.
But only the mottos will be left behind without support of the parliament for you.
And with this in a policy you will not remain for a long time.
Or you think, that after you will go to the people and will speak with them, that will be a success for you to realize criminal and financial responsibility?
I do not have another possibility.
Only being trying to convince politicians, journalists and public and you have to try to entice them on its side so that we would achieve our one.
If I was elected by the president, that did not put together to organize the direct television transmission in which I will turn to the chairpersons of the parliamentary parties with the appeal to legalize the financial and criminal responsibility for the politicians, the civil servants, the judges and the public prosecutors problems.
Also they, in the event of the rejection, they will have to announce why they do not want this.
If a strong personality which will announce abuses will be one will be able to put the pressure upon a political scene.
Take the president's direct elections - this was a merit of the pressure on the side of public.
I am speaking outright, that I am a lover, and not genius and not the intellectual.
I am trying to look for the allies in order to assert my convictions and the looks.
I am only began in policy, and will try for my program to receive the support of the majority.
Matters I try to promote independently; if this does not succeed, I will finish in six years and I will return to the private sector.
This partly sounds so as apparently Okamura has to save the Czech Republic.
I am not any not the rescuer.
I know, what one I will do nothing, therefore I went with proposal to run the row of the well known people to the Senate.
I went to Radimu Yanchure, he refused in connection with the big amount of the work.
Also I supported at least the journalist Yanu Lorencovu carrying out investigations who discovered the swindle with the light fuel oil products.
I put forward my candidacy because the people are also really unsatisfied, but now I feel himself on the scales.
Sixty percent of the people did not go on some elections, and most of those, who went chose the representatives of the establishment.
Us of the independent ones in the Senate only two.
The people chose the Senate so that the changes will materialize with difficulty.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, for example, for the direct elections of the mayors and the governors.
Do you think about a basis for your own party?
I have not thought about this yet, because I do not have any time on that, in order it to check cleanliness every past potential supporter, also I do not have money on this.
There is no money also for the presidential campaign, there are only twenty thousand crowns on my transparent bill.
Do you not have any money?
You are talking about some property declarations, but as their your own situations are with this?
The private property is being estimated of about 60 million.
I have an area in Prague the cost approximately 25 million, the apartment of 10 million, yet another apartment of 8 million, the collection of the works of art of about 10 million, Aston-Martin of 3.5 million and Wkoda Superb of a million, of course and still a few million on the bill.
By the way Aston-Martin appeared with me because this was my boyish dream - I have liked always Bond Dzhehijms which drove the car, he was gallant towards the women and he fought against baseness and lawlessness at the same time.
You are going on Aston Martin, you own the property of 60 million and you do not have any money for the campaign?
You say that you want to change the republic, but especially want to invest your own money in this.
This is not not really persuasive.
I do not have 15 million on the campaign.
Do I must get into debt?
I put already 2.5 million in the campaign.
That fact that I do not have any sponsors is testifying to the fact that my program is not so interesting.
Also I am not obliged to pay for election campaign from my pocket.
Expenses for the campaign will cover for me in essence the senatorial wages.
But I would not have lived off this money, would not be able to pay the son for the English school which costs 30 000 monthly for example.
So, if I wanted to earn the money only, I/you/he would not run nowhere.
This means, you will further be engaged in business so that one would be able to live?
Really did you not say that you will reduce this activity?
But this does not depend on the size of the wages.
As I also promised, I partially diminished my activity.
For example, my deputy will become the managing director of the tourist agency in spring.
The people would want, that I was bessrebrennikom who will protect a republic.
But I should also live off something.
How much, how a businessman is, you got used to receiving monthly?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, what I am receiving and is more distant.
And if I became a president, I/you/he would have finished his business.
You will find the complete interview in the Saturday issue of the newspaper "right".
The architects MVRDV prove that the real adventures happen not only in imagination - are 2 photographs on the example of Speijkenisse and his Book mountain built recently
"This building seems cheerful to me, it looks it can see futuristichno, at last with us again something interesting", Lizette Verxaijg, the passer-by, is speaking on the edge of the road.
And Stefan is Spermon, a specialist in IT in the large-scale enterprise which was located close by, he is counting so: "No, this building is really beautiful".
But I am asking myself: why I am today already one library?
Everyone has an Internet, iPad and e-books.
Is no one voluntarily going to such old-fashioned libraries, right, now already?
An unusual record belongs to Speijkenisse, the small-notable sleeping small town near Rotterdam.
His population has with the number of 80,000 people very the low level of the education in the Netherlands.
For the fight against this annoying circumstance it was decided a few years ago to bring in a deposit into a common education and to build seven fictional bridges which are described, in the type of miniatures of reinforced concrete colored zhivopisno, on the banknotes of a euro.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
Also at that time the fathers of the town understood that the only opportunity to manage the statistics remained with them: you have to build the library here!
Blame Maas from the architectural Rotterdam office MVRDV, the skilled worker of the bold bar diagrams and the author of witty, sometimes the even cynical buildings, belonged to a task with its normal calm and I/you/he appeared on the competitive listening in 2003 with five books under the mouse and grin on the person.
Both while the members of jury were puzzledly looking around and were shrugging their shoulders, impudent Maas made size from its original gift for piramidku and crowned the speech into the defense of its project with the following words: "The distinguished town-dwellers"!
Here are it, my proposal: "The book mountain" in Speijkenisse, so-called Bukenberg!
Nine years later this mountain with a value of 30 million euro grew.
It is the part of the project of revitalizacii, which all in all also includes the underground garage, the supermarket, the post office of both the apartment houses fitting somewhat in them and taunxausov on 50 the apartments.
At the beginning of "Book mountain" November "The better library of the Netherlands of 2012" was noted by the second prize of contest.
Also the project participates in the national Dutch contest of the wooden buildings of 2012.
In this way, the faceless suburb which formerly could not offer anything stood, besides the postmodern pedestrian zone and the astonishing homely city hall the white facades of which they are bringing to the thought about the dairy better one modern work of the architecture.
But the most important thing - in Speijkenisse the first in history of this small town public building of the cultural purpose appeared.
The long road to the book
The first impression: book Ehljdorado is under the cap for cheese.
Here is only one elevator which is going away in the center of the massif, but the real admirers of architecture and the reading will prefer to investigate this terrain on foot.
The room that was glazed from all angles is bright and easily visible, the floors of the burned brick and the elegant street-lamps faultlessly create the sensation of public city area.
City Wednesday is recreated ideally.
The look involuntarily looks for the benches, the dogs of both the youngsters who are playing soccer and the girls.
There are books, books, books also everywhere.
The bookshelves are normally along the facades, and in the middle the big dark hall is situated as rule comfortless and faceless" , - speaks Blame Maas.
We took the classical configuration of the space from our feet to the head and pulled out the zone for the reading from within outside.
The inside space of the book mountain is used skillfully: in the center the offices, the internet-library, the chess club, the ecological center and the technical rooms are situated.
The black bookshelves which serve as now a finishing of the walls, now parapets, now stair railings delight especially.
Their look, texture and smell unusual.
The even tempted architects and the civil engineers are disappearing in some assumptions, what a is unknown material.
"We strove to work with the second materials", Ijop Trauborst, the project leader, is explaining that introducing the community Speijkenisse, in accordance with the demands of the standard.
Also somehow a time in one agrarian business in Friesland we met the suitable by-product of the agriculture.
Already many years in the greenhouses and in the fields in the Netherlands as the support under the roots the artificial fibrous material of millimeter thickness has been being used.
This is cheap and is saving the time.
The thin textiles have served one to two seasons, after this one can throw it out.
For the library this canvas is for the first time of such volumes: four centimeters were pressed by the thickness in the panel.
Under the action of heat and pressure so-called landbauplastik (KLP) is turning into dark, homogeneous, firm material, the new car a little reminiscent of smell and a little plimsoll.
To a top 105 steps are leading.
The one who will overcome the way with a length of almost 500 meters will be rewarded in the literary coffee bar by the not only fantastic look at the town, but also the Dutch croquets and the woody fici in the pots.
They are taking care of an atmosphere, and first of all of the right air humidity on the literary mountain.
Expenditures on new soul
"It is difficult to believe, but this is a building, despite the mass of glass surfaces, a model project is ecology in plan", is saying Trouborst.
The heat of the earth is being used for his heating and cooling.
Although the Book mountain is under the glass cap, during even clear days the sun is hitting inwards only for a short term.
The wide farms of glue wood, put perpendicularly the glass facade, they are giving a shade and they are taking on the big part of the sunbeams on themselves.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
Fully automatic roll blind provide the remaining defense.
Stefan Spermon, the sceptic who was being mentioned higher is from the sphere of IT, has already visited the new library.
Lizette Verxaijg has already also been here.
As well as the lecturer of the traditional Chinese medicine Sintiya Bogard who named Bukenberg "the soul Speijkenisse who has not grabbed for a long time".
Reason: a few weeks before opening every inhabitant has received the invitation to donate one book from his own meeting.
These books had to take up the empty places on the shelves is yet the library completed completely on that moment there were in it 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The regiments are forced to the brim.
"No nothing" the architect Vini is "more badly than the half empty library," saying Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation every inhabitant is now connected to this new house by some form.
Each knows that his book is the part of this building.
Even if it is serving only as a decoration.
In this way, MVRDV managed to solve the royal problem which is called the creation of identity on professional jargon.
Speijkenisse wrote his literary history.
Both they will let really young are and uneducated.
However, this is only a starting point for the construction of identity.
Sabot: "The Germans have to play the more important role"
Germany abstained on vote about acknowledgment of Palestine.
On the opinion about connections Stefena of the Sabot, the expert among the USA and Europe acting so Berlin is balancing on the narrow diplomatic footpath.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of a week Germany gave at first to understand that she will vote against the Palestinians' application to the receipt of the status of the observer under the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained on vote.
Why?
Stefen of Sabot: Germany is not keeping up the Israelis' action in Gaze.
Now Germany necessary be the careful one in connection with her particular relationships with Israel.
But simultaneously I think that it is also not maintaining the American position.
Germany wanted to show its independence - without at the same time appearing it is too critical with respect to Israel.
During the rebellion in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained about the introduction of the restricted area for the flights on vote.
As a result of the NATO conducted this proposal.
Is it for Germany difficult to take up a precise stand in complicated international questions?
Yes, this is so.
The thing is that it is in the course of the transformation of her foreign policy but namely crosses from the policy which, so to speak, the USA conducted, to in fact German foreign policy.
The situation is additionally becoming complicated by with the Europeans a single coordinated policy being missing.
In this way, the Germans turn up among two fronts again.
It is expected from them that they will play the more independent role, but they did not get used to this.
I think that they have only felt their role yet, but are on a way to "more normal" foreign policy.
Such a foreign policy, what France or Great Britain will see off.
What after all does the "normal" foreign policy specifically mean from German point of view?
This is a readiness to take up in its national interests a stand which does not depend on the position of the USA or the European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy depends from an economic policy, that is to say from an export and connections with certain such as Russia, China or the Middle East regions.
The economic interests of Germany are to a considerable degree different from the interests of the other big states, and therefore Germany has to defend its interests.
Did these economic interests influence a position in Middle Eastern conflict and on the vote in the UN?
First, Germany has the big commodity markets, in particular in the states of Persian Gulf, in the Middle East.
Therefore she needs to show caution in order to not offend the public and the elite in the Arabic countries.
At any rate this plays its role.
But I would not attach an oversize importance to this, this not completely one-way connection.
But at any rate this plays the important role in the Germans' calculations.
Did Germany harm its relationships with the USA abstaining on the taking of the important decisions such as vote about Palestine?
I am convinced that in Europe and even in the USA the understanding of the German position predominates.
Therefore I do not think that this was the same dramatic break as in a Libyan question.
It is possible, Germany will even acquire the in this way determined respect.
But this is warning about what should perceive it seriously as the player on the international arena and with her interests taking into consideration is necessary.
In Europe the different opinions about Palestinian initiative exist.
The USA precisely spoke out in favor of a veto, on the contrary.
Is the divergence of the opinions among the USA and many European states?
Due to American internal policy such distinctions have always existed.
I think that the government Obamy has a sufficient understanding of the European position in the depth of soul.
But, of course, in connection with local political situation the government is openedly not able to take up such a stand.
I believe that the essential divergences are not not at all so considerable in opinions, it appears as usual.
If you will discuss the relationships between Obamoij and prime minister Netanyahu, you will note that Obama is not excited about Netanyahu's policy at all.
On the one hand is it for Germany easy to unite its narrow connections with Israel and the USA and has the condition of the most important partner been in the EU from another?
I think, namely this makes a situation such difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be somewhat the Germans more simply if the single, consistent european policy existed, but now this is not so.
Therefore they are not able to appear within the framework of wider approach and have to work instead of this relying only on their own sight of situation.
They are namely so treating a euro.
I think that in future Germany will undertake the leading role in the manufacture of the common European position.
It is clear that for Germany this is complicated at least due to connections with Israel.
This topic has been ticklish always.
But I think, it is clear to the Germans that they have to play the more independent role.
If Germany herself sees itself in the role of the important international player: it will not undertake leading role really?
Or does the leading role still seriously come to Germany?
Germany did not get not used yet to this, is it unpleasant up to now always and, according to evident reasons, it has seriously come up to now always to play the considerable role.
We will look, to example, a euro is a crisis whenever Germany is undertaking the important role, the most different anti--German feelings appear.
It is not for the Germans simple to manage this.
In fact, this old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by the hostile countries.
From this point of view Germany is located in a considerably more difficult position than the USA.
It must take most different neighbors and the opinions into consideration, and this is complicated.
Thus, the influence of the USA constantly grows weak in european policy, but at present moment the EC is not filling in this vacuum, who after all at that time remains?
The Germans will simply have to play the more considerable role.
Even if you do not like this, it is unpleasant or the dislike for you strengthens - life is such!
Stefen of Sabot is the deputy of the director of the Transatlantic academy in Washington, the institute in which the academicians and the political scientist-experts are jointly investigating the problems of the transatlantic association from Europe and North America.
Besides that, the Sabot a member of the German fund of Marshall is which he is specializing in on German policy, the foreign policy of the USA and transatlantic connections.
"The protection of the trade marks" is in China: when will Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous trade mark, Polo Ralph Lauren is also.
But what are Armani Polo?
This is a designation registered at China which does not have anything in common with the firms, from the name of which it is formed absolutely officially.
Nevertheless it will be protected as long as, the owners of the initial names will not make the claim yet.
However, at that time it is unclear whether they will manage to assert its rights.
"The foreigners in an always more difficult way becomes to defend its trade marks in China", Thomas Pattlox, the lawyer of the company Taylor Wessing specializing in infringements of the rights to trade marks in the Far East, is speaking.
On my table it appears in new matter like that every week.
It is for the imitators enough to add a couple of letters in total in order to receive the right to register its trade marks.
So Gucci is turning into Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada one can register Prada-Kny.
The German businesses, for example the producer of the sport goods Puma are copied the same way legally.
Pattlox opens the folder with the recordings of the department of the registration of trade marks in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010 the Chinese company registered the trade mark Zegna DF Puma, the artificial name which the name of the stylish house Ermenegildo Zegna is also used for there.
The that the Chinese are duplication and the infringement of the rights of the intellectual property world champions is known.
There are multistorey department stores which is selling hardly exceptionally the forgings in the large towns.
However matters Pattloxa are not such. On behalf of his clients it appears against the Chinese businesses receiving absolutely officially the right to use the name from the department of the registration of the trade marks which is already guarded somewhere already.
The Chinese are calling this "ban", a mark passenger, "minpaij".
This word is being associated with "ban dakuanj".
So they are calling the women who are hunting for the rich men.
The Chinese authorities will not recognize the guilt behind themselves
"This is causing damage to business, it is necessary with this to fight": Pattlox is convinced.
"The trade mark is being washed away, the unique position is disappearing, image is very strongly damaged".
The financial losses and the judicial costs in the branches which suffered are amounting to millions, especially in the event of the expensive products being copied.
According to the data of the the market research CLSA company, China with the sales volume of 15 billion euro per year is the third in size and very growing into the commodity market of the luxury articles fast.
However to achieve the removal of the questionable entries in the roll of the trade marks is difficult, and this costs a lot.
The process can last, with unclear issue, up to nine years.
Pattlox is talking about the matters in which the court turned claims down because the name protested at the end of the long time became "the real fact of the market".
If the complainant will not be lucky, that it even will be to pay to the plagiarist because the damage brought it to the trade mark in China must Pattlox is speaking.
Sometimes he governs the law of the jungle here.
There are also famous matters of the graphic components.
In 2009 the company Daimler lost the judicial dispute by Sany, by the business which acquired the manufacturer of the concrete pumps Putzmeister shortly before that with the producer of the building cars.
Therefore the Chinese have up to now the right to use mark, similar to the star Mercedes.
The company Geely which bought Volvo used the blue-white logotype which was reminiscent of BMW initially; the process was successful, one had to change Geely it.
The producer of the stylish goods Lacoste lost in China to the imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore with whom the famous crocodile watched to another side.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves to be guilty.
The department of the registration of the trade marks CTMO confirms in Beijing that there in 2010 due to the shortage of personnel and the equipment of the rooms difficulties took place.
But last year "a return" came "from emergency situation in the work process to norm".
So, the quantity of the crude matters on objections diminished by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such matters were closed, it is 75 percent more than last year.
Nevertheless 81,500 claims have still waited for productions in department.
It is a lot with this it to fight worth
How very often in China, the numbers impress.
Last year in CTMO more than 1.4 million statements about the protection of the trade marks, of hardly third were received more than in 2010.
This also means record, a department announces that China became head of the list of the new registrations in the whole world the tenth time on end.
The same is concerning the common quantity of the valid trade marks 5.5 million pieces in total.
In 2011 1.8 billion yuans of collections were paid.
If to simplify, this means that every registration is in the average of 1280 yuans or 160 euros.
It is it to protest it worth as the matter of the German family company shows Freudenberg many times more.
During the space of more than seven years the group fights against the Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans managed to achieve that that the illegal production by it of the counterfeit automobile components was liquidated.
However the imitator secured the Chinese rights to trade mark Freudenberg for himself.
This was its own omission, since the surnames are not subject to the defense in Germany, Xanno Ventcler is speaking, the chairperson of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities is in Munich.
Also the department of the registration of the trade marks CTMO turned the claim of myunxencev down.
Really, in both of the following instances Freudenberg won, but the opposite direction continues the fight up to now.
Necessary be on the alert
Now a question is on the examination in the Supreme Court.
Ventcler is hoping to bring the matter to good completion and is praising the professionalism of the ships.
But he is also speaking: "The process is extremely expensive and much is taking the time from us, the money and the nerves".
The inner expenditures are almost giving way to account-taking, the archive of the firm had to glance even through the acts of the centenary remoteness in order to bring proof.
Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered "the large westiznachnuyu sum of money in a euro" to the opposite direction for the settlement five years ago.
"From here as this costs to us a lot" Ventcler is clearly speaking.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to leap even to Europe.
And if the imitators register unprotected trade marks behind themselves namely there.
So, one Chinese producer wanted in Germany to register the designation of Freudenberg for shoes and the products of leather.
The group stopped production in these fields long ago, but I/you/he has managed to avert the registration despite this.
"Necessary be on the alert", Ventcler is speaking.
Both it and lawyer Pattlox are advising German businesses to be very careful with China.
It is insufficient to rely on some international the protection of the trade marks regulations, he is rather following the foreigners is saying "everything it is somehow it what to defend, what to register also at China worth" to Ventcler.
Otherwise this can turn out much more expensively than registration.
Really: if Freudenberg will lose in the last document of its drama concerning the trade mark, that is explaining to Ventcler he will have to pay license fees to the opposite direction for his own name.
Will force out otherwise than we from the market in controversial segment.
A global day of Aids: you have to pritoptyvatj, you have to sing, you have to help
In Xaijdeljberge the chorus Imbongi is rehearsing is but in Swaziland the orphans of Aids are happy about this.
History of the relationships which overcame the distance of more than 8733 kilometers.
At first stomping is heard: they are picking the kovboijskie boots, the basketball plimsolls, the ladies' small boats and the man's slippers up the measure on brad floor and they find it fast.
Once-two to three-four.
Only after this slowly increase the voices of the singers - the viola, bass, tenor and soprano - they are beginning, are enchanting and are following each other.
And Fite Xopf, the 29-year-old conductor, it is rushing out from his materchatyx shoes nearly, when he is leading them flexible and expressive gestures.
The evening of Monday, in the musical hall of the institute of the medical psychology in Xaijdeljberge the chorus Imbongi is rehearsing a new song.
Of the rehearsal fifty participants of the chorus arrived, from the specialist on the person's genetics before the caretaker, from 23 to 69 years.
"Om"Obani" is complicated thing, every voice of the chorus has its text, by same in an absolutely foreign language: the Zulu, which eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland are speaking.
Help for self-help
According to the evaluation of Unaids, the United Nations' programs of the fight against Aids, in the peace about 34 million HIV-positive are.
23.5 million of them live in the south of Africa.
In Swaziland 245 000 orphans of Aids live.
At the same time more than 40 percent of the population VICh-polozhiteljny.
For 180 orphans of Aids in the village Ehsitzheni the association Voices for Africa found the bosses in Germany.
70 of them visit the school that is preparing for the further teaching.
For 15 or 20 euros per month one can undertake sponsorship.
It is guaranteeing money for the school, a school form and the daily hot lunch in the Gogo-center to the child.
A story-teller or vosxvalitelj mean Imbongi in Zulu.
In this hall they are not speaking fluently about the Bantu, they can but sing.
Almost ten years the chorus learns songs in this unknown soft language and he even brings them there from time to time again where they appeared for the first time: on the south of Africa.
But in the distance 8733 kilometers are years from Xaijdeljberga, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swasiland, the village Ehsitzheni which depends on the voices of the German chorus is.
Forty percent are infected
There live about 2000 people, there are several things in the simple shacks of clay and straw, among the inhabitants many children up to now.
More than 300 of them lost the parents who died of the virus ICh.
In the miniature the illness of the whole Swaziland is reflected in Ehsitzheni: the highest level is VICh-inficirovaniya, the life-span, lowest in the peace, according to the data of the UNICEF being expected.
The circumcision of the men's foreskin which provedly reduces the risk of contamination half is almost not taken on among population.
More than forty percent of the population of Swaziland carry the virus of immunodeficiency, death in themselves on the middle of fourth dozen is not rarity.
The chorus discovered this village on the joint trip on Africa in spring of 2005, but formerly the participants Imbogni saw the great number of the children in the streets which did not grab not only a parental concern, but also simply everything with: the food, the clothes, education.
Without school education the person does not have any chances at all in the poor country.
At first this was separate participants' private obligation: in a few euros to send the child to a year to the school and to give him the chance once a day to receive a hot food.
But a year later the chorus already founded the unification "Voices for Africa" who since then is hardly professionally taking care of orphans SPIDa v Ehsitzheni.
The facts about the infections which are passed on sexual road
What are the most important diseases which are passed on sexual road?
To the bacterial ones IPPP takes syphilis, xlamidioz and tripper (gonorrhea) away.
AIDS, a human papilloma-virus, genitaljnyij gerpes and a hepatitis are frequent viral IPPP.
Lobkovyij pedikulez and the itch belong to the parasitic ones IPPP.
What are the main groups being struck?
Mainly the syphilis and the gonorrhea are met with the men who are teaching the men sex.
Robert Koxa institute is presuming from the minimum being in four of every five cases of syphilis registered at Germany, the transfer is going on as a result of sexual contacts among the men.
With the heterosexual adult people xlamidiijnye infections, trixomoniaz, kandidoz (the mushroom), a gonorrhea and a human papilloma-virus are diseases being often met which pass on sexual road.
The spreading of AIDS amongst adults is comparatively low however about 20 percent of new infections of AIDS fall on this group.
Among young people the xlamidiijnye infections are substantially more often than among the other groups of the population met.
According to European data, three quarters of all the infections amaze the young people from 15 to 25 years.
With us among young people the human papilloma-virus is often also met.
How is the quantity of the cases of infecting changing?
Not all the diseases which are passed on sexual road are not subject to the obligatory registration.
The rate of syphilis has doubled more than, according to the data of Robert Koxa Institute, from 1697 cases in 2001 up to 3698 cases in 2011.
The quantity of new infections of AIDS since 2007 is coming down.
In 2011 there were about 2700 cases.
This is smaller than in the previous year approximately on one tenth.
What symptoms point out the venereal disease?
The sores in the field of genitaliij, complaint on the urination, allocation, pains can arise with infectious diseases below the stomach, as well as the blisters or compressions.
However they are often not being accompanied by pains and the other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can one defend oneself?
The condoms are capable of diminishing the risk of contamination, but do not give hundred-percent defense.
But the stimuli of the diseases which pass on sexual road can partially spread also by means of contact infection and with narrow physical contact.
Therefore the experts are recommending a regular inspection, especially on the frequent change of the sexual partners.
On early diagnostics one can cure most IPPP and avoid the remote consequences.
Sponsorship, the donations and for the last line the fees for the talks of the chorus on the whole Germany do not allow calling something together.
"All we sent in Ehsitzheni already about 200 000 euros", Annete Lennartc, the chairperson of the association, is speaking.
In the village itself Codva Dlamini, the conscientious and active woman, is controlling the money from Germany.
She makes sure also that the orphans were placed, for example near one of the grandmothers, well.
Gogos, as they are calling the old women, this woman in the Zulu the support of the village.
Some of them received up to 14 orphans to themselves, they are giving them the roof above the head and they make sure that the children in form appeared in time at the lessons every day.
Those who relatives did not stay with are acting into the asylum to Xaniijsile, the single woman that is receiving wages from an association, in the same way as also two cooks who prepare every day for more than 200 hungry children.
Moreover, the association "Voices for Africa" organized a sewing school, two henhouses built and with American organization for health protection PSI jointly organized the change of analysis on AIDS for many inhabitants of the village.
It is difficult to present, but they prefer about the illness which is so evident in the whole country to be deeply silent.
The king with 14 wives
"The Aids is absolute taboo", is saying Annete Lennartc: "because it is connected to sexuality".
It is quite unusual for the country which the king officially has 14 wives in.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, king Msvati III, is well known for his love of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, on such a style of life sanctioned by the state the guilt behind the virus ICh spreading so fast in the last years also lies.
But it is also lying on the vagrant workers who are delivering the virus on the country.
The free condoms are literally in every corner, is saying Annete Lennartc, "but they are almost not employing them.
Another culture is a flesh to the flesh".
In order to keep up the cultural exchange a little, the chorus Ibmogni carries out the trip on the south of Africa every two to three years and is singing the songs, complete of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-awareness, which are many on the southern edge of the black continent know already since the times of apartheid.
The bus, full of the white ones which sing the songs in black tongue - such an acknowledgment brings the good mood and joy not only, but even, happened, caused the tears in front of the eyes of the austere border guards.
A trip has always brought also in Ehsitzheni where the singers are visiting supported children.
In spite of the fact that one can find the small village on the go-cart with difficulty, in the valley of the river Ehculveni it is more than well known.
"Go in Ehsitzheni, there is light", are saying local people.
BUT after the 8733 miles long flight back into Xaijdeljberg one after the tramping singers are returning as Bergxaijmer to the rehearsal hall in the street can see, that this light is burning as well here.
Messendzher: NASA is opening ice in Mercury
The probe "Messendzher" found proof that there is Mercury ice in the planet.
The ice can have the thickness up to 20 meters.
The cosmic department of the USA proved NASA the presence of ice of the planet Mercury.
There is also water which froze, although it is put to the Sun the nearest, as it is clear from three researches published in the journal Science on Thursday.
The probe "Messendzher" found proof of the region of the planet being constantly in the shade being covered by the ice.
His thickness has to be at the minimum 30 centimeters, and up to possibly, even 20 meters.
Hypothetically, water is occurring from the comet or, it is possible, the asteroid, bumping into Mercury.
No one connects the opening of ice to the existence of life in the planet, the scientific leader of the probe Won Solomon said.
The temperature in Mercury can reach Celsius''s 426 degrees.
However these openings could have helped to explain as water could and other prefabricated units of life hit the other places of the Solar System.
For the inhabitants the Earth is imperceptibly probes, telescopes and the small robots, for example the "phoenix", are investigating the depths of the Universe.
They from time to time send representations to the Earth: the small windows gave into endless.
The representation is coming from the camera tube which German researchers worked out from Max Planck's Institute.
Eight planets of our Solar System, as well as the dwarfish planet Cerera.
As well as Pluto which has been turning for Neptunom, Cerera, around the Sun on the new definition of the international astronomic union from 2006 is not "a planet".
This fragment of the infrared photo of the telescope "Spitcer" presents "the family portrait" of the countless generations of the stars: you have to identify the oldest stars in starlit circle the pink "newborn" stars in the form of the blue points, in a more difficult way.
This region of zvezdoobrazovaniya - the scientists are unromantically calling his W5 - is discovered by the telescope of "Spitcer" in constellation Kassiopeya, in the distance of 6500 light years.
This perelivchatyij heat of the dying man of the star photographed the telescope of NASA "Spitcer".
The ring which is similar to the donut consists of material which the star threw out in the course of the dying.
In the gigantic fog of Trifid of gas and dust removed of 5400 light years from the Earth new stars arise.
The telescope of NASA "Spitcer" made this photograph of the galactic maternity hall.
The starlit accumulation the Pleiadeses, also being called "Seven sisters", one can see at night with the naked eye.
Of course, with the telescope of the color they are coming out better.
Like the red eye fog winks at the observer the Snail on this infrared photo.
It is put in the constellation of the Aquarius in the distance of 700 light years.
The likeness with the terrestrial continent brought this fog nickname "North America".
The combination of the normal and infrared photograph provides expressive cvetoperedachu.
This new star in all the beauty managed to photograph only with the help of the infrared sensors of the telescope "Spitcer".
Saturn and his rings: How did they arise - one of the great riddles of the astronomy.
It is possible, this the fragments of the moon of Saturn which completely disappeared 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the greatest and most precise photos of the telescope "Xabbl": the galaxy of the Water gates
Depending on cvetoperedachi the photos of the spiral galaxies are turning into the present works of art.
The photo which was published by the European Southern observatory shows the fog Trifid in the constellation of Sagittarius removed of a few thousand light years.
The name Trifid is coming from the Latin word of trifidus (trilobate, three-separate) because the dark stripes of the dust divide the heart of the cradle of the stars made burning hot into three parts.
In the Ophiuchus' constellation the astronomers photographed the herald of the cosmic clash: in the distance of 400 million light years from the Earth the kernels of two galaxies merging together are rushing towards each other and will inevitably come across.
This birth of the star the telescope "Xabbl" took off in the spiral galaxy M83.
The one who does not like the technical reductions can call it with "Southern Bobbin Wheel" nickname.
The photograph of the cosmic telescope "Xabbl" shows the fragment of fog the Iris in constellation Cefeya.
The fog removed of 1400 light years consists of the particles of the dust the sizes of which are smaller than near the normal domestic dust from ten to a hundred times.
This representation was put together out of the optical and roentgen photos of different telescopes.
It shows the ring from the black holes removed of 430 million light years from the Earth.
This group of the galaxies under name Arp 273 photographed for NASA the cosmic telescope "Xabbl".
The scientists are naming UGC 1810 the big spiral galaxy.
There is the brightest group of new stars of our Milky Way in this starlit fog.
The starlit cradle constantly creates the new stars.
This starlit cloud, connected to fog the Wall Socket, it is constantly also creating the new stars - in the distance of 5000 light years from the Earth.
In this galaxy shining brightly with the small black hole still no do not raise dust, only gas.
The researchers suppose that it arose shortly before Big explosion, when in the Universe hydrogen mainly meant.
Our views into the Universe: the most important telescopes
Probably, the telescope was invented by Hans Lippersgeem - still before how Galileo Galilei a year later approached the observation of the stars, in 1608.
Since then the mirrors of the optical telescopes became more and more is but the spaces that are open to their look are deeper all.
For 30 years, but namely from 1947 to 1975 a year, the telescope "Xale" was the biggest telescope in the observatory Palomar near San Diego in the peace.
The mirror described here five meters had the diameter.
In Arizona, the USA, "The big binocular telescope" is installed.
It is allowing watching into the cosmos with the help of two mirrors, each.
"The grain Teleskopio Kanarias" has a gigantic inside device - diameter one only the mirrors puts together 10.4 a meter.
The mirror Of "the big South African telescope" in South Africa is segmented - for the sake of the reduction of the cost.
Nevertheless in the diameter it reaches approximately eleven the meters.
The shortage of the inexpensive constructive implementation: the telescope is fastened together at the vertical corner hard - this limits his mobility.
The telescope "Xobbi-Ehberli" also has the vertical fixed corner in Texas.
His peculiarity: high light-gathering proficiency.
It is reaching: despite the comparatively small diameter of the mirror - the parameters of the biggest world telescopes.
With the help of the radio telescope in Aresibo (Puerto Rico) the researchers are listening to some extraterrestrial signals in the cosmos.
The radio telescope has the diameter of 305 meters.
Participating in "the Search" project of the extraterrestrial reason" (SETI), just any owner of the computer can help after granting his computing power.
Look at the observatory of the European astronomic service (ESO) is in Chilean Andes.
Here "A very big telescope" is - that completely corresponding to its name.
His four mirrors allow clarifying even the average infrared spectrum in the spyglass.
In the Chilean observatory ESO the set-up of "the European Very big telescope" is also being planned.
His main mirror has to spread out on wholes 42 meters is and will be put together almost out of 1000 mirror components.
However one not earlier 2018 should expect the photographs.
By both of the telescopes of "Kek" were considered in the gavaijskom volcano Mauna Kea biggest in the peace until 2007.
Two mirrors are installed in them by the diameter of ten meters.
The telescopes "Kek" belong to the observatory Mauna-Kea which watches into sky also with the help of the telescopes "Subaru" and IRTTF together with them.
Moreover, on Mauna-Kea the new gigantic telescope has to emerge: with the mirror with the diameter thirty meters.
Here they may admire the illustrations.
However a cosmic telescope "Xabbl" delivers the most important looks from the cosmos.
Since April 24, 1990 he is delivering the pictures of the distant peaces.
Since March 2009, the cosmic telescope "Kepler" looks for planets beyond the limits of the Solar System - above all such on which life is possible.
On February 2, 2011 NASA informed that 1235 planets-candidate were discovered since beginning of mission.
On the photograph the last preparations of the cosmic telescope "Kepler" are stamped.
James Uehbba (JWST) cosmic telescope will not earlier 2018 aboard the rocket "of The 5 Arian" be sent to the cosmos.
The main mirror of the infrared cosmic telescope has the diameter 6.5 meter.
One of the tasks of the telescope: he has to look for the Big explosion on the light of the first stars and the galaxies.
The scientists suppose that there is ice in south pole of Mercury.
However the reliable data about this are not here because "Messendzher" revolves nearer to north pole than the planet.
The radar measurings during decades pointed out that there is ice in Mercury.
Thanks to the probe that was thrown in 2004 "Messendzher" - the first which is revolving around Mercury - the scientists are convinced of this now.
Drink butter every day is and zhivite 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan many inhabitants reach po-bibleijski venerable age.
Here the museum of longevity even exists.
The search of the solution is in the country, where the 97-year-old old men seem still comparatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan many inhabitants reach po-bibleijski venerable age.
Here the museum of longevity even exists.
The search of the solution is in the country, where the 97-year-old old men seem still comparatively young.
One can name the trip across the Talywskie mountains wild and romantic.
The mini-bus with thundering is rolling along the winding road past the hills which were overgrown with the thick forests, the stormy rivulets and the simple peasant houses.
Everything is all around so green and what one can think as if you are in Wvarcvaljde is bright.
But this is the most southern edge of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is in a few kilometers all from here.
Here talywi live one of the people of Caucasus about which it is known a little that they are excellently saying really only that is is on farsi also azerbaijzhdanskom and they are notable for longevity.
Lerik is end point.
The small small town kichitsya with the too heavyweight architecture of Soviet times which does not harmonize with the picturesque mountainous landscape at all.
The tourists are almost not coming from Europe here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku is too exhausting.
Of 323 kilometers eight hours leave because the road has one stripe in total.
Legendary fortune, must with which the country the mineral oil of the Caspian Sea, here, to the province while was not reaching.
However Pilata Fatulaeva (48) is convinced, that there is in Lerike to interest the tourists like what.
"In May Baku was famous for the festival of the Eurovision song is but in the next year with us the festival of the oldest people of the peace will take place", Fatulaeva is speaking.
It is the director of the museum of longevity, probable, only in the peace.
Here talyweij from these places which are more than 100 years old zadokumentirovana the biography of approximately eight dozens. Fatulaeva points out the black and white photograph.
This is my grandfather, it is 120 years old here.
At the age of 136 years another child was born in it
But shepherd Wirali Myuslyumov who supposedly 168 years have been fulfilled is the controversial star of the museum.
The evidence about the birth is not here, however.
And with the account-taking that the oldest man whose age is confirmed by the documents has been 122 years old the age Myuslyumova is extremely questionable.
"It was born in this district in 1805, died in 1973", is explaining Fatulaeva.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, at the age of 136 years the daughter was supposedly born in it.
Like that did shepherd Myuslyumov add a couple of dozens of the years to his age?
But even Rembrandt Woljc, the researcher of the age from Max Planck's in Rostoke Institute, heard about the old persons in Middle Asia.
, one can meet strikingly many people of advanced age also in some districts of China, in Japan or in the valley Xunza in Pakistan, is saying Woljc, in Sardinia extremely many very old people also live.
However due to the absence of the documents the scientific confirmation of age is impossible in so far as there were no rolls of civil state.
Every day is the glass of toplenogo butter
Nevertheless there is the fact that people strikingly often attain the biblical age in the district Lerika.
Now 20 people live here in an older way than 100 years.
Why here in the south are so many old persons?
The Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzade is explaining this by particular genes of talyweij.
The director of the museum Fatulaeva, conversely, believes that matter is in the nourishment.
Talywi likes meat, bread and drinks the dairy produce, many out of them most of all on the glass of toplenogo butter every day. However such a high-energy diet can be healthy from diet-logical point of view scarcely.
Or is matter in the primitive way of life which saves the people's youth? In Chengemirane, the tiny settlement close to the town Lerik, Mirzoeva Rubaba lives.
At the age of 97 years it is still comparatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaeva which asserts that she has 143 descendants lives in the simple wooden house, typical for the whole Caucasian region.
It is sitting on a floor with the barrel of butter, which got without rolls here and there.
Here under one roof eight people, including one of the sons and the daughter Mirzaevoij live who for a long time already have had their grandchildren.
Also two kids are jumping close by.
In the kitchen they are preparing tea which they are serving to armudu in the typical big-bellied glasses for the guests.
Near Mirzaevoij it is ideal even and the strong white teeth, under the head scarf she is hiding her long dark-dark-blond braids which her son with pride is opening in front of us.
I always my the hair milk, so they never fell out and kept the color.
"Also I have never used shampoo", is saying Mirzaeva.
The monthly pension suffices for life
She has eaten always what appeared in its own yard, tomatoes, potato, the green pea.
In the whole life I have never bought the products in the shop.
Then she is talking about her husband who served in the army.
It was the heaviest after the Second World War.
But became better after "dear father" Geijdar Aliyev had stood near the steering wheel.
A propaganda is often not heard in the speech of the old woman.
However the cult that is created around the figure of the father of the nation, who governed the country how the dictator, he does not know the borders in Azerbaijan practically.
It was at authority until 2003, then his son Iljxam took on the reins of the management.
Nevertheless there is no poverty among the Azerbaijani old men.
230 manats (a euro is approximately equal to the same amount) Mirzaeva receives as the pension monthly, for local conditions this is an amount on which one can live well.
And the son Mirzaevoij who grew, possibly, is also right for a long time: "The old men in our culture are enjoying deep respect".
They live in big family, are dear, are surrounded by the concern and are happy.
Like what not reason to stay alive as much as longer
The word "human rights" is missing in the constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
The competing demonstrations in Cairo are testifying to the deep split of the country.
The future constitution based on shariah was met with the furious rebuff.
The Egyptian president did not scrimp on pathos.
We have to create the transition.
"Also his success lies on my responsibility to people and to god", he said on state television.
His speech was turned to all the people, but first of all to the Christian Copts, the liberals, the enlightened Moslems and the unreligious Egyptians.
But they all estranged in perplexed opposition up to now hopelessly feel fear.
The fear of the religious state in Nile is on the favor of moguqestvennyx "Bratjev-musuljman".
Moxammed Mursi said seemingly apologizing, that it cut down on responsibility temporarily constitutional the ships and I/you/he enlarged his responsibility "in order to save the revolution".
However what as a matter of fact the 61-year-old engineer who has the doctor's degree of the American university of Southern California wants to save is not completely clear to the Egyptians and to the whole world.
Will the justifier be deprived of power?
Actually 234 articles managed to carry in the night 15-hour download with the obstacles at the constitutional meeting of 100 participants incited the Islamist, also this partially causes the fears.
As well as in the previous constitutions, in project it is being said that the legal procedure is relying on "the principles of the Islamic right".
But what does "principle" mean?
This was and remains the matter of the interpretation, one can also be afraid of the Islamists using the indistinct formulation and the legal clearance that arises in connection with it for the stricter explanation of shariah.
Alludes, at least, to this one new-brought article: in all the matters which are concerning shariah one should draw for counsel the university Alj-Awar, the most important Islamist institution of the country enjoying the big authority on the whole sunnitskom Islam.
This does not owe, but what in fact would have can mean that the clergy are overseeing a legislation consequence the restriction of the justifier.
In constitution draft many things are the object of interpretation
Another problem: the civilians' jurisdiction has to remain court martial.
These courts served Mubarak's authorities for the members' of the opposition suppression in the period.
After the dictator's overthrow there were up to 11,000 civilians in war conclusion.
Also, as is said in project, the state has to protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "to maintain her morality and values".
This is legally formulated so indistinctly that the state institutions with the help of this article will be able to check even the content of movies and literature.
This does not mean with the plain language what another as censorship.
Not a single article establishes directly the equality of the men and the women at all.
But another prohibits from offending and porochitj Mohammed's prophet and his envoys.
But what is insult and remains as it should be punished, unclear.
The formulation is questionable also, that the people's insult is prohibited from.
Will the caricature of the president or the joke about the jurist be enough?
A matter of interpretation, as well as many things are in this project which offers Mursi for a signature and which, according to his statement, will "very soon" be presented to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"The revolution returned"
Already a few weeks the opposition against the Islamists' superiority has been developing.
Dozens of thousands of people got together in unusual unanimity in the evening Fridays in the area Taxrir in Cairo and swore to destroy this document still before it will can come into effect.
"The revolution returned, and we will win", said Xamdin Sabbaxi occupying the third place on presidential elections.
Laureate nobelevskoij of peace award and the former head of the international department of nuclear energy Moxammed Ehlj-Baradei declared that constitution draft is place "on the dump of history".
Across the service of the short news Twitter he accused the adherents Mursi of the wish to become head "of the coup d'etat against democracy".
"If he will declare the referendum, we will go to his palace and will throw it off", said a member of the opposition Yasser Said.
"We did not get yet tired, our brothers' blood be not otmqena yet": Egyptian mass media quoted the opposition politician Xaleda Ali.
Many judges also announced that they do not want to supervise a referendum, that he would have made it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
Organized "Bratjya-musuljmane" well called to the opposite demonstration, for their part, but, from caution, not in the area Taxrir, and after the mass prayer in another shore of Nile in front of the Kairskim university.
A large number of the women under the covers and the adherents of salafitov who were shouting took part in it: "The people are demanding the application of the simple law".
They demanded of Mursi: "Clean the country"! and assured: "The Koran is our constitution".
The struggle for power over the symbolic area on which everything began practically provoked the state the civil war.
The followers Mursi did not want, completely evidently, to take this risk.
"The Moslem-brothers" declared that both the enemies and the supporters of the constitution draft spoke out loudly and clearly.
Now the time to let the people decide near the ballot box in what direction the country has to go came.
Majority is for the Islamists' project, this is considered the solved matter.
"The idea" of "the human rights" is never mentioned
Xafiz is Abu Saeda in rage from this constitutional process sped up which, in general, had to last until February with the participation of all the public forces.
The 48-year-old lawyer for human rights and the chairperson of the Egyptian organization for human rights (EOPR) was defending "Bratjev-musuljman" when in front of Mubarak they were sitting in the prison or appeared before the court.
Not because it shared their philosophy of life, but because the human rights for it are indivisible.
Behind this it was beaten, is sentenced, is arrested.
And now the word of "the human rights" is never met in the new constitution, he is sorry in talk with "Welt am Sonntag".
The expansion of the influence Mursi on all three branches of the authority in the state disappoints the lawyer.
These measures are the overt blows to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of reinforcing a civil state, in fact the president annulled it": Saeda is sorry.
But without civil public organizations democracy is not able to function.
Even an international community which looks at the ideological fight of the directions in Nile against the mix of curiosity and effort feels Saeda, which everyone abandoned it.
Behind this the payment can occur.
The demonstrator in the area Taxrir is giving advance notice: "You are creating the monster which you will not be able "to check".
Norwegian rakfisk: very the badly smelling fish in the peace?
The five-millionfold one has populations of Norway one of the highest living standards not only in Europe, but also in the whole world.
Somehow, possibly, is the secret of the success of this country connected to local passion to one extremely fetid fish dish?
Take a few pieces of cheese which overripened.
Put them in the heap of the dirty and sweaty sportswear.
Leave them there on nedeljku.
Your smell of rakfiska - one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies otwibayuqiij sense of smell will turn out.
I am under a name Fagernes in the small small town, in three driving lessons from Oslo.
All around there are picturesque looks which were covered by the snow. This is really beautiful, but in air the ineradicable characteristic smell is poured.
Rakfisk is a trout sprinkled with salt and roaming in water until a year, depending on what is necessary namely taint to achieve.
As the dusks are thickening and it xolodaet, the Norwegians' crowds are gathering for the festival into Fagernese devoted to this very, we will say like that, the taking dish.
"It eat raw and wash down he" is explaining "by the liqueur glass of the aquavit, local caraway vodka," Xavard Xaljvarsen, the local fireman by profession also in secondary occupation "rakfiskovyij general" who is guiding the carrying out of festival.
The people are eating everywhere around us fish which was being cut with the small cubes and are washing down alcoholic beverage with her sizable portions.
"Somebody likes the aquavit more than rakfisk", is saying Xavard.
This drink is capable of interrupting smell.
I am testing a couple of small pieces.
If it will be possible to carry the piece is that it differs by from the portion of the continent all not so bad - little under your the nose, then, which you have been transporting with yourselves in the bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from absolutely other times, the times of poverty, when, already before the appearance refrigerator is, wetted the fish in the hermetically closed barrels with salt-water in autumn.
Then the deep winter, when the fish already wandered well and soundly, they extracted it and after smothering the perception with an alcohol used into the food.
Mainly, there is that fact that thousands of Norwegians had to abandon their country in search of work and to emigrate in the USA already in the memory of the past generation.
Now after all the population is precipitantly growing - more than 13% immigrants are who the jobs, the high wages and the developed system of the social welfare pull here.
The inhabitants of Sweden come (the old rival but еще not long ago and much the more well-to-do neighbor) massovo to work here.
Rakfisk is being perceived as certain important symbol, an indispensable symbol, although somewhat the fetid component of the past Norway.
This is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, everything is expensive here - the small glass of beer or the sandwich will cost you 9 pound sterling (14 US dollars).
Norway infrequently appears in world news, and the majority of the inhabitants of the country is organizing this, similarly.
The people are unwillingly mentioning the name of Andersa Breijvika, the racist and the extremist of the right sense shooting last year and killing 77 men, women and children here up to now.
Without mentioning his name, they are calling the terrorist attack "the occurrence on 22nd July".
It is for the Norwegians really difficult to believe, that in their peace-loving country one of their fellow citizens turned up capable on similar atrocities and murders.
In the basis of the today's well-being of Norway a growth (since the beginning of seventieth) of one of the biggest petrol branches lies in the peace.
"However mineral oil is the cause of our prosperity not only", is saying Anna, our waitress, the woman with the long bright hair and the striking light blue eyes, delivering the trays with withstood rakfiskom is the realization of the Nordic well-being.
We such a people - you are calling this as you - rational.
As well as the majority of the Norwegians, it are excellently speaking English.
We do not love being posted on a presentation, we are not boastful.
Norway is very carefully turning with its mineral oil - the big part of the earnings of the petrol branch is being invested into the special fund created for the welfare of the future generations.
In years preceding the global financial crisis, when everyone sorili to the money, which they did not have Norway frugally calculated all the expenditures.
"While" one "can ski in the winter and go to the excursions of the summer, this is for a happiness enough", is saying Anna.
"Also there is rakfisk", she with the careless laughter is adding.
I am in the snow in a line for some food - rakfiska from me will suffice.
Here the burger with losinym meat is really exact exotics, tasty juicy meat.
But us waits with the evening the even greater quantity all of the same fish with unforgettable smell.
In my hotel they are organizing special supper, rakfisk let in, in the course of which the visitors are determining a best with vote or, it is possible, the most aromatic fish.
A direct tele-ether is going, in which show leading in the bow tie, surrounded by the plates with rakfiskom.
This looks like a song contest "Eurovision".
"Thus, the Torus Yurgen, what evaluation you assigned behind the better fish in the mountains there with themselves""?
"Yes, Xavard, here our evaluation"....
Everyone is laughing and is applauding.
Somebody is falling from the chair after, possibly, taking the aquavit too much.
And he can, it is simple it nadywavwisj with the smell of this fish.
Difficult beginning of career lies ahead of the president of Mexico Ehnrike Penjya Njeto.
While the new president of Mexico Ehnrike Penjya Njeto is preparing to enter a post, BBC of Grant's Uill correspondent is inviting us to look at the difficulties which it will have to come up against, and at the mixed expectations of the population of his country.
Road traffic is soon in Mexico City in an especially sad state.
This town is overloaded by the transport and the steel obstacles cutting off a few key highways to the capital and causing chaos in the roads were erected in the better time, and since Monday.
However this was not done in order that it will not be possible to let for the people to reach to work from the suburbs, but in order to prevent the participants of protests from winding up to the building of the parliament.
On Sunday the new head of Mexico Ehnrike Penjya Njeto will put on the presidential sling and will take on the reins of the management by the country.
A complicated task is before it.
Mexico made good economic levels attached to the administration Felipe Kaljderona who now is packing her power, however the country wallowed in the war against the drugs which has already taken away about 60,000 lives in six years.
My government is declaring" to the people of Mexico about its readiness to fight a violence", informed Mr Penjya Njeto the president of the USA Barak Obame in the oval cabinet of the White House earlier this week.
I am preparing to offer new security strategy, aim which will allow us to reach this.
Before such statements next to the president of the USA the political career of Mr Penjya Njeto was developing in the post of his governor of the native staff of Mexico City.
In his home, in the densely populated and vast staff of the opinion about the new leader surrounding the capital of the country they differed.
The straightforward person
In the idyllic small town Valje-de-Bravo, to example, they remember it with heat.
The inhabitants are putting him enlivening of tourism, the development of the resort sphere and the creation of the infrastructure in merit.
One may reach the town from the new highways, built g-om Penjya Njeto, which are strikingly different from the roads with the indents and the pits which were earlier in this place.
The plates with his name are hanging on the modern building of the sport center and in the interactive impressing museum dedicated to climatic changes.
"We connect the hopes of the real and serious changes to it", is saying his friend and from the institutional-revolutionary party (PRI) being headed by Penjya Njeto the political ally is Gabriel Oljvera Ehrnandes, the congressman of the staff.
We are expecting the real and decisive changes first of all in the field of security which are so sharply necessary for our country and economic development.
After 81 of continuous stay at authority the party PRI was forced out by Visente Foksom in 2000.
Congressman Oljvera will recognize, that after it the party is putting 12 summer absences from the presidential palace Los-Pinos high hopes of Ehnrike Penjya Njeto.
Moreover, it is refuting the accusations of vacuity which an opposition put forward to the new president.
It is really rectilinear and is betrayed to the matter of the realization of his sight of future really the countries.
This is an excellent statesman, and, above all, the person that can listen.
But in another part of the staff many people developed another conception about the former governor.
The municipal administration Nesaualjkoijotlj, well known also under name Sjyudad-Nesa, yavlyaet with himself the most striking contrast with the paved streets Valje-de-Bravo.
Hidden under the overpasses of the highways, it in many senses is a suburb of Mexico City itself.
Also the problems are also carrying the severe character of this megapolicy in the municipal administration.
It is for usmireniya of gangs which are dealing in the drugs in these districts earlier in this year, the troops were drawn; and the violence with regard to the women has a here especially sharp character.
On the wasteland a few dozens bodies of the women's dead were discovered directly by the vast dump only in the last two years.
More than a thousand women were killed by Mexico City in staff during the governorate of Mr Penjya Njeto - this exceeds the similar index in the town Sjyudad-Xuares which was sadly famous for violence the name of which became common after the speech is touching on the murder of the innocent women considerably.
According to the opponents of Mr Penjya Njeto, one can speak about it in better case, that during his stay in the governor's post it could not to manage the problem of the women's murder.
In the worst after all case they are accusing his administration of full ignoring of this problem.
The inhabitant of concrete house, similar to the majority of the houses in this decayed district, Irineya Buehndiya is holding back her tears with difficulty, showing me the photographs of its late daughter Mariany the Moon.
On Mariana official version in 2010 I/you/she carried out the suicide.
However her family thinks that her roommate killed it.
"When I reached her house, it "looked that" they "washed her body" in front of this" Mrs Buehndiya remembers.
Signs that they beat it were, and the body has already grown numb.
The mother of Mariany is retelling this history, and the daughter's portrait looks on us from the wall, where it is hanging next to the crucifix on which one word in total is traced: justice.
Namely this was denied, in their words, to this family.
"The officials of the staff treated me as with the old gossip, dissatisfied naruwiteljniceij of calmness.
They want the people simply to take on faith that they are speaking, and dipped all.
But this is wrong, it is so not right, in particular when all around so much violations and shortages is", she is speaking.
After putting on the presidential sling on Saturday, president Penjya Njeto together with it will claim difficult responsibility.
In the last six years dozens of thousands of families in Mexico have affected the crimes connected to a violence, and the new president promised to make the solution to this problem priority during his management.
I "hope that it will be the same president in an exact way to what was a governor" speaks Oljvera, the congressman from Valje-de-Bravo from the party PRI.
However families of the victims are most of all afraid namely of this in Sjyudad-Nesa.
Mehnning did not complain Brehdli on a bad circulation, he is declaring an accusation.
The accusers are trying to refute the statements Brehdli Mehnninga about the bad conditions of the contents under the guard.
The attention in the course of audition increased was being paid to stay Mehnninga in the war prison to Kvantiko, staff of Virdzhiniya.
The defense is demanding to close the matter on that basis, that the conditions of the conclusion of Mehnninga were cruel.
The armies of the USA are accusing the private of the robbery of a few thousand secret documents.
On Friday the accusation tried to prove that ordinary Brehdli Mehnning accused of the biggest escape of the materials classified as secret in history of the USA did not take advantage of the lot of the opportunities to give the complaint about the bad circulation which, according to his statement, he had occasion to bear being in the war prison.
During the cross-examination on prejudicial audition to Fort-Mide, staff of Maryland, the war major public prosecutor Ehwden Feijn declared that the recordings of the weekly attendances Mehnninga by the representatives of the administration of the prison in nine months of his contents into Kvantiko, staff of Virdzhiniya, do not contain the complaints about bad circulation.
The cross-examination within the framework of the consideration of the application of the defense for the discontinuation of the matter has been organized by Mehnninga according to the conditions of his conclusion being cruel and in itself a sufficient punishment for a next day after that, as Mehnning declared, what be under the guard, it intended to carry out the suicide.
The war specialist arrested in June 2010, in the analysis of the reconnaissance data is being accused of the robbery of a few thousand secret documents during the service in Iraq.
These materials were published subsequently in internet on the site of WikiLeaks.
The resource of WikiLeaks did not confirm that namely Mehnning was information source.
During audition on Friday public prosecutor Feijn glanced together with Mehnningom the reports which filled up after the attendances Mehnninga by the representatives of the administration during his stay in the prison Kvantiko, where there has been it on the conditions of the strict regime of the conclusion from July 2010, until April 2011.
The prisons during the attendances serving assigned questions Mehnningu and were writing down his answers.
After public prosecutor Feijn had asked about the reports on Friday, Mehnning recognized, that he appreciates the appeal to themselves on the side of the administration of the prison how "excellent", but the general conditions of the conclusion like "very professionally organized".
The reports looked at do not contain the complaints about bad circulation, in spite of the fact that Mehnninga asked about the conditions of his contents directly, is asserting Feijn.
Mehnning answered, that it expressed the oral uneasiness these problems and, that the representatives of the administration who visited it discussed these problems with it and were declaring that they will deal with them, but did not fix this in written form.
"They were writing down "the problems are missing" (after the discussion of my complaints) ", but this does not mean that I did not pick up this topic in talk" Mehnning is speaking.
The war judge, colonel Deniz Lind, also Mehnninga asked why that did not complain to the commission that was discussing suicidaljnye intentions which it has expressed in written form a few months before that about an illegitimate treatment of it in January 2011 during session.
Mehnning answered that during that session he wanted to achieve in order to they took the regime of "the warning of traumatism" off it and conditions softened conclusions.
The representatives of the war instruction explained that the limited regime of the conclusion - on a level is lower than the regime of the surveillance with the aim of the prevention of suicide - was brought for the prisoner's defense, as well as for the sake of the security of the other ones.
"I wanted to let know the administrations, that with me everything is the regime of the warning of traumatism in order, that they canceled... so that level improved my life, from my point of view", Mehnning explained.
On Thursday Mehnning testified to its arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where almost two months have contained it, in July 2010, before they translated into the prison in the naval base in Kvantiko, a staff of Virginia.
He announced that they emerged the thoughts about the suicide in Kuwait, and that once he lost it consciousness due to strong heat.
He explained that it is psychologically really heavy when they are not letting you know how your fate is deciding, and that is occurring in the outside world.
My peace shrank to the base Kehmp-Arifzhan, before the sizes of my prison , - Mehnning said on Thursday.
- I thought that I will die in this cage".
According to his statement, being in Kvantiko, Mehnning, I/you/he saw off the big portion of the time in the small camera tube - at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours per day are in the complete solitude.
A few objects of the clothes inform Mehnning that they let him leave only the mattress, the blanket, the slippers also the glasses.
He says that I/you/he was trying to move because sleep or the rules prohibited from being into daytime even simply.
In words Mehnninga, during the dream into the eyes for it constantly beat the light, penetrating from the outside the cameras tubes.
If the guards did not see his face when it was being turned over in the bed by the night then, according to his statement, they were waking it and forced to turn over on the back.
Lawyer Mehnninga gave the official objection concerning illegitimate circulation from the Mehnningom one in January 2011.
In April 2011, Mehnninga translated into the war prison in Fort-Livenvort, a staff of Kansas.
Moreover, the judge questioned Mehnninga about a statement about that which he did during testifying on Thursday on Friday, what after that, how once at night they forced it to sleep bared in his camera tube in Kvantiko, they forced it to be the bare ones in front of the guards and other prisoners on the morning check.
Mehnning declared that I/you/he did not have the opportunity to take refuge in the blanket during the check.
Answering the judge's questions on Friday, Mehnning said, that I/you/he understood from the guard's order that he has to throw the blanket in which could take refuge, but declared, that no one ordered to him directly to desert it.
On Thursday Mehnning declared, to show the officer which they blocked it previous at night to sleep bare due to his attempt, which it does not introduce to the danger for themselves.
Mehnning announced that told the officer, that could use the eraser band of the gym trousers or the slippers in order to traumatize itself, but I/you/he did not do this.
That night, according to evidence of Mehnninga they took his underwear, slippers and glasses from the camera tube.
His lawyers hope, what the judge, at least, it will take into consideration that it had to survive during conclusion, and he will decrease the period of the conclusion substantially, in case Mehnning will be recognized by the guilty court martial which has to begin the consideration of his business at the beginning of the next year.
The defense declared that it is planning on offering to declare the guilt in less serious crimes Mehnningu, and contesting the other accusations like the excessive ones.
The renewal of auditions is planned for these ones exit, it is expected that the side of accusation will insist on the conditions of the contents under the guard being justified.
Pentagon asserts that Kvantiko in accordance with the rules which regulate the maintenance of the prisoners with regime in a maximum way strict contained Mehnning.
The grant for the enemy, the illegal assistance for the publication of the data in internet, the communication are among the accusations put forward by Mehnningu, concerning national defense, also the robbery of state property or the documents.
If it will be condemned on all the indictment points, the life imprisonment can be in store for him.
My crisis of the national self-determination a story of the American of the Mexican origin is.
According to the author, many Mexicans had to abandon Mexico due to the absence of the opportunities to realize himself.
The Mexicans are inclined to blame those who left because they are reminding the inhabitants of the country of the complicated times.
Ruben Navarette thinks that the Mexicans of the American origin are torn among two cultures.
During the recent trip to Mexico City I fit through the corridor for the arriving ones, approached the zone of the border control and congealed on the spot.
The signs pointed out two lines: one for Mexicanos (the Mexicans), the second for Extranjeros (the foreigners).
I have been before them for a few seconds not knowing where to go.
I appeared in central California, also me all the life named a Mexican.
This is a simply conditional name, like a volume, as my friends in Boston they are calling themselves Irishmen, and the friends from New York consider themselves to be Italians.
I later dwelled on a complicated construction "American of the Mexican origin".
But I was in Mexico here.
There was no need of conditional names or complicated constructions, here, in my grandfather's home.
I was simple as an American.
I am speaking Spanish sufficiently well in order to ask the questions or it to answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than with the native speakers, and I can not get rid of American accent.
Therefore I got my American passport and became for line for Extranjeros.
I remembered this history a few days back after the elected president of Mexico Ehnrike Penjya Njeto again visited the White House and met with president Obamoij.
Questions which are usual for the meetings of the presidents of these countries stood on an agenda: immigration, the drugs and commerce.
President Penjya Njeto spoke about the raising of the Mexican economy thanks to which Mexicans are now, with the same success voluntarily, they will be able to stay in Mexico, instead of crossing over to the United States.
He wants to conclude the agreement about partnership with the USA and Canada and to create certain north-American trade block similar to the European Union.
Moreover, president Penjya Njeto promised to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, however any concrete proposals did not sound.
For Mexico of the relationship with the United States is heavy and carried out old insults a question.
The majorities of the Americans were never thoughtful about that that in 1848 the United States invaded a Mexico and forced her leaders to refuse half of their territory under the mouth of the guns.
But the Mexicans think centuries, and not minutes, they also see reminding of those events in all.
Therefore it is it only to some statesman of the USA to obmolvitjsya at least with the word of the critique in the direction of Mexico worth, in press and among the elite of the Mexican society after all the complaints on the Americans being encroaching upon the neighbors' sovereignty are heard here.
Also the descendants Montesumy preispolnyayutsya with bellicosity.
At the same time relationships of Mexico with more than 35 million Americans of the Mexican origin living in the USA are most complicated.
Do you want to talk about insults?
They are enough.
There are also those for whom such possibilities are not here winners and losers, people who find possibilities in this country for themselves in Mexico.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, the Phoenix, Denver or Dignity Anthony so many people of the Mexican origin only according to one reason: in some anybody - the father or the grandfather - did not have the opportunity to realize himself in Mexico the moment of their family history and had to set out to the north.
These were mostly Mexicans of the certain type - the dark-skinned small-formed of poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we are recalling this.
In Mexico they see this otherwise.
Today our life is the realization of the American dream, we were studying in the good schools and we established ourselves at a good work, but it will not be possible for us to forget that, that even this dream is American, and not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused and is unclear, but we know what country to consider its.
United States of America.
Moreover we know that the majorities of the representatives of Mexican elite and ruling class do not like us.
We are answering them like the same.
They see reminding of humiliating defeats in me and are related to us as to the people of second type, as to the unreal Mexicans.
We are speaking Spanish insufficiently well, and our connections with Mexico are insufficiently strong.
Our existence even is being explained by failures for them.
If our ancestors succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left.
We would not have turned up behind the silk curtain after finding full life in the USA, but after losing the spiritual touches now.
My wife was born in Gvadalaxare and I/you/she legally moved in the USA already in childhood, and this is reminding about among the real Mexicans and the Americans of the Mexican origin certain disputes existing me - the Mexicans more precisely understand their national identity, and the Americans of the Mexican origin are finding this vexing.
It the citizen of the USA and he thinks that it belongs to both of these countries.
At the same time many my familiar Americans of the Mexican origin do not feel accessories not to one of them.
We are listening to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but like also Bryusa Springstina.
Receiving the better of two peaces, you are inevitably losing the roots.
In Mexico we are Americans.
And in the USA they are calling us Mexicans.
As I cleared up during my trip as if our relationships without that are insufficiently tangled immediately some Mexican leaders and the representatives of the intellectuals want to restore the relationships with diaspora.
They want the Americans of the Mexican origin to work svoego roda as ambassadors of Mexico and interests to introduce it in the USA.
We could have told our friends American about that, which this the beautiful country and they could also have convinced the political leaders to strengthen the connections with Mexico as it to healthily be visited.
Aga, final.
Nothing will come out.
Too Many insults in the past.
BUT taking into consideration break among rich and poor, the revelry of corruption and narkotorgovli, many of us not at all think this country such a grass snake beautiful.
Excuse, but understand themselves this, amigos.
Also this is fair.
If the Mexicans' part can not forgive the United States' that up to now, they treated Mexico as them one and a half centuries ago, they will have to take on also that fact, what some Americans of the Mexican origin still in insult because of that, as quite recently they turned out with their relatives in Mexico.
It really yes.
Maybe, with us much in common seemed than me.
The old battles in the new Middle East
The agreement on the cease-fire among Israel and Xamas grouping becomes can fragile foundation for further peace
Is the long-term peace possible among the Arabs and the Israelis in the Middle East?
The next round of bloodshed encourages to conclusion concerning the futility of such hopes.
Are heard, the disputes becoming usual, absurd about the one who began the first; the mass of the buildings are turned into the ruins; 140 Palestinians most of whom civilians, and six Israelis put together are killed; for the first time during conflict, the rockets that were let out from the territory of the Gaza Strip fell down in the environments of the capital of Israel of Tel Aviv and the sacred Jerusalem town.
However in spite of the fact that the Israelis and the Palestinians got stuck in their immemorial conflict, on the Middle East hopelessly came the changes.
One can belong to this differently, however the events of "the Arabic spring" twirled in the rebellious storm the mass of the real facts which stabilized, the Israelis and also the Palestinian was not managed to stay in the side from whirl, shook the region.
Possible, as a result, the earlier their fight will become even more sanguinary.
However reasons which give hope on an exit from this fatal dead end exist.
War without the winners
The situation which at first developed does not give causes for optimism.
Even if the cease-fire will be fulfilled the agreement on which was signed on 21st November, the clashes which occurred this week only strengthened the positions of the workers from both of the sides.
The leaders of the Islamist Xamas movement coming to the authority in the Gaza Strip in 2007 will declare from their forcing Israel to recede from view, despite the losses that were suffered by them.
In spite of the fact that they were destroyed some leaders of the grouping, and blockaded 1.7 million the inhabitants in one of the most densely populated and problem corners of our planet, Israel did not manage to destroy Xamas.
As a matter of fact Xamas is growing its popularity in the West Bank - yet another Palestinian territory which is checked by the more moderate movement Fatx at present.
Furthermore, the leaders can Xamas completely come to the conclusion that the time works for them.
According to the growth of the influence of the Islamist movements Arabic peace at Xamas emerge the new influential and rich friends.
The regional reviving leader appeared Turkey which once was the nearest ally of Israel among the Moslem countries with a support Xamas; Qatar, one of the richest states and the dynamically developing states of Persian Gulf, followed her example.
The triumphing supporters declare is Xamas about the creation around Israel of Islamist half a month from Lebanon in the north in which a paramilitary grouping Xezbolla is governing, to Syria in which the always более pro-Islamists rebels will overthrow the authority Assad's Bawara any moment and then to Jordan, where Xamasa allies are threatening the king's authority.
The most considerable change of the balance of the forces in the region occurred on the southern boundaries of Israel, in the most densely populated and important Arabic country, in Egypt, where in front of president Mohammed Mursi the influence of the movement became stronger the Brothers Moslem.
Xosni Mubarak who has governed Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator not paying a particular attention to support Xamas.
The brothers Moslem are organization, on the contrary, in many respects similar from Xamas, but their leaders are inclined to populism.
In the future diplomatic arrangements Xamas becomes can an important player whose voice even Israel and America will not manage to muffle.
At the same time the supporters of the "hard" line will come to the opposite conclusions in Israel.
In war sense Xamas be poverzhen.
The Israeli antimissile "Iron cupola" system justified the outlay on her creation and successfully destroyed many of neglected Xamas of the rockets.
The citizens of Israel can sleep calmly, at least some time.
As for diplomacy, the USA remained true its fixed position; many European countries also put the blame in the beginning of the last round of violence on the Xamas.
An economic prosperity of Israel is another important factor, in the peculiarity under the government of Netanyahu's Binjyamina who ignored the peace process to a considerable degree.
In spite of the fact that since 2004 about 30 Israelis died of the rockets turned out from the territory of the Gaza Strip Israel managed to reduce the condemned man-terrorists' problem to the minimum, partly at the expense of the wall which is dropping by the territory of the West Bank - the considerable part of the unrecognized Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements which continue to expand despite the unlawfulness of such actions from the point of view of international legislation.
The position of Netanyahu's prime minister whose party is Likud within the framework of preparation for the elections which were planned for the 22nd January - I/you/she united with the conservatives even more aggressively more incited under leadership of Avigdora Libermana, I/you/she is extremely convenient.
What sense in pandering to the Palestinians and giving to them is its own state?
If to give all the authority in the territory of the West Bank to their hands, did they begin to launch the missile from there in the direction of Israel as their co-workers are doing this in the Gaza Strip?
It is better to hold them behind the wall and to overwhelm hard just any attempt to pick up the heads.
It is possible, the supporters of the "hard" line will gain victory; however their calculations can be refuted by the Arabic spring.
Under that, that the Islamists are testing who are coming to power in Egypt and other countries not the warmest feelings towards Israel, inner problems will become their priority task.
The defense part of the budget of Israel is greater than at all his Arabic neighbors taken together.
The unbundling of the war against regional superpower will scarcely help the governments of the Arabic countries to strengthen their own economy.
The pragmatism of the president of Egypt, Mursi which jointly worked on cease-fire with Barak Obamoij is good sign and can mark himself the beginning of changes.
Israel, into not smaller degree, it has to take the long-term consequences of his policy into consideration.
According to the onset of the democratic changes in the Arabic countries, the deprivation of the Palestinians of the right to self-determination is the time bomb which will burst in the territories that were being occupied by Israel sooner or later, like the bus blown up in Tel Aviv this week.
The repressions already undermine the principles of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and demographic aspect - the growth of the Arabic population - it is redoubling these problems only.
One has to pay for the sanguinary operations which are being conducted in the territory of the Gaza Strip for the suppression of the Xamas movement every a few years in the growing dissatisfaction of the international association.
Both of the sides are needing an external impulse
The only decision which the sensible representatives from both of the sides are incessantly calling to remains, as well as the big part of the remaining one is a target and our newspaper: the formation of two states and concession by Israel of the territories in exchange for security.
The hope, not the too impressive one in short-term perspective, does not remain - the hope cease-fire allowing the other countries to influence the sides of conflict more efficiently.
Are to Egypt which for a long time it has been for time to make the decision to cover the deliveries of the weapons to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar available as never, advantage in order that to convince Xamas to recognize the boundaries of the Jewish state taken from 1967 with the account-taking of the exchange of the territories and the resource sharing of Jerusalem.
The other Arabic countries also have to apply the efforts to the reconciliation of Xamas movements and Fatx.
This would have done more for the creation of the Palestinian state than the vote lying ahead in the UN the result of which an acknowledgment of the virtual nationhood of Palestine becomes can.
Also president Obama has to play his role in usaditj Israel behind the negotiating table.
In his first period it tak i ne did not present his own plan of the peace settlement.
After return to the White House it has been showing as before the reluctance to be joined to the solution to the present problem.
This is a catastrophically shortsighted position.
The United States vitally are interested in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the event of the peace agreement among Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia the law on the unified packaging for the cigarettes came into effect.
The warnings about the harm of smoking and the representations of the parts of the body struck by the diseases are constrastingly being picked out on the melancholy green cardboard boxes, equal for all the brands of the cigarettes.
The first in world practice Australian law on the packaging of the cigarettes and the tobacco products of the same kind came into effect replacing the logotypes and the colored get-up of the different marks the equal cardboard box in a melancholy way-оливкового цвета with the weird photos of the parts of the body struck by the illness and the children's representations the health of which their parents' smoking podorvano.
Apart from different pictures and the inscriptions that are giving advance notice of the harm of smoking the only distinction between the bundles brought in obligatory order since this Saturday is the titles of the marks which are printed by the equal small font.
These are the most severe in the peace of condition for the get-up of the packagings of the tobacco products.
The Federal Government of Australia is declaring, what is the goal of this measure to keep young people from smoking, the lichen this harmful habit of the stylish status.
Results of the researches that showed served as a basis for such a decision what the people, begun to smoke up to 26 years, in 99 cases from 100 so never and they are not becoming smokers.
It "is evident, that the children understand even at a youngest age" a Health Secretary Tatyana Plibersek is explaining "the sense which is trying to bring the tobacco companies with the help of the get-up of the packaging", referring to the researches that showed that, for example, the crown is being associated with the princess' idea in logotype with the children.
Australia is one of the countries with the least in the peace of the smokers' shares so these changes will not effect the profit of the transnational corporations especially, however also the other countries have already discussed the possibility of the acceptance of the similar measures.
The representatives of the tobacco industry strengthenedly counteracted the passage of this law.
The tobacco companies assert that this will only increase the share of the black market in which the cheap and accessible cigarettes will be sold.
This law will lead to serious consequences, different from those, who were thoughtful his initiators", Skott Makintaijr, the representative of the company British American Tobacco in Australia, is counting.
The producers of counterfeit production of China and Indonesia will deliver much more such goods for the sale in the streets of Australia.
For somebody the new laws contribute to the growth of business, on the contrary.
Sandra Xa from small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd asserts, what the demand for cigarette cases and silikonovye cases, hidden the unpleasant pictures on the packaging, I/you/he precipitantly appeared (from practically zero) ever since two months ago such companies as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the matter in the high court of Australia, to appeal where tried present law.
In words Sandry Xa, company Zico already realized the order of six thousand products the wholesale establishments and he is expecting the new party.
For us this is a good business.
A popularity of the social nets among namely that part of the population which these measures are directed towards is potential disturbance for the effectiveness of the similar measures, according to the experts.
After the acceptance there are cigarettes in a conspicuous place in Australia of the series of laws, the sport measures that made illegal the television commercial of the cigarettes and the support with them, as well as prohibiting to the sellers from putting out, the advertisement of the tobacco products moved in Internet.
The government of Australia prohibited to local companies and the web sites from putting the advertisement in a net, but it can not limit the foreign sites to this.
"If you are dealing in the tobacco products and only this small loophole remained with you, the idea to move its product will seem extremely tempting to you in internet", Beki Friman is explaining investigating matters of public health in the University of Sydney.
Frimen is noting the growth of the number of the reviews on trade marks written from the person of the supposedly average users, in such social nets as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
A question arises: this is really a handiwork of the row citizen who that I/you/he did not feel sorry for the forces and the time and videorolik made, or behind this an advertising agency is likes the cigarettes Marlboro so much?
The Australian department of the company British American Tobacco asserts that now in branch more are taken up by the adjustment to new rules than by the advertisement.
The representatives of the tobacco industry went even on such measures as the sponsoring of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the contestation of the new rules: these states are expressing the dissatisfactions within the framework of World Trade Organization reporting that that the commerce was exposed unjust restrictions, in spite of the fact that the trade relations of all these countries with Australia are extremely unimportant.
The decision of the WTO is being expected to the middle of 2013.
According to Tatyana Plibersek, the government discussed the possibility of the passage by them of the analogous laws on the packaging with some other countries.
In 2001 Canada of first brought the obligatory allocation of the photographs that are giving advance notice of the harm of smoking.
Now this rule is taken on in more than 40 countries, among them in Brasilia, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of the stiffening of the laws is being discussed in Great Britain, New Zealand, SA and India.
The great number of the smokers in Australia is demonstrative do not obey the innovations.
These pictures do not touch me.
I am simply not turning attention.
You "are whipping out the cigarette simply and you are hiding a bundle into the pocket", Victor is explaining Beer Xeijg buying the cigarettes with the photograph of the tumor of the oral cavity on the bundle.
Speaking honestly, only, that it can force me to quit - this to be it my small daughter.
James Iju, the the shop of the tobacco products of King of the Pack in the center of Sydney manager, asserts that the equal packaging complicated the task of the arrangement of the goods in the shelves
I/you/he "went to the unloading of the new party "earlier with me an hour, but now for four hours": he is complaining.
"The government needed to take and quite to prohibit from cigarettes, we would have said at that time: what after all doing all right, always is finished, we are closing a shop", he is saying throwing hands up.
To be bored in the peace of electronic nets and the constant connections is not so bad.
On this Day of thanksgiving I suddenly have had to spend five hours in the airport because the mechanical disagreement happened to our plane and replaced it with another plane which we also waited for.
In this way, I had enough time on reflections about the nature of boredom.
I will not deceive you.
Half a day in the airport in the expectation of flight is really boring, and here neither the books, nor the magazines, neither iPhone, nor even the shops of the free trade, will strongly help.
However recently more and more learned ones and specialists in children's development are speaking out for the benefit of boredom.
They are saying which to be bored not so bad in certain situations for us and for our children.
This is forcing its brain to be distracted on interesting adjacent topics, that contributes to creation, possibly.
And in so far as there are constantly we all in front of some screen in the modern peace, the advantages of boredom are going past us.
Perhaps for us necessary strive to boredom?
Yes.
Also at the same time it no not no.
We will still return to this.
Earlier I, as well as many, I/you/she thought that boredom is the invention about the recent times, when with the people more spare time has appeared.
This not so, the author of the book "Fascinating history" of boredom" is asserting Piter of Thuya, the professor of Greek and Roman history of the Canadian University of Calgary, (Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011.).
"As a matter of fact boredom can really brag about ancient history", he is saying.
On the walls in Pompeyax the Latin inscriptions about boredom are discovered, dated the first century.
At the same time the question about how we understand boredom remains open.
Problem in that, a John is speaking D. Istvud, the associate professor of the University Ijork in Ontario, Canada, what understanding and the sight of boredom changed often.
After studying the materials of the researches on this topic and zadav a question to goal group into 100 people, the professor of Istvud and his co-worker came to the next definition: boredom is when the people "want, but they are not able to do what would bring them a satisfaction".
The difference between boredom and apathy, he is speaking, consists in that that the person being bored is not doing something, that I/you/he would want to make.
It not to do anything with apathy is not desirable.
Main thing is in the boredom to be experienced, he is saying, this "the violation of attention and connected to this the deterioration of mood and the sensation that the time is stretching slowly".
On description boredom can seem very similar to depression.
However professor Istvud asserts that the people being bored despite the possible connection between these states, see the causes of the problems in the environment and circumstances, and the people who are experiencing a depression see the problems in themselves.
Sometimes it seems to us that it is boring for us when as a matter of fact it is for us simply difficult to concentrate on something.
In its research there is "Unoccupied reason: the definition of the boredom from the point of view of attention", refer published in the September issue of the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, professor Istvud with the co-workers on the experiment more conducted earlier the participants of which listened to the recording of the voice that is reading magazine.
One participants also heard the loud sounds of the television program not belonging to a matter included in the neighboring room, the other ones heard the same sounds on the low one loudness, so one hardly could analyze them, and the third group listened only to the recording of the voice without the foreign sound track.
Those participants, who heard a television from loudness level low, they were noting, that they found boring, is more frequent than the other ones - it it was difficult to concentrate, but they did not know reason this and they were attributing this to boredom.
When we are trying to concentrate attention on a difficult or fascinating task, the interruption of attention can cause boredom, Mark of J is saying. Fenske, the associate professor of the neurology in the Guelph's University, Ontario, and one of the authors of the present research.
"For example, on the other hand, "looking at the stream of the products on the conveyor belt in the search of the marriage the diverting music can help to avoid boredom" after we are doing uninteresting something.
He is taking into consideration, it continues, that when the people begin to rock on the chair or draw the caraculs on the sheet of paper, they are doing this from boredom, we now however know, that as a matter of fact such actions help not to grow weak physically simply.
"The research showed that the children who they are not forbidding to fidget and to rotate are studying better and remember more information than the children who are demanding to sit quietly of" is asserting professor Fenske.
At some all the moments we have felt boredom: on the delay of flight (as in my case), listening to the monotonous speech glancing through the uninteresting film.
However different people are showing a different degree of the penchant for boredom.
In 1980 for the measurement of such individual specifics the researchers worked "the special scale of the penchant for boredom" out.
For example, questions and assertions are being used for the definition of the grade in such a scale "a great deal from what my having to make is monotonous and monotonous" or "For me "too a great deal interesting, therefore the time does not suffice for anything".
With the help of such questionnaires the researchers determined that the boys are bored more often than the girls, is saying Stiven Vodanovich, the professor of the psychology in the University of Western Florida, - in peculiarity in the presence of the diverse external irritants.
In general, however as a whole teenagers are often bored.
In 1991 Rid Larson, the professor of the personal and social development in the University of Illinois, conducted the experiment in the course of which he was involved with the help of the beeper hardly with 400 teenagers and their parents of 7-8 times a day.
It received the following results: 32% of the teenagers reported that they are finding boring in the school and reported that during the fulfillment of homework, and 23% that they are finding boring beyond the limits of the school.
At the same time only 3% of the parents noted that it is boring for them.
Professor Larson notes that he does not have any data about what similar data about boredom would soon be 21 years later.
Mainly however he knows that "the peak of the penchant for boredom is falling on podrostkovyij age" because they are not allowing the children and the teenagers to decide to the complete extent that to deal them.
We will return to my initial question: is boredom useful?
Sometimes it no not no because in extreme manifestations she can encourage the people to the absurd and dangerous physical actions, some risky reckless games or the abuse of certain substances in the attempts to get rid of boredom as they show the researches.
On the other hand, many philosophers and the writers were thoughtful about the connection between boredom and creation, is saying professor Vodanovich having devoted more than two decades to the research of this problem.
"Like that our brain explains to us that one should begin another something; this is also boredom", is saying Gehri Markus, the professor of psychology, in the New York university.
However he has always not known his this very brain, to be done namely better.
If you will find boring and will direct this energy towards the playing on the guitar or some culinary experiences, will do for yourselves better.
However if you will watch a television, for you will become is better only for some time, and soon this will go.
Therefore, if your child is bored and you are giving him iPad, it will stop being bored, however he will not learn to fight boredom with another way to operate its time and employment independently or somehow, professor Fenske is speaking.
"But such skills of the independent control will be put into operation in most different situations", he is asserting.
Your child is learning not only independently to keep himself with something busy, he is also studying self-control, in general.
I do not think that it is necessary somehow to prevoznositj boredom.
It is not it however also to consider it something bad worth.
One should rather learn even to feel comfortably out of the continuous stream of the actions and technologies.
Professor Istvud is agreeing with this.
"We see this so that we should feel boredom more often under that that boredom is the extremely unpleasant, unquenchable wish to begin something sensible", he is speaking.
As a matter of fact the people are striving to be becoming disconnected somehow from constant concerns and to grow weak simply.
"In the modern peace we got used to the constant excessive stimulation of the organs of feelings, he is saying, is but when silence is beginning, we are disappearing and do not know what to do".
While it is incomprehensible as the new law on the legalization of marihuana will be used in the staff of Colorado
Ehntoni is Orosko, the nineteen-year-old player of the football team and the student of the public college in the southeast of the staff of Colorado is accused of the accomplishment of the criminal offense that consists in that that soon it will be absolutely legal in the whole territory of the staff: the storage of the small portion of marihuana and pipe in which he smoked it.
G-n Orosko says that once the friends and it was in Lamare in September and went directly by the border between Kansas in the car on the prairie when the police officers stopped them.
After the police officer discovered marihuana in the car, Mr Orosko got a writ of summons for the storage of the drugs and possession of adaptation for the use of the drugs - the small infringements for each of which the penalty at the rate of 100 dollars is owed - and the date of the legal proceedings is fixed.
"They treat us as with the criminals", is saying Mr Orosko.
But the criminal is really it?
As a result of the uncertainty which has continued already for a few weeks after the staff of Colorado voted for the legalization of the use of the marihuana in the small quantities for entertainment the decision of the hundreds of the small cases depends not so much on a law, as on the place of examination.
The accusations of the small infringements connected to marihuana are already taken off in hundreds of cases here also in the Washington staff which took analogous measure.
The police stations have stopped already putting forward accusations the people for the storage of low doses at the age of 21, which will be considered legal as soon as in a couple of weeks the law will come into effect, in an also older way.
However in the more conservative districts of Colorado the accusers made the decision to discuss the existing matters connected to marihuana draw and on former to responsibility for the storage of this drug.
At the same time they are voting on the West in some towns from the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous districts behind not admitting the appearance in their places of the shops new, licensed by the staff on the sale of the marihuana.
All this "is developing so precipitantly that I do even not know" what "waiting for is further", is saying Dehniel of J. In the small town Avrora is Outs, a chief of police in the east from Denver.
The representatives of the inspectorates are also in a staff of Washington the heads is puzzled pochesyvayut.
They have to form the rules for the definition of the procedure of the licensing of the raising, the processing, the spreading and the sale of the marihuana, and it is necessary to do all this until December 1, 2013.
They are speaking, what Colorado, this is good or bad, most of other staff is overtaking for medical purposes, but now for entertainment in the settlement of matters of use of marihuana, at first.
"There is a more regulated market in Colorado, therefore they will serve as a good example", is explaining Braijan I. Smit, the representative of Counsel on the control of production and the market of alcoholic production is in a staff of Washington.
But now no one can do more, Mr Smit recognizes, to move out some proposals and to hope that this will start up like what.
"We do not have any real precedent which we could orient ourselves towards", he is saying.
The bill of the staff of Washington named by I-502 will enter due to the 6th December and will drive the staff into the state of uncertainty when the system of the state licensing has not been here yet for whole year, and right of possession is already legalized by the marihuana.
BUT the complicated technical aspects have still existed, however, which is necessary to solve in this period, for example, how find equilibrium among the disposal of the staff about "adequate access" to licensed marihuana with prohibition of trade of it in the distance of 1000 feet from the schools, the parks, the play grounds and the nursery schools.
He will especially complicatedly put the licensed the commerce with marihuana in the boundary of the towns, in particular in Seattle businesses and it the suburbs", Ben Livingston is explaining, the representative created recently research group "Center of the legalization of marihuana".
On 21st November the chief of police Outs has distributed the message about that that the Public Prosecutor's Office of the town will not draw her persons any more, attaining the age 21 to his subordinates by e-mail of Avrory for a year, to responsibility for property, and what stops with the small quantity of marihuana police to accuse people of some present violations "starting in this moment".
The chief of police Outs announced that the police will follow the observance in the town of the rules regulating the activity of the persons, for medical purposes raising marihuana, and will pursue illegal merchants and the spreaders of the drugs.
The district attorney Uehld in the north of Colorado, Tank Ken, is presenting a stricter approach for this question.
After vote on bill he declared, that the Public Prosecutor's Office will hold for a possession of marihuana responsible as before, mainly in order that to incite the using ones to complete the course of treatment her faces.
At present moment the accusations of the storage of two and less than ounces of marihuana are made to 119 persons although many of them are being accused also of some other violations.
I/you/he said, "the duty of our institution is to pursue because of the actions which are considered criminal at the moment of their accomplishment", Mr the Tank in its statement.
The reaction was ambiguous even in such places as the village district Mesa, where the participants of the vote turned down the proposal about the legalization of marihuana.
The Grandee police of Dzhankwn, city even in the neighborhood, it is not holding the majors for a property responsible any more the small quantity of drug.
The district public prosecutor Pit Xautcinger supported this decision, but also decided not to take off the accusations in already open matters connected to the storage of marihuana.
"I am counting, what an observance of the law to provide as long as while it will not be changing is our direct duty", he is saying.
In spite of the fact that 55% of the inhabitants of the staff of Colorado taking part in the vote kept up this decision, switching on of matters of use of the marihuana for entertainments into state and legal system will not be simple.
And the contradictory reaction of the inhabitants in different places of the staff bared the ambiguity of the relationship of the local authorities to the experiment of the staff with marihuana.
He is explaining, "In this question the district public prosecutors exists a cultural barrier", Won Makalister, the denverskiij lawyer that is presenting the convicts' interests for the storage of marihuana, and the local representative of the National organization of the reform of laws for marihuana.
"They have been persecuting people because of this so for a long time that now they properly can come to terms with that that this is already not crime", he is speaking.
To Colorado and to Washington - the first staff in which belong to the small quantity of marihuana just as as to alcohol - is predestined to become the experimental field on the scales of the country for the check of the very idea of the legalization of the drugs.
The supporters of legalization and the officials of the staff are planning on enlarging the territory of the legalized commerce, but at the same time they with care wait instructions from federal the authorities which have been planning as before on considering the sale and the raising of marihuana as federal crime.
The supporters of the legalization of marihuana hope that judicial authority will be inferior in this question.
For medical purposes despite a few good gave the cases receiving the wide resonance of the arrests of the merchants and the patients, using marihuana on medical evidences, the Federal Government in majority on a commerce with marihuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other staff.
The agents of the Office for the fight against the drugs will scarcely burst into the houses in order to confiscate the small packet of marihuana, however they will almost shut their eyes to the shops of the recreational marihuana which new law is resolved, Kevin A. Sabet is counting, the former adviser on matters of fight against the drugs is in the administration Obamy being regulated by the authorities of the staff.
Some towns did not wait for the activities of the federal authorities in Colorado.
Already before the presidential elections some local administrations approved the moratorium for the opening of the new shops on the sale of the marihuana which anyhow would not have managed to open earlier than in a year.
Last week Montrouz, the town in the western part of the staff, put forward on the examination six-month prohibition of trade with marihuana, which, in all probability, will be approved a next week.
"We do not want to turn up in such a position that we will deliver a license to somebody, but then this will cause the serious problems at the federal level", is saying Bob Nikolson, member of town council.
Our town voted against this correction.
Also now with us the contradiction between the results of the local vote and that what a staff voted for is available.
Still very many unresolved problems are left behind.
Petronella Uaijehtt: they survived me from Oxford behind my being a conservative.
The pursuits of the students of the universities behind their looks began not today.
How much I remember myself, I always dreamed to act to the Oksfordskiij university.
My father and my older brother were studying in Oxford and an educational establishment, a modern counterpart of the ancient symposium imparting two principles of civilization were describing it as the better one in the peace - freedom of thought and tolerance.
Both nevertheless, two weeks later studies are on the historic faculty of the Vusterskogo college of the Oksfordskogo university at the end of the eightieth, I gathered the suitcases and I/you/she went away as what developed into the first real scandal in my life.
My father did not withstand and began to cry.
The friends were confused.
The newspaper The Evening Standard asserted that I gave up the college because I did not like that my odnokursniki are dealing with sex in the neighboring room.
Writer Eh. the Norman Uilson was playing around, that I left because I had to drink out of the qerbatyx cups.
As a matter of fact everything was not funnily so.
I ran.
Yes, I/you/she ran because they systematically etched me and intimidated.
Not at all due to my quite unusual name or that that I was studying in the private school.
They etched me only according to one reason, and in this cradle of prosveqennosti brought glory to this looked like real cruelty and a blind fanaticism: my father, nowadays was late Vudro Uaijehtt, a well known adviser Margaret Tehtcher, also I myself was the conservatives' adherent.
Will you ask why after all to remember this now?
According to the last data, the students' new generation keeping to right-centrist views is exposed to the same hunting.
This hatred institutionalized and constantly growing against the students-conservative in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same defense of its rights as that which is being granted to the invalids, sexual and ethnic minorities.
The conservatives are declaring their Body Kristi from the student club of the college in Cambridge, what them "actively isolate often, subject to personal attacks and they are forcing to feel like undesirable guests" due to their political looks.
They want to bring the additional representative to the committee according to equal rights of the college in order to provide the freedom of the expression of their opinion.
The documentary about the politician in student Wednesday which left 2 to BBC recently redoubled their situation only "The wonderland: young, smart and right", in which they introduced the conservatives the eccentrics and the neonazis.
A film was shown in by Dzho Kuk, the former president of the Association of the conservatives of the Oksfordskogo university which is going in rolls-roijse is taking a silver suit and the walking stick with the silver knob.
In other universities the students conservative are complaining, that of them they do "the scapegoats due to the rise in the charge for studies".
The hatch of Blehk, 20 years, the vice-president of the Association of the conservatives of the Nottingemskogo university, in the interview of one of Sunday newspapers said that "in university Wednesday the warp in the direction of the left looks is increasing.
The people who do even not know us consider us to be impertinent beforehand also with impunity the parents, rich in the wild children".
Sehmyuehl Roberts, 21 years, the student of the historic faculty of the college the Body Kristi in whom the petition about the intensification of the defense was given calls such an atmosphere "comfortless", but Stefani Cherill, 19 years, the new president of the conservatives' Association of the university Oksfordskogo, he says that the relationship of the members of the student club to the carriers of the right-centrist looks worsened considerably.
This is the threat both for the atmosphere of the intellectual discussion and simply for normal life of the members of the club", she is saying.
A few first weeks in Oxford I was not simple in minority, I was alone.
I entered there in September 1986, the shy and shy eighteen-year-old girl.
Excited Oxford from hatred against the conservative party.
In a year before this the university deprived with vote the alumna Margaret Tehtcher of her honorary degree due to the reduction of the budget allocations by university education.
In such an atmosphere it would be even comfortless stalinistam.
Into the freshman's first weekdays, after the students are meeting themselves and the lecturers, I felt that expected me ahead for the first time.
I have not known yet that the lecturers turned a blind eye not only to the conservative-students' hunting, however, took themselves part in it with pleasure.
The political questions are the miners' strike, a privatization and the disagreement of the government: the sanctions against the government of apartheid to be used in SA they penetrated through the walls of the auditories sheathed by the wooden panels.
On my first seminar I should translate the French text of the eighteenth century into the English, and I was not ready to what followed this.
"Miss Uaijehtt, is a lecturer said, nowadays the late Garri Pitt, please, translate the first paragraph".
The text came to me with difficulty, I faltered.
Garri Pitt was person, similar to the cake, and a very gall person.
"Tehtcheristy is fundamental do not teach the French or the brains" do not "suffice" for them simply?" - he asked.
Other students began to giggle.
With me in front of the eyes tears appeared.
"I am advising you to take a few initial French lessons to a spare time if, of course, you are not not really busy revolving in society": Pitt probryuzzhal.
I returned absolutely unhappy to my room.
In that evening in the college I sat alone at dinner; then somebody slapped me on his shoulder.
This was James, the student of second course from the faculty of English who appeared as his member of the Association of the conservatives of the university.
"I know who you, is he said friendly.
- Unfortunately, the situation is as follows:
above each, who they are suspecting of likings for the conservatives, they will scoff.
For me myself is difficult, and in your case they know, that your father is close to Margaret Tehtcher, therefore will be you more complicated.
The majorities of the freshmen conservative are pretending, that they are Labourites".
Later, in the local pub, I tried to dissemble in a cowardly way.
I was insisting on that that I/you/she is not agreeing with all, that Margaret Tehtcher is speaking.
Slyness did not turn out well.
The freshman of the faculty of the philosophy, the politicians and the economies, studied which himself in Itone, said: "You are the daughter of the fascist pig.
You are infectious".
Other students joined in his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
"How are the conservatives dealing with sex? - One of them asked.
- They are beating each other, really?"
I felt so, as, probably, the homosexuals felt before the abolition of the prosecution in the sixties.
Will I be able to live for normal life in Oxford sometime?
Or will I have to meet with the like-minded persons only under the cover of the night?
I will really be must to become leijboristkoij and to hide its present convictions?
Three years which lie ahead of me have started seeming like the hell, complete of the persecutions and solitude.
Norman Stoun, the professor of modern history, was the only lecturer not hiding his conservative views in my college.
They hated it not only for accessories for the conservatives, however, behind that, that it was an adviser Tehtcher on matters of foreign policy also to one of her spichraijterov.
In the college it did practically not appear.
It despised it for provincialjnostj, pettiness and adherence marksistsko-deterministskomu view on history.
In 1997 he took on the professorial post in the university Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"Here you will not be happy", he told me.
I started going to Oxford from the parental home in London trying to find the refuge among the relatives and the unpreconceived metropolitan friends.
I told the father that I hate Oxford and explained reason.
He did not confide to me.
During his studies just any political look was being accepted in the forties there.
"However, just the same the better university in the peace , - he said mournfully.
- There of such a are not capable, only not in the town of the dozing capstans...
Even my friends-communist always behaved irreproachably".
His moist eyes became cloudy.
Do not make the hurried decisions.
I am convinced, that this is simple jokes.
You will break my heart "if you will give up the university".
I was worn out by the constants the trips to London and my emotional defense weakened.
My friend, also the conservative, did not withstand the pressure and refused his convictions.
A next week during seminar, when the next lecturer of history absolutely seriously named me "an enemy of the people", I decided to act just as.
In the shower burning from shame, I confessed, what "washed out for me "the brains the parents", I/you/she also named them "dotards".
The breather was brief.
The last nail into the cover of the coffin of my career in Oxford was to drive ordained by fate my father.
At that time he wrote two columns each for the editions which belong to Rupertu Merdoku every week.
My door was locked.
I did not leave, and five minutes later my persecutors gave up themselves.
When they left, after all I gathered the suitcase and the villages on the first the train to London.
Tak i ne I did not return.
You can call me a cry-baby and a rag.
But at the age of eighteen years no one has to become the object of such a spite and the intimidations in the educational establishment.
That pechaljnee, that this was Oxford which not only turned out fourteen prime ministers of the Tory, however, which is hiding po seij denj behind the undeserved reputation of the university which they value equality and freedom of thought in.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
About "the" exhibition "Valentino: the skilled worker of the sewing", which opened up this week in London, ABC is talking to Nati Abaskalj, Fionoij Tissen-Bornemica and other well known customers of the Italian designer
Somerset-xaus, the former residence of the English queen of Elizabeth I, the only place in the British capital, the place which is worthy to take the exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer declared this "Valentino" during opening: the skilled worker of sewing", the triumphal retrospective exhibition which unites more than 130 dresses of the high fashion created by his "house" during the last 50 years.
"I am adoring this palace", he with his unique Italian accent is saying.
This exhibition is the final part of history, the only personage of which is "ilj signor" Garavani, however she might not have been written without his famous customers.
Valentino has felt like the rare and distant enchanted peace of the nobility always.
In the first hall of this exhibition, opened until the 3rd March, personal letters and photographs during the signature of the most distinguished aristocrats, from the princess Salimy Aga-Xan before the lord Snoudona, including Mari-Wantalj, the princess of Greece abound, also Margaret, the princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories like the booty of its social raising: from the modest tailor from the town Vogera is in the north of Italy before the idol of the international "elite".
To be in love with the royal yard: there is nothing bad in this.
"They are not extinguishing the cigarette butts of their cigarettes against your splendid carpet" even if "as some beautiful stars of the pop music are doing this" is saying baroness Fiona Tissen-Bornemica.
In 60th and 70th both of us lived in Alps and both of were good friends.
Valentino is a matchless proprietor and is receiving the guests with generosity and elegance.
All of "us were really liked to come in his wale in Gwtaade", is explaining the former wife "Xaijni" Tissen, the intimate of the forgotten beauties like Marelly Anjelli or Eugenia Niarxos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
Also despite this it is a star.
Valeriya Macca presenting Valentino
Valery Macca Argentinian model remembers the charismatic fashion designer.
Once we went to have supper to his place wash, was this after the presentation of the fashions in the area of Spain in Rome, many years ago.
Wehron Stoun and a John Kennedi - the minor were among twenty invited ones.
Style was seen in all by Valentino - in every component of his apartment, in her decoration, in the food, in music.
To each of the guests Valentino hit to feel important and dear", he remembers "a top-the model the work of which began with the fashion designer in Paris in 1995 during a Week of the high fashion.
"It never goes out of style because she is finishing his sketches - these are present works of art.
The parade of the pedigrees
Life Garavani is story of not oderzhimosteij, but vlyublennosteij with the complete mutuality.
He likes the people with good education and high titles, and they like it.
One of the galleries was turned into the glamurnyij podium of sixty meters in length which offers the change of roles by Somerset-xaus: the visitor is taking up the place of the models and has to file on the podium contemplating the "spectators" from dreams who have been shining with the masterpieces from Valentino as the dress, who I/you/she chose Zhaklin Kennedi for her wedding with Aristotle Onassisom, the suit which Monica Vitti used in "the night", or the overcoat from wool and leather, which belonged the empress the Headlight Diba.
In this public from models such names as Luxembourgian Sibilla, Gloriya blestayut the Rate Turn und background, Mette-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia are Gabsburg.
Nati Abaskalj and the fashion designer, in 2006
Many of these customers say that is first Valentino like the first love, "it is impossible to forget".
I remember it excellently.
These were trousers, a T-shirt, "a waistcoat" and a jacket from collection autumn-winter 1971-1972.
This, one of the designer's muses, "was the gift which he did for me" is telling to Nati Abaskalj.
I "prefer it to the remaining ones for his femininity, for his big love for the women because he is emphasizing our beauty" is adding the former duchess de Feria.
I really like the colors which he is using: there is much light in it and they "are approaching" his face.
Proportions are ideal.
The princess and the lawgiver of the fashions Патрициа делла Джовампаола d"Arenberg can also not forget for the the first time when she had put Valentino on.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I will have age and a cause to put on one of his evening toilets...
At last that hour came at the end of the nineties.
I have bought my first dress from Valentino, in order to put it on the holiday in the castle of mine was kuzena, prince Eduard Line de.
This was a red dress, with the skirt with the ruches, "the camisole" with fold and the cut without bretelek.
This was the dream that became a reality" a widow Родриго d"Arenberga is speaking.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is a timeless one", is explaining this Italian aristokratka who lives among Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess d"Arenberg is keeping her festive dresses from the fashion designer with "maximum caution... because the dress is not simple the dress, this dress also the total of memories, his escorts".
The "king" of fashion
The great final of the exhibition in Somerset-xaus is a wedding dress Mari-Wantalj Miller for her wedding with Pavlosom from Greece in 1995.
Four months of the work and 25 "girls" were needed (as a fashion designer is calling his seamstresses) in order to make this order from silk the colors of the ivory with inlaid work pearl, twelve types of different laces and the train of 4,5 meters.
According to the journalist Syuzi Menkes, the greatest authority of the specialized press, that dress is the landmark of the high fashion of the end of the 20th century, "the customers' return is of the highest light".
Odurmanennyij many years "the style" of life" of the elite, now Valentino himself is her best representative.
The cavalier of the Big cross (the decoration of the highest rank in Italy), the Cavalier of the work, Komandor of the order of Arts and the literature awarded by the Legion of Honor after all Garavani called so many together honors, how much any of his customers' husbands.
His refinement, his calmness, his neat and irreproachable appearance have always attracted my attention, d"Arenberg remembers.
The last time I saw it a month ago on ceremonial supper in the Museum Orse.
It worked at the table with countess Zhaklin de Ribe, my big friend.
"He was impeccable, the time does not exist for it".
If a princess is saying this...
The most difficult occupation is in the peace: the miners with Kavax-Idzhena
For four euros the Indonesian miners are risking life and health pulling 70 kilograms of sulphur on the top of the volcano along the steep stony paths
There are people for whom their work is hell, and the other ones literally work in a hell.
Among them Anto Vidzhaijya, one of 400 miners who are earning sulphur with the loot for living in the volcano Kavax-Idzhen located in the east of the Indonesian Java island, is.
Every day Anto goes down to the very bottom of the crater, where sulphurous gas which is rising from the depths of the Earth congeals with contact with air.
After unpinning the huge pieces of sulphur the total weight of which can reach 70 kg he is putting them in two bambukovye baskets, is loading baskets on his shoulders and is carrying them upward along the steep stony road.
To the top of the volcano the height of which is 2,386 meters, only 250 meters however the emaciated loaders needed more than 40 minutes, in order to get up turtle step, retaining equilibrium with difficulty and feeling carefully the road in order it is not possible to stumble and it is not possible to fall down from the precipice.
They know that one false step can cost them life as this happened to one tourist from France who broke out of the rocks Kavax-Idzhena a few years ago.
Kavax-Idzhena and the miner earn 5 evrocentov in every kilogram of sulphur which they are obtaining
After turning up above, they are paving themselves road between the tourists who are photographing them how if they were monkeys from the circus and supporting the heavy baskets in a tired way three kilometers take a step to the scales which the mining company put hardly higher, at a height than 1,850 meters.
The talk is about PT Kandi Ngrimbi, the business, which has operated this volcano since 1960 and, it is better not to say either, its workers to whom he is paying 662 Indonesian rupees (5 evrocentov) for every kilogram of sulphur.
Then he is selling it for 10,000 rupees (83 evrocentov) the petrochemical productions, but this mineral is spread in everyday life and is being used for the manufacturing of the matches, the fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the lightening of sugar.
"Since" пере wearing of 70 kilograms "is norm, we are earning" about 46,000 rupees "(3.8 euros) in each the walker", Anto who is normally fulfilling three daily oversocks is explaining to us.
He has been wasting three hours on each of them and he feels at the end conclusion disabled, however they are allowing him to accumulate 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) towards the end of a day.
Although this seems like mizerom for such a superhuman effort, this is three times greater than what it would earn in field is.
"Daily pay the miners very high in local measurements, where they are paying 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) for the collection of coffee at a day and the average monthly payment is equal to two million rupees (167 a euro)" , - a loader is clarifying who worked as a mason earlier on the tourist island of Bali.
His wages were 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day there and the area was not so difficult, but Anto returned with its family to Banjyuvangi, the small town close to the volcano, according to important reason, which is the same crushing one in Indonesia as sulphur: "I got married to the girl with Bali where one Hindus are, and brought it to Java, that she took on the Islam".
Anto has asthma, it is breathing with difficulty, he is constantly coughing, and his eyes due to the toxic gases are streaming
Into the own people 27 years Anto has led three years risking itself in Kavax-Idzhene whose sulphur has already begun to effect it despite the presence of the mask and the special glasses.
He has asthma, it is breathing with difficulty, he is constantly coughing, and his eyes due to the toxic gases are streaming which a volcano is picking out.
This is a price which he has to pay for the achievement of his dream.
I "will still work" for two years:, because I want to open a shop or to study Spanish or French", it is promising in the more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this pleasant and smart young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a porter in the hotel, but instead of this he is fulfilling the work of the mule.
Sharing the dirty wooden shack with other porters, it gets up because sulphur does not stop flowing by night every day at two o'clock in the morning, when her characteristic yellow is turning into blue and it is sparkling among darkness.
Throwing the call for shades, Anto is going down into the crater himself lighting a road with the small lamp connected to his helmet which he himself bought to his money.
About 400 porters are dragging the baskets with sulphur from the bottom of the volcano on their shoulders
Despite high profits, the mining company did not mechanize the loot of the sulphur for the saving of expenditures and is not granting any equipment to the porters who are working on their bill and with such deprivations.
Actually, they are not producing even the part from 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) of the collection for the photography, which, together with the permit for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this nature reserve are collecting from the tourists who are coming in order to photograph the volcano and his people mule.
This work for cattle, and not for the people", Badrusin, the thickset porter of 42 years who has led three decades on Kavax-Idzhene ever since the college abandoned, is declaring.
Capable to pick up up to 110 kilograms, he is swearing, that he will suffer a work "so much, how much will be able", because he needs money for the education of his three children at the age from 18 up to 10 years.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is all of my lives
Although sulphur burns the throat and the eyes when the wind is suddenly changing and he is catching the miners in the dense poles of smoke leaving the volcano, they are so much sturdy that no one is complaining about his difficult diseases... more serious, evident than their usual problems with breathing, artrozy, pains in knees and sores on the shoulders which became deformed under the weight of the baskets.
Only balancing the basket on the back, Unaijnik now 50 kilograms can raise 53 years into the own people.
Every day it and his comrades take out 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano which three trucks transport on the stockroom in Tamansari overcoming the distance of 18 kilometers along the narrow path among the undergrowth.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is all of my lives" Unaijnik is declaring opening mouth in which a few teeth do not suffice widely.
Of his five children, the boss, 30 years, he is also working as a transmitter of sulphur.
The time is passing, but poverty immortalizes from generation into generation one of the most difficult lessons in the peace: what human mules are teaching to Kavax-Idzhena.
Singapore is looking for children in order to save the economy
They are accusing Singapurcy career, the stress and prices of the habitation and the education in the children's absence.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow".
I the husband the patriot, you my wife the patriot, we will fulfill our civil duty and we will create life!
It can seem improbable that these lines are the part of the advertisement of the mint pancakes, however became a hit despite this - or possibly thanks to this - this video in YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
We "will put" rehpa, who "let's is kind of using local sayings "these phrases are part bao (the roll) into the stove", in order to laugh at the level of birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency which made this video, BBH is cherishing the hope that with the help of the advertisement they will manage to draw attention to the present problem in entertaining form.
His creative director, Duglas Hamilton, says that I/you/he wanted to use the power of the music that the people fulfilled their national duty".
This thing exceptionally for internet, therefore we should make it cheerful and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are worst in the peace on reproduction himself similar, therefore we felt that this is that topic which we have to affect.
We knew, that the government tried to do many things, to carry out the startup of the perfume with the pheromones for example or to organize the parties of the fast familiarity (blic-dates).
Many of these ideas were kreativnymi, possibly, but optionally snapped.
Therefore we thought, why we will not be able to do the most samuyu kreativnuyu thing out of the possible ones in order to resolve the present problem, but namely create rehp?
1.2 children
Who is not perceiving this is so thoughtless, this government of Singapore is so.
He is spending 1,300 US dollars on the birth of the greater quantity of the children in a year on policy for the citizens' enthusiasm.
The state package for married couples and the parents grants up to 15,000 dollar on the child, is prolonging the vacation on pregnancy and the deliveries and provides tax abatement.
But all this has low effectiveness.
Singapore is a rich and high technology state town in Southeast Asia, also well known in the conservatism of its instruction and in its strict public control.
There is level of birth rate at the level of 1.2 children on the woman in Singapore, according to his national department on population, at present.
The last time it was lower than 2 - which is well known as the percentage of filling - in 1976.
So why singapurcy do not have the greater quantity of the children?
Tan Veij of Mines, the director of the Department of the policy on married couples and families of the National department on population, says that cause of that is "the improved education" and "the wider gamut of the career possibilities".
This allowed the people the wider gamut of the versions in that, as for life goals and priorities, apart from the wedding and the creation of the family to be been available", she is explaining.
These changes of social norms contribute to the stature of the quantity of the bachelors and the postponement of marriages and the children's birth, why the level of birth rate came down in Singapore.
Meanwhile, the immigration policy which is directed towards the burst of the immigration for opposition to the decrease in population causes indignation among native population.
There are web sites in Singapore where a xenophobia with regard to many new immigrants, in particular the Chinese who criticize for the maintenance of the wages on low level also the reluctance to be integrated being hardly hidden thrives.
The growth of immigration is also looked at like one of the reasons of last year the ruling Singapore party receiving the worst result from the times of independence on elections.
After elections an attempt to resolve the problem was, with the help of the quotas and some higher taxes for the foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall of birth rate provides the well known influence on the economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, the expenses for medicine and also begins to have the policy of immigration, the example of Singapore some unexpected consequences.
The government is exerting efforts that so much small habitation was not being built.
For example, this began to influence the sector of real estate.
The instruction in city development crossed the numbers of the small apartments, well known numbers to the control how "the shoe cardboard box", which one can build in certain districts of the town.
These apartments with an area of 46 square meters are very well selling.
Nevertheless, there is the opinion that they can contribute to single way of life and are depriving the building contractors who want to build the big family habitation of their stimulus.
But the Lima Yu Sunj, the General Manager of the house-building firm EL Developers, says that their "shoe cardboard boxes" sell much more fast than the more spacious copies.
They are more popular, in that sense that such apartments will be sold of a few days, even weeks, more fast than the apartments of greater size.
As a result of this our receipts are increasing.
Nevertheless, he recognizes that the new norms give the clearer landmarks for the building contractors who impediments helped earlier if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in project.
Overstrained too
Singapore is a town-state.
Although these new rules can be the step in the direction of the increase of the national birth rate, after the conversation with singapurcami which work in the financial quarter of the center it seems that they will not have a particular effect.
"The people are overstrained really, the habitation is expensive, also as well as education, also due to this many people they" are "laying" this aside, a young administrative official is speaking.
Other people can have the children.
"But it is for me important its own money and the time to be available", has said another young man of 20 years.
The men and the women are mentioning their career, a stress and the prices of the habitation and the education as the reasons which prevent them from bringing the children.
So, in a quasi way the government was not trying to incite its citizens to the children's birth, in that, as for detorozhdeniya, the last word remains for singapurcami.
A personal one is personal in offlaijne in onlaijne
Confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the Royal academy of Spanish, the talk is about the property of the quotient or "the sphere of private life which they have the right to defend against just any intrusion".
Is what is personal for the minor younger than 16 years?
How is he using this definition in his everyday life and in social nets?
Does he understand the dangers to which it is exposed on the discussion in internet of situations, which I/you/he would not have shared certainly out of internet?
elPeriódico has taken an interview from five children from ten to 15 years, the frequent users of the net.
In four cases they associated a term with "very my something", in a personal plane, both password and user name, when they applied it to some social nets.
"I would not have loaded my biggest secrets into a post", is saying decennial Xorxe, when he is trying to explain importance personal on such sites as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it has had discount entries already two years.
This very secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not the whole world", he is reconfirming.
I am downloading beautiful pictures or the pictures from games on FB.
Also I have a good time with my acquaintances.
"I would not have shared the photograph which is not my or somebody, who is behaving stupidly", he is speaking.
The boy will realize, which it is bad the indecent photographs of the bared people, crimes to publish or to write insulting or furious comments.
Xorxe swears that 35 friends who see it in FB, and nine of their folloverov in Twitter know.
Most of them the relatives.
The mother is knowing the latest, it has a password to one of the discount entries.
I brought Twitter, in order to express also to write himself were tvity interesting.
"They are answering me, I do not know, I am downloading only them", he is adding.
"The social nets are entertainment, I can talk to the distant relatives or to my friends on-fast", is it is pointing out.
Without being thoughtful, he answers that the inquiry would never have received the person from the stranger.
Who would have recommended it to the stranger would not take somebody into consideration.
The case 14-letnego Xose differs.
This teenager has open discount entries on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and he will recognize in the last one, that 20 people do not know, added to his the friends' list.
This does not scare me because, for example, we have a something common, a music": it is pointing out.
According to the boy, no one insinuated to his place into trust and I/you/he did not ask for his domestic address or telephone number.
"If me will press or demand", I "will send them away from my discount entry simply": he will recognize.
Xose became a follower Ask after the reading of the recommendation in Twitter.
The experience of what today is well known as kibermobbing is not alien to the boy.
They blackmailed one my friend's acquaintance in social net.
They threatened it and they extorted money.
"Tak i ne he did not know who this was": he is certifying.
The victim did not delete the discount entry, in words Xose.
I/you/he "only included confidentiality".
Then he is explaining the succession of the steps for the setting of the discount entry by safe form.
In contrast to Xorxe, this boy would have downloaded the acquaintances' photographs in uncomfortable or awkward situations.
Yes, I would have done this if he does not like me the person or if he this would like me.
"Although I know, what this kibermobbing", he is confirming.
Key questions
Marjelos Porras, the lecturer of the English and the specialist in education and the teaching is, thinks that in order to direct children and teenagers it is necessary to understand what the goal of the social nets to inform.
"The internet appeared like resource for the search of the information, but with the appearance of these sites the rules of the game changed", she is noting.
Porras points out that also the author of the work is academician Mark Prenski, the skilled worker of the pedagogics from the Ijeljskogo university the Numerical aboriginals and the immigrants, invented these terms for the explanation of the present phenomenon.
The numerical aboriginals this they, the children and young people who were born in the epoch of technologies.
"We are digital immigrants who have to learn them while we have still been studying themselves", she is saying.
He explains that this topic "is" complicated because we are asking them to have a certain criterion of the that what can either it is not allowed to extend, it to publish or it to speak, at the age, when ripeness does not suffice for this".
"Also that they were electoral while it is the most important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about consequences" she is adding.
According to the specialist, to show the most effective way, that confidentiality the children and the teenagers , - to ask the questions which force them to contemplate.
"Speaking with it that they did not do this, is useless", she is adding.
Then Porras is listing some versions: there are things which you would not have told to the stranger so why you are doing this in internet?
Or you would have liked, if they published a photograph you like that, which you about your friend published?
You know, that the other ones are publishing for you?
Are you asking other people for permissions, when you have been signing the photographs from the parties, in order to note them?
Also still one, everyone should know what you make at every moment?
Another point is to give to them to know something, that they must behave onlaijn just as, as they are doing this offlaijn.
I/you/she governed same.
"Out of internet the person is behaving with respect, responsibility and other principles, one has to be in some social nets just as", she is asserting.
Vigilance
Ehstuardo Guardiya, the university lecturer, the professor of the primary education and the consultant on education, a necessity of the politicians of the social nets conscientiously reading the heads of the families is explaining.
Understanding each of the points, they have the good bases for talks with the children about the prerequisites of the opening for the discount entry in internet.
"For example, he is saying "also that it is allowed what extending or what publishing age".
Concordant Gaurdiya, a key question is not to remind the children of a lesson "speak with the strangers".
The summit UNASUR is ending without publication of the Limskoij declaration
The VI presidential summit of the Union of the South American nations (UNASUR) was ended in Peru without publication of the Limskoij declaration more declared earlier and theoretically signed by seven obligatory participants today.
Efe tried repeatedly to receive the access to the document signed on the VI statutory meeting of the heads of the states and governments UNASUR, however the sources are from the Office and they pointed out to the president's Administration on the main page that they will pass it after the closing, but they confirmed then, what will be published at a fixed moment it on the web site of the Peruvian government.
On questions about the text, they pointed out, what is presented contained the president of the Peru, Oljyanta Umala, during short statements for the press.
The journalists' access to information about Summit has always been limited.
For a day only has been transmitted, the session "closed" in the hall for the press, the video of the presidential assembly without the sound with message, "the sound" is "suppressed".
Little information which circulated among the reporters was submitted by the press spokesmen of some governments UNASUR attending the meeting however not Peruvian.
A list of the participating presidents was the only document widespread in a day, which caused the dissatisfaction of hundreds of the journalists from different national and the international mass media which asked for more information.
The administration of the president of Peru subsequently sent the electronic message to mass media with "the final declaration" of the summit, however the talk is about a statement Umaly, and not about the official document which the summit finished up with.
In the past October of Peru the III received the Summit of the South American and Arabic countries (ASPA), and on that occasion in spite of the fact that the press insistently demanded this the so-called Limskaya declaration which they declared earlier was also not extended.
On the official web site ASPA one can check, that the document was published on the past Tuesday.
At both of the international meetings the Peruvian authorities tried so that the systems of the transfer for all the journalists would be provided, however limited the information recovery in a maximum way.
Summit also was ended with the joint decision of Chile and Peru to take on a verdict the Hague the court which will regulate the territorial dispute between both of the countries.
The presidents of Peru, Oljyanta Umala, and Chile, Sebastjyan Pinjera, got together at the regional meeting and ratified, that they will observe a decision International the court within the framework of accusation which begins the audition of the statements both of the sides in The Hague on Monday, which Lima put forward against Santiago.
"We will observe and carry out the decision which will clarify differences, which we are presenting to this international court at present", said Umala, next to its Chilean co-worker.
"Chile was, has and will be a country that respects an international law, the peace permission of differences, pacts and international tribunals", added Pinjera, and greeted Umalu with the handshake of the arm on the background of the flags of these two countries.
Confirmation both of the presidents of their yielding to the International court occurred immediately after that, how Colombia protested this week Bogotskiij pact, according to which she recognized a subordination verdicts this international the court after the decision about the sea borders between Nicaragua which she considered to be mistaken.
The summit took place in the absence of the presidents of Brasilia, Dilmy Rusef; Venezuela, Ugo Chavesa; To Bolivia, to Ehvo Moralesa; also Argentina, Kristiny Kirwner.
Paraguay whose membership has been stopped in UNASUR since 2011 after the impeachment of his former president Fernando Lugo did not participate in the meeting.
The receiving president, Oljyanta Umala, was responsible for the opening of the discussions also for the closing of the summit hardly later than the noon on Limskomu time in the morning.
The head of the state read the final document in which I/you/he announced that 16 agreements were taken on and the directions of the action on 31 projects confirmed among the South American countries, the amount of the capital investments to be supposed were 17 billion dollars.
Among the agreements taken on he mentioned that the countries UNASUR will undertake "the important steps towards the goal of the South American nationality for which we are enlarging the agreements on the place of residence".
He announced, that the actions for the improvement of "the cooperation in the fight against the citizens' uncertainty and against the transnational organized crime, the action for the increase of the accessibility of the medicines, inexpensive access into the Internet in all the corners of South America and consideration" are being undertaken "by the combined and effective form of risks natural catastrophes".
In so far as Europe in crisis, "economic association (Latin America) it does not have to have the triumfatorskoij basis, but it has to serve as widening of our industrial basis and to anticipate better future for our towns", Umala added.
"We decided to give privileges to the group from 31 sign projects which will improve the connection of the spaces of South America, in peculiarity in the ones village and the border areas... uniting our countries and forming the new economic schemes", the Peruvian president said in the read message.
Among these projects he mentioned that five belong to Peru, and are limited by the lateral axes on his territories, from the coast to Brasilia, and two are aimed at big connection with Ecuador, however it did not grant more details.
Also the final document affected the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope, that the electoral process will serve in this country her repeated connection to the Union of the South American nations" which at present it is excluded from.
The necessity Latin America remained a region of well-being and peace would be united, and had the good relationships between the neighbors, was another topic which is emphasized on summit.
In this sense the president of Colombia, Juan Manuehlj Santos, said, before to begin the participation in the regional meeting, which is hoping to meet with its co-worker from Nicaragua, Daniehlem Ortegoij, in Mexico City for the carrying out of the negotiations in respectful form about the sea dispute as a result of verdict on Saturday international the court that the is contested by Bogotá.
"The day after tomorrow (on Saturday)" I "will meet with president Daniehlem Ortegoij, possibly", said Santos.
"We will review all these ways, they are not mutually exclud, among them the pact will require the discussion from Nicaragua from Nicaragua", he emphasized.
"With president Ortega, I hope, I will be able to tell him that we will manage this civilized and respectful form in a maximum way possible", Santos added.

Also within the framework of summit the Defense Secretaries of a block preliminarily met for the assertion of the Plan of the actions on 2013 which is directed towards the strengthening of dialog and unanimity on the question of the defense of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brasilia, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are forming UNASUR, although is stopped participation last from the countries.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional block.
"South America has to study the integration of nationality by Europe in a question": Rafaehlj Korrea
The president of Ecuador, Rafaehlj Korrea, confirmed today that the creation of the common nationality is the goal in which there is "South America in this case," yes, he has to study by Europe".
Korrea who participated in the VI presidential summit of the Union of the South American nations (UNASUR) being organized in Lima declared the state television of Peru that the Europeans "killed each other during the Second World War" also in other clashes "however now they" practically "one native country".
It was defending, in this context, the project of the establishment of the South American nationality which countries participant UNASUR are approving.
"It is necessary to achieve the free transfer of the citizens and the workers on just any South American country, it has already occurred with some members of Andskogo association as this, but up to now there are reactionary sectors which want to bring us back into a past" is warned it.
Moreover, the Ecuadorian president showed himself as a supporter of the renewal of the Organization of the American states (OAS) under the prerequisite of the reduction of the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and the consideration of those who signed the Pact of San Jose about human rights.
Those who are giving lectures never undertake any obligations, but we, the South Americans are signing everything, on the contrary.
"Inexplicable, that the inter-American human rights commission is in Washington and is being financed by the United States", he declared alluding to the political refuge given to the founder WikiLeaks Dzhulianu Assanzhu by Ecuador.
Korrea certified that he is not regretting this decision because with it he did not commit his principles, and observed his "deep values" of democracy and human rights".
He added that at that time "certain suspicions were in that that Assanzh be ehkstradirovan to the third country and the process will not be observed".
Moreover, it castigated Swedish justice to arrive to his territory for the interrogation behind demand about the crime on sexual ground being supposed, while "himself the Swedish legislation considers it possible to carry it by means of videokonferencii which one would be able to make out of the embassy of Ecuador in London out".
Korrea confirmed, that risk exists physical deterioration and mental health Assanzha.
"I did not say anything serious with it ever since it arrived in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small pulmonary problem", said the Ecuadorian head of the state.
So this is what is really the danger of the deterioration of his physical and mental health due to the confinement in the small space without opportunity to do the exercises in the open air.
This influences just any person's health", he added.
Korrea pointed out, what decision the problem of the refuge, granted Assanzhu since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by means of the granting of the guarantee of inviolability which will allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European judicial organs and emphasized that negotiations in London about the search of the solution to the problem of the confinement of the founder WikiLeaks were.
We are not carrying on the negotiations about human rights, we are not using this word for a present case, but constant discussions were.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European judicial organs because lawyer Assanzha, Baljtasar Garson, is carrying out the series of the processes in different European instances" is mentioned it.
And I/you/he expressed an opinion, what "will grant"if Great Britain tomorrow the guarantee of inviolability, this will end".
AND if Sweden, as the legislation is excellently allowing it to her and as it has already made in other cases, Assanzha will interrogate a senor in the embassy of Ecuador in London or Skype will interrogate it, tomorrow this problem will be exhausted.
Korrea took advantage of the situation, in order to show himself as advocate of the freedom of the press and I/you/he emphasized that "mediocrities, unscrupulousness and the lies which deform the freedom of the expression" are not patient.
"The head enemies of the freedom of the press this not the spoiled malefactors politician, but the bad journalists that are keeping up a profit, a blackmail and a blackmail" he said.
It remained content that neither these journalists, "nor the bankers, nor the bourgeois countries leader have dominated" anymore "in Ecuador" in this aspect, and added, what, be re-elected, "it will deepen the revolution for the continuation of development in true direction".
Korrea also supported the decision to keep the veto of Paraguay in UNASUR at least before the next elections, argu this with those, that the organization "has" to be hard it is not allowed to suffer opportunism and the support of the coups under the mask for legitimacy either", because in reality this shattered the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president regarded, moreover, "founded absolutely" the wish of his Colombian co-worker Juan Manuehlya Santosa to carry on negotiations from Nicaragua about the sea borders between two countries after decision now International the court of the justice of The Hague, which turned up for the benefit of Nicaraguan sea sovereignty.
At the present time this decision is not being observed.
This is a problem among the South American and Central America countries.
The conflicts are inevitable, but they should be overcome by the wish to go together.
It is necessary to work on them jointly in order to overcome them and to continue to move ahead.
Also it stated the hope of the good completion of the dispute about the sea borders who they are carrying on in the same court of Peru and Chile, and which expressed that it "is correct for Latin America to turn to some international instances if two countries are obyazuyutsya to make a decision, which it is heavy not".
About the opportunity to appear as candidate on the presidential elections lying ahead in Ecuador in order to be balloted on the third period on end it pointed out that he is discussing this possibility "with greater optimism and joy, although sometimes this is quite heavy".
Korrea certified, will lose what if on some elections in February 2013, that will leave public life.
In personal plan I have never been interested in an authority, but in such unjust situations as in Ecuador, the socioeconomic poverty can be corrected only on the side of political authority.
My political movement considered that namely I guaranteed this probable victory so one has to admit this responsibility", he said.
In the event of victory this would become my last period in the president's post, and then we are withdrawing from public life.
If we will lose, the same.
"This is decision", he confirmed.
Korrea also mentioned the new course of the treatment of the Venezuelan president Ugo Chavesa in Cuba.
I only that I/you/he said a traditional with the Venezuelan vice-president Nikolasom Maduro who told me that he set out for the treatment, who had already been planned, and that is being expected, that it will miss a campaign in order to return on Cuba.
This does not mean the degradation of the health of the president Chavesa", he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian state took part in the VI summit of the heads of the states and the governments of the Union of the South American nations (UNASUR) which was ended with appeals to the greater regional integration for the maintenance of progress, equality and security in Lima today.
The mortality through Aids is the result of the late diagnostics today
Fabricio was 21 year, when they announced to him that his analysis gave the positive result on an Aids.
"They practically stunned me", he remembers that difficult, despite all the the doctor's measure, moment.
The youth hid this from his family.
After deciding to manage an illness independently, he wanted to hear about it as much as possible. Also his efforts proved correct - he has already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabricio is one of the "oldest" patients of ВИЧ-department of the hospital of Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where it wound up after overcoming quite a lot of obstacles in 1994.
It lives with a diagnosis "virus of the person's immunodeficiency" (AIDS) already 22 years. At the beginning of the nineties into this it would be complicatedly to believe - existed too little at that time the versions of treatment, they knew too little about an illness, in a too preconceived way they treated the patients.
So, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican institute of social defense did not want to take his leave of it "because he had a cut".
In other words, in those times having Aids was sentence.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and to do this without making the quality of life worse.
Nevertheless not knowing about their illness many people are coming up to now when the virus already caused the damage, "weakened" their immune system also they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 year after the appearance of the Aids in the peace later, at least after the first declared cases, "big achievement is at the present time that, what the survival of the patient, who begins a treatment timely, also the survival of the common population into precisions equal" , - ВИЧ department chapter indicated HCG, Xaijme Andrade Viljyanuehva after pleading that that this information is confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific edition.
Also the ВИЧ/СПИДу, Andrade Viljyanuehva expert explained to Infekcionist that since 2008 the scientists came to the conclusion that the Aids is not sentence, however the duration and the quality of life depend on the degree of the defeat of the immune system which is available with the patients with the beginning of the diagnostics, with the better life-span being expected with those who are not using drugs: right up to 30 years with the number 200 CD4 are, also up to 50 years, when 500 CD4 are being announced.
Simply said, abovementioned means that that according to these terms who a diagnosis VICh-polozhiteljnogo has received at the age 25 years "will be able to live keeping up the control without problems right up to 75 years" he explained.
In order to appreciate this progress, one should remember that the Mexicans' life-span has been today on average 76 years.
Although the mortality came down in the last years, in the event of Mexico considerably, the number of the people, the dying men is from an Aids, came down from 6.678 in 2007 up to 4.862 in 2011 (annual report YuNEhIjDS), is also true and what from the moment of the appearance of Aids, 60 percent of the patients in national data base died.
Only in Xalisko of 255 people they died in 2011, and 187 deaths are already registered by May this year; nevertheless, it is being asserted that there is general access to the antiretrovirusnym compounds since 2005.
- Why are there up to now lethal issues?
- It personally seems to me that problem is not in access to the treatment.
So I imagine this, the situations are so in our hospital.
The at the minimum last 12 years we have not had any shortage of the medicines, problem was that the patients are coming very late because they do not know about their infected state that is, at late stages of disease.
It listed the crushing data: "Nine of ten patients are coming when they have already had some opportunistic infection; what it is necessary to make, so necessary in order to exert a greater influence upon a common mortality, this to see off diagnostics at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to grant the tests for the discovery on mass scale, for all the people which" will "ask" for this.
In their proposal specialists and the officials of the State counsel on prophylaxis SPIDa v Xalisko (COESIDA), as well as even the patients, kind of Fabricio which turned for the check to the private laboratory, incited agree only about that about opinion, what did this it the friend both, despite his young age, it already has been on the stages of Aids and suffered even with the sarcoma Kapowi, the cancerous tumor, which is one from some widespread complications.
Everything is changing when you know what with you an Aids is.
Several things think that they will die, and nothing wants not to know.
"Since I anyway will die, I will better be torn off three times a week", they are saying. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, I live well, I am doing exercises, I am taking medicines.
Currently, his parents know that he bore the crawfish only.
I live for normal life as any another does.
"I am working, I have many lessons, I am traveling, I am carrying out active sexual life, but with mutual responsibility, I am taking care of themselves and of another person", is Fabricio transferred which agreed to share its private life with MILENIO JALISCO in order to spodvignutj those with its statement, who now, in the context of the Global day of the fight against Aids, a fear tests.
Will let will be checked, if a risk of contamination was, let them hear whether they are VICh-polozhiteljnymi so better as soon as possible, and if they have already had a diagnosis, let them know that they can live as just any another person, being responsible.
This his message summarizes the topic of the fight against Aids in this 2012.
The condoms behind the counter
The chasms are great among the programs in the field of the health service and the simple citizen, thinks Rikardo Salazar, the journalist from Gvadalaxary who dealt with the problem connected to AIDS.
Also biggest this the prophylaxis.
In places, dedicated to this task, "as a matter of fact the spreading of the condoms increased, one or two gave to us earlier, now packages on a hundred give to us, and this is really good, but it is turning out that there are those who do not have the access to the condom now up to now", he said.
There are teenagers among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why they are for you"? this is a popular question, with malice and condemnation, on the side of the social workers, the school consultants, the health service's co-workers of the drugstores and the workers, which teenagers do not want to hear a propagandist certified.
I am offering to change this ineffective distribution; that the condoms were not only behind the counters and that hundred their was in the automats in the places which often some young people visit in the public toilets.
This is not an encouragement of laxity.
The talk is not about the payment of beer and the motel, answered the governor of Ehmilio Gonsales after they had asked him whether the dispensation of the condoms is possible on his instruction.
"This is not sexuality, it is best to make the condoms accessible to those who have already practiced the sexual activity", he noted.
The key data in Xalisko
Is registered 13.435 cumulative case (12,158 SPIDa and 1,317 VICh).
The staff is taking up the 4th place in national appraisement of new and cumulative cases of Aids and the 13th are up to AIDS.
92% of contaminations belong to a sexual road, 6% across blood and 2% to a perinatal road.
According to the estimates, 50 000 people can live with AIDS because there are from 4 to 5 people who do not know about this the registered case on one.
Taking into consideration ratification reached the appeal court of the United States of the decision which annuls the restructuring of the debt of the Group Vitro by means of competitive production in Mexico, the scenario establishes a fatal precedent for just any national company with the branches in the neighboring country which has the problems with solvency.
It seems that the procedures are not coming real into the support of the survival of the firms which are allowed by the Mexican laws in the country of the stripes and the stars, in contradiction with international agreements.
In the practical sphere, the approval of the decision pronounced by judge Xarlin Xeijl on 15th June in the court of the bankruptcies of the north district of Texas leaves the Mexican firms defenseless in the person of the possibility of the seizure on their property po tu storonu the Rio Grandee.
However the decree reveals the doors to the leading producer of the glass for a circulation to the Supreme Court of the United States in Mexico bringing three disparities as proof.
As an entry, while the judge is noting the matters, what must the creditors be regulated by the Code of the USA about bankruptcy, the Appeal court of fifth district put in New Orleans says that the main examination is concerning competitive production that is discussed in Mexico.
The first point means the annulment of the international judicial cooperation in the cases of the insolvency of the businesses of transnational profile.
The Model law of the UN on the unification of the right of the international commerce was created actually, with this goal determining the American institute of the right as arbiter.
Secondly, the verdict establishes, what without intercompany vote, the liabilities recognized in the critical mass of the competitive production which had the branches Vitro in front of a parent company would not be attained majority, necessity for the assertion of restructuring.
Nevertheless, Mexican laws will recognize this possibility.
Actually, Vitro was not with the first case, when this scheme is being taken.
There is a half-a-doz of the examples among which there are Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts a Federal institute of the competitive productions guaranteed.
Right as well that, what subtract the voices of the branches, one way or another the creditors are Vitro who fought against it in the ships of the United States, but namely funds "carrion-crows" similar to Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have attained majority.
The vote would be 45 percent against 37.
The Appeal court is lowering these data.
On the other hand, he is accusing Vitro of the imbroglio from which that has come across starting in 2008 affected by the serious depression which overtook the United States dealing the blows to the country.
While what the firm of the family Gonsales of Garden will show the appeal of the decision into himself the appeal court, that the vote came across to his plenum, that is, five judges, because only three voted.
In the event of flop the application for the certificate which will require the revision of the process on the side of the court of the highest instance, in the present case of the Supreme Court of the United States will be made.
What the court turned down the document directed into the roles of amicus curiae ("the friend of the court") in which the process is described, which Vitro within the framework of Law is following about the competitive productions signaling about he being releasing himself from the observance of the agreements signed by both of the countries, in order to connect it to article 15 of the Law of the USA on bankruptcy by the government of Mexico is the worst.
Moreover, it is being noted that the country yielded to the principles of the United Nations' Commission on international commerce that is, the rules established for the cases of the intergovernmental insolvency which guarantee the equal rights for the debtors and the creditors.
The cannon from two boards: they are beating in Vitro and бьют to the country.

Gektor "Xetin" Reijes: "The basketball was my life"
The inveterate basketball traveler Gektor "Xetin" Reijes has been connected to these sports for more than 60 years and, thanks to it, all the world went.
Hardly anyone is keeping "Xetin" Reijes in Puerto Rico in the memory of so much basketballs histories, as Gektor.
And, however, formerly than the brain hemorrhage confined it to the wheelchair in 2008, Reijes was dipped into sports into the flow of more than 60 years, as player of small categories, the player of the Highest basketball league, the commissioner and the leader BSN with the Cowboys Bayamona and president of the Federation of basketball.
"I fulfilled many roles in the basketball during its life, including somewhat simultaneously as when I was president BSN, the General Manager of the National Team and the president of the federation in the nineties," Reijes remembers in Bayamon during the visit of Primera Hora to his place home where it lives with Isabelj its true wife during the extent more than 50 years.
"The basketball was my life".
Reijes is not exaggerating doing this assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all the walls adorned by the photographs and the memory things, gathered for his long road, they are testifying to this.
Bayamon in the heart
With the largest emotions it is keeping those, who remember his road through the Cowboys, starting with the middle of the fifties as player until 1982, after the talks into roles have been been old his 15 years from-agent or the agent of the contract.
This were my better years which I enjoyed most of all because I had the opportunity to be the part of eight championships of the Cowboys since 1967, as agent from-agenta or the leader.
Joys, including five championships which were going on from 1971 to 1975 a year have been many years.
And then I took my leave of one in 1981, in a year of the debut of Dzheroma Minsi v BSN.
"Kuko of Ortis which was a great administrator" started guiding since that moment and from now on: Reijes pointed out.
I remember that the Gin of Bartov which went here and was in the university of Alabama (Birmingham) told me: "I for you have a very strong player, the growth 6'7".
You "want?"
Also this was the beginning of Minsi, one of the best players who were at Puerto Rico.
Bartov recommended then sniper Raijmonda Gauss who received nationality and became one of our best high scorers.
I remember that I/you/he said what if Minsi brought championship Bayamonu, Gauss would have helped to conquer still one.
I enjoyed the Cowboys' championship with Gauss, but already in the distance, because I/you/he has already been registered as the boss of the federation by 1988.
At that time I preferred to enjoy his achievements and the achievements Minsi in national national team.
I remember how we beat the USA for the first time during the olympic qualification tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then a World Championship of 1990 on which we received the fourth place and this had to be bronze came if that Canadian judge who forced us to replay the final game did not say Reijes.
That team from the World Championship of 1990 is better national team, what you saw some day?
It among the better ones, in the same way as also that, which I/you/she won from Dream Team on the Olympic games of 2004.
But that was my love, what from Panamerikanskix of games is in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and we broke the national team of the USA which quite looked like that, which won bronze from us on the world championship.
In that team not only they again played Minsi, Gauss, Ramona Rivasa, Lopesa Fiko and 'Pikulina' (Ortisa), but also 'Tonjito' Kolon young (Xavjer) and James Karter, the brothers Leon (Fransisko and Ehdgar) and Mario 'Kixote' Morales, who was not able to participate in 90 a year due to the trauma knees.
Team, which was possibly, not the best one in the plan of the personnel, but I/you/she brought us a gold medal and a big joy, was the team of the Olympic qualification tournament of 1995 in Neukene, Argentina.
With the roll players like 'Kanito' Njevesa, Pablo of Alisea and young Rolando Xurruitnera in place of the players, temporarily pushed aside is for a disorder in championship Panamerikanskom Mar-delj-Plata, we won gold contrary to all the forecasts.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without all doubts, this was Pikulin Ortis.
They are impressing his indexes in the international tournaments.
No one dominated in Puerto Rico so, as Pikulin did this, at this level.
Also this is without account-taking of his career in the different leagues in which it was playing.
Who was the best Puerto Rican the leader?
This is a very complicated question.
There was with us very the good cubs generations that includes Xulio Toro, the Flora Melendesa, Karlosa of Moralesa, Raijmonda Dalmau, Armandito Torresa.
From the young ones, I like the work as a Leo Arilly really.
What do you consider your main achievement in federation?
The participation by the national national team among 1988 and 1995 in the most famous epoch, and that there were up to 17 teams in a season at the beginning of the nineties in BSN.
That did you have to do?
Things were which I wanted, for example, to realize the regionalization of the smaller categories.
For example, that the boys played from Ponse only in their field and pleij-off is only against some teams from the other parts of the island in the national ones.
Now the children are traveling and are playing too much, also this is excessive.
I see, at least, the fruits of obligatory certification and course for the operating, official persons and the judges.
This brings me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
I am listening to the music most of all, am watching the musical videos of my epoch in YouTube, am enjoying my grandchildren and go to some basketball matches from time to time.
And, of course, I am enjoying the company of my wife, Icabelj which has always been with me.
An actor Larri Xehgmehn died
Larri Xehgmehn being born on September 21, 1931 in Fort-Uehrte (Texas) became a world-famous thanks to his leading role as John Ross Yuinga, better known John as "J.R"., in the television serial "Dallas" in which he embodied the business person without principles cruel and manipulyativnogo.
Larri Xehgmehn, whose role of the oil tycoon predator Dzheij the Are Yuinga is in the television serial "Dallas" became the symbol of greed in 1980, I/you/he died.
It was 81 years old.
Xehgmehn, which returned as in this year J.R. in the new season "of Dallas", I/you/he died due to the complications caused by the crawfish, according to the statement of the family on Friday evening, granted for The Associated Press by the company Warner Bros., the studio of the production "of Dallas".

In 1995 they discovered the malignant tumor in the liver with it and he bore the transplantation.
Long before "Dallas", Xehgmehn acquired publicity on television thanks to the role of the respectable type in the light comedy Of "I Dream of Jeannie", being transmitted canal NBC from 1965 to 1970 a year.
In it it played captain Tony Neljsona, astronaut whose life is changing when it is meeting the attractive girl-genie who Barbara Iden is playing, and the hearth begins to live with it for one roof.
Also it was the head personage of two comedies which infrequently appeared on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work at the movies included the roles taken on, into "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors", by the critics well.
But namely his masterly interpretation deliciously disgusting J.R. Xehgmehna on the top of fame brought.
Dramatic serial of canal CBS went about a clan Yuingov and other personages in his environments on the air from April of 1978 until May 1991.
Advertising slogan "Who shot into J.R."?, conceived generated international discussions and millions of dollars for the creation of the wumixi around the episode, full of emotions, in which they are killing personage Xehgmehna nearly, which risked in the bookmaker offices.
Also this helped to draw the record auditory to serialu at that time.
When the answer in the episode from November 1980, was given, they watched it in the average of 41 million television viewers and "MASH" turned "Dallas" into histories, after the final into the second entertaining program on the number of oversights in 1983, drawing 50 million spectators.
This was a sister-in-law J.R., Kristin (in Mary Krosbi implementation) which shot at it.
J.R. I/you/he disturbed it and I/you/he threatened it then, which will accuse it of a prostitution if she will not take off from the town, however, the other ones also had the reasons to attack it.
Xehgmehn played Yuinga as insatiable korrupcionera with charismatic smile: the dishonest businessman and the false husband who wanted so that his wife the alcoholic, Sjyu Ehllen (Linda Grehij), put on the treatment.
"I know: that it has to be on the grave plate J.R"., Xehgmehn said in 1988.
Probably is said: "Here the honest citizen is resting J.R. Yuing".
This is the only transaction which it lost.
Victoria Prinsipal, is the heroine of original seriala also, remembered Xehgmehna as somebody on Friday "huge, how on, simply outside of the screen".
It is unforgettable and indispensable for millions of the admirers all over the world, and in the hearts of the each of us, poschastlivilosj who to know and to like it.
Ten episodes of the new issue "of Dallas" have been shown a few months ago with the big success on canal TNT.
The recording of five episodes of the second season had already been finished and the sixth was in production, the sixth announced canal.
Warner or TNT have not done the statement about Xehgmehna being with serialom after the departure yet.

The course which investigates "an end of the world" is beginning
Every week the students investigate the apokalipticheskie such as nuclear war, the zombie, the viruses and the bacteria phenomena and global warming.
In this semester, when the professor of the religion Styuart Warme decided to read course about an end of the world, he knew that the irresistible bait was available to I/you/he: the end of "the long reverse counting" of the calendar of Maya, on 21st December, which many people caught as behind proof that an end of the world approaches.
But Warme of idea did not have what expected it into the nearest a couple of months: the catastrophic hurricane Sehndi, the financial crisis which several things are calling "dolgoarmageddonom", and the growing conflict, where they will draw Israel, place, where the Christian theoreticians of the end of the times think that Apocalypse will begin.
"I did not realize, that this will be of all the most samyij apokalipticheskiij semester", Warme told the students of the University Rutgers-Kamden (New Jersey) this week.
If to analyze that it is occurring in the peace at present how if with us 30 days in total remained, this was really good period.
Also remember, what bad good for those who have a apokalipticheskiij way of thinking.
Also it is the professor not only who is offering courses for the topic of the "end of the world" in this semester, theoretical one last in history.
The associate professor Barri Vaker is reading course in the Templjskom university "Mass media, culture and end of the world".
Every week the students investigate the apokalipticheskie such as nuclear war, the zombie, the viruses and the bacteria topics, and global warming.
"We are analyzing why these ideas have been spreading with time", it, and a way said, who they are offering the hypothetical scenarios which cause the person's certain actions.
If nuclear material falls into the terrorists' hands, for example, the war can burst out.
This month the students analyzed the films on apokalipticheskie topics and studied as they are being correlated with some examples from real life.
"I tried to tell the students about it being possible, it being probable, it being plausible and it being impossible" Vaker said.
The professor of history of Latin America Mehtjyu Restall and it co-worker Amara Solari, an associate professor of history of art and anthropology are in main kampuse of University of staff of Pennsylvania, amalgamated in order to read the course which is simply called "end of the world".
"We are not adding '2012', in order to always have the opportunity to read course is once more in case the end of the world" will not "occur" said Restall.
Despite "the inevitable destruction", the students have to study, have to prepare projects and have to take final examinations.
To Penn State the final examination will be taken on into the eve of Apocalypse, which is not leaving the students another choice, besides how we should work "until that night into which the end of the world will hypothetically occur" Restall said.
The courses turned out to be quite popular.
"The places have been ending in two hours", Restall spoke about his course for the students with the high middle gain which 35 students enrolled in.
We have been receiving the messages by e-mail for many weeks before the beginning of the semester from the people who asked whether there are places.
The students certify, for their part, that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to observe what the people are doing to comfort themselves", told Bridzhid Robinson, the 23-year-old student of the department of religion and sociology from Xaddonfilda, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Kamden.
Also the apokalipticheskiij form of the thought, the secular form or religious, this only a matter of solace or his absence.
Uill Vekesa, the 25-year-old student of the department of psychology and sisterly matter, said that I/you/he watched all the apokalipticheskie films.
"I have never heard about the course which would teach this", he noted.
I like it.
But no one of the questioned students is have talked anymore about the professor: I/you/he did not say that he believes in the date of the end of the world on 21st December.
"Our first project affected the prophecy of the Maya, and in some kind we discredited it", said Dzhuli Zeglen, the 21-year-old student of the last course is in the Templjskom university from Uehst-Chester.
Maijya never predicted end of the world; this is simple the key moment in the calendar, said Restall.
But he noted that the apokalipticheskoe concern in western culture which has had a few centuries exists where the people react to some changes around predicting end of the world.
The internet caused the increase of these speculations.
"In other places the people do not think about this", he said.
Primarily in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dogerti, the professor of the religion of the university La-Salj who is teaching the courses in the Philippines in this year whether I/you/he answered a question about that fast, he about some course knows about "an end of the world" there.
"The Philippines is not taking part at the end of the light", he wrote alluding in front of the higher instance to an order.
We have a pardon from the Dad.
Restall turned attention, that during the long time was being talked about many days last the ships will not occur, I/you/he also said, what if nothing on 21st December, "the people will begin to think about the next date right away" or philosophize, that 21st December are the beginning of septennial period, according to course of which peace will end.
The students and the lecturers in a carefree way belong to this date.
Several things said that they are preparing to go to the parties of "the end of the world".
"Perhaps, I "will call somebody of the friends in order to laugh together" Samira commented the Ford, the 20-year-old student of the faculty of connection.
