The lack of snow in mountain hoteliers
The tracks are not a problem that operators of ski lifts.
The lack of snow discourages people to book their stays in hotels and pensions.
It is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of hits on our site.
Internet users roam the offers, asking prices but dare not commit to reserve for the moment.
And if they call, they ask immediately if there will be snow or mud at Christmas, " said Martin Jandura, operator of the information portal Spindl. Info.
If you want to spend the New Year of his dreams to Špindlerův Mlýn, better not too reluctant to book.
If the priority is given to economies and that the quality of accommodation only then, then we can try to wait a few more days.
The Špindler hotel offer for the moment that stays of a week for the New Year.
I think they will try one more time of the place, but they also and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of rooms free will rapidly diminish, " said Jandura.
The tourism agency Ingtours of Vrchlabí also proposes free beds for all periods of winter.
The week of Christmas we are most concerned for the moment, it is not completely sold.
There are still free, say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That is why we have already prepared a few last - minute Christmas stays cheaper, " said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The agency Vrchlabí tourism may also propose the New Year to Krkonoše, but there are fewer empty seats.
The first 14 days of February go well, the remaining winter trips are moderately.
This year, the interest in the winter has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow to Krkonoše.
People expect it to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the winter in the mountain without snow.
If the overlap during the week, Christmas also will be complete, " think Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupation of the hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
It was an improvement of about five percent.
We have few places for the New Year as for Christmas.
There is a great interest during the holidays in January and February of Polish sells well too, " said Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia Hotel near the central park Jánské Lázně is also full to 80 percent during the period of the New Year.
On the contrary, half of the beds are empty at Christmas in the most recent Jánské hotel Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we have already sixty percent of occupation at the moment.
February is a bit lower for the moment, but as soon as the snow will fall, the interest for stays in the Krkonoše grows certainly said the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The hotel of Krkonoše should not expect more snow.
On Thursday it will be fresher and if there is, they should be the mountains.
But the time should warm, informed Jiří Jakubský of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
United States: repetition is the mother of wisdom
It becomes even comical, the effort with which Barack Obama, president of the reputation of wise, reproduced the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan question, that he considered himself as simple.
When he eventually leave sweat its doctrine so eagerly awaited, it turned out that he had in carbon paper since the Iraqi scenario of Bush three years ago.
Not content to use in the text itself several times " as in Iraq, " he has not hesitated, moreover, to use the title of the speech by Bush in January 2007 as the title of his own speech: " A new way forward "
At the same time, he has personally criticized the idea of Bush to send new reinforcements in Iraq consumed by the civil war as " irresponsible and a disastrous decision in its consequences. "
The following month, however, have shown that the strategy of Bush, who came from the recommendations of the commanders of campaigns, was the only possible and likely success to the point that the newspapers currently do not speak at all of Iraq.
This has not enhanced the reputation of Bush, however, objectively speaking, it has left his successor a final situation much more favourable than we might hope.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen
Are the commanders of campaigns that have requested an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, which has severely criticized the reluctance of the White House despite the habits of subordination.
He asked 40,000 men in order to make the situation more favourable.
The president has hesitated for three months but in the absence of a better alternative, at least he had defrauded the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He has managed to root out the promise of additional 5,000 from Europe, even if it were about 10,000.
This brings the most problems throughout the strategy of Obama seems to be its intention to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete this process within three years. The doctrine of Obama raises more questions than it answers.
Many doubt the fact that an increase of half will bring the same fruit that progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders to honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation is by the exact opposite - we cannot rely on anyone and no treaty is respected.
In these conditions, difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to change from day to day depending on what suits them.
The political institutions, although based officially, will remain as a smokescreen behind which will proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is particularly difficult to balance the interests of various ethnic groups given the lack of clarity about the reports, which are further complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a " quick to act ", which is the aim of the operation, does not appear to be very real.
The time horizon of the Obama strategy makes perplexed by his determination.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has worsened and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a heart purely romantic and out of the reality can be confident that the small soldiers sent in the tumult of the war for " speedy return to the home " will bring a real miracle.
From a political point of view, set a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible because the Taliban will see as the indirect admission of defeat.
The last NATO summit has shown that the will of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving towards the negative.
European politicians do not know or do not want to explain to their constituents why security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor that could radically alter the situation is the development of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and that the sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult issue of a resolution of the problem by the use of military force.
It will respond by example when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Each solution of this type will, however, a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Obama is the fact that there are three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time to working on a new strategy, if it proves to be a flop.
The leaders of the bank Goldman Sachs will receive bonuses in cash
The senior leaders of the US bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced in response to strong criticism of its pay practices.
The group of 30 leaders will receive shares instead of cash, they will not sell within five years.
The actions can be withdrawn to leaders in case they would take too many risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is leading the effort to link the rewards with long - term performance on Wall Street.
I suppose that Wall Street is well aware of the overall sense that we need to take, " said the former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan
The concern is in the details, he added.
The bank Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after being set aside almost $17 billion in premiums for the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, large bonuses in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced Wednesday that it intends to affect a single fee of 50 percent bankers ' bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.

In the discharge of its policy he added that in certain situations the war is essential for peace, even if the price is high.
The Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus has invited to the castle
President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning the Finance Minister Eduard Janota, which weighs his stay in government because of his disagreement with the state budget for the next year as it was passed by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also the position of Janota the cabinet will be on the agenda of the meeting on Friday.
Klaus also criticised the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, widening the public finance crisis.
It is the presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat who informed the meeting.
Janota then discuss its Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget which will be submitted to the signing of Klaus is a deficit of $163 billion that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies approved Wednesday the proposals of the left transfers of money and has increased the rewards of officials, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the proposals of the Social Democrats that they would indirectly increase the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other hand, disagreement which calls into question the future of the cabinet who had been trained by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics argue that the budget, as it was voted by the members, removes the package of measures by the government of Fischer and that it should halt the indebtedness of the state.
Klaus, who can ratify the law on the state budget but that there is no requirement, said today at a breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs, that policies have long neglected the " serious problem " of the " disability " of public finances.
Now there is, according to him, no solution.
Only a strong government could bring an improvement, if he could rely on a consensus among the political parties, according to the president.
The president of the ODS Mirek Topolánek has indicated that the budget is staggering and that the government should call into question its existence.
The Vice - President of the ODS Petr Nečas told the ČTK that the idea of a Cabinet supported by the ČSSD, ODS and the Greens is clearly more.
In its response, the Prime Minister Fischer described such words of " drastic ".
The head of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit for this year by the former government of Topolánek is staggering and that it will exceed 200 billion kronor.
On Wednesday, the ČSSD called success the ratification of the state budget for the next year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film
Despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans say the new Hollywood film of will explain to the world a lot about the country, its struggles and victories.
The story of sport, relations between races and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, U. S. actor rewarded the Oscars, embodies the film on the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and first black president.
Freeman said, that this is a Mandela aged years who asked him to embody in the film.
Matt Damon plays an important role.
I told him: " If I were you, I should be able to see you personally.
The actor aged years who was awarded a prize for his role in the drama Milion Dollar Baby of Clint Eastwood located in the middle of boxing has, for example, the leader of a movement against slavery, itself a fictional US president, even God in the film Evan Almighty but never someone still alive and so important to so many people as Mandela.
The ex - homme of State of South Africa was jailed for 27 years for his hard work in favour of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning unbeaten and this is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak with him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country resteencore and always divided racially and economically after apartheid.
It is sure to unite his people through sport and decides to join the rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world.
The South African team will progress in World Cup in 1995.
Freeman has worked for a few years to bring the history of Mandela on screen.
I had no other purpose if not play this role to the closest to the reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge for me it was, of course, talk like him
The actor said that if he and the international policy were in the same region, it would have tried to meet Mandela, dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake hands.
I realized that when I shake hands, I recover your energy, it is transmitted and I had the impression of how you feel, " he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh environment of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I come to the door of the house, I opened and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was: ' I have the air much greater in the film ".
Despite the differences between the actors and the actual models, under the leadership of the director Eastwood received positive opinions and there is even talk of ambitions for the Oscars.
The film critic Todd McCarthy of the newspaper Daily Variety summarized his appreciation in these words: " This is a very good story, a film very well done. "
In the evaluations of films on the site rottentomatoes. com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive feedback.
The mystery of the will in Norway is committed: the Russians tested a rocket
There has been a strange phenomenon of unknown origin over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence has acknowledged that yesterday have tested a rocket intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
The launch has been a failure and the missile " Bulava " which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army is gradually becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His presence repeated tests of the rocket has not had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Most of the time, has not, or it is damaged in flight.
The Russian newspapers talk of " Bulava " as " not flying "
A missile that is not
This 13th test took place at the beginning.
It is only at the end of the flight that there was further damage to the equipment.
This is clearly the engine of the third floor of the rocket that exploded.
This time, " Bulava " soaring nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be fired from a boat and submerged
This is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object precisely has likely been a " Bulava " flawed.
The rest, the Norwegians have not doubted for a moment that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot talk of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket have resisted and damage was confined to the third.
In the previous cases, the engines have been on the first floor.
Although none of the test launches went smoothly, the direction of the Ministry of Defence said that only six out of thirteen have been failures.
This success rate of almost 50 percent fills the general optimism and they say that one day " Bulava " fly without problems and that it will prevail even ten nuclear cores a total weight of 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetissov has signed a one - year contract with CSKA Moscow

Hyundai has listened to the unions and cancels all overtime
The direction of the Hyundai plant in Nošovice has agreed with unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of overtime frequent that unions have declared a state of emergency strike Monday.
The spokesman Petr Vaněk plant Hyundai has confirmed.
The leadership wants to reach agreement with the unions on a Saturday worked again this year.
We cannot abandon our production plan, it is essential, that is why voluntary overtime have been proposed on Saturday, 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, said.
The site Sedmička. cz indicated that the company has proposed a bonus 400 Czech crowns to employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will be awarded also checking for the day worked on 28 November.
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change the way to motivate its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for hours, or they can ask a replacement leave on 28 December and extend their holiday aindiqué Vaněk.
In addition to this all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for the costs of transport and for their lunch.
Given the fact that overtime were the most urgent and the warmest in the comments and the demands of the unions as employees who have voluntarily stopped production last week, management has taken the decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, said.
Until last week, the employees of the automotive plant were forced to work almost daily two hours in addition to their eight hours.
The unions have cancel the state of strike after signing of the agreement.
The following negotiations between the direction of the car factory and the unions should take place Friday afternoon.
The union leader Petr Kuchař said Wednesday that they were prepared to stop the state of strike if agreement on their claims and signing of a joint document.
The situation in the plant culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 workers were on strike because of overtime.
They were protesting against the poor conditions of pay and so - called bizutages.
Management has defended with the fact that employees had to work as a supplement to meet the imperatives of car production.
At the announcement of the strike Monday, the unions have also requested that the employees who have ceased production are not subject to any sanction.
The unions are asking the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want this year a reward of 5 million crowns (209 €) for them.
The car plant Hyundai of Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
She started series production last year in November.
It has produced about 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that operates on the HIV virus "
A team of German and Czech scientists test new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it is also on the virus that have already developed an immunity to drugs.
This is, in some cases, the fact that the combination is not as hard on the common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at the moment.
It nevertheless can prolong the life of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the spread of HIV in the body.
Consumption, however, a series of side effects.
The suppression of this increase is the development of so - called resistant viruses on which drugs have no effect.
The work of the three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the Všcht of Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way for a way to cope with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination is blocking the development of the virus in a different way of all drugs used to date and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of researchers to discover new substances " improved ", on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their routes on the protein of the virus.
The metalocarboranes have a unique three - dimensional structure: two cages to multiple walls are formed by the boron atoms of hydrogen and carbon and connected by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A traitor and resistant virus.
The HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus which is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by the HIV protease there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If we stop the HIV protease, it will stop the spread of the virus in the body of the patient, the researchers explained in a press release issued by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their study published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short link, which is then systematically amended.
A little lower but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on the HIV protease was tested in test tubes and its variants resistant, obtained from patients infected with HIV.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as on the clinical medicine, however it is not diminishing the resistant versions against which the current drugs are often ineffective.
The metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and their other properties as their biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are therefore interesting combinations to consider more to move towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, director of the structural biology laboratory of the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and molecular genetics Institute of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute around the budget. The ODS is Fischer, who defends
The president of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) , Mirek Topolánek has described as " staggering " the budget for the following year and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The prime minister described the ODS of drastic verdict.
He said take time to analyze.
The spokesman of the ODS Petr Nečas said that the idea of a Cabinet supported by the ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party did more.
According to Nečas, the head of the government should decide whether ilprend in the Chamber of Deputies on the minority who cares to combat the growing deficit, or if it is to remain in office with the help of the left.
Nečas has warned that the positions of the ODS and Social Democrats in relation to the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, with the proposed amendments to the tune of 12 billion kronor included by the left.
The House has increased the money for the salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's complaint against the proposals of the Social Democrats was the fact that they increased indirectly the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should run a deficit of $163 billion kronor.
The ODS has left the chamber before the vote, obeying the wishes of the government as a revised budget is a variant less bad than a budget.
Disappointment and
The Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still consider the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office in case of ratification of the proposed changes, the situation might be different.
According to the Czech Television, Janota took meeting Monday with Prime Minister after its passage in government:
He indicated at the same time that he wondered whether he would remain in office.
His disappointment about the negotiations on the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight against the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, which have imposed changes in the budget, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make clear that he will resign if the House ratifies the other laws increasing the deficit, such as those affecting the health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the law on services.
Topolánek: ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
This is the case of the head of government Fischer and the government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing wrong, said in a news release from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some departments are TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to give his resignation to fight against the amount of the deficit in the public finances, " it is entirely logical and correct that it is based on the left - wing majority which is currently in the House. "
That said, it should not expect the support and tolerance of Democrats.
I have not thought about it and once it will be on the agenda when I, said since the House to journalists, the Defence Minister Martin Barták, elected to government by the Democrats.
The Prime Minister Fischer has soared in the afternoon for a discussion of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS has backtracked at the request of the Prime Minister.
Nečas stressed at the same time that the ODS would probably have voted Wednesday against the amended budget if he had not specifically asked the Democrats to allow the vote on the budget.
We do not have the feeling of being orphans, it is no small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not been the President of the Party in the House or in the country during the negotiation of the budget.
I have not noticed that my vote would have been lacking.
I already knew when I renounced my mandate that what would follow in the coming months would be a bolchévisation of the House and destruction of all that was positive, reacted Topolánek in person.
According to the new schedules of the ČD there will be fewer trains for the same charges.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit from 13 December some express trains or regional less responsible and will instead some others.
The full coverage of transport will fall on the day of entry into force of the new schedule of two percent compared to today.
Most of the charges will not change, including the basic rates and the reduced rate.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region who will have more connections to the capital, the railways will add a rowing.
On the contrary, an express will serve Bratislava.
There will also be less fast trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, the Prague - Letohrad will be drastically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest drop in transportation for the region of Hradec Králové eight percent in total, Prague and its environs can welcome an increase.
Two night trains on the line Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice are also cancelled and the movement of some express trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice is reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the major changes, you can see the introduction of a new line of Milovice in Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice must change to Lysá nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of the commuter system, whose opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines to the capital will have their final destination at the main station in Prague (Praha Hlavní nádraží) .
The ČD will introduce more lines between Prague and Ostrava and Pendolino trains to leave by intervals of two hours.
Travellers can no longer take the Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December.
The bill this year for regional railways: 200 million kroner.
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the railways next year in all four billion kronor to visible, the same amount as this year. The regional trains are ordered by the regions who will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The railways have newly signed a contract for ten years, until now the duration was always a year.
The railways like the system, which also explains that they have not resorted to a price increase of the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will affect only tickets a day ČD Net and the Internet at reduced prices eLiška.
For travellers without a card, the price of ČD Net increase from 450 to 600.
The price of eLiška will depend on the miles, whereas previously it was valid between the cities of a region in the choice and was a single rate of 160 crowns.
The rebels still hold more than 50 people, children have been released
The rebels have kidnapped today 75 people in the southern Philippines, including some primary school students and their teachers.
It is the AFP agency who informed, but who spoke to the origin of 65 hostages only.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as teachers.
The hostage - taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels have used the hostages as human shields during a flight to the police.
The local negotiators are trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA) , which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) .

They have however renewed peace talks with the Philippine government Tuesday.
The history of South Africa for everyone, according to Morgan Freeman Mandela
The new Hollywood film of Clint Eastwood arrives in the US in the next few days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus: Neporažený) , and part of the life of the former South African president Nelson Mandela.
The role of the fight against apartheid world famous returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody.
The second male role of the legendary champion South African rugby has been attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in cinemas, the critics and the public are heard.
Nelson Mandela
His full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, born on 18 June 1918 to Mvezu in South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for freedom of spirit, in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside de Klerk.
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great expectations because it is presented at a time when South Africa is in full preparations for the World Cup, and secondly because the media are disturbed by disturbing news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants of the part of the black majority in power.
According to the AP, reactions to the new film are for the moment rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations to the main roles where " pavanent " of Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is nevertheless, using his own words, proud of the film.
I dreamt of this role for many years and I am well prepared.
I have also repeatedly personally met Nelson Mandela to power - as they say - recover his energy, he said in the first official film in Los Angeles.
I think it is a good thing if we had the opportunity to remember via the film personality and the message of Mandela.
It is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but It is each individual, he added.
Wear the jersey of the national rugby team
The film based on the history of the British writer John Carlin the title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the room that gave his creation to the people portrayed the South African defender of human rights during his presidency.
Morgan Freeman tries during the film to pick up two racial groups of a population long divided and that Nelson Mandela in 1995 it between the national team on the lawn of the World Cup, which South Africa had won.
To be shown on the lawn in Jersey, which is seen in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been widely fourteen years ago mainly white audience and has been recognized by the white populations.
Hope that the football championship will unite people again in a single nation, said the rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only " black " of the national team.
It remains to be seen if the situation tense situation will improve.
The white South Africans, however, are sceptical as recently said in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who has fled to Britain.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.

Jančura will sue for defamation against three prefects of ČSSD
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, will file today complaint for defamation against three prefects Social Democrats.
And specifically against Michal Hašek region of southern Moravia, against Radko Martínka of Pardubice region and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesařík.
Jančura indicated in Dvacet of Radiožurnál.
The complaint is linked to the attempt by the company to operate regional railways in some regions.
All regions have signed long - term contracts with the Czech railways.
All three have attacked us and say that the fine, while it has only made an offer for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the price of Czech railways signed last week.
Therefore we have to defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for slander on society Student Agency, said Jančura Radiožurnál.
Similarly, he said he had evidence that no region has proceeded in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint to the European Commission.
Considers that the complaint of Mr Jančura represents the result of its media spectacle of free publicity for his company and his person.
I am of course prepared to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on others to do the same.
I assume that this will be an opportunity to show clearly that it is precisely Mr. Jančura who manipulate public opinion and using false and misleading arguments about the regional rail transport, says
Jančura has already informed last week that it will invest a few million crowns in an advertisement that approaches regions.
He said Radiožurnál that it stopped the campaign after Christmas and that it intends to resume after the New Year.
He said that the campaign will target corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura began his campaign after the regions have agreed to give the Czech railways operate rail links to an order of about 150 billion kronor, without bidding.
According to Jančura, such action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions has even led to Jančura threats of a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if it does not stop, we could lose our licences bus.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I do not know who He is but I will not say his name, said Jančura today to Radiožurnál.
Vaccination against pneumococcal will be free and voluntary
Vaccination against pneumococcal reverse the old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time for the families.
The already, saying that a compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumococcal.
The pharmaceutical Institute for vaccines already defines the maximum prices that will pay for the insurance.
The experts also clear in the process of vaccination.
A new vaccine.
Free vaccines for children of August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated free against pneumococcal.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If we began the vaccination last year or earlier, we will have to pay the following vaccinations.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the third and the fifth month of the child.
Last year a quarter of families has voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcal.
Yet parents paid 1,600 crowns or even more for a dose.
The vaccination of young requires four doses.
Experts estimate that each year the insurance spend 300 to 450 000 crowns in doses of vaccine.
However, they save on medical care that children would require.
So far the state was spending about 500,000 per year for the vaccination of children.
The vaccination was introduced with the " Janota package.
The pneumococcal bacteria are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including inflammation of the brain and blood poisoning.
According to surveys in hospitals, until 28 deaths of children under 10 years caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced vaccination refunded.
Vaccination will be mandatory?
There is advice on a possible vaccination in the future.
From January, it must be resolved by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that a compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
The association has long promoted the pneumococcal vaccination.
At an international conference in which our association has participated, experts were not really satisfied with the fact that we have a voluntary vaccination.
This is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased to have been able to impose at least this.
I think it is a direction that we must now follow said Kalovský.
But the Department of Health does not change the process of pneumococcal vaccination.
We are definitely not for the moment, " said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, say doctors.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Society of paediatricians, recognizes that a vaccine based on the volontariata its shortcomings.
If all children were vaccinated, it could consider a reduction of renewals vaccinations " in the situation where the vaccine is such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination optional " said however Cabrnochová.
Experts predict that next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will vaccinate their infants.
Vaccination against pneumococcal marks a break from the fact that this is the first vaccination of children which is funded by the insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochová explained that insurance should free up funds for prevention, they save on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their products themselves
This is linked to the concerns of pediatricians practitioners, which relate to the purchase of vaccines.
The original intent was to buy vaccines by insurance, doctors receiving the same way as other products of vaccine provided by the state.
Some Members were concerned, however, that this would allow insurance companies to deduct the amount of health insurance. "
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for the insurance.
According to estimates, pediatricians individually invest nearly 40 000 SEK per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.

Islam can be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, fans of the author's latest book, " why the French do not like the headscarf " (2006) , an elegant and well documented on an issue that has divided and concerned the country for 15 years and whose effects are still being felt today.
The last book by Mr. Bowen presents a much broader and more ambitious.
Good anthropologist, he does not want to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes provide now in France this quem. Bozen called " spaces " for the 5m - 6m Muslims.
He knows very well listen and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
A Muslim must marry in a mosque or at the town hall (or both) ?
The evolution and the rights of homosexuals should be taught to young Muslims?
A Muslim woman can marry a non - Muslim?
A Muslim can use a banking system based on the interests for a loan?
These are practical problems, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, a Muslim Arab born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate until the end.
Lesconservateurs do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
Intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts lawyers of a Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia that today, are a small part of Muslims in Europe.
M Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularism of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can be achieved with the efforts of each side.
He wondered how the French politicians (and the intellectual elite guardian if virulent of secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims have not been spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also had to make compromises with the secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, he detects a " narrowness of key values ".
Islam can be French? after reading this book, one is tempted to say " yes, but not yet. "
The view of the world's darkest
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other place on the planet.
The ice is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipments and new fishing vessels in open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In " on a thin layer of ice, " Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the symbol of the north, the polar bear.
Knows the history and complicated political of whaling, he described the long tradition of Arctic explorers who were their evidence in hunting polar bears.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then courageous aspiring 14 years who had to fight the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young cubs, captured while they swam alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the twentieth century, a show celebrating 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still generally a millionth of the surface necessary for an adult in the climate is rarely mentioned: a polar bear living in Singapore became green because of algae that grew in his thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and is often on the threat posed by hunters on the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada where hunters by helicopter and the Indians in motoski use fusilsd ' powerful assault to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of these two nations of hunting that ice will be longer.
In his new book, " after the ice ", Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear summary and frightening science of the Arctic and a fascinating glimpse of what may be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither the atmosphéristes nor oceanographers can tell exactly the speed of change.
This is not for lack of trying.
Late nineteenth and early twentieth, travel pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen gave the first information on the melting of the ice cap.
The submarines in the Cold War were then mapped changes sous - celle - ci.
The surveillance satellites and probes placed on icebergs are a great help, but most of the work is done by men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson the extraordinary world and tiny system dependent on the Arctic ice, formed by the nets of brackish water by freezing.
But the bear mentioned above the microscopic marvels contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of summer ice, scheduled between 2013 and 2050.

The Marines, among the 6,000 people who have laid wreaths on the graves in Arlington
The first class Angello Robinson, 19, has made a trip of seven hours by bus to lay a wreath on the grave of a soldier that he had never met.
For him and for the other Marines who made the trip to Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina at Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was devoted to salute the men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, where we will be sent, we will be in their place, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If it was me, I would like someone to do the same thing for me, that is why I just trying to show respect.
It was one of the 6,000 volunteers to be gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans, in different sections of the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company to Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others have decided to decorate hundreds of graves in the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
Now, to continue a tradition of 18 years, and his wife Karen, each year the journey, stopping in different cities on their way to organize the commemorations in honour of the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcester have also founded a non - profit association, Wreaths Across America (wreaths Across America) , which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers have placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves of the Arlington, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the cemetery Fayetteville National Cemetery enArkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City and on the site of the memorial to the victims of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation has given more than $150,000 to buy and carry the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said that she had made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a career soldier died.
While her husband is not buried at Arlington, Hunt said that for her, it was a way to thank those who had sacrificed.
It is a small gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It is like visiting a family tomb.
In several layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked between the lawns and hills tracts of the cemetery.
The volunteers have chosen ancient tombs, dating from the First and Second World war, as well as the Vietnam War, because they are not often visited the new graves, said the organizers.
The mood was optimistic, while children played and couples were held by the hand, wearing the crowns of fresh pine on the graves.
Each crown round had a dark green colour, with a small red butterfly knot on the top.
Nearby, was silent on the Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations has given 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
People without hiding, others praying and families and friends back in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in stone while others looked to see small black and white information cards in the wetland for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers in tears, on the grave of her son.
It is part of Zanesfield, Ohio and had led eight hours to come to collect on the grave of Marine Sergeant GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget thanks to what we are free ... my son has paid for it, " she said.
" long after I am gone, I want someone to remember him. "
A US citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a US citizen who was mobile phones and laptop computers in the country, said the services of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The national, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U. S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities as well as the U. S. Interest Section in Havana trying to gain access to the inmate who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested under the pretext of being " dangerous ".
All the so - called revolutionary activities, including moderate and critical writing, the risk of arrest.
The anti - government graffiti and speeches are regarded as serious crimes.
Cuba has a community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, popular commentator who writes often about how are husband and are followed and harassed by government officials.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards but the authorities have always been denied.
The detention of an American citizen may increase tensions between the communist government of brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration pursues a " soft " approach to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times, Friday evening.
The new US policy insists that the Cuban government advance by concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and create more space for the opposition, so that the US to reciprocate.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed to Cuba, although consumer goods and desired in a country or the average salary of an employee is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government has granted to ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for text messages or for a 15 - minute conversation which corresponds to a day's pay.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
The Cubans want to connect often must provide their name to the government.
Access to many Web sites is limited.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, " said Gloria Berbena, press officer with the U. S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention is a big mistake.
An activity that, in any open society, would be allowed -- distribute free mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, " said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas Program director of the group Human Rights Watch, which has recently published a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba, called " new Castro, Cuba ", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as leader of the country to replace Fidel, his older brother ill.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, when the two countries begin to initiate a dialogue.
The Pakistani authorities prevented a plot to send men in Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities have identified an organization supposed to prepare a plot to send five men of Northern Virginia in Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, saying they hoped that this case would remove a significant network of terrorist recruiters of the Internet in search of young men.
Investigators said they hunted a personality insurgente hidden, known as Saifullah who invited these men in Pakistan after having discovered when one of them has made comments endorsing the waves terrorists on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Arrived in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them to reach the remote area of the tribal belt of Pakistan, home of al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the Pakistani secret service who has been informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince the al-Qaeda commanders that these men were not involved in the plot of the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network.
They have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the mountains of northeastern become a haven for terrorism.
They were considered as undercover agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities said that the men were determined and that they were always trying to obtain the necessary approvals for the entry into the camps al-Qaeda when they were arrested by the forces of Pakistani law.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and who are interviewed by the FBI on the crucial role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and perhaps more important, in the determination of the people who trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US secret services have been a priority for men in the al-Qaeda network.
Recruiters of the organization play the role of firewalls, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may be spies.
According to analysts, the American recruits are studied closely by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their value propagandaire.
However Evan Kohlmann, an expert of the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups must also do more attention in recent years in the choice of people they accept because the US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow its recruitment model that so many other people have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen for an " action " for the climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants marched in the streets here Saturday, calling for greater action on the part of the negotiators working in the palace of Congress Bella Convention Center in the city.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000 people, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
This event went relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists has few explosives near a set of government buildings in downtown.
On a day when little has happened during the discussions on climate sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists marched through the city, deploying signs in English saying there is no planet B " and in Spanish, saying " the Earth said she has had enough. "
Several celebrities have joined the protests, including the top model and photographer Danish, Helena Christensen, who said that travel to the home of his mother, Peru, has opened our eyes to the problems facing the country because of the impact of climate change are already happening. "
This is one of the reasons why I decided to join the great march -- to get the word and to launch an appeal to the leaders of the world to take the right decisions, ambitious and committed, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the Centre and said that it had arrested 19 people on the ground that they were wearing a mask or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
The police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the Centre and said that it had arrested 19 people on the ground that they were wearing a mask or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passer - by who requested anonymity because of his involvement in the discussions on climate, the activists who wore masks and black clothing, have several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is surrounded by some departments.
They launched near the buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, followed by " a few large explosions ".
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people gathered around television screens to follow the march, throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the demonstrators have failed to awaken the conscience of key authorities such as Su Wei, representative of China for the climate.
When asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English " in fact, it is something that I had no conscience.
He then continued in Mandarin, saying " the event is important, I cannot hear what is happening outside. "
He observed that the march could be harmful or helpful to the outlook.
It shows the interest of the general public and various sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, " you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or that they undermine the freedom of others. "
The results of the tests reveal persistent differences between the races
The federal report last week on the results in mathematics has brought good news for public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the District is still far behind the leading institutions, the report shows that the Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1 - cm2) are much greater progress in the past two years in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of the progress of education) is the persistent gap between the results of African - Americans and whites, both local and national.
The results of white children in Grade 4 () to Washingtond. C. have increased over the past two years, 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500) , but those of their classmates increased by only three points, 209 to 212.
The gap of success has actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African - Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, falling just one point, from 245 to 244.
The result means the White has not been included in the results of the tests because the sample was not important enough.
The overview over a period of six years is not encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in class of Grade 4 () , when the first report was published, the District was 60 points (262 to 202) .
Although the results obtained by the children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District have expressed concern that the rising celebrated by the Director of group of educational institutions Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were powered by the white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we have raised the aggregate in considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, " said Jeff Smith, director of DC Voice, a non - profit group that promotes equality in education in the District.
I do not jump for joy for one or two points, " said Kwame R. Brown (related Democrat) , member of the D. C. Council and whose daughter is in Grade 4, Eaton Elementary (elementary school) .
Often critical of the management style of Rhee, Brown said that the message of the test results is that the middle schools (colleges) of the city desperately need attention.
Really, you still want to see the positive signs and I respect that.
But the fear is that we do not spend enough time and energy to our middle schools (colleges) .
Rhee said that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson reading System, for classes end of elementary school and early college who have not incorporated the foundations of reading earlier in their school and who are behind their peers.
Every day, the mathematics curriculum for grades kindergarten (kindergarten to Grade 6 (6th) focuses on the games and the experiences of real life, as they have been put in place in the District by the former superintendent Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I simply believe that we must continue to work to provide better responses to these students from the class, said Rhee.
Others believe that the results of the NAEP raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less successful in order to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a trainer of education at the University of California at Berkeley who studied the results of the tests of cities.
The conventional political solution is to spend your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
Also this targeting may have political repercussions that this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that as the superintendent of schools, she is trying to use the middle class whites and blacks.
We focus to ensure the development of a system of good schools.
We must strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they come from, are confident that their children can obtain an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the gap of success is the duration of traditional public school, now of 180 days in the District of Washington, to compete with the Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with the union of its teachers last year for 185 days, that it considers a " starting point " for an increase in the next contract.
Make higher education a promise of future
The bus was arrested in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years, falls and cligne a time of eyes at the sight of white columns, facades of bricks and rolling lawns.
The parents of Graciela had only been able to finish The school, àEl Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela itself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, when she and other students in Grade 8 (4) of the group explored Gettysburg where tuition fees are $38 690 per year, his attitude was less than that of a new student impressed that enthusiastic.
This is where I will study! exclaimed Graciela wishing to study medicine, while the guide heading towards the entrance of the building of science.
Youpi, really? " she says, when he said the low ratio law professor - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that visiting children during their voyage of discovery of three days and now they had completely integrated the message: the question is not whether you go to university:
The question is where.
Although this question is still largely for the large number of American children born to parents Hispanic immigrants who have left the school where became parents to adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands of university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, " Hispanic " second generation " on cinqpoursuit his studies at the school -- a notable success if one considers that both of their immigrant parents, most from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without having completed high school.
Their success is important, the researchers say, they pave the way for future generations that will play an important role in the country.
Researchers studying the wings say that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
The mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children as it to reach the university -- in particular, if its efforts are regular and long - term.
When you look at the children of low - income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at University of California, Davis, who has studied the Latin American students.
We need to provide a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that has funded the visit of Graciela is a good example.
Known as the Gear up (you) , it provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems to organize the programs at the university that begin when students from low income families are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of years of school.
Since 1999, the programme has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering the university, according to the U. S. Department of Education.
The Department of Iraqi oil agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auction that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of oil with the foreign oil companies suggest that oil companies from China, Russia and Europe are poised to play a major role in the rehabilitation of the oil industry of Iraq, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies are left with an interest in only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began Friday.
The only one that had set an auction has lost.
Two American companies have won contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, are of Asian and European companies are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the forum Iraq Oil Forum, a site of information on the Internet.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
The concerns about security, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings, Tuesday, and political instability, while the US military troops withdraw have slowed the American oil companies, preventing them from entering with more force in Iraq, which has the third largest oil reserve in the world, say analysts.
American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, especially the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they had not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon - Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only companies to obtain contracts with the department.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong links with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and brought their technical advice, are left empty - handed.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the state, has more on contracts that other companies and is left with significant holdings in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesman of the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that the Chinese society will be on an equal footing with its competitors and achieve its commitments in Iraq.
The pre - selected companies to submit auction bid which were then compared to the price per barrel that the department agreed to pay to motivate the production above current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaeda have been killed in Pakistan
It seems that an American missile, which hit along the border with Afghanistan has killed one of the organizers of the operations of al-Qaeda, this week, said Friday the U. S. authorities of counter - intelligence.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack against a terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected to have been killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car, Tuesday, near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to US and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities have said that the missiles were fired by a pilotless aircraft of the type used by the CIA, inside the lawless tribal border of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of the secret services Pakistani civilians, speaking by telephone from Miran Shah.
The authorities have said that the local militant suspects rushed to place and quickly confiscated what remained of " body completely.
It was completely impossible to local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two U. S. counter - terrorism officials have given unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of the organizers of military officials who ran the al-Qaeda terrorist group outside the Afghanistan - Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize conspiracies in the world, " said one of the authorities who requested anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of the air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this included probably conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe.
It followed the strategic guidance of the leaders of al-Qaeda and has translated into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the American authority said that Somali had increased rapidly in the ranks of al-Qaida's and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It is not known to the general public, but this does not diminish the threat it poses for us and our allies, " said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, would be the second major figure of al-Qaeda or the Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks carried out by CIA drones has declined since the summer, about six transactions per month to two, according to the figures by the Long War Journal, a Web site tempered by a non - profit group.
This decline is perhaps due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while killing also ruthlessly suspected informants, says the site.
The UN special envoy to Kabul withdrew
The UN special envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous tenure marred by allegations of corruption during the presidential elections supported by the United Nations.
The departure comes as the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported the increase, but he expressed concern about the timetable for a withdrawal of US troops that would begin in 18 months and that would force the other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, " Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Our commitment must be long - term.
The Norwegian diplomat has also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international staff helping the political transition in Afghanistan.
The increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said that he did not resign but that it would honour the commitment that he made to his family in March, will spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
The Secretary - General Ban Ki - moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I simply said that it was better to start looking for my replacement, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a gap of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to the representatives of the UN, Ban has already begun to seek a replacement.
The representatives say that the name of Staffan di Mistura has been cited; it is a citizen Italo - Swiss recently chaired a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean - Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who has previously led the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan has been put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, was accused in September, President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and to conceal evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations, but he said that the accusations of Galbraith -- who was thanked -- " have damaged the mission because there was already a good dose of scepticism as regards the international observation of the elections ".
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the rescue of American forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries that it is attributed to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence about how their money is spent.
Eide has expressed his frustration about the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy regulation of hiring UN hindered its ability to bring new talent.
The rules are such that I was unable to recruit one person since May, he said.
It is catastrophic and it cannot last.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers would soon impose " significant additional sanctions " on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on the nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking before a crowd of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a visit to a week in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, has the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to the question of a soldier on the possibility of such an outcome.
One of the things that strikes me the most is that if I learned one thing in Iraq over the past six years, it is the unpredictability inherent in the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions against the military and political elite in Iran, but Gates has indicated that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians in the street.
He said that " a package of incentives and punishments " might be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would in fact less good security with nuclear weapons " because " his people would suffer greatly of these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the administration has joined the European leaders in warning that Iran will face consequences " probable " if it does not bring its nuclear program in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) .
Iran continues to say that he wants to develop its nuclear experience only in a peaceful purposes.
In the Geneva talks on October 1, he indicated that it would resume dialogue on the reduction of its nuclear programme and agreed to give up a significant part of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has prompted such an agreement, way to build confidence on both sides and to save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to be attempts - in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, I think, the stiffening of Iran with some of the proposals of the international community to which they had given their agreement in early October, has led the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join what they had not considered, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before it turned to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called " increased sanctions ".
In a statement Thursday in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations has denounced what it called " baseless allegations " of some members of the Security Council on the nuclear activities of Iran and said it was agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, " in order to obtain a satisfactory solution in the long term ".
Gates, who was to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning, the Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, before flying to the oil rich region of Kurdish derencontrer Heads of troops in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly on the borders, property rights and the sharing of revenues.
Gates has urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays of US plans to reduce the number of American troops, 115 000 to 50 000 before the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm the anxiety of Kurds concerning the withdrawal pending. The American authorities have quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan regional government: " We will preserve your security, prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq. "
We will not abandon you. "
In China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by the propaganda poster preaching, " the Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children " and " a baby, it is a grave in more ".
They have learned the lesson that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the lack of birth rate of their city and the ageing of the population, have radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instant and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
There is no second, said Wang, 31, director of human resources and has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one - child policy in China, creating two generations of children unique notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled, dubbed the " little emperors ", a crisis of the population threatens the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and over will explode, 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This figure is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in the rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for almost 22 percent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Commission of the Shanghai Municipal Population and family Planning) said that the fertile couples to have babies in order " to help reduce the proportion of the aging population and to prevent a lack of manpower in the future ".
Shanghai is on the verge of becoming " too old - but not as rich, however - that the developed countries such as Japan and Sweden, " she said.
A gradual reduction
Written in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one - child policy is to this day, without doubt, the most controversial requirement introduced by the communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay huge fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and suffer discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have attributed to the police on duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while lawyers for human rights have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority have forced pregnant women a second child to have abortions.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to a ratio of boys to girls abnormally high.
In recent years, the authorities of the population have gradually softened their position on the one - child policy.
In 2004, they have given more exceptions to the rule -- including for residents of cities, members of ethnic minorities and the cases in which the man and the woman are already children -- and in 2007, they have softened much of their slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research (Institute of Population Research at Peking University, said that the authorities of the central government have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, the posters encouraging families to have only one child have been replaced by copies of regulations retailer who has the right to have a second child and how to apply for authorization.
The city government has dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples at home, and slipping leaflets under their door.
He has also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response has been disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for records of couples wanting a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115 million inhabitants, for example, is four to five requests per month.
Officials in Shanghai, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is still expected to be only about 165 000 -- slightly higher in 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Committee of family planning in the Caolu of Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to provide their first child, she said.
Yang, 27 years and his wife, Liu, 26, said they would love to have two children and that they are legally allowed.
But like many Chinese, they have only the minimum health insurance and life assurance given by the government.
Without a social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
The Western mistakenly see that the one - child policy is a matter of rights, " said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
It is true, we are fortunate to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only the law.
It is money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their reluctance.
Wang, Head of human resources, said she wanted a single child because it itself. " We were the centre of the family and had used that everyone cares. "
We do not have the habit of taking care of someone else and we really do not want to take care of others. "
Chen Zijian, 42 years and owner of a translation company said more bluntly.
For couples working at two, middle class, which reduce the birth rate, he says, he must be selfish pourbien succeed.
The people of 20 or 30 years have grown up watching their parents struggle in the early days of the China capitalist and do not want to have themselves this way of life, " he says.
Even one child takes a lot of time with his parents, he says.
A mother must abandon at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the problems of space -- " You must change your apartment " -- and planning -- " When your child has only 9 months, you need to write his CV for a place in the best mother. "
Most of his friends are willing to this experience once, said Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, " he says.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
The group of the United Nations plans for reducing emissions
The climate conference, sponsored by the United Nations -- characterized so far by disorganized and mutual recriminations is back in the spotlight Friday, due to the publication of a document outlining the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations supporting most of the burden in the coming years.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, said the remaining obstacles, as he has informed the path to take.
But it was seen as an important step forward in the negotiations that lack of time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Prepared by a special working group of the United Nations, the text does not say how rich countries would give the poor to withstand global warming, short and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how the developed economies and the emerging economies could reduce their production of carbon and what would be the upper limit of the increase in global temperature that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility in the process, said John Coequyt, Representative of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has written six pages of the document, studied a text of 180 pages to focus on what has described the Secretary - General on climate change, Yvo de Boer, as " the full picture ".
It shows the guidelines of a possible agreement in which the industrial nations collectively reduce their emissions in 2020, from 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990 levels, while the major developing countries, during the same period, reduce by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched negotiations, Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion per year over the next three years to help the poorest countries to adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercation occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, the US Representative to the negotiating climate has rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, in comparison with the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed countries.
This change is a signal that the Obama administration becomes harder to China that the Bush administration has been two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of the major developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text does not enough to ensure that the reductions could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, He Yafei has said that the US chief negotiator, lacked " common sense ", was " extremely irresponsible " for having said earlier in the week that the US would not help financially China to combat global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of major world powers involved, defects are both within the third and between the industrial world and the emerging economies.
The current battle is more concerned with the rescue of individual economies that the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States on their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the two dozen of the most influential scientific imperatives to act more boldly.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate of Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of the reduction of greenhouse gases, even if the vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major emitters accountable for their actions.
It really is a game in which has developed a new economic hegemony, said Ulate, who is also advising on the climate for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to put pressure for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say that the negotiations will lead to a minimum, a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States which brings together 43 members, has drafted a proposal for a treaty of 24 pages, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge - Metzger, head of the unit of the European Commission, said that the action of small island states has " put political pressure on the political process in part by what they are now unified and they ask to emerging economies such as China and India, to act.
The debates have become a matter of urgency, while delegates focused on the fact that they should solve most of the problems pending before the heads of government come to an agreement.
High - level officials such as the Indian environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister descended from their plane and rushed into the building of the Bella Center to attend meetings and conferences of information, in order to make claims that will be considered during the course of the following week.
The real image of the gathering -- in which 13,000 people entering and exiting the Palais des Congrès every day -- activists guitar players are nocturnal entertainment mocking countries which they betray and that proposals are prepared and distributed on paper rather than by emails -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is increasing: almost all key ministers are here and not later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the big, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of Conservation International.
Lorries arrive.
In Britain, the first train to 225 km/h will redefine the syndrome Monday
5h13, Monday morning, a whistle night to signal the start of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in Britain.
The first high - speed commuter train in the country will reach 225 km/h, of Ashford, in Kent, to London St Pancras, covering the 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Minister, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first commuter train Javelin outside London.
He hoped that the new service will allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast trains and reliable and will link the large conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The small holes lost will become thriving suburbs, business travel will be much less long and the passage of the plane and the car to the train will reduce national emissions of carbon while reducing congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhering to this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new rail network, the battle of planning inevitable and fears of risks to the environment may dampen the high - speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2) , a company established in January for the government to conduct a feasibility report, will make his report to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage for the high - speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn in the five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment can be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres of the final itinerary.
It is also expected that HS2 presents three options for a high - speed network, to the north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are put forward in a configuration for which a high - speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will split into two at or near Birmingham, with a branch from the west Pennines àManchester and Scotland and another to the northeast, Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line through Scotland.
" It seems that this will be the best option of performance said a professional of rail.
When this is completed, the journey time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to an hour now.
The proposals will allow the train to travel 400km/h, making the UK network the fastest in the world.
The original route is designed to allow trains to 400m in length and can carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a line London - Birmingham.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the constraints of space, it is anticipated that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high - speed network.
The rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he feels that the project must be put in place, but public consultations longer and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will be built by.
The trains will be forced to drive out of high - speed lines on the existing track north of Birmingham, journey times between London and Scotland more than three hours.
This seems to be the best to ensure a way of trains, a reference point for the revolution.
Taxpayers repay the loan of £75,000 for the Orangerie of Tory
Alan Duncan, the Tory member of parliament, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year to reimburse the cost of a Orangerie he has built in his home in his constituency.
The head of the party that has been demoted by David Cameron for complained that members of parliament were " maintained ", has increased its loan of £75,000 to build an extension in oak at his second home in Rutland.
He had been allowed to pay the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities have received complaints at the time and have not been interviewed by Sir Thomas Legg, who has a control of expenditure. Last night, Mr Duncan said that complaints could not be " clearer or more simple. "
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, is the owner of a two - storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland - Melton.
The neighbouring houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a living room and dining room, but the fees office said that Mr Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a porch at home, describing in its plans as an orange.
The neighbours describe as a " porch for fun. "
It has not been asked Mr Duncan to give an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Committee of the Commons standards and privileges, on its loans.
The Committee has cleared last month of any charge of non - compliance with the rules, after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan has changed the legal certainty of the loan of 271.406 GBP to his London property in his constituency home that he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents released this week show that Mr Duncan claimed approximately GBP per month interest until March of last year.
In April, its applications have increased by more than 1,800 GBP per month.
The interest rate on the loan RBS of Mr Duncan has not been changed at that time, suggesting that all the increases were intended to finance the borrowing of £75,000.
The standard variable interest rate RBS from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, without moving since then.
The last publication of Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to ask £1,250 in May.
Mr Duncan lost his position as head of the shadow cabinet in September, after a journalist in coverage was allegedly filmed saying that members of parliament had to survive " on budget " after the expenses scandal.
" In fact, it is now national, you must live " on budget " and you are treated as " e "
He said: " I have spent my money on my garden and I asked a small part, based on what was correct.
And I could ask a more, but I did not. "
The member of parliament, a millionaire from his former position as an oil trader, has begun to explain its spending, in May, after it emerged that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before agreeing with the fees office that could be considered excessive ".
An activist has dug a hole in the form of £in the lawn of M Duncan to protest after it was revealed that he had claimed £4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing, last night, Mr Duncan said: " It was for improvements capitals, approved at the time by the fees office then by Legg. "
He added: " There is no problem of evasion or development or use of rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, allowed, etc.
This could not be clearer or more simple. "
True, all see the Advent calendar of Brighton
The Brighton beach have found a new way of promotion for the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, a group of church alternative that encourages spiritual exploration by the creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for each day of December, using as a theme, songs of Noel.
The event began on 1 December, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5.30 p. m. to 6.30 p. m., each day, with pies and wine served free of charge.
The songs of Noel selected so far include " I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and the First Christmas ", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, an assistant marketing TV of Hove, is a priest of the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: " We want religion is closer to the people in a society post - chrétienté.
" As a church, why do we expect that people come in an old building strange? it seems to me that the Church should get closer to the people and celebrate more exciting.
" The idea of Advent calendar of the cabin of beach came just after a conversation with a few friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is a creative and vibrant and we try to experiment and to represent this through spirituality. "
Late payments: anger prison guards, actions
The prison guards unions have called on Friday to the " general mobilization " to demand the payment by the end of year bonuses and overtime which payment has been deferred to January for budgetary reasons.
Fo - pénitentiaire (2nd union supervisors) asked the personnel who will not be in service to demonstrate Tuesday morning in prisons and the " block ", to " denounce the theft of their due. "
The CGT - pénitentiaire (3rd union of the profession) calls to " meet in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong turnout as " shameful and unacceptable " the non - payment in December of overtime, night premium, Sundays and holidays " worked in October.
And the first union of supervisors, the independent federal prison (Ufap/Unsa) , " calls for general mobilization (...) to raise the discontent and anger ".
The Directorate of the prison administration and the Department of Justice explained that the extra hours have increased significantly in 2009 and have not all been budgeted, but ensure that the remaining will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said late in the day that Michèle Alliot - Marie had sent a letter to the unions of their supervisors to ensure that the payment would be made next month.
I know the efforts made by the staff for the operation and the modernisation of our prison system, writing the Minister of Justice in the mail.
I have asked the leadership of the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation of a wrong assessment of the number of overtime does not recur in the future, " Mrs Alliot - Marie.
The pay in December will be lean, except for the personal direction of the famous premiums of functions and objectives, deplored the Ufap/Unsa, for whom " the budgetary constraints have good back. "
It is a pure scandal, has outraged the union interregional FO of Marseille, in announcing its decision to boycott until further notice " all meetings ".
The staff will not work on Sundays and holidays if those of October are not regularised in December, ditto for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône - Alpes - auvergne.
At a time when increasing our tasks and missions without increasing our workforce, it is more than regrettable to dare to take the money of staff, believes the CGT - pénitentiaire of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some worse off than others.
But it is not, found the Secretary General of the Ufap, Jean - François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama said " more " than those it receives
US President Barack Obama, who is preparing to spend his first Christmas with family in the White House, gave the " papesse " of the small screen Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple rule of gifts: " I give more than I get. "
In the framework of a special program to be broadcast Sunday night on ABC, the president and his wife Michelle offer an overview of how they intend to celebrate the holiday season in their new and prestigious remains.
Even Bo, the small companion to four legs of the family will be the party.
The Father Christmas also like Bo, said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would " of course " a gift, according to excerpts of the show broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama takes issue with claims of her husband about the quality of the gifts that it receives: " Certainly not, I have offered gifts last year, " she teased the president.
Absolutely, he was forced to concede before responding with humour pointing the finger at the string of pearl of the First Lady: " Who gave you that? ".
During this one - hour, casual atmosphere, with the famous animator who has been a staunch support of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife were also remembered their favourite gifts as children.
Barack Obama has a bike to ten speeds, but also a balloon basket that his Kenyan father he has rarely seen offered him at Christmas.
I remember the time I met my father came to see us for Christmas and where he gave me a ball basketball, the President said.
It was only much later in my life that I realized that it was he who gave me the ball.
The First Lady is remembered for his side of his house of doll.
I really do not know how to organize a house so I had aligned all furniture against the wall, rather than around the chimney, but I loved this little house of dolls, said Michelle Obama.

Counsel for the franco - polonais filmmaker Roman Polanski has called again Thursday in Los Angeles, California, western United States) , the abandonment of prosecutions against his client, currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a case of more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer for the director of " the Pianist ", denounced before three judges of the Court of Appeal of the second District of California serious procedural errors at the time, in 1977.
I called for the abandonment of charges here and now, said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the behaviour of the judge in the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, " was cold in the back ".
According to him, the judge Rittenband -- died since -- would have discussed, before his sentence, with a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved the prison -- which is a serious lack of procedure.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary " Roman Polanski: Wanted and desired " (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired) , the prosecutor, David Wells.
But Mr Wells had finally declared the end of September had " lied " to the author of the documentary.
If the court refuses to abandon the prosecution, Mr. Hummel has demanded a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his arguments.
The prosecution has reiterated the arguments already developed in the first instance, namely that no charges could not be seriously considered as Roman Polanski would not be before the court.
The filmmaker, aged 76, had fled the United States in 1978, before the sentencing, for " unlawful sexual intercourse " with a minor of 13 years.
He has never set foot in the United States since.
The deputy prosecutor in the County of Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayama, said that Roman Polanski " must be there to appear at the hearing. "
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to escape? , asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker " request a favour to the court, while its authority ".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- underlined " that there were other alternatives to the flight ".
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to request the dismissal of charges against Roman Polanski.
Counsel for Samantha Geimer, the victim, has also called, once again, the end of the prosecution.
Recalling that his client is to be harassed every rebound of the Polanski case, she added: " Nobody in this room can say that the process was fair.
Thirty - two years is enough ".
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on U. S. arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he has been under house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, pending a possible extradition.

The new Johnny Hallyday " are very positive, " according to his son David
The new Johnny Hallyday " are very positive, " said Friday his son David on his arrival at the airport in Los Angeles where he had to go to the bedside of his father in hospital for several days.
The new are very positive.
It is very strong, it is going very well, " said the press David Hallyday to exit the plane that took her to Paris shortly after 1 p. m. local (2100 GMT) .
The son of singer, air relaxed, assured that he would be " very quickly " to the hospital Cedars - sinaï of Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection following surgery for a herniated disc in Paris on 26 November.
The singer was " placed in an artificial coma that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent suffering and be able to administer its treatment, " said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at the hospital Cedars - sinaï of Los Angeles, where he had been admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a herniated disk in Paris on 26 November.
The singer had to be on the night of Wednesday to Thursday because of damage resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning at the French Lycée in Los Angeles where is their daughter Jade, to attend a school, found an AFP photographer.
The chief of orthopedic surgery and trauma of the Pitié - Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would Monday in Los Angeles with the singer.
The producer has vehemently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on 26 November at the international Park Monceau Clinic in Paris.
We were told that it was a massacre.
Surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, " said Mr Camus.
I have heard talk of a possible judicial proceedings, he said.
Jean - Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday was " much too quickly for Los Angeles, with the permission of the surgeon.
I had this doctor in person in line who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and I was amazed, as I myself had two herniated discs, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently " party without drain, nothing, " after his operation in Paris.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic community.
He had made the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic in Neuilly - sur - Seine where he was at the time.
In 2007, he had also made the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to eliminate a hematoma following a brain hemorrhage.
But it is also a doctor reputation, repeatedly condemned by justice, in medical liability and for tax evasion and fraud.
I Olivier Metzner, counsel for the order of Doctors, was accused of being " a man without scruples " continued " regularly " before the Council of the order, and that is " not recommended ".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention was " perfectly well " and that the post - operative examinations were " normal ".
The operation " was not hemorrhagic and does not require the installation of a drain, " he added.
In any event, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have increased since this summer, appears in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens) as planned, it seems very short, " said Mr Camus.
The association UDF increase the tone and the New centre to use its acronym
The association UDF, controlled by the Modem party of François Bayrou, responded Friday to the attempted takeover of the president of the New centre, Hervé Morin, the acronym of the ex - parti giscardien, warning not to use on any support, under penalty of prosecution.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced its intention to recover the acronym UDF, that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his legacy after he reached out to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy Saturday before the National Council of NC.
To support his approach, he has received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (ex - UMP NC) which claims ownership of the mark UDF for being the first to file in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But Friday evening, the office of the association, controlled by the Friends of François Bayrou who do not intend to let, is out of its silence to launch a formal notice to the Minister and MP, not to use the acronym and to transfer the ownership of the mark, under penalty of prosecution.
You have multiplied in recent days, the statements indicating that you propose to your political movement of + + the acronym UDF, the association wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez the modem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis centrist Alliance.
You also have to follow up on your equipment and activist on the front page of your site, the name of this movement, the New Center + + +, the UDF today +, also see the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to the use of the acronym, said the office of the UDF that remains the NC to withdraw " immediately the mention of the name of the UDF of any medium and (his) website. "
It also asks Hervé de Charette " to pass the property of (the) marks its legitimate right ".
If you do not, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, prevent the signatories.
In their letter, they specify that the UDF " is a full - fledged political movement since 1978 " and recalled that Mr. Morin and his friends had " chosen " to leave in 2007 " to create a movement competitor, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP. "
The New centre has therefore, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union for French Democracy) .
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 accession to the modem for three years and the creation of an office to defend " the material and moral interests " of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Mr Hervé de Charette, said the office, " when he filed the mark ", it was " no longer a member of the UDF for three years, but the UMP.
It is scandalous and fraudulently the abscence of filing of the acronym UDF to perform.
This brutality is turning into crime, dénoncent - ils, before the strategy of NC: " It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more fit to make a name for yourself to a name which was not entitled ".
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François - Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided Friday to judge the artist François - Marie Banier to determine if, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, it has benefited from a state of weakness of the a part of his fortune.
The photographer for 62 years, known for his photos of stars, will be held on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families of France, in which a mother and daughter tear while taking the reins of the L'Oreal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th criminal chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87 years old, should be conducted by three doctors.
The heir and major shareholder of The L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such a review, at least not in the conditions proposed by the prosecution of Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors Friday will submit a report before March 10, 2010 in saying if Liliane Bettencourt could find themselves in a state of weakness and what periods.
I think it will.
I am going to talk, " said at the exit of the hearing counsel for Mrs Bettencourt, Georges Kiejman.
For its part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt - Meyers, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the decision of the court.
This is excellent news (...) The expertise will show that he (Mr Banier) has handled this elderly lady that we must protect, he said.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has committed criminal prosecution against François - Marie Banier, photographer and artist, which it accuses of having benefited for years from the weakness of his mother to obtain one billion euros of donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or tables of masters.
For its part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, as a friend.
While the court should examine the admissibility of the action taken by Ms. Bettencourt - Meyers, the pleadings of lawyers have sometimes turned to unpacking family Friday.
Thus, counsel Liliane Bettencourt reported three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary, in which she said was wary of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt - Meyers.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: " Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for 15 years.
Françoise, I have never been able to speak to him since his marriage ".
For its part, the prosecutor in Nanterre has estimated that the complainant was not entitled to act, especially as a guardianship judge refused in recent days to grant his request to open a procedure of judicial protection for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt " has full capacity to act, it is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place, " said the representative of the public prosecutor, Marie - Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court has decided that it would decide once the trial will be held on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt - Meyers.
Revolution managerial or end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our struggle for the development of the economic intelligence will have been in vain ...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies to its employees, said the position vis - à - vis consumers before the revolution marketing: it is to join the staff to " values " determined from above as it was once, to impose the consumer products designed by the technicians of the plant.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the revolution has provided the marketing strategies of conquest of markets to the place ... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected factors of return regularly!
A demobilization of employees can lead to a deadly demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much more general phenomenon which affects in particular.
This seriously undermines the development of all intellectual functions of the company, including R& D and, more importantly, the economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE " requires of all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward - looking vision "; it requires a commitment on the part of employees that the authoritarian management completely.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would put the staff at the centre of the concerns of the company as the client.
The usefulness of internal polls
The opinion surveys as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its salariés - will encourage this revolution in the managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I fear not.
- first because I could see that, faced with a new situation, any structure in the end, after many detours, priority ... what it has always done.
- Second, because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of the increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most of the leaders have a simplistic view of human behaviour.
From the major engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old theory, revived recently by the " American and widely disseminated, unbeknownst to them, by the institutes and the media.
Thus, suggesting that it is possible to handle the " levers " (sic) of the commitment of managers, a recent survey by Ipsos published in the Figaro. fr conforte - t - elle leaders in a governance posture, unsuited to today's world.
Identify and measure the factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises, to adopt a vision of human behaviour.
It is to integrate, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: for employees, the commitment to the company is only possible if it is clear as a means of achieving a part of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only studies from the analysis motifonctionnelle adopt this design of the motivations of employees.
These studies have shown that they believe their company based on a predetermined which allows them, through their image of the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these factors of mobilization, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their " social " and their management of human resources " to ".
They create a breeding ground for joint development of a robust economic intelligence and effective.
Oslo speech: the " just war " is right to praise Obama
The American right has welcomed Friday the speech in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of " just war " against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had the award to Mr. Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former candidate for the vice - presidency in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, " said Ms. Palin, the right wing of the Republican Party, the newspaper USA Today, adding that she herself addressed the theme of war " sometimes necessary " in his memoirs that have been published.
The war is the last thing in my opinion that the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We must stop these terrorists there, she said.
Mr Obama, who has inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, has worked Thursday to Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr Obama, Newt Gingrich, said that the president had done in Oslo " a very good job ".
I found that the speech was very well, welcomed the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, which has particularly appreciated the reference to " the existence of evil in the world " in the presidential.
By some side, I found this quite historic, " said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed on the radio program " The Takeaway ".
The former elected, regarded by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to have seen " a left - wing president " to remind members of the Nobel Committee " that they would not be free and could not put a price of peace if the use of force did not exist ".
For Michael Gerson, former pen of George W. Bush columnist for the Washington Post, Mr Obama made " a very American ".
In addition to appearing in " citizen of the world " as it always does, " he spoke as an American president, " they live in a bubble of security that they have not created and that they do little to preserve it, " said Mr. Gerson.
Among the few right to not be convinced, a hawk in the Bush era, the former ambassador to the UN John Bolton, has described the speech as " dull, and without inspiration " on the National Review Online.
Has the left of the president, the Democrat Dennis Kucinich is alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When the war in the concept of justice, can easily justify the killing of innocent people, he warned.
The centre - left press remained against the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr Obama, called his speech " blockbuster " even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo " should serve as a road map to guide decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression, " has ignited the Daily Californian.
Mr Obama " made the speech that he was, " said the New York Times, " both dark and inspiring ".
Road: three marathons for an agreement that saves the supply of Christmas
After three sessions of the road sector unions and employers, only to be stayed until the end, reached an agreement Friday night to end the strike and the threat to the supply of Christmas.
At the meeting of signatures Friday evening, the secretary of state for transport, Dominique Bussereau, was " delighted " of this agreement, after several rounds of negotiations, which began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions the negotiators were left in the early morning Friday, with the hope of signing quickly in late morning the text of the agreement.
Even if three employers ' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had slammed the door.
But it took more than six hours of a meeting began at 11.00 so that everyone is in agreement and that the text is signed.
The conflict " would have been very damaging for business " and " it was feared that it will disrupt the Christmas for years, " said Mr Bussereau.
The text provides for a salary increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in the local and regional road transport) , and 2.9% for the highest (international) .
In hourly rate, for, " from 8.72 euros 9.06.
It is not much, but it is very far, said Patrice Clos (FO) .
It will give the order to our supporters that there are no barriers, no blockade of centres of supplies.
But we can always have some holdouts who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed " a good agreement ", even if it was " difficult to concede the increases on the high salaries because of international competition ".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of EUR 170 monthly for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is the agreement of common sense and respect of employees, " said Maxime Dumont (CFDT) , while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed " a historic agreement ".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) has " an acceptable compromise. "
The agreement also provides for the upgrading of the travel costs of 3%, and the general state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will address the issue of a 13th month and modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that " a decrease of EUR 100 million in employer contributions " has been the subject of a government amendment to the bill amending finance for 2009, voted in the night from Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote " in the same ".
The signing of TLF allows that the agreement applies to the member companies to this organization, and in a second time, the entire profession, in the case of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be " as soon as possible, " said Mr Bussereau.
The opposition of employers ' organisations may only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a " fool ", because the EUR 100 million " had already been promised to the sector to offset a portion of the carbon tax.
The Secretary of State for Transport has obliged us to negotiate in the emergency, not in the conclusion of a shared analysis, but not to thwart the eaters of the next, deplored the Unostra.
For the school, the agreement risk " digging the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months ".
A: disruption this weekend, unions unhappy with proposals of the RATP
The disruption on the RER, the largest urban transit line of France, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting Friday on the second day of strike between unions and management of the RATP has left on their hunger for their demand for premium.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there will be no trains between and, a train on two on the central portion (between Defence and Nation) and a train on four outside the central section.
The interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre prefecture, which will require passengers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette, who expect 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that " the RATP efforts to serve the large stores ".
The RER A crossing from west to east the Paris.
The RATP short of Saint - Germain - en - Laye and Nanterre at Boissy - Saint - Léger and Marne - la - Vallée.
Friday, about a train on two was circulated at peak hours, and virtually no hours, as planned.
As Thursday, there were no crowds on the docks, the Franciliens is being organised.
And in the morning, the station of Saint - Germain - en - Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, especially because of the absence of school students.
At Boissy - Saint - Léger (Val - de - Marne) , Jack Nbakina, engineer of 29 years, explained to be lifted " an hour and a half earlier, so be sure to arrive on time. "
The Saint - Lazare station has not been saturation, indicated the SNCF, which had provided a framework of agents and police.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy - le - haut arrived or departed from the Gare Saint - Lazare to join the subways.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held Saturday and Sunday, which will review the results, deemed " weak " by the unions, a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of RSP proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the RER A on all aspects, working time, career etc.
This is not what the drivers, who are demanding a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South) .
The RATP is even its proposals premium brackets, has outraged the CGT, stressing that the direction " was not kaput to solve a problem while in the road and the SNCF is done. "
A new meeting is scheduled Monday for " a broader review of the conditions of exercise of the profession, " said the RATP.
What has also told the unions that the company " made fun of users of the weekend. "
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded a committee at headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the direction, which refused until then any discussion during the strike, had suggested " in a spirit of appeasement " the meeting.
The conflict threatens to widen the RER B Tuesday, after the filing of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
The unions are demanding a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to EUR 150 EUR 30 variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, independent) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line the million daily passengers.
The Drivers, all in the second part of their career, have to EUR as well as 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for hours, Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish justice dissolved the pro - Kurdish party, decision consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled Friday the dissolution of the main pro - Kurdish party in the country, a decision that was immediately followed by expressions of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south - east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which is to reach out to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a " home of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity, " said to the press the president of the Court Hasim Kiliç, after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously of the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to make the dissolution, said Mr Kiliç, adding that 37 of party officials, including its president Ahmet Türk and Tugluk, are banned from politics for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Mrs Tugluk and the confiscation of the assets of the party.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (550) .
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that members would leave Parliament rather than sit as members without label.
The decision follows a process launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP to obey " directives " of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) , considered a terrorist organisation by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political wing of the PKK rebels.
The party is, however, that there was " no organic links " with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with him.
The verdict of the Court comes as the government is to reach out to the Kurdish community in proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, to try to shrink the support of Kurds and put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP had said that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in the southeast, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
After the announcement of justice, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the largest city in the southeast majority of Kurds.
The police fired tear gas and used water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails and stones, with slingshots.
About 100 people demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr Türk said that the decision of Justice would " deepen the despair. "
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish) by banning a party, " he said to the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties.
This solves nothing, " said Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total of democratic openness launched by the government, " said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, " he added.
On Thursday, the PKK has claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the north of Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months.
The new " Silicon - valley "
For a long time she had the reputation of city secret, off - limits to visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the 10 districts of Moscow, was under the Soviet regime, a place of secret weapons, under strict supervision.
Today, with its 216 000 inhabitants to 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the " Silicon Valley ".
Important sites of production and research of micro - and nanoelectronics.
In September 2008 representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, place of science - with academic institutions and companies in the centre of Frankfurt (FIZ) .
There were meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg have signed a " memorandum of close collaboration ".
The signatories were the Deputy mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz section head project for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strong point is scientific research, will Zelenograd for a seminar.

Zelenograd is the seat of research institutes and companies Soviet famous.
There is the Institute of Electrical Engineering from Moscow, the major firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja - Elektronika.

Zelenograd (literal translation " green City ") gets its name from the forested hills in the heart of which research centres are located.
The project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
We cannot place high enough the magnitude of the project Stuttgart 21.
To its supporters it is nothing less than " new heart of Europe ".
If is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a massive construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden - Württemberg, in a chaos of yards for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 is born of the spirit of the 1980s.
The stations, with tracks which ended in town, had a reputation at the time to be the relics of the technique of the 19th century that were effect of brake shoe modern rail traffic because it was once a lot of time to get from the back to the front.
Arrival, stopping short, departure - that is what needs to be done.
That is why the head of the line must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And Stuttgart also: a station of trains, which is about halfway on the trans - European rail between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava where the slogan " heart of Europe ".
The project S21 will really start, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners have recognized that the cost to bury the station in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
Indeed, the head of line stations no longer pose real problems of entry and exit since there are modern trains, reversible with railcars and voiture - pilote at both ends.
However, it is now the achievement of Stuttgart 21 alongside the new line of the inter - city Ulm.
The regional and local prevailed.
The railway company is in part because it is the taxpayer who paid the cost of the risks of the largest infrastructure project of the Federal Republic and not the public company.
From the point of view of this project is relatively well justified.
There is an urban area - according to the computer - generated graphics planners - will be very green.
For the system of rail transport the S21 is harmful.
The station and the enlargement of the section are designed for trafficking is - and this is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth.
At the time there was no competition from cheap flights.
The policy of modern traffic should first focus on strengthening the traffic of goods transport by rail is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly affects many other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the draft of the
It is the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to 15 billion are more realistic.
One thing is sure, in the next decade will this money for other junction and congestion in the network.
The list of the Department of Transport in 60 major projects.
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section across the Rhine Valley of 180 kilometres.
Since 1987 the line is built.
It would be really urgent support here to build on the fungus.
But the project is a braking.
The itinerary of the Rhine Valley is becoming the bottleneck of international freight traffic, and this in the heart of Europe.
The government is considering the judgment on the airport
The regional parliament in Wiesbaden, the Land government has raised the possibility of appeal to the judgment of the Administrative Court of Hesse concerning the prohibition of night flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the coalition CDU/FDP had entrusted experts to examine the legal point of view the ruling by the Administrative Court and is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Tribunal of Kassel was justified in a written document that the land should adapt the regulation on the prohibition of night flights in the case or the construction of the runway aterrissage northwest of Frankfurt airport would be realized.
The approval of attérir for 17 aircraft between 23 and 5 in the morning, as envisaged by the Land government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against air pollution.
The coalition must have decided on 4 January if it wishes to make an appeal against the judgment.
The opposition criticism this time and attempts to put pressure on the government representative for celui - cirenonce to appeal to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Schäfer - Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise before the elections and which was to ban night flights. Otherwise, it will be considered a failure to a word.
It is darn hard to be allowed to keep its word, said the head of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir referring to the FDP electoral slogan " We want our promises ".
The Minister Dieter Posch refutes the accusations of Schäfer - Gümbel which claims that the Land government tries to allow the night flights using " avocasserie and roublardises ".
It takes time to conduct a legal review.
The coalition does not take a decision on the basis of a " first impression.
The decision is legally reliable, said Stefan Müller (FDP) .
The interpretation of the opposition on the statements of its share on the prohibition of night flights is completely.
US banks repay the aid
The big American banks, very affected by the crisis, shedding their ties to the state.
The Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had fully repaid to the Treasury $45 billion (more than 30 billion Euros) , corresponding to the aid granted in the framework of the rescue plan.
The American television channel CNBC reported in a story that Citigroup was also planning to repay the aid received.
The banking institutions seek to get rid of restrictions, which accompanied the acceptance of the money, such as limiting bonuses awarded to the leader and the regulation of higher costs.
The Bank of Americaa launched a capital increase by the sale of securities to investors who reported $19 billion of fresh money.
The rest of the money comes from the coffers of the bank are met through the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis, the Director General of the Bank of America held specifically to thank the American taxpayers: the injection of capital has significantly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The bank had assumed its capacity by buying the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup also plans to get money on the financial markets to free themselves from the guardianship of the state.
The U. S. bank could launch as early as Thursday a capital increase of $20 billion, reported the CNBC citing the banking community.
The spokesman for Citigroup did not wish to comment on this information.
In June the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had received.
Election
Finally it is still faster than expected.
Barely two weeks after the dismissal of the current taking the post of editor Nikolaus Brender by the board of directors of the German ZDF, the successor is appointed.
The committee wanted to vote yesterday evening to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who heads the drafting of Berlin ZDF was the odds - on favorite.
The chain has not wished to confirm - officially - the vote so as not to pre - empt the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a desire not to further damage to the ZDF Markus Schächter if the proposal would not be accepted by the board of directors.
Frey, who is the candidate of Schächter, needs the votes of nine members of the Commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the end of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the board of directors to extend for five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender, but this was rejected.
Only seven members of the Council had supported the renewal of Brender and 7 others had voted against the dismissal by a vote of Brender represented a failure although predictable for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which has a majority in the Council of Administration had already suggested several weeks before the vote, not wanting to renew his position.
It is Roland Koch, the minister - president of the Land of Hesse who had organized a league against the editor.
He had denied that the contract of the esteemed editor is extended, citing the fact that the rate of listening to the news of the ZDF had fallen under Brender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, denounced the growing political influence on ZDF.
At the end there was even 35 experts in public law who had meddled in the debate and who felt that the action of Koch was unconstitutional.
But it will be for nothing.
Peter Frey: who is it?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957.
He studied the science - policy, pedagogy and Romance languages (Spanish) .
He then worked in radio body Südwestfunk (Rhineland - Palatinate) and the German daily Frankfurter Rundschau (national) .
In 1983 he became editor in the ZDF first the news magazine " heute - journal " (newspaper today) .
Then his journey continues: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy editor of the time; then corresponding to Washington in 1991 and 1992, and in 1998 he was head and presenter of " Morgenmagazins " (emission information presented the morning) ; until 2001 he was responsible for the service of foreign policy of the then head of the Berlin.
After the disgrace of Brender, when it had just been elected journalist of the year by the trade journal Medium Magazin, the Greens have announced that they will launch a constitutional complaint
The enemy of Koch in the Council of Administration, the Minister - President of Rhineland - Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the Treaty so that the proposals of the staff can not be blocked by a political majority.
However, Beck has no plans to request the withdrawal of political figures who are members of committees overseeing the ZDF.
Peter Frey, the likely successor to Brender had skilfully manoeuvred to the board in criticizing the Commission in its decision to dismiss Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose for the post of editor without losing face, as well as the Council of Administration could elect without being to a political supporter.
In the representations of the parties, Frey is classified liberal left.
Clean in university studies
Partial success for students: After a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between the ministers and delegates to the conference of Presidents, an agreement has been developed that the working conditions of students Bachelor or Master should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to overcome their studies.
They are set to reduce the weight of reviews: a single review should close the module of study.
In addition, the workload will be reconsidée to ensure " realistic and acceptable ".
The political authorities and institutions of higher education to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also committed to organise common structural requirements more flexible for the Bachelor and Master.
At the regional level, there should be no regulations different from land to another.
Less reviews
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Minister of Education of the Länder and the university rectors have repeatedly in the mouth the buzzword: " étudiabilité ".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take a specific meaning.
The accreditation council decided to reduce the number of some reviews: " Each module should normally be concluded by a single review, " in a document of 30 pages on the conditions of admission to the university.
Reinhold Grimm, president of the accreditation Council says that significantly reducing the burden of reviews should be able to stop the slippage, étudiabilité.
The " étudiabilité " should be, in the future, the decisive criterion of the organization of studies.
The modules like the substance must be examined carefully to see if we cannot avoid this smothering sensation that you are sometimes in the choice of courses.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in raid on Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Defence Minister Karl - Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should " have the opportunity and the flexibility to allow and encourage the personal initiative ".
The new regulation will affect access to new university but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be re - certified every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only by 2015 that all cycles have been reviewed.
There are 10 relevant accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory which depend on the Accreditation council created by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had exerted some pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies so that the programmes are not too loaded and the regime of not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and graduate schools have already agreed with their regional departments to take the appropriate measures.
The Rhineland - Palatinate is so far the only Land to have agreed to grant more resources to the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize programs tutorielset strengthen the offices of educational guidance and the offices of reviews and the Department of international relations
The Länder and universities provide a budget of EUR 10 million.
In early 2010, the government wants to table in Parliament an amendment to the law on higher education institutions.
Following this it will take more than a single review to complete his studies.
The organization of studies to be more flexible, more must be able to guarantee the recognition of other institutions of higher education and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, " étudiabilité " of all university will be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition have again discussed the question of conditions in the country.
The décisionsont been appreciated but critics have been heard.
The Federal President of the student union indicated that he would like the organization of educational policy does not happen in the future " behind closed doors " of ministers and presidents of universities.
After the strike, students as individuals should be able to speak a little.
The future of higher education received the support of the President of the delegates to the Conference of Presidents (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: " the experience of students is very useful, " she said Thursday during a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with which the HRK is working on a project of reform.
For the Union of Education and Science (GEW) the decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. It calls For the right and the opportunity for each bachelor degree to enroll in a cycle of Master.
Andreas Keller member of the steering committee of the request that the Länder ensure students bachelor today, tomorrow there will be enough places for studies and studies as good as possible.
The Länder must hire more lecturers.
However, the Ministers of Education have not raised the possibility of easing access to the master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is by these words " arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control ... " that begins a work of the poet Werner Söllner, in which he dealt with in snippets of sentences, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who won freedom but lost at the same time its territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Romania, was first professor of German and English in Bucharest and, subsequently, director of collection in a publishing house for youth before moving to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner received various literary prizes; in 1993 he took the highly coveted chair of poetry of the Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 he is director of the forum of literature of Hesse in the house of artist of Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He has done a lot of him in literary circles last Tuesday, at a conference in Munich, whose theme was " the German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your files.
Visibly upset and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his fellow writers germano - roumains as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had worked as an informant for the Securitate political police.
Söllner received in 1989 the price of the German language together with some of the participants.
The trials began in 1971.
I am, " Söllner " someone who has not sufficiently stood auxessais intimidation of the Securitate. "
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter) .
Almost simultaneously with the honoration Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and his literary copies with the mechanisms of power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, in a case which clearly shows the depths and of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can tell from the current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own Securitate file, MI Walter played a role, ensures the specialist literature Michael Markel after the confession of Söllner and it refers to the positive influence of IM Walter, who had interceded in his favour.
" He had been drawn from all difficult situations at the time, " according to Markel.
Moralde Markel has felt the need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before the public was unexpected, however the confession of a former dissident its collaboration with the Romanian secret services is in fact, not so surprising.
Germany is a reserve for the spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the journal " Die Zeit ", after having read the 914 pages of his own record.
It can be assumed that the victims have made speculation and sometimes have guessed what real names were hiding last names borrowing Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
In Germany where the consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude to the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confused.
A systematic clarification has been constantly frustrated and in past years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council for the institution Birthler was created to work on the assimilation of the Securitate Archives (CNSAS) but the return of files has dragged since.
Since 2005 there is a law that defines the management of archives.
The influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very high, is confirmed by an interview with a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expressed a very dismissive of the winner.
She had a psychosis, and ultimately had interviewed only once.
The infamy of power to speak here, without any gene, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Certainly, many questions are associated with the case Söllner as happens so often in a context of guilt hidden.
Why now? which has been despoiled? the weighted response listeners, the admission of Söllner, hope that the result of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge that by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
In the Champions League
We had the impression that a representative was there, fired four pins from any right to a Christmas party, on which the manufacturer of had spread its goods when the new coach Christian Gross at midnight quarter in a Mercedes C Class, he had just called, a plastic bag supplier.
The man, whose skull bald drew attention, was driving in the city that was still foreign.
Otherwise our peers could take the wheel - he had not been drinking alcohol and he was not drunk happiness.
He had spent a pleasant evening but tomorrow it would return to work.
Because it is now that it would begin.
The words of Switzerland that had to hire three days earlier were clear: " We have reached the eighth final ", that is to say in the Champions League thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania " but we must not allow ourselves to be blinded by the success. This will be a brutal battle not to fall ".
The " work " we expected Sunday.
Here, it is to repeat the results of the Champions League.
And it will have to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three goals of Marica (5.) , Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11) .
Drawing of lots
The eighth final of the Champions League (match go 16/17. + 23/24 February/return match + March) will be drawn on December in Nyon.
The joy of the inauguration of the successor of Babbel was moderate.
And the joy was not only moderate who had brought luck, who had sent to Stuttgart destabilized, a highly motivated and fun to play.
I went to see the players and I told them that they should focus on their strengths, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the " plumber souls " - Gross - the recipe for success that sounded if bienmais which was more effects with the Babbel.
It triggered a certain magic, confessed Jens Lehmann - supporter of Babbel - " in football when there is a new impetus it happens sometimes things that we would never have thought possible ".
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of break for injury, advanced to the ranks of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the " phenomenon " found by a proverbial " fresh wind " and the method of work of the new leader: " It is someone who takes action and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation ".
But apparently Babbel had failed.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet turned the corner, warned the manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart needs of tenacity.
As Gross, the players and the manager is careful not to overstate the victory against a defence completely outdated and weakened guests Romanians.
They had also won in Glasgow before having had four days later a bad awakening in Leverkusen with 0: 4, objected.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but there were others who were still far away.
We have not yet passed the difficult.
That Heldt the day of its 40th anniversary does not have the heart to celebrate, even after the first victory at home for three months, the events of the weekend that a television interview of goalkeeper Jens Lehmann did bounce back just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others take and not Jens, Heldt, in response to the criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the direction of weakness of style and said that it had decided to change coaches under pressure from fans.
Lehmann had also seen as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jalousiele fact that his day of free after the games has been deleted.
The statements of Lehmann were " marked by a pure selfishness " Heldt and announced the consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were more likely to become friends for life these two.
In any cast, they agreed to all the rest, that is to say that without the work of the group by the coach replaced, the strong representation and would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were " for a large part in the success " Heldt and Lehmann in choir - and even the man in the plastic bag.
World championship heavy
Hot in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly verbally and gestuellement the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after 12 rounds difficult Ukrainian defended his title of world champion of heavy goods vehicles from the version of the federation.
The judges in the points.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko retained his title of world champion of heavy goods vehicles.
The federation announced that on the night of Saturday, the champion of 38 years had won a victory to the unaminité judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120: 10) .
For the third time Klitschko defends with honour his title since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Before the Ukrainian had already won twice the title of world champion federations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately it has not passed the KB.
Klitschko, out 39 times winner in 41 professional fights, say twice its defeat because of injuries.
The challenger Johnson has to accept its first defeat in 24 fights.
In the arena of Berne, before 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko has wanted to dictate the fight, its 2.02 metres, by the left.
Johnson, 11 centimetres smaller, which before the duel, announced the end of the era Klitschko, managed to avoid the blows of the champion, empéchant Klitschko to bring into play its against right detrimental.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, has tried to move the rounds.
Although he continued to cause Klitschko in words and gestures attacks reached very rarely the champion.
It is the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, have exceeded with Klitschko distance of 12 rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the capital Switzerland before the fight.
It insulta Klitschko the " dirty " zombie " is not really capable ".
During the weighing Friday, the champion has not been able to prevent cause Johnson to by his sunglasses nose " to see his eyes ".
Fourth victory since the comeback of Klitschko.
Klitschko imposed again in his fourth fight since his comeback on 11 October 2008
After a break of almost four years, he was beaten at the time the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered " its " WBC belt that he had previously abandoned without a fight.
This year, defending his title of champion, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of us.
" I have just taken a blow in this fight and I am in perfect form, " said Klitschko to explain his rapid return on the ring.
His rève is to try to bring in the family the four titles.
His brother Wladimir is the IBF and WBO champion federations.
But it is Britain's David Haye, who détroné the General Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 metres - in November, is the WBA belt.
This summer, Hague had cancelled a game against Vitali Klitschko in September.
It would appear that his promotion company plans to play this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The case Kunduz
Frontal attack of the opposition: the head of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence Guttenberg of lying in the case of the Case Kunduz.
The SPD and the Left Party (Die Linke) ask the Chancellor explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on the air attack in Kunduz, the opposition has criticized the Defense Minister Karl - Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) délibérémentdissimulé some facts.
The Minister has intentionally " made an untruth " on the deadly strike two tankers last September, said the leader of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, Saturday during the broadcast of information chain ARD " Tagesschau " (the newspaper) .
Clearly, this means that he lied.
The order to kill has been given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF) .
It is, in essence, the content of the report available to NATO and which was read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new revelations of the media, the objective of lafrappe was in reality, not to destroy the stolen trucks, but was intended to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the investigation report of NATO, 142 people were killed or injured in the US air strike which was launched at the request of the German Colonel Klein, military commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left have called Saturday Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) , to decide as soon as possible before the federal Parliament and reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Green Party Renate Künast are of the opinion that Mrs Merkel must say clearly whether the strategy of targeted killing is part of the government's Afghan policy if the Chancery, the army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The government spokesman categorically rejects the criticism.
The Chancery has in any way influenced the interventions of the army in Afghanistan, he said.
Saturday, voices were increasingly strong to express doutesquant the real reasons for the dismissal of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as it had been presented by the department.
According to the information of the newspaper SPIEGEL, the information they had provided to Guttenberg concerning the attack tankers were both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the report of NATO and hid the Minister some details.
In the entourage of two senior officials suggest that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a document of two pages of Colonel Klein and a report of the military police.
The Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung reported that Wichert would have meanwhile requested in a letter a clarification of the facts.
So far, it has not received a response
Saturday, the department did not wish to comment on the charges and referred to the committee of inquiry of the federal Parliament would be the next Wednesday to the light on the facts in question.
The worlds of dream
Some see, while awake, images and hear voices that nobody else sees or hears.
It is not only among the mental patients, or under the influence of drugs, that the boundaries between fantasy and reality blur.
As these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is going very well.
When we are lying in our rooms, we can do without hindrance to the dreams and the wildest fantasies.
However, awake, the experience of dream, hear and see things that others do not perceive, has a reputation in our western world to be crazy or drugged, or at least to be an original.
Such images and voices do not appear in the mental ill or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination that is at issue: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, but sometimes prompts the boundaries between the dream, madness and reality to merge.
A state of arousal aware, taking the form of a dream, can be in various forms, in the best case it is called visions, at worst madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect differ, visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the experiences of drugs of the prophet of the New Age Carlos Castaneda, the latter of shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to very similar.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, substances of the brain - the dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and achétylcholine - breaks and that the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The force of attraction land has more power on the person.
Since antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between the madness and the dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of rêve - éveillé; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 " a great similarity between the madness and the dream, " Sigmund Freud the dream was " a psychosis with all irregularities, imagination, delusions and sensory illusions that ".
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into a comic strip.
His body is in two dimensions to the colours.
The attraction has more power on him in the ceiling.
It is a coup.
Behind him creatures of devil ailées, grimaçantes, mouth bloodied, showing teeth.
They continue, give him kicking with heavy boots, the cast against the walls, he feels pain throughout the body.
Voice, the walls and radio.
It can no longer tolerate those who insult and humiliating.
Henning T. pulling two cables of its stereo, in fact a loop and attached to a hook attached to the ceiling.
It is on a baffle and the loop around the neck.
It is.
The loop.
You serve as a lesson, the voices in a chorus to extract the eardrum. " in a clinic and treat! "
Today Henning T. 40 years ago, he lived six acute psychosis, the last date of 2 years, the first in nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
The diagnosis: psychosis schizo - affective, paranoid, it is, he takes medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he was married for three years.
During the psychosis I experienced terrible fear and deep despair.
The illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in his life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics is the most common illness after the depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, people can no longer make the difference between the inside and the outside world, they are in a state of hyper excitation, they may suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relational or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices - voice command, comment or dialogue.
The optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person can no longer distinguish between the important and the trivial, the brain can no longer filter disturbing signals, the conscious is the sensations.
Just as the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies of deeper layers of conscience.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the issue, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Department of Psychiatry Chu Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum) .
The schizophrenic is located in the centre of the situation, meaning focused on him.
At the same time it is found in a passive role, it is like a dream, overcome by events and may not act on them.
That is why the schizophrenia often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the opportunity to adjust the reality, the illusions are a cruel reality, wake up is excluded.
Experience once in her life of a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, " the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is seen during the psychosis, is fundamentally retained ".
The thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of lived in a real framework.
Why our brains such antics, is still a mystery to researchers.
Exceptional situations can bring everyone to lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people develop a psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determinants.
The researchers speculate that the persons concerned are tiny brain damage.
It is assumed that the neural maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, " Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained is how the anomaly of the system occurs and also the fact that it is not for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role - stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis, if there is a predisposition.
The hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they act on the neurotransmitters.
When our brain heats.
This is crazy, said Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck is that the psychotic suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs for it while others buy drugs very expensive to obtain.
The perception pleasant or unpleasant illusions is often just a matter of perspective.
Kasten brings together for ten years reports of hallucinations and the phenomena of images illusory: last year he published his findings in a book entitled " the world in our heads. "
The hallucinations are phenomena typical psychoses but also an impressive number of many other diseases.
They include psychological problems such as borderline or depression but also the migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or head trauma.
It is surprising that in certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions, are hyperactives or not sufficiently refrénées; when our brain heats but also when there is lack of stimulation.
The drugs can trigger this state as a brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, grief of love or other mental states.
In recent studies, one third of participants acknowledged having made at least once in a lifetime experience a hallucination.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. 16 years ago, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg - West Pomerania and it goes to school.
A young girl to normal.
If there was not the images and voices.
During the recess, a young boy, thin, with long hair, to address the floor.
When she meets his comrades watch, surprised - nobody else sees or hears this boy.
They believe that this girl is a lunatic but Sarah K do not dream, it is certain.
She is awake, hears and sees the boy as she sees and hears the girl who is sitting next to her on the bench.
It can even see its presence temporarily.
It is a good feeling, she found this young sympathetic.
Am I crazy? , asks sometimes.
But she knows that this young and other visions are not real and they will disappear again.
The night appearances are, in general, frightening.
Often the visions are cumbersome.
When it is in class, it is that it can follow the course because the teacher is just present a new student in his eyes and ears when it is invisible to others and that the professor is clearly trying to explain the equations in table.
The night appearances are, in general, frightening.
When, in the darkness of his house, it expects the sleep that is too little and too late, it often cannot distinguish if she is awake or dream already, if the images she sees, the faces grimaçants or the girl with bloody cuts on his arms and legs are before his eyes open or closed.
Let me quiet, Cree to these creatures.
It does not speak or his parents or friends, they would take to a mad.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. now 20 years.
It had last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations have ceased.
Since it came into contact via the Internet with the psychologist Kasten she knows very well that it is not crazy.
The madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or has not enough incentives, the probability is high that he has hallucinations after a certain time.
I assume that the brain is not enough, that there is animation.
Sarah K., only daughter, was afraid of other children when she was small and often played alone.
Its hallucinations began when she learned to 13 years, that the man she called Daddy, since it was in age, was not his real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active in the acoustic and visual hallucinations, and the impressions and noise, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to the difference between the illusion and reality. " every experience, " according to Kasten " takes place in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real. "
For Kasten, dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike the schizophrenic, mentally healthy person is able to recognise that the fantasies are not real images.
That is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish the hallucinations as a particular talent.
There is only a step between the dream and the hallucination.
In our world too focused on the conscience has unfortunately quickly tend to take the imaginary experiences for diseases, according to Michael Schmidt - Degenhard, a professor at Heidelberg and chief physician of the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious disease, painful but which also contains something positive, creator - the madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt - degenhard has studied the form of so - called experience, a particular form of the conscience of the dream.
The experienced oniroïdes are very complex semi - rêves which are seen as real by the lives and that it cannot differentiate the dream even when it is in a state of arousal.
The state of consciousness oniroïde occurs during a trauma or in situations of extreme conditions as for patients with polyradiculopathie which fully aware, experience a paralysis.
According to Schmidt - Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and sustainable to move, it replaces the real situation that affects his life, by his own imaginary world that is divorced from reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between the dream and the hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, a form of means and interpretation, in a situation in itself, organizational capacity that is given to men, not to sink into the abyss of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurichois Peter Cornelius Classen, art historian also describes his experiences oniroïdes in his book " change of heart " as action to safeguard the soul.
He was 49 years, when his hand for a trip of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed a transplant; meanwhile, his body was sentenced to remain in resuscitation.
Claussen plunges into a world that he created from scratch, site visit foreign travel in time. It is in old man in a sanatorium rail, a robot at his bedside on his health.
He lives in the Middle Ages of noble who manufacture drugs based on blood.
It is abducted by a Greek motorcycle who takes in his country, he is riding with his hospital bed in the Alps and meeting a Korean mafia.
It is absorbed completely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen these domestic trips are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a quite different, " he wrote in describing what he lived.
Instead of dreams, memories from mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
We can even say that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience shattered the horizon of our other everyday experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt - Degenhard.
Ultimately, the oniroïdes, delusions, hallucinations and experiences we show how our internal representations of the external reality are fragile even.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten " can result in a distortion of what we call the reality. "
An experience that can also be very rewarding.
The first snow can fall
Burda
27 years, children will be the result of the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen to the position of CEO of editions Burda is an intermediate solution: longer term, Hubert Burda hopes that his two children use the press group, he told the newspaper Spiegel.
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - A long term, the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of its children
The two children will inherit 27 years and are committed to integrate society, said Hubert Burda, 69, Spiegel.
All the details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will.
It will also see if they are capable of.
We cannot impose its children to 7,500 staff without knowing whether they have the capacity to deal with it.
This démolirait children as well as the company.
Burda said last Thursday that he was withdrawing from the CEO post in January and that his successor was Paul - Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, is a member of the Board of directors since 1999.
First, It was responsible for the technology sector.
He held the sector that is to say that he was responsible for the capital of the company and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he took the head of marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
And for the first time this is not a member of the family who is at the head of editions.
The children of Burda have respectively 19 and 17 years, his son Felix would now 42 years, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to make the connection of 10 or 15 years "
Burda said that the holding company must remain at 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in the families who are left by a bulimia of capital, who have made enormous speculation unfortunate in thinking that they could climb ever higher.
It has never been my strategy.
I have never had rêvede universal power, Burda said.
I do not see myself in the role of the country as could be and I do not intend to be part of these leagues international as the Time, these companies have taken too much importance.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that allows only to watch his e - mail, without offering the possibility to see some type of attachments or surf the Internet.
It took its five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine designated as one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see in the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek offers a monthly subscription price and a very low, less than half of what it costs, for example, the subscription data of the iPhone.
Given its success, the company launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free service to life, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the event the Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is also limited his grand - frère American, but is a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes the roaming across Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what is the fact of the data when it crosses a border or seek desperately a cafeteria on the (or a connection of Fon) to consult his mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and it is a long time that it should operate.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have a thesis in physics to understand and good glasses to read the small print.
The repeated reminders of the European Commission to propose roaming fees affordable throughout Europe have had a barely perceptible.
Outside his country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and it was not wrong.
A small device as the FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon when it does not have the WiFi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators are beginning to think differently and are studying various proposals to make their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes the downloading of books and other research on the Internet.
Without subscription and boat.
It is a device connected and pay at its purchase and not every month.
And that is what I hope to see a day for the FonPeek: a purchase option with access to life as Peek already in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I look at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I would simply because I believe that it is a more fair to the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The favourite colour of Michelle
Yellow is, without doubt, the favourite colour of the first lady of the United States.
If she went to the inauguration of Barack Obama to the presidency of the United States with a dress and a coat of this colour, it has chosen the same to accompany him in the second time, without doubt, the most important of his life: the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama was a model very similar in these two occasions: in addition to their colour, a yellow to green with bright, both times, consisted of three parts: the dress, the jacket and the mantle, in the same fabric, and was decorated with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So a first glance, it would appear that the first lady of the United States to follow the wake of Princess of Asturias and chose to return the same held.
But the fabric in which are cut both sets them very different.
If for the fact that it was a thick, however, it was in Oslo a printed velvet.
The accessories are also different: green shoes to heel means for the first time, and a similar model, but, this time.
The also has changed: the hair are now records when it was released last time.
75% of working mothers have had problems because of their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is what the study " Fertility and career women in Spain, " conducted by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, conducted on 9 737 women aged 15 to 75 years, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers saw their career limited because of motherhood.
The study indicates that there are many differences about the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, if the woman works or not, and the type of job.
Those who do not work outside the home, working part - time or have a stable work, earlier in couple, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
In contrast, women with a stable job, mainly in the public sector, pushing the entry into the couple and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 with a fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after being installed as a couple. This figure rises to 4.1 among those who work in the public sector. " These data show that women with a stable job needed more time in their lives for it, which led to the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment influence largely maternity, but less the start date of common life, " explains the researcher of the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widening the gap in the age of marriage for women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they marry and have their first child later.
The difference is also among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group aged between 35 and 49 years, those who have elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
" Another is also among women, according to their level of education.
While those who have done studies marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those with higher average level or reverse this program and give priority to achieve a stable work as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a child, " said Ms. Delgado.
Diane Kruger also is
L'Oréal Paris is to add a new name to its list jalousée ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will embody the image of several products of the mark, the universal currency " Because I wish ".
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses of the international stage, and join other celebrities listed in L'Oreal Paris, as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before it, the last to enter this club if select were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire) .
Among men, the brand of cosmetics also ambassadors of luxury: Patrick Dempsey (Dr. Grey, lessons of anatomy) and Matthew Fox (the companion of Evangeline in lost) .
The price of British fashion
The British have much to say in the world of fashion.
Its greatest representatives, creators and mannequins, yesterday and today, gathered for the annual price, which took place in London, the Royal Court of Justice.
Nobody has missed the appointment.
The former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected best of the year.
The poker as Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer of ases (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) " X - rays " of writers who have crossed his literary life (and sometimes, his other life) .
It is not as predictable and apprehended (summary biographical, life and work) , but in seeking something similar to the core of ignition of the character created.
The trip is exciting and Vincent spares neither fear nor the illuminations.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also an invitation moving to readings and reviews.

A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, was walking in our neighbourhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent beside her and our dog, a sang - mélé, saved the APS and not weighing more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they assenèrent two feet which gave the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is huge because we do not see what is fun to attack a defenceless animal which, moreover, was on a leash.
Add to this the indignation of a woman who was walking calmly and, when these individuals came to fear for his physical integrity, as a énergumène which attack an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, anyone lower than him.
The episode took place at around 5 p. m., Tuesday as another in a usually quiet.
The dog was gémi throughout the day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint to the office of the district even if we doubt that and not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
The outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening in young people to find fun to abuse free a defenceless animal which gives us the love, friendship and our company.
We do not know where is the good education and respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for helmets
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial) , has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of helmets, mainly among motorcyclists, as the two structures.
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of helmets, since it is the only element of protection to avoid injuries to the head, or even death, in the event of an accident in two wheels.
Michelin said that the campaign was in line with his commitment to road safety, which " goes beyond the design and manufacture of products always safer " and said it contributed to this objective by other actions to educational and informative.
This new campaign of helmets in two wheels, under the motto To be or not to be ", will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 garages of motorcycles, in order to ensure the widest possible dissemination.
Finally, Michelin has stressed that road safety " is a constant concern " for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two - wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop products always safer.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is
After nearly two years, the market for light commercial vehicles are beginning to see a light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the union of manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, dealers.
However, the good news, since the reference for the comparison, the month of November 2008, was particularly bad, with a decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebound last month, registrations accumulated during the 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if you add up all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles (passenger cars, pickups, vans, and light trucks lightweight chassis) 95 853 have been sold.
The big clouds that affect their application have not dispelled. Indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium - sized businesses, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external funding.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions implied by the limitation of bank loans, other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic climate.
Faced with this situation and the difference of passenger vehicles, aid for the purchase of the little used.
In addition to individuals, the self - employed and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicles of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, in Ganvam, reminded again the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to commercial vehicles (trucks and buses) .
The dealers association provides a year 2010 similar to that end, for which she calculates a drop in sales (passenger vehicles and 4x4) of 19%.
The emergency braking is now mandatory
As has occurred with the system of anti - lock brakes and as it will take place with the ESP stability control, emergency brake assist will be a compulsory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on passenger cars and light commercial vehicles newly registered, while for the rest of the vehicles a waiting period has been set up at the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if, by its mode of action, it can also help prevent many rear shocks.
The assistant emergency braking is increasing the pressure on the brakes in urgent cases detected by the system through the kick given by the driver.
But it does not always maintain the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for cars Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to slam on the brakes before the collision, and half of them had not benefited from its full force.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in revancha, requires the brake system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to a study of the EU, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1 100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of so - called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is calculated that a disaster on four with injured would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to act slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device is the maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimize the damage.
General Motors postponed until January the plan for Opel
While the workers at the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April - probably the 8 - after Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, means that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may mean that the final document, which will be submitted to the workers and the governments of the countries where the factories are located, be postponed until early 2010.
In contrast, GM, it ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the US manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of the Dutch manufacturer of sports cars Skyper, supported by the Russian group, is important.
In the case where there would agree with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last and valuable jewellery, engineers are parties of the Porsche Boxster S and succeeded in nothing less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance to only 1 275 kilograms.
This has led to happen, first, the automatic roof which has been replaced by a roof to reduce manual, 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors as the GT3, other 15 kilos of less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the gas tank of 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of earned, climbing bacquets of sport, still 12 kilos, and 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they have abandoned the audio system Cdr - 30, earning six other kilograms and have replaced the poignéesdes door handles in tissues, saving the kilo remaining.
Although the model also exists with the box to double clutch, the test was carried out on a model to manual of six speeds, mainly on secondary roads in California, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous.
His behaviour can be described as beyond reproach.
The weight does not prevent the car to drive on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: it was a long time that we had not tested a model as small and light, at the same time, guarantee security in the turns, including at high speed.
It is a small athlete, able to heat its musclesà small speed for the time, until we ask him to sprinter, to recover and grow again its engine ...
It is out what we wanted. Through his leadership, also communicative that, the car will do what will our hands on the steering wheel.
And it will do so with surgical precision.
His engine
The sound of his V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be strengthened with the option " sport " or through a system that alters the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration is brutal, either to the judgment or during recoveries.
The suspensions are firm, but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The road that we have travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car was well managed potholes.
The electronic assistants were barely act of presence on the journey, while some turns we found ice in the morning and gravel, later in the morning.
Ultimately, a car ultralégère, more fun to drive and is much more than a simple amendment of the Boxster S.
The car will be put on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70 euros.

But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, and the team of Avala wanted to remind the Vitoria that it does not win so easily on their land, and thanks to " the hand of Elias ', they managed to enter the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the yellow take the advantage on the light (50-49) .
Other difficulties
The players of Ivanovic, wounded but far from dead, needed to take appropriate actions to take the air, and it is at this point the gun who, with three baskets to three consecutive points and the assistance of English and Ribas gave the meter to a reassuring (54-67) , and that the end of the third quarter (57-67) .
The team of Avala out to play the whole during the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) that they were tired person to take what they had earned during the first 30 minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini Eidson, the best of their team, is not résignèrent and tried to support since the three points (70-77) .
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for mistakes, the players from Ivanovic did not rushed, defended well, and although the Israelis are closer together at the last minute (80-85) , the party was already and the victory in Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
The injuries prevented the Unicaja battle
The Unicaja lost loudly in Greece in Olympiacos and has given him the head of Group B of the Euroligue, in a match marked by the absence of players of the Unicaja, especially in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald) , which have facilitated the Greek victory.
The team of Malaga was not frightened by the atmosphere of the flag of Peace and friendship or by the scale of the rival, without doubt one of the most powerful in Europe and with a big budget.
The game of the first quarter, has the Andalusian. An aggressive defence and three baskets to three consecutive points, two of the leader Omar Cook and Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.

Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president will abandon the diplomatic legation no later than January 27, 2010, the date of the official end of its mandate.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d ' affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that " Mel " knows that he must leave the embassy, where he has refugee since September 21, before that date.
" he is aware that he must leave on 27 January, at the end of its mandate, it must seek another destination.
The chain has also cited the former agent, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the deadline established: " My position is to leave as soon as possible, with the support of the Brazilian government, " Zelaya said by telephone.
After the elections of 29 November (during which Porfirio Lobo was elected) , Zelaya has ensured that he would remain in the Embassy of Brazil until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed, since Zelaya refused the condition of exiled policy that would impose the de facto government headed by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much
After days roses since last spring, during which the asset inflation was the dominant note on the markets, the uncertainty there arises again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where officers take decisions on a future inherently uncertain.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize the markets has been to monetize the debt by the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by providing liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
Central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets were virtually finalised, and without questioning their political maverick liquidity, begin to put a bit of sand in the wheels, as did the ECB, with their award to a year next week.
Consequently, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain an economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are seeing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of stock markets and business obligations are rising again, although they remain very distant paranormaux levels they have reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to socialize the risk private and public debt is affected.
There is a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany were the shelters chosen by investors, an increase of differences between the countries of the euro zone and Germany.
Spain has been barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard& Poor's threatened a new downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a bit of uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of moral hazard, who tried to provoke a case of awareness among lesresponsables of global economic policy that had hampered the destructive effects of the credit limit on the destruction of employment, whereas what we should do is declare a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation of Dubai is a fight between the tribal sheiks to restore power in the emirates and we have already seen in the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government that uncovered the roses.
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational that Ecofin saves Hungary a breach of its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a member country of the euro area not to meet its commitments.
What makes sense is that the Ecofin has prompted the Greek government transparency and make its citizens of the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of standardization of risk premiums, after some excesses in high positions, this would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as our differences of the public debt increase to the extent of the obligations of European companies, nousn not to worry.
If the European and continued to increase, it would be a risk Spanish.
The Standard& Poor's is an anecdote. When our predictors require most services studies to anticipate their models of recovery and to revise up their forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, who returned to the charge with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not much hope for their warning.
Again, this has to be an excellent opportunity to buy assets Spanish, even if for the moment " caution is the mother of safety ".
Sectors connected
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, which is discussed these days the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades.
After his speech, which was followed by the President of Gas Natural - Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Galán has outlined for the press that he had spoken to the subcommittee, camera.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 000 million until 2020 and 60 000 million between then and 2030, where nuclear power plants now in operation would remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments do not amount to 60 000 million but to 95.
By contrast, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be used to increase production capacity, but the distribution networks and interconnections.
From 2020, the question is changing, and it will increase the power.
His bet focuses both on the gas to coal plants, with recovery of carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that 18 000 MW of more are needed, with other " support ".
Galán, who believes that the draft bill of sustainable economy that the government has approved is in line with what his company, did not wish to attack the royal decree aimed to encourage the use of coal, which contradicts the policies to combat global warming.
According to him, there was " a clear long - term bet " in this sense, despite the measures " one - off ", as the president of Iberdrola.
Nevertheless, Galán believes that investment decisions, although they are in the long term, must begin to be taken, because they take some time before reaching their maturity and a profitable stable framework is needed to address them.

Acciona dispute its first highway in Australia to Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for his first motorway concession in Australia, market on which it is already working as a business manager of energy and water.
The site at stake is a tunnel estimated at 700 million Australian dollars (about 1 million euros) .
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A tunnel of 5 kilometres long in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, such is the option to allow Acciona to settle in the country as a company of public works and highways.
The mayor of the city wants to have by the end of 2014.
Having chosen the public/private partnership (PPP for its initials in English) to complete the project, in the framework of a business plan under the tutelage of Erns& Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the presentation of their bids in May, the planned investment amounts to 1 700 million Australian dollars (about 1 million euros) and in the last phase three consortia, with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, only Spanish company in smooth, and his associates are MDBs and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest manufacturers, while the second, in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists to work underground.
Against the team of Acciona, the consortium Northern Direct, with the presence of the British firm Laing O'Rourke, manager of the Australian infrastructure and the French manufacturer group Bouygues.
The third and final consortium that has passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German builder Hochtief, which has in turn the participation of GBA) , another local company, Baulderstone (property of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian market infrastructure promises of major projects and privatisation, but there is a great difficulty, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that followed the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian, and which is still a step not validated for the Spanish giants of the sector.
GBA is just to win a place on the market by its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Active millionaires
Acciona on a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, on which it already has a large presence through its energy supplier and activity in the sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for building and managing the dessalinisateur of Adelaide, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the markets of the construction and management of infrastructure.
The underground road toll, promoted by the Office of the infrastructure of the city of Brisbane and the Northern Link (north) , is called upon to link the western peripheral route to Kelvin Grove (see map) , by 4 kilometres of tunnel. It is the largest project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the administration said that the auction will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December of next year.
Despite the fact that the toll road will be open to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not anticipated that the site is completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be developed in 2005.
It will include two tracks, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its funding.
Brisbane already provides work to Hochtief
Australia continues to be widely Hochtief, who mentioned yesterday obtaining a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the national broadband network infrastructure in fibre optics.
This will allow 400,000 people to have rapid access to the Internet and provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has given the construction of the tower King George, 27 floors, in the city of Brisbane. The work has not yet started and Hochtief concluded the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC is adjudiquer a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary, is adjudiquer the construction of a tunnel of 2.1 miles long for a motorway in Slovenia, for an amount of EUR 64.5 million.
The company was awarded this contract a few days after being responsible for the expansion of the tunnel Bosruck (Austria) , for a total of 130 million.
Alpine consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The launch of the site is scheduled for early 2010 and its implementation will take 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore is adjudiquer advertising of Renfe
Renfe has left the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore, for a budget of around three million euros per year, said the rail operator.
The contract mentioned the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. SRA. Rushmore was chosen from among 16 agencies that were presented to the tender organised by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity in the past three years.

A fine of 63 million to France Télécom to curb competition
The French competition regulator imposed a fine of EUR 63 million to France Telecom for its anti - competitive conduct in the Caribbean region in the country.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition in the fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and loyalty programs to consumers in the margins of the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and even state company, accumulating more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it puts its competitors.
The sanction imposed yesterday has been increased because the authority which ensures competition considers that France Telecom has committed similar offences in the past and that it is therefore.
A shop applications
On the other hand, the mobile phone subsidiary of the French company has followed the wake of other operators and opened a shop of Internet applications, with the goal of increasing revenue from the transmission of voice.
Initially, the business applications of Orange will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will wait until 2010 for that it happens in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League reported 476,4 million to Real Madrid and since its creation
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs, since its birth in 1992.
Indeed, Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona won 467,4 million, which puts them in third and fifth position of clubs who have pocketed the most money in this competition.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Win the UEFA Champions League does not only the glory. It is also one of the main sources of income of big clubs.
Indeed, the competition has allocated 5 million to 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, during the 1992-93 season, according to UEFA.
The Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona have been well served in this distribution.
The club was the third of the continent to receive more money for his participation, and the only one, with the A. C. Milan, has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, taking the title and last winner of the old European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are the Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams which, moreover, have charged the more money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, although they have lost before.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, in respect of the money generated by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two) .
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure of allocation of money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the body chaired by Michel Platini expects to earn $1 million through the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will 413,1 million fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs who participated in the classification matches (including the Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who have managed to participate received 3.8 million just to be there, more than 550 00 euros for each match.
There is also a bonus in the event of victory (800,000 euros) and equality (400 000 for each team) . Those who arrive in eighths of final three million each, the eight teams who arrive in a quarter - final reçoivent3, 3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will earn $9 million, the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, under fixed payments, a club will win at least 7.1 million, and the maximum 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barça pocketed $2.5 million for winning the Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are varying payments, which are devoted 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the value of each market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four places.
The champion of the previous year gets 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party will be paid based on the number of matches played during the edition of the year.
Nueva Rumasa provides EUR 61 million for 29.9% of SOS.
The group Nueva Rumasa listed yesterday the details of the offer to purchase of shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of the capital of SOS.
A percentage which does not require to launch a takeover bid (OPA) for all of the securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share, which will be disbursed over 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this postponement.
