What is what it will occur? CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor of pastry making in Prague.
The newly-elected representatives of CSSD to the town hall of the capital will have apparently to surmount a real linguistic barrier to understand themselves on the level of the town council with their old and new colleagues of the ODS.
The Actualne.cz daily newspaper "tested" the new members of the town council pertaining to CSSD, namely if they know the slang which was born during last years with the town hall, when they were the partners of the current coalition who directed to Prague.
The coded vocabulary that the political cream of Prague started during the previous era of the mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is with surprise which it was discovered that the newly-elected representatives do not understand the known terms very well.
At least they say it.
"Which is Valdemort."
"I really do not know."
"I am a young fellow in the policy pragoise reacted Lukas Kaucky, the elected official with the culture with the test of the vocabulary of the "godfather."
And concerning the political veteran, the elected official Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example the direction of "hole of golf."
"It is the only expression among those which you propose to me that I use"
If not, I do not use the slang.
Vocabulary, of which the Aktualne.cz daily newspaper published the expressions in June this year before the pre-éĺectoral congress of the ODS, the drafting chose 6 examples, in priority those which are dependant with the town hall of Prague.
The Socialists were to explain the direction of "Voldemort," "the largest hole of golf in Prague," to go to pastry making," "beef animal nerve," "treason of the capital" and "to fleece."
Three of the elected officials were of agreement for the quiz, fourth Antonin Weinert, who must direct education to Prague in the future - promised a maintenance first of all but then the telephone did not take down.
The fifth elected official Petr Dolinek straightforwardly refused the test.
"I do not deal at all with these things there and how the representatives of the democracy citizen have fun: I will not give my opinion."
"I currently deal with the way in which we will understand ourselves within the framework of our programs," T he has reacted.
As one already heard, the elected official Lukas Kaucky apparently does not recognize in the legend above, that it is influential Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of the ex-mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" does not say anything á' Kaucky and the only expression which he guessed in the test is "the largest hole of golf in Prague."
"It is the Blanka tunnel" says Kaucky and adds immediately: "But I know it newspapers."
"I will have to pay me a language class," T joke he.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but as Lukas Plachy, the elected official for the environment, know as the hole of golf is the tunnel of Blanko.
The two social democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows the place where to find the character - he thinks within the meaning of "going to pastry making."
"It acts, I think, to go in a company," Plachy is ready to guess that it is the seat of the companies of Janousek.
On the same tone Brezina recalls that it rather draws its knowledge from the newspapers and not from any vocabulary which it would use.
According to the candidates with the tests there does not exist any lexicon of slang in the social democracy.
"I took council with colleagues and it appears that we really do not have something of this type."
"One rather says the names some time one uses abbreviations and symbols," known as Peter Hlinsky, President of the Party socio-democrat, that the members of the Party call Hulda.
"Me was called Briza at the school but I do not know if my colleagues call me like that, Karel Brezina in connection with the nicknames acknowledges.
The Actuel.cz daily newspaper tested the name and it goes.
The Weinert elected official is Papy for the members of the Party or the least friendly Little old man, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by the swindles during the sponsoring of the party, is called "the small toy."
The nicknames are also the only ones which inside the party the social democrats admit to employ.
It appears that Hulinsky does not like much to hear Hulda, but the Akutel.cz daily newspaper recorded another nickname for this president pragois.
"Doctor of Laws of bludgeon" recalls appears it that Petr Hulinsky obtained its title of JUDr. Doctor of Laws to the police academy of Bratislava.
The government wants to decrease tortures of the "witches," a booklet published.
In Burkina Faso Faso, the declared women witch refer common.
They belong to the older generation rather, cannot work for example for health reasons, are free and do not have a child.
That which becomes "witch" is insulated not to threaten the remainder of the village.
"The man very seldom has this destiny."
"One does not judge either the young women in good health because they take part in work and are confined of the children," a sister declares who occupies herself in the capital of this country of West Africa, Burkina Faso Faso, in a special establishment of more than 100 women who were rejected by the company.
The local government decided to intervene against these unusual "social measures."
It published a booklet which should help has to limit hunting to the witches.
The business comprises "difficulty."
"More than 70 percent of the adults in Burkina Faso Faso cannot read," the daily newspaper Die Standard in connection with the disadvantage of written education informed.
The charge of sorcery is current in other countries of Africa.
In Ghana, close to Burkina Faso Faso, Ammy Hemma, woman a 72 year old died after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with oil that they had sprinkled to him.
It is the waiter of the BBC which transmitted this information.
The criminals affirm that it was the evil eye.
According to their version the oil which is used for ritual oilings is emflammée in contact with the woman.
Oil flamed, it appears, when the team wanted "to drive out the bad spirit" of the woman.
The insulation of the "witches" is approved by the people of all levels of education.
Standard daily newspaper DER quoted a 42 year old entrepreneur of Burkina Faso Faso: "The eaters of human spirits always represented a danger," said it.
Whereas Burkina Faso Faso endeavours to reduce hunting to the witches, Gambia not later that last year even saw the President himself taking part in it.
"Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a broad hunting to the witches which, it appears, would have taken part in his death and would have endeavoured by the black magic to also kill the President."
"Shamans of Guinea come near to the rescue, brought to the firm presidential election with Kanilai, under the protection of police officers and of the personal guard of the President, the men and the women randomly chosen in villages of Gambia," in a message the organization "Amnesty International indicated.
With the farm the imprisoned people were to drink a potion containing plants with the hallucinogens effects which caused besides other effects on the kidneys and the intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive it.
On the international pressure it is approximately a thousand of people who were given in freedom.
The tenant of Bakal: The poèles heat, it signed a rent more raised.
An imposing old man left by the door the center customers the company RPG Byty the "baron coal" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments to be rented as a Czech Republic.
It carried under the arm a file with three new agreements of hiring for three apartments: his, that of his/her daughter and her son who is spirit to purge a sorrow.
The deregulation made increase the rent with these three people.
Instead of paying the 3500 sons will have to regulate as from the next year for an apartment 2+1 of second category 4100 crowns.
"And there is no warm water and the heating runs on solid fuel," finger on the new agreement of his son the man shows who has the power of signature.
"But I signed nevertheless" explains T it with motié in anger and half resigned.
The association citizen of the BytyOKD.cz apartments which described the nouelles conditions of hiring like "immoral and indecent," advises with the tenants not to sign and wait until December 7th, date on which will be published a note to explain the method to be followed to claim.
But the man reacts to that by an epic of the hand.
"One says that, the other says another thing" by wrinkling the eyebrows.
The area of Ostrava becomes the laboratory of the deregulation.
After the New year, it is what waits most apartment as a Czech Republic whose rents do not correspond at the cost of market.
Aktualne.cz for this reason decided to visit the "laboratory personally."
The waiting room of RPG in the street Havirovska is one of the four of the area of Ostrava and it is already full Tuesday at 09 o'clock in the morning.
Just beside the door a guard is held of a company of safety with an apparatus to call the customers.
A special button, "rent 2011," is lit on the touch screen.
Only one pressure and a paper with a number leaves the apparatus.
You do not have time to read your number "157" that your number already starts to be illuminated on the big screen under the topit of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second it is your turn.
After a short moment, an old couple is able to get information about the rent, but the new rents do not seem to concern people in the waiting room.
The majority of people came to solve current problems like everywhere - request for repairs, events concerning the insurances and others.
In the area of Ostrava, people of more than 44000 apartments of the portfolio of RPG receive the mails with the new agreements of lease in their letter-box since approximately mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes to them increases in rent from 15 to 38 percent.
the special counter for the new rents is opened with the public since November 18th.
"it functions since nearly one week, it is thus still with the test" answers, after one moment of hesitation, the employee behind the counter when the customer is presented in the form of a journalist.
The deragulation and the old apartments of minors of Bakal are a very significant local subject.
The vice-president of the Parliament and originating in the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of the social democrats in mentioned rather constant way before the elections and that fills from now on the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They did not even change me one could... N of board in the WC, relieve in introduction the man mentioned.
However, it is especially, according to the employees, of the pensioners who come to be sure that they will receive a rebate on the new price of the rent if they sign now like promised it RPG in a special offer.
It is a rebate of half of the amount of the rent which the others will receive loctaires which will have signed their new agreement before December 15th.
But the counter "deregulation" of the street Havirovaska is really not overpowered by the questions.
"Among the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for the rent," the employee indicates to the counter.
And yet RPG porpose so much on its Web site than in the windows of the individual talks on the rents when it is necessary.
If the two parts do not get along on the rent it is an independent court which will make the decision.
'They are not threats but to only inform on the single way and legitimate to act legally," RPG indicates on its Web site.
"Here nobody will go to the court" thinks one of the employees of RPG Byty and the man in the street in front of the center of customers agrees to him.
"I have 13000 crowns of retirement and there remain to me 5000 crowns to eat, I do not have to go enough to the court," known as it.
The employee feels suddenly badly at ease.
"We will see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that nobody sign and thus the people wait," indicates T she.
The regulation of the rents finishes as a Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and the increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic need.
"And, moreover, the current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the funds for the residences," points out Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, that it is precisely the negligence of the funds for the residences which returns the tenant in anger is the primary reason of the increase in the rent.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG could with the rents invest in the apartments 4 billion, in four years of 2011 has 2014 that should make 5.2 billion.
The big screen fixed on the ceiling opposite the stuffed armchairs of the waiting room of the street Havirosvka, however repeats some information indicated in red.
'The increase in the rent in 2011 is of 15 percent and does not concern less than 31200 apartments is more than 90 percent of the apartments of RPG."
"And it will be always with more the 7.50 Czech crowns the m ² per month," the screen indicates.
The increase of 38 percent relates to only 400 apartments of the portfolio of RPG.
"In these cases there, it is about an increase in a sum really very low 19.66 Czech crowns with the m ²," RPG adds.
The next year the rent will remain the same one for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation will not cause a radical but progressive increase on 4 to 8 years.
She adds other commitments: all the money of the increase in the rents (cf the graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of savings in heating - news windows and heating.
Those which sign the agreement on the increase in rent have priority.
The nursery school also is part of the offices understood the architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint de Brno is the new seat of company arch. Design.
Nobody could have expected that it also shelters a mini nursery school with all that it is necessary - walls of colors, pieces of furniture imaginative, toys and finally a miniature playing field on the terrace.
Since October of last year, can go there the children of the employees of arch. design.
The company of project-architectonic arch. Design. whose workshops produced a large number of constructions with Brno, its mini nursery school of company imagined since the first outlines of the Avriopoint building.
It employs approximately 90 people, especially of the age to make children and it mattered to him that the women architects and project managers can quickly return to work.
At the same time as of the work contracts at decreased time, the nursery school is a no-claims bonus suggested to its employees by company arch. Design. within the framework of its social program.
The manufacturers and the architects thus have the possibility of combining a fascinating work with the care for the children.
They are the employees thesame ones who imagined this nursery school and with the support of the direction they could obtain an equipment of the European Union and Ministry of Labor and social affairs.
The mini nursery school is financed by the means of the Funds of a company European through the operational programme of human resources and the official Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the equipments of financing (with height of 2.8 mil.de Czech crowns). They could buy equipment and apparatuses and after two years to ensure a qualified personnel as well as the startup.
After the use of the equipment of financing (two years) company arch. Design. the obligation has after 3 years to make function to it mini nursery school on its equities.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and it is the company Economy rating which helped to make the request of equipment.
The care with the children is ensured by a qualified personnel, all the day a nurse and a teacher of nursery school deals with the children. the children can go to the nursery school without limitation of age but they have more than three anspour the majority.
As there is about a "mini nursery school" he can be only 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there is more who are replaced.
The operation of the school is flexible the needs of the parents and the children of all the employees have the same right to use this school without glance on the hierarchical position.
Although it is about an individual care and an education, the program of the mini nursery school is comparable with that for pre-school education.
The children do not make there that to play but a teaching of quality is also assured there - beginning until the preparation with the benches of school one teaches English.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and plays but also with a computer which the children can use.
The presence of the small children in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
The parents can at any time to control their child and not to have the stress of a delay to go to seek the children in a school far away from the workplace of the parents.
The parents thus use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not astonishing that creates for itself a natural relation of honesty between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s' is thus registered among the companies which offer a no-claims bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and who are friendly towards the family and through this program the marketing of RH reinforces.
The house in bone fascine still after 100 years. Throw an eye in the interiors of Gaudi.
The roof resembles on the back of a prehistoric saurian, the staircase with a spinal column of dinosaur and the balconies with open fish mouths.
Thus is the house Casa Battlo in Barcelona of the architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic forms, the house received on behalf of the buildings the nickname of House in bone.
Organic forms, colors wild, use unusual of stones, fragments of squares and mosaîque, frontage pointing out of the scales and everywhere present curves, here all that is ypic for the Art nouveau of Antoni Gaudi.
The frontal frontage of the house unrolls its lines of dream, its pleasant colors and textures which point out nature and the animals.
During a more detailed observation one sees the geometry, the rhythm and the order thought with precision.
In the night the frontage of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such way that the impression of brightness of the colors is reinforced with it.
The rolling up and the torsion of the forms also appear in the interiors with same measurement.
Wood copies in waves the windowframes, the balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the eyepiece and the strips.
The Battlo house which is drawn up in the Eixample district in the commercial street Passeig of Gracia to the number. 43, was born from the construction of a house of 1877 of the architect Emilio Sala the Cortes.
The rebuilding was done during two years and the house finished in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a rich entrepreneur, insisted initially on the demolition of the old construction and the construction of another any news but quickly accepted the idea of Gaudi of the unusual rebuilding and cheaper.
But the idea of Put Battlo as an apartment building was not thought by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on its project that were born decorations for an apartment from representation of the owner of the building and the use of mosaîque for the frontage.
For the frontage also worked of other artists and creators.
Common work for the plans of the house Casa Battlo begin with a co-operation with success between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol took part in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and the Guell park in which there are other works of Gaudi.
The buildings called the hot house just after its completion because of its organic forms "the House in bone."
Others, in view of specific mechanism of opening of the windows called it "the house which bucket."
It is said that at the top of construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint Georges the owner of Catalonia.
Other elements of sculpture of construction contain hidden religious reasons.
Gaudi thought for the house a single system in its central warming-up time, with vents of ventilation and typical chimneys.
Their slope of 45 degrees seems odd.
During Gaudi creation absolutely did not respect the directives of construction of then and did not let itself block by them.
At the beginning of construction it obtained on behalf of the city the building permit, knowing, of course that the data related to the plans of rebuilding were so vague that two years afterwards during the completion the town council was horrified and asked for modifications.
It did not like, for example, with the members of the town council which the pillars of construction empiettent on the public pavement.
There was never modification, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo asked for (and satisfaction obtained) the authorization of rent the two higher stages.
The owner moved on the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a living room common and to the third a room and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented with a jewelry.
The whole house of six floors is divided by a staircase by which one reaches to an independent terrace of roof.
All the right angles and the straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the rebuilding and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked the modern concept of connection of spaces.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the living rooms and the high society can communicate comfortably or to limit the space deprived for more intimate talks.
The house with the rebuilding of Gaudi received in addition to new frontages a nontraditional roof and two stages moreover.
The play of Gaudi with the light is also impressive, of the blue and white glazed tiles with which is decorated the interior court and with the wells of lights.
The play with two colors gives a maximum of light in all the floors of the house.
It was simply enough to bet on the principle that the white reflête more than sinks it which on the contrary absorbs the rays of the sun.
The house Put Battlo which was registered in 2005 in the Funds of the World heritage of UNESCO perhaps visited by each one.
On the first floor of the house is the most roomy apartment and most splendid accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 at the time of the 150ème birthday of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits because they noted that it is about a lucrative company and they widened the field of the visits to common spaces and the attic including the terraces of roof.
The ticket of entry in the monument is really not expensive and costs 16.50 euros\; the students, the pensioners, the groups and the holders of touristic maps have 20 percent of reduction.
The sum is nevertheless above entrance fee in other constructions of Gaudi in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you must quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a diagrid: the women have other criteria that the men.
No the ostentatious framework, but rather surface quality reserved for sleeping, therefore the mattress and the diagrid give a real base for a good bed.
Must of course be complementary harmoniously to like them a concrete user.
During the choice several things are determining: the weight, size, the age, the health status as well as the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which one will place the mattress and the diagrid is also important.
A typical example?
For example in the country house where one does not sleep continuously the latex mattresses are not suitable because they "are heated" gently.
They have, in addition, a weight higher than the standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to frequently turn over them.
If they also do not have enough ventilating ducts in the middle and if they remain, moreover, on a solid board, they retain moisture. Mould can be also formed there.
The practice is also determining in the choice.
That which passes the light of time abroad when one frequently uses very thick mattresses with a softening layer, will feel of course with difficulty a low and hard surface.
"Thus all the hokeyists who return from NHL feel sorry for that they cannot sleep over there."
"For their tired shoulders, the feet and the coasts, they needed mattress with a softening layer of lazy foam."
"Such mattresses are also recommended for the people who suffer from diabetes which has a disorder of the nervous system which thus badly assumes "information" of the articulations and the skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova which specializes in the stuffed pieces of furniture.
Therefore there is a few years the mattress with lazy foam conquered the hokeyists as well as other customers.
"Today everything works well, Tempur, Italian Magnifex but also Czech Tropico have for example suitable mattresses.
You do not need to be a guy of NHL to be able to appreciate a lazy foam.
This "miracle" functions simply.
It optimizes its rigidity and its form according to absorptive heat or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you will not be turned over in the night as after a difficult match.
You sleep simply better.
Lazy foam also functions like a protection against the esquarres.
For the choice of the mattress according to your size, add the length of the feet, that is to say approximately 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of a size of 180cm thus need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimal width for each one for a double bed should be 90 cm is in all 180 cm.
For the beds in only one place, the individual ones for example, it is recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm.
It is convenient in the event of visit.
'However it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on the back you should pose the hands in a comfortable way with the slightly folded elbows. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of the Harness-maker-mattress makers and decorators who has devoted themselves for several years to the problems of a healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and the sign in the specialized schools.
For a double bed each one needs its own diagrid and mattress, therefore attention however during achât to choose the height of the mattress well.
If not it will only remain you to assemble the diagrid to various heights and that is not realizable on all the executives of bed.
The mattresses foam should have a minimal height of 14 cm, the spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of that count for the ventilation and subgrade at least three centimetres.
"With the touch or in sitting position on the mattress you should not feel the springs," Héléna Prokopova prevents.
Each mattress requires a well defined type of diagrid.
The bed-diagrid, when the mattress and the diagrid are plain like Siamese twins, does not have anything to make in the bedrooms.
The mattresses are aired very badly\; one should not wash it, which is usually made auhourd' today.
And since during the night one perspires normally from 0.2 to 0.75 L of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress starts to point out a large (and stopped) sieve.
For that the specialists refuse to make advertisement over one 25 years lifetime of for a mattress or a guarantee with life.
But very with its but.
And for this reason a council of experiment on behalf of the salesmen: for a mattress of 120/140cm, give up, for the coating of the mattress, to hygiene or washing but add a mattress of protection rather that easily vouspouvez to withdraw and wash.
And even if nowadays it is frequent to manufacture coatings with zipper for all the unit, i.e. that after the opening one has two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine it is very important!) if not handling for the great models (and only one person) becomes when one withdraws them a combat between a light weight and a heavyweight on a boxing ring.
Do you have in your bed a rigid board instead of a diagrid?
Never!
To the maximum for a bed intended for the visitors for only one night.
However equip the board (if there is not) air vents and use the spring mattress with a minimal height of 15cm with springs out of sachets (of Germany Taschenfederken) and a layer of ventilation.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of a bed of this type.
For the diagrids with strips with single position with 14/18 strips, the latex mattresses or known as sandwiches (perhaps combination of latex and coconut), are the ideal but will be always better for you to have a mattress with more strips, 28 and above, where the strips are doubled in the part of the bottom of the kidneys and that it is thus possible to control rigidity of it.
For the mattresses with several positions one should not take spring mattress because it does not answer the changes of position.
Beside the adjustment of the rigidity of the strips one can also install what one calls a cradle of shoulder.
It is about a special connection of the strips which makes it possible to put pressure to even incline the strip so that the shoulder of the sleeper "is integrated" well.
For the men who have "the shoulders as broad as the back," it is really an important thing.
This thing is already considered by the manufacturers of mattresses which for the "masculines" started to use a zone softening on the level of the shoulders.
But they also think of the women - they again offer to them a softer surface on the level of the hips.
For the most difficult customer there are diagrids with wings or plates with what one calls a suspension multiforce.
The pressure is disseminated in more points and diinue the tension.
But of course, attention, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and inflated air) on good mattresses and diagrid, "more" disappears.
The basic rule is a very simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its points must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The size recommended is 50X60 cm that the Scandinavians by exmple prefer.
When one is lengthened on the side, the pillow must level (with the cradle of shoulder of the diagrid or the zone softened in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
The modern mattresses still have something of commun run with the first containing straw and of grass.
The manufacturers still use natural matters or many mixtures.
The tendency is also with the organic mattress.
The raw materials containing oil, from which the polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils, such as for example of the soya oil.
Almost all the known manufacturers precisely use soya.
"The Bio qualifier for the mattresses means that the heart is manufactured containing natural products," Petr vasicek company Tropico Plus explains.
The natural matters are also used for the coatings of the mattresses\; one of the first was the aloe will vera.
But you can add to it microphone-capsules which develop perfumes of the forest or lavender.
There exist differences between the man and the woman.
Whereas the extract of plants of birch so that the coating of the mattress absorbs heat and cools the body, "kills" the man, the coatings "heat" the women.
The red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is thus hotter for the weaker sex.
The preferred current ones?
The mattresses manufactured starting from cold foam (it have more pores with a thus disturbed cellular structure more breathing that the standard polyurethane and have more elasticity.
The combination of various rigidities of cold foams gives mattresses polyzones which know precisely where is the head, the bottom of the back and the feet.
You will pay a mattress of quality starting from 7000 crowns and more.
Those which are characterized by their parameters for health have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
As a Czech Republic, it is Gumotex which reached the first place.
To save for the mattress and the diagrid is not simple.
One can from time to time have within the framework of special actions on behalf of the manufacturers or the producers two mattresses for the price of only one.
As for example the Magniflex company which proposes Duofreeze mattresses with foam with Memory memory bent with the coating for 11990 crowns.
One can obviously take the second free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cellular structure and a great thickness was started with the Tempur matter at "cosmic" intervals.
That started as matter for NASA because the astronauts underwent with the starting of the enormous load factors.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens, on the contrary, cold.
It thus adapts perfectly to the hot human body and distributes to him an optimal pressure.
It is for that ideal against the evil slept and for an increase in comfort during the sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for the mattresses but also for the products for health, as the special cushions for the feet which relieve the venous legs and system.
The Czech manufacturers use for example foam EucathermC or Twinsaver or of the same type.
The apparatuses to follow people are required more and more by the parents who wish to supervise their children.
The fear for their child leads people more and more to think of supervising them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to seek the cars can just as easily be employed to trace the movement of the people and to help for certain cases as by exmple that of small Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as large as one limps of matches but will be soon of the size of a watch.
The case of small Anicka moved a large number of people and they started to seek the means of better protecting their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their private life.
"We endeavour to say to all which it is not of espionage but only about another means to decrease the probability that there is another tragedy," declares Petr Pilin of the company MAcro Weil which is one of the suppliers of apparatuses of tracing on the Czech market.
"I acknowledge that there can be cases of bad use of such apparatuses, as for example to put it in the bag of a person who is not with the current, but I did not encounter such cases yet."
"The majority of people are customers who buy really the product for safety reasons, Pilin adds.
According to him the children should always know at which ends is used "limps it" and how to use it in the event of urgency.
The psychologist for children, Dana Bockova, draws attention that if the child does not want to carry on him a thing of this type, it will be débarassera some.
'And even smallest can show a great creativity when it is a question of getting rid purposely of something when they do not want to be under control."
"The cellphones, which can be cut like these apparatuses of tracing, already brought the parents to long waits," Bockova affirms.
According to it, the fact that this kind of apparatus can help in the event of aggression is very debatable.
"If it is about a prepared abduction, the author will do everything so that the child does not have an electronic device which can locate it."
"Currently, it is the telephone."
"As soon as will develop the equipment of tracing, they (criminals) will also seek them because the sale will be supported by an advertizing campaign."
"In such cases the criminals will be always advances of it on the police," known as the psychologist.
She acknowledges all the same that such apparatuses can help at the time of an aggression not prepared by a paedophile.
According to Robert Cech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers services of tracing as well for the cars as for the people, affirms to have this kind of apparatus can help, even if it is destroyed in the case of an aggression.
"The apparatus can be parameterized in such a way that it is in regular emission after one given period."
"If the apparatus is destroyed, there remains all the same the last position of the person concerned."
'The more expensive apparatuses also have an inclinometer which immediately announces the position of the person who slipped and finds herself in reclining position without moving," Cech indicates.
According to him the cellphones known as intelligent which are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after having formatted it with a special prologiciel.
The problem of the current systems of tracing is that it acts is of an apparatus similar to those which one carries into pendentive of the size of one limps of matches is with the more telephone small apparatuses.
One can always lose them.
According to Pilina of the company Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently carried out to make apparatuses which resemble common digital watches.
"That will have the advantage that the possible attacker will not be able to recognize the apparatus of tracing."
"Or it will realize there after a certain time, which will have given to the police a little more time," he adds.
That the apparatus of tracing is developed in the shape of bracelet or pendentive, it will always utilisiera same technology as to trace cars.
It is about a combination of systems of acquisition of a position by means of the GPS (which is usually used in autonavigation) and of a function of a cellphone which alerts the current location of a vehicle.
The army has as well detonator fuses as it could make it tower of the Czech Republic with. But it can hold only two years.
The army bought for 445 km of chalk lines used for the explosives.
Already last year the Ministry for Defense had bought 224 km of them.
The army thus has reservations for 225 years.
The problem is that the lifetime of the chalk lines is from two to four years maximum.
The army bought detonator fuses at limited company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The general staff gave as reason of achât of an enormous quantity of detonator fuses to MF DNES which the soldiers use 60 km a year.
According to calculations of reserve to be held made by the pyrotechnists of the army, that MF DNES contacted, this reveals that even the generals, the officers having a command, secretaries or staffs of household should have each year a exercise with the explosives.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister for defense and Vlastimil Picek, ordering army do not make exception.
Only to argue the yearly consumption of the army of 60 km detonator fuses.
With this distance corresponds 25,000 explosions.
And even if it were true, the reserves of the army could provide for it for 10 years.
If on the contrary it would be true that for the basic training of each new professional it is enough with more than 2 m of detonator fuses, as the experts say it, that means that the army with its new purchase ensured - with also the consumption of the special units and the genius - concerning the 225 years mentioned.
However the soldiers of the brigade of rapid intervention recently complained with the Vondra Minister whom they almost do not have ammunition for their handguns and whom the meetings of shooting are limited because of the needs for money.
In connection with the lack of body linen one does not speak about it.
"And I am not caught the head if they on our premises buy a so great quantity of detonator fuses."
"And it is their decision and they know really what they do."
"for us the army is a good customer that we endeavour as tradesmen to satisfy," known as the sales director of STV Group Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesperson of the Ministry for defense, argues achât it of hundreds of km of detonator fuses by the fact that the army will have these "ammunition" reserves some for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group mentions however only four years of lifetime of the detonator fuses and the pyrotechnists of the police and army of only two years.
"If they are stored perfectly in the deposits, that can go even up to four years," said one two which does not want that its name is published in view of the criticism of the army.
The time of lifetime passed, each ammunition must be tested to see whether it remains just and the life does not threaten of the soldier.
These tests are however not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the ministry is a reduction due to the quantity for 445 km of cordeux explosives.
"They cost us 60 percent less than the supply of the last year of 245 km," indicates the Pejsek spokesperson who is made the interpreter of the opinion of the purchasers of the ministry for defense.
To only compare: the yearly consumption of the detonator fuses of the pyrotechnists of the police who neutralize the ammunition of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed the 1500 meters.
And organizes it order always only the quantity necessary of ammunition to be used before the end of their lifetime.
That was established for safety reasons of the pyrotechnists and to be able moreover to obtain in a more flexible way of the types of more modern and more reliable detonator fuses.
the ministry for defense has today big problems for the neutralization of tens of tons of ammunition coming from time from the Warsaw Pact when the strong Czechoslovakian army of two hundred and thousand men prepared to move, course on the Rhine.
What expects in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES contacted: to neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old detonator fuses which it buys today "at a cheap rate."
Until today I benefit from contacts which I obtained thanks to the contests.
The sale under frankness from its hotel helped well Lukas Pytloun for the place of winner of the contest of best individual Entrepreneur.
The winner of the contest of best individual Entrepreneur for the last year was Lukas Pytloun, entrepreneur 28 year old.
Its adventure towards success is as in a film.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, it realized that in Libérec it missed a site of lodging of quality at a reasonable price.
Of its economies on what it had gained when it worked abroad and with the assistance of a bank loan it bought a small demolished building of 5 apartments to half.
Knowing that it was still student in trosième year of higher learning, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between the quality and the price of a lodging in our area gave me desire for doing something," known as Lucas Pytloun.
It started has to rent the first apartment rebuilt with the foreign blue-collar workers.
It reinvests the benefit in the building which it transformed into pension with 54 beds.
Since this moment, its action of entrepreneur enabled him to open in Libérec 4 pensions, two restaurants of style and two hotels with a full capacity of almost 300 beds of all categories of lodging.
Most comfortable of them was to very recently the four stars Pytloun design hotel.
This year it him arrived from there another of identical quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel with Ostrova U Stokes where we sold our concept of frankness and other candidates with the frankness from the Pytloun hotels appeared," number 1 of the entrepreneurs of the last year.
"And for the sale of the license for the starting of a hotel on a large scale the victory with the contest of the entrepreneur of the year was useful well, adds Pytloun with recognition.
The victory brought more popularity to him and to be known with Libérec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me in the streets, often congratulated me and, I must say, that it was very pleasant," he recalls.
It recommends the participation in this contest to all those which endeavour to do something.
It is not necessary to gain but any opportunity of being visible is good.
He says that he uses until today his contacts and knowledge which he could not have obtained in another way.
"With those which I met thanks to the contest I started to maintain the trade relations regularly.
According to him, the fame related to success had an impact also on the employees.
And it has approximately 70 of them.
"I on their premises observe especially honesty and the pride to be itself committed in something which was in general recognized."
"It is not, and by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of us all together.
"Only my name is ahead thorough," known as Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish with my successor a better year than that which we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of the victory rpidement was rpidement replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the direction of the objective of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind oneself.
That which came to seek the price with Slovansky dum for the first place of the contest for the Firm of the year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the Farmet company.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it transformed a workshop of tools with Ceska Skalice into a firm with the turnover of 100 million crowns.
'I can say that the reward encouraged not to only me my also my collaborators and increased our self-confidence to fight against competition," the winner of the contest of last year declares today.
At the beginning of the history of the Farmet company there was the desire to do something of useful.
And thus when the state proposed to the father of Karel Zdrasky to rent the small workshop like compensation after the confiscation of the goods by the Communists, he did not hesitate a long time, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with some comrades in the entourage of his father for the manufacturing of plastic bath-tubs.
Not very a long time after they started to specialize in the presses for vegetable oil.
It became after eighteen years the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the public not specialized after the success obtained with the contest through the media.
"Not only our customers started with really better knowing the Farmet mark but also the foreign partners who started to realize that they collaborated with a company which obtained greatest success in its country of origin," said Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year E did not occur to Farmet only ldans the euphoria from the victory.
The evaluation of the company had been made starting from the economic results of 2008 and partly of 2009.
And precisely in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of machines of engineering.
With highest of the crisis, which did not really touch the citizens, the companies were obliged to stop their investment projects and to start to limit their achâts of new materials and technologies.
"We do not have obviously escaped with this situation."
"The turnover fell from 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and to even lay off," explains Karel Zdarsky.
A viable company must know that from time to time should be taken unpopular measures.
But they managed the situation correctly and preserved bénéficiares results even if they were lower than those which they had before the crisis.
However in Farmet, they continued without compromise to invest in the research and the development.
"We built with the equipments a training center and with research, reinforced the presentation of the company in living room-exposures international and gained the principal rewards in the national exposures," known as Zdarsky.
All leaves us think that the crisis is behind them.
The figures of affires go up and with them the number of employees also.
"With the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of the victory but in a calm atmosphere," known as Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation which removes foolish regulations.
The investigation into the Nonsense of the year is for the fourth time part of the clan of the business.
Certain absurd regulations could be removed.
The victorious glorious not very of this year of the investigation into the Nonsense of the year was the obligation to bring in the offices of the documents which the civils servant can obtain on-line.
More of the third of the 4000 voters voted for that.
For example, the administrations of the social affairs required an extract paper of the trade register whereas the civil servant can obtain it in two clicks of a mouse.
that changes thanks to the investigation.
"The Czech administration of the Social Security will not require any more the extract of the trade register for controls of payments of the insurance," indicated Jana Buranova, spokesperson of the Czech Administration of the Social Security (CSSZ).
To emphasize all the regulations and decrees which the companies and the entrepreneurs must fill as a Czech Republic and make remove those which are absurd is the direction of this contest of the Nonsense of the year.
This investigation is still this year for the fourth time part of the clan of the business organized by Hospodarske noviny and still has a greater popularity.
If last year 3000 voters appeared, it is at least 4000 this year who brought their voice.
And it is not astonishing, there are in our country the most various legal requirements which do nothing but slow down the company, and, this, more and more.
"We are perhaps with the number of documents to be filled for the tax declarations in the first places in the world," declares Karel Havlicek of the Association of the small and medium-size companies and the entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of the activity of entrepreneur becomes a goal proclaimed of all the governments these last years.
In comparison with the whole world the situation as a Czech Republic does not improve at all.
According to the World Bank the Czech Republic is located at the 74 ème place concerning the conditions for the company, that is to say 8 places moreover compared to last year.
The contest of the Nonsense of the year was set up for the first time in 2006 and continues each year according to the same scenario.
No matter who can mention each year of the administrative and bureaucratic nonsenses from April at at the end of September, final deadline before the contest closure.
To give an account there is the Web site www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the organizer of the contest chooses seven candidates for "the antiprix" and lets the public vote during October on the www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita site and www.ihned.cz.
The Nonsense which received more a large number of voices is declared victorious.
Until the last investigation of last year, it is a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and decrees which lost their direction of existence.
The remarks are sent by the entrepreneurs but also the professional unions and the professors.
Among the "finalists" of the contest, therefore among the nominated ones for example the obligation is that the vehicles of maintenance of the highways and the fast tracks pay tolls, or although the entrepreneurs with twenty employees, repaint two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of the seven proposals is published on the site of the contest.
The proclamation of the contest, which always starts with at the beginning of November on the Place Venceslas in Prague, is part of a happening in which take part regularly of the personalities of the political life and public.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of Association for the small and medium-size companies of Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of commerce of Czech Republic, attended the culminating moment of the contest.
'Economic prosperity cannot function when the State puts âtons in the legs of the entrepreneurs and for this reason my objective is to remove, each year, at least three tens of paragraphs which today do nothing but complicate the company," with declared Martin Kocourek, the trade and Minister of Industry.
The effort to remove absurd decrees is not a blow of sword in water.
In 2007, which people did not like was the obligation of the entrepreneurs to declare three days front at the office for private industry at the place where is the company, the intention to go to an exposure or a pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was removed with the amendment of the Company law private industry.
The second most voted by plebiscite obligation in 2007, which was to declare at the Office of work a voyage of service for a foreign employee over 30 days, was removed with the legal text on what one calls the green chart.
And all is ok until the third session of the contest.
The Nonsense of the year 2009 was the decree for the physiotherapeutists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two patent weighing machines.
That was changed by ordinance of the ministry for health the year last-the obligation to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards the responsible firms socially.
Are evaluated the ecological, humane, of formation or sporting projects.
The innovation of this year of the contest of Hospodarske Noviny, which already has existed for 5 years, is the category called the Firm Responsible for the year 2010.
The onjectif one of this contest is the support for the company reasonable and right.
"We want to support the companies which supervise the impacts of their company on the environment and undertake a socially responsible activity," Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the operator of cellphone indicates, the Vodaphone firm, which is the guaranteeing one and promoter of this contest, like in the case of the contest for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this subcategory of the contest of the firm of the year 2010, organized by the Vodaphone firm, the companies were registered which do not have success with only one long-term objective for the company.
The adventure of each one of them is rich inspirations and an independent article would be to publish.
Although the object of their company is different one from the other one can regard their activity of support and forecast as the denominator of their efforts.
For one of the cases, that relates to the handicapped people and the personal problems or of health of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for all the Czech Republic example is not the company of prologiciels pragoise And Netera which supports the creation of abstract sporting teams their employees who take part then in many tournaments in various sporting disciplines.
Another example of firm responsible for the area of Pardubice is the company Isolit-Cheer which has been for 17 years the principal contributor at the bottoms of equipment which sponsors the handicapped children.
Well aware of dealing with the employees having health problems, one can still quote the old manufacturing plant of paper of Podebrad which employs some more than 70 percent and which, for that, obtained the title of the Responsable firm for the area for central Bohemia and which placed third in the area at the contest of the Firm of the year organized by Vodaphone.
With Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a finance company, which gained to have introduced work hours softened and even decreased up to 35 hours per week on average and, this, without, proportionally, wage cutting.
The jury to him déverné the title also because it achête in priority with the Czech manufacturers, supports a ditoyenne activity in the close entourage and is concerned with environment.
"We endeavour to recycle as much as possible so that our activity of company and our administration have less environmental impact," explains Miluse Ryznarova, the executive director of the company.
company responsible IT Enlogit for the Area of Usti also thinks of the health of its employees and their set up for each laptop a chair and a keyboard ergonomic, encourages their home-based business and uses the services of catering of a local factory protected for its actions.
"We support moreover the foundation the man in the shade which helps local the Rom community," known as Ondrej Suchy the representative of the company.
With the very last row is, also for its activities, a company of Washing and cleaning of the area of Karlovy Vary, who takes part in the insurance reprocesses his employees in the form of no-claims bonus above standards.
"In our company we contribute to food, transport, the increase in the qualifications and with the leisures," known as Joseph Strapac of the company of construction of bruntal Czasch, winner for the area of Moravia-Silesia.
Back up automatically registered voters in the category company Responsable, all the regional finalists for the contest of the Firm of the year of Vodaphone, which had answered the questionnaires in attachment of the document for the inscription and had returned it to the organizer before August 15th.
The answers badly filled or incomplete in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the contest by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the firms in string had not answered the questions, they could not take part in the contest of the Responsable firm but were not disqualified "a principal" contest the Firm of the year of Vodaphone."
"The independent inscriptions are not possible because it is about a subcategory of the principal contest of the Firm of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison&amp\;Rose.
The Funds for the Grounds with Plzen, the police carried out arrests during a public contest
In the building of the Funds for the Grounds with Plzen, the police anti-corruption carried out arrests these last days.
The detectives passed the handcuffs to the entrepreneur local and trading in Lubos real estate. G.
This one had endeavoured to precisely handle a public invitation to tender for the regulation of a request for restitution in such a way that the ground proposed is obtained by a determined candidate.
This one was to pay in Lubos G. a half million crowns.
"For the moment I can only confirm that the police continues a person for offense of initiate within the framework of a public invitation to tender and a concour." for the Pravo newspaper the chief of the Parquet floor of Plzen Antonie Zelena declared, knowing that it is interdict to provide more explanations because the investigation is in hand.
The police officers gave after 12 midnight this 46 year old entrepreneur in freedom.
To know how it could influence a public contest, one can only speculate in view of if few official information.
With a question of Pravo, the spokesperson of the Funds of the Grounds Lubomira Cerna indicated that the police officers had really carried out an arrest with Plzen on a separate workplace and, this, during the public contest.
"It was about a customer and to in no case of an employee, she specified.
The public contest according to Cerna has as true name "Call to propose rights for the transfer of grounds according to the Law on the ground" and is set up when several profit candidates of right appear.
"These people propose, within the framework of the call, a higher value of their rights to resitutions which must be regulated before the value of the ground is announced."
"According to the rights suggested a classification of the purchasers is set up and the Funds of the Grounds transfers then the ground to the person who proposed the highest rights," explained the spokesperson of the Funds.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, information concerning the people who had been registered with the call and as it is itself, also, a person bénéficiare because having bought a large number of rights to restitutions, it had proposed to the candidates with the ground not to take part in the contest.
And it undoubtedly boxed by the fact of withdrawing itself.
What would explain why it had such an amount of money in its possession at the time of its interpellation.
Lubos G. had contacts largely above standards in FdT (Funds of the Grounds).
It appeared in the business of the ex-chief of FdT Vaclav Sankot which was continued with penal to have to publish grounds for which one had already published the decision of installation of a construction.
Precisely Lubos G. had obtained for example grounds intended for the construction of public communications, concretely in place and place where was to be built the artery of access to the industrial park of Borske Pole.
Later it exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historical center of the city whose value is higher by far.
The town hall was obliged to accept because if not it was likely to put construction in danger by a blocking of the grounds.
The households will monthly pay a supplement of a hundred crowns for housing.
The households will have to starting from January pay a supplement not only for all the types of energy but also for water and the cleansing, the supplies of heating and with certain places the rents will also increase.
The families will have to thus draw starting from January from their purse to a hundred crowns monthly more than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, the gas of almost 2 percent more expensive, in certain localities you will have to pay until a tenth moreover the supply of water and in many places the supplies of central heating will be also more expensive.
The increase in electricity should annually border for the households in apartment the 100 crowns moreover than currently.
However all the suppliers decreased the prices of electricity being given the significant development to encourage the manufacturing of renewable energies, in particular the photovoltaic piles.
The gas increases moderately but of course at the time when people need it most to heat and thus have greatest consumption.
One can thus also count a hundred crowns moreover.
Although electricity and the gas increase in all the Czech republic, the change of the price of the central heating differs from city downtown.
In fact mainly the largest communes plan price increase.
For example the households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay starting from January for the central heating almost 50 crowns moreover per month, the families of Libérec will pay more than 1000 crowns annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague an increase of 9 percent for water and the cleansing for the case prepares where the city increases the rents of infrastructure.
If the rents do not change the pragois will pay a supplement of 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be part of low in comparison with the entire country.
In Bohemia of north, where the prices are already part of highest, water and the cleansing increase by 7.4 percent.
The prices of the rents will increase for example appreciably in the 450 thousand apartments in hiring starting from January i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example the company CPI Byty which has in Usti nad Labem almost 2500 apartments, decided an increase up to 100 percent.
Those which will not be agreement with the new increase in the rents will be translated in front of the courts by the company.
The controlled rents that people in nearly 300 thousand apartments pay could increase the next year by 10 percent.
The Czech children saoûlent themselves with rum and the fernet. The beer is not any more mode and acts all gently.
The fernet, rum, vodka and in an exceptional way also the best whiskey mark are stolen to the parents.
They are drinks which bring generally those which is saoûlent, which is not yet fifteen years old, between the hands of the doctor.
The children who are neat at the hospital for repetition do not make the exception.
That results from the experiment of the doctors who encounter cases similar to the admissions of the departments children of the hospitals.
"The beers or the wines are not any more mode because it takes time to be drunk."
'The tendency is really with strong alcohols," indicates for Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Chef of the department children of the hospital of Horovice in central Bohemia.
"When they succeed in bating a dad bottle in the cupboard, it is about sometimes of wisky but it is the fernet and the vodka which prévalent'.
"Vodka has this advantage which they can mix it with fruit juice and thus not feel it," explains the Chief of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesperson of the Motol hospital, also agrees to him.
"In general, it is rum or fernet."
"It is today alcohol with the mode in particular in the elementary schools."
"In certain cases, it was about slivovice which they brought back from the house," Jurinova added.
According to the Head of Pélikan department, to see old drunk children from thirteen to fourteen years with the admissions at the hospital is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, it was in Motol where it precisely exerted ten years in pediatry where the ambulances brought schoolboys of the broad completely drunk surroundings.
"An young girl was thus hospitalized four times
"It acommencé its career at twelve years when it was brought with 3.5 per thousand of alcohol in blood with in more one mixture with extasy," the doctor this particularly important case described.
"It was with the Exhibition site of Holesovice to a party."
"What is interesting, it is that it did not appear odd to the mother that his/her daughter is absent 48 hours" known as astonished the Director by the Department.
It is precisely the satisfying of the parents or their tolerance out of commun run vis-a-vis the fact that their kids devote themselves to drink who are the main cause of the development of the alcoholism of the children.
According to the specialists, one does not speak however about the dependence, in his strict direction, for the children.
"Under the alcoholic term one hears a chronic dependence with the alcohol of several years with all the phenomena which result from this but that one does not find in the children."
"At those which use the acool with repetition, it is rather about a socio-family background significantly unfavourable," explained the Head of Pélikan Department.
According to the Jurinova spokesperson, approximately forty drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the private clinic of pediatry in Motol.
Are integrated in stastistic only the cases with a grâve intoxication requiring the hospitalization.
The drunk children who are after the care urgently brought back on their premises by the parents or the police, are not counted.
In addition to the cases of the children who assoient and drink an alcohol bottle after the school, it exsite according to Pélikan three seasonal waves which one can take into account: the day of the witches, it holy Sylvestre and the school end of the year.
"Either they drink by spite after bad results or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of the vacancies."
"Of course I lived at the day of the witches an admission of 7 drunk children at a stretch," Pélikan underlined.
The drunk child who spent the night to the hospital in desintoxciation under medical control is paradoxically in better position than that which returned at his place and suffers the following day from the "hangover."
The headaches of the morning caused by a dehydration and a lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion from glucose and nutritive elements which the organization needs.
"They for that are parcelled out better since they pass an excellent evening then a soft alarm clock and nothing hurts them."
"They are only astonished by the place where they are," Pélikan knowing adds that from time to time that wastes the good mood of the patients at least with the note to be paid for their care.
Transport by ambulance and the hospitalization on bed of intensive care can go until tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I applied that as a means of education including to these children how much their intoxication cost and than they could spend all the summer in seasonal work to refund only one evening," Pélikan added.
However, according to him, the insurance companies of health in their managements in regression, which should recover on behalf of the parents the loads related to the care, do not treat the cases of drunk children.
Two L-159 planes are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two L-159 planes of the five in all, against which the Ministry for Defense exchanged planes of transport Casa C-295M, took off Tuesday for Seville in Spain where seat the manufacturer of Put-EADS planes.
It is the first time that apparatuses of this type become the property of someone else that the Czech army.
They however were abroad within the framework of exercises or flights of demonstration.
They is the two-seater versions of the L-159T1 which was until now in service in the Czech army and which was in a state of vol.
Lestrois remaining apparatuses are single-seat versions of L-159.
Those station for the moment at Aéro Vodochody and the trade intermediary - the Omnipol firm - took into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the department of press of the Ministry for defense, the physical departure of the planes of Vodochody is for the unknown moment.
'The planes L-159 single-seaters planned for the exchange were taken on planes stored for a long time without that not causing additional loads or investments for the Ministry for defense."
"The two-seaters L-159 T1 were exchanged in the state," declared for Pravo Pejsek.
It has tournament which the army will not remain without two-seater since the ministry signed in May 2009 with Aéro Vodochody an agreement of a value of 200 million crowns for the transformation of four unutilised L-159 single-seaters in the two two-seaters.
The army took delivery of the first apparatus in July, the second being envisaged with the delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS committed itself introducing the planes into the equipment of certain countries of Alliance.
"In the contract it is clearly indicated that which takes the L-159 planes in account is EADS and which they will be used for the pilot training of member countries of NATO."
"It is consequently the business of that which takes into account to determine how to carry out that," Pejsek indicated.
Hospodarske noviny announced, some time ago, that the Spanish army is not interested by L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a plane Put and the purchase of three other planes for 3.5 billion crowns was ratified last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The ministry for defense did not launch an invitation to tender and contacted EADS directly.
the direction of defense argued whereas the exchange ensures a future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought in Aéro Vodochody 72 apparatuses and does not use any which 24, wanting to sell the remainder.
The purchase of Casa planes will probably have legal implications.
the European Commission however carried felt sorry for against the Czech ministry of defense near the European Court of justice because the planes should have been selected within the framework of an invitation to tender on a European scale and have in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army already took delivery of three planes Casa, the last should arrive on the airport of Prague Kbely in two weeks.
An index longer than the annular one is a weak sign of risk of cancer
The men who have the index longer than the annular one are exposed at the less risk to have a cancer of the prostate.
It is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
That can depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our conclusions show that the relative length of the finger is used as simple test of risk of cancer of the prostate, in particular for the men before 60 years," the joint author of the study Ros Eeles proclaimed, professor at the Institute for research on cancer at the university of Warwick.
The finger could thus help to determine which men should subject themselves to the test of the cancer of the prostate, in particular while combining with the genetic risk or other factors aggrâvants like the family antecedents of health, added Eeles.
For the period of 1994-2009 it followed with her colleagues to the United Kingdom more than 1500 patients reached of a cancer of the prostate and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More half of the participants under investigation had the index of the right hand shorter than the annular one.
For them as for the 19 percent of those which had the fingers same length, one found the same probability of a cancer of the prostate.
In the case of those which had the index longer than annular the risk however fell to 33 percent, for the men before 60 years the reduction in the risk reached 87 percent.
The report length of the two quoted fingers - formed for the antenatal period - indicates in particular levels different of sex hormones to which the child in the uterus is exposed.
With less of testosterone corresponds a longer index.
Preceding research had shown that it is precisely the testosterone which development assistance of a cancer of the prostate.
Professor Vacla Paces, famous Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Science, said for CTK which it is with the current of this study but that it does not seem to him, appears it, that the relation between the length of the fingers and cancer "is completely shown."
The Czech Republic is under snow, the highways D1 and D5 is closed.
Tchéquie as most Europe this is covered Thursday morning by snow.
On the roads and the pavements, there is compact snow most of the time, the déblayeurs worked all during the night in many places.
The D5 highway is closed the morning between the 89ème and the 93ème kilometer in the direction of Rozvadov because of several accidents of trucks and cars and the auroute D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague undergo the same fate.
The dispatcher of the Automobile central club (UAMK) said it to information
With the 91ème kilometer a truck was broken, with the 93ème two heavyweights were struck, the accident made casualties.
Several cars were also found in the ditch.
The problems are also on the D1 highway with the 185 ème kilometer in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks were struck there
The drivers should leave just after Brno to the 190ème kilometer or go by Brno and enter then to the 182ème kilometer in Kyvalka.
A file of cars of several kilometers was formed at this place.
Also on the D11 highway, there is an accident and, this, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow of several centimetres thickness, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Files of cars are created for example in Prosek, the street Sterboholska is also stopped.
The surest means of transport are the subway.
The trams are delayed for example on the line between the Place Charles (Karlove Namesti) and the Place of peace (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning the staff of crisis of Prague must still meet.
The railways and the airport also encounter problems.
The Czech Railroads already had to remove because of snow 7 connections of rapids.
The lines for example of Prague with Kralupy or of Prague with Beroun have problems
The travellers should control the current situation.
The airport of Ruzyne was closed since Wednesday the 11th h00 in the night up to 5 hours of the morning.
Most roads in Southern Moravia east already roulable but by redoubling vigilance.
On the road of Vyskov, three service roads are impracticable, on the road of Brno there starts to be with places of the gusts of snow and on the road of Blansko the chains are obligatory to pass certain transportation routes in the places placed higher.
The area of Vyskov was part of the most touched places.
Until now the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
Perhaps to clean them it will be necessary to send the déneigeuses ones and strawberries to snow.
One cannot for the moment estimate when they will be roulables.
On the road of Hodonin prudence is of rigor in the area of Carpathes white.
On the roads which are, in view of protection of nature, maintained only by sprinkling inert products, there is all the same a layer of 5 centimeters of snow informs CTK.
In Tchéquie, it fell between two to 10 centimeters of snow\; it fell more in Bohemia of north, with, often, up to 18 centimeters of snow.
Into the area of Moravia-Silesia, it fell up to 15 centimeters of snow.
Snowing up disappears in Tchéquie gradually.
American has a new "intelligent weapon"
The American army sent in Afghnistan a new "intelligent" weapon, only known under the name of code XM-25.
The generals think that this new automatic rifle will affect the conflict over there with the Talibans and "will change the play" with their profit.
The new weapon is like a precise super gun
Its projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of a few meters.
The special ammunition of gauge 25 mm developed for this rifle and containing an explosive highly breaking, function in fact like small grenades.
One can program the ammunition in such a way that they will explode in contact with the target but also at any point of their ballistic trajectory.
One can thus use it against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a ditch.
It is not protected either from in top and when fall to him a fatal rain above from steel glares, that can also put it out of combat.
According to Richard Audette who took part in the development of the XM-25, new rifle is the first weapon of infantry which uses "intelligent" technology.
"The soldier makes use of it primarily in such a way that it finds the target, sends a laser beam to him who determines the distance, thus obtains a point of precise aiming, according to which it corrects his aiming site and supports on the relaxation.
"Let us say that you aimed at 543 meters."
"When you press the relaxation, the weapon takes care and draws with the distance of 543 meters more or less 1,2,3 meters, indicated Audette.
400 delocalized employment
The Fujitsu group delocalizes its subsidiary of Bad Homburg towards Frankfurt.
The next year in July, 400 collaborators will transfer to Astro Park their workplace which is currently at the office building of the Mareinbader Place in the area of Bad Homburg.
The Japanese group Fujitsu delocalizes its branch of Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As affirmed it Wednesday the giant specialized in the manufacturing and the maintenance of the computers, the next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located until now on the Marienbader place of the town of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, immense complex of offices located on the street Lyoner Straße of the Niederrad District of Frankfurt.
A spokesperson of Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, the group should gather there 100 other employment still scattered up to now in the area.
The offer of hiring was extremely gravitational. In addition, the offices with open surface of Astro Park are appropriate better for the work method of the collaborators.
In Bad Homburg also, Fujitsu was right tenant.
The chief executive officer, Bernd Wagner, declared: "Frankfurt-Niederrad constitutes for us a paramount site having a remarkable infrastructure."
He affirms that connection to the airport is precisely of great importance for a total company like Fujitsu.
The new removal of an important company inside the area caused the joy of the winners yesterday and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The person in charge of the economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), declared that once again, a "planetary actor" had been thus conquered.
It is a "extraordinary relative profession of faith instead of establishment."
Fujitsu is appropriate for the city and its establishment constitutes an important dash for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (greens), regrets the decision of Fujitsu.
The direction very early informed the municipality of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we proposed our assistance to this company," Mr. Korwisi declared.
However, the friendly relations could not anything have changed with the difficulties of the computer maker vis-a-vis the owner of the building of the Marienbader Place.
In the final analysis, the economic reasons would have been determining.
It is a question from now on of preventing that a so exceptional place does not remain unoccupied for a long time.
"I have the hope that the owner and financial backer of the building will be co-operative."
Ten years ago, the building of the Place of the Town hall, used up to now by the company Fujitsu and "small the close vertical," as well as the remainder of the buildings of the Marienbad Place, were part of the discussed construction project of the spa.
Fruit of a joint project of the municipality and a private developer of projects, a new entry of the city was created between the station and the Town hall. This one caused many criticisms, not only because of the impressive installation of surfaces which were used formerly partly as carpark, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the company of notation and councils in investment, Feri, the computer maker for the delivery systems of the voyages, Start Amadeus, like Fujitsu, computer maker at the time still associated with Siemens, moved in the buildings.
In 2006, the German group of Frankfurt specialized Immobilien-Chancen repurchased the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the funds real estate Morgan Stanley. One year later, these buildings were resold at the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group whose seat is in Tokyo regards as the third larger supplier of data-processing products in the world.
For example, it puts computers and waiters at the disposal of companies and also ensures the essential service.
Its branch established in the area of the Rhine-Hand is one of most important in Germany: Fujitsu counts undoubtedly much more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leave Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries present in this site are Fujitsu Services and a named company TDS.
For that, 7000 square meters took in hiring in the building Astro Park.
This old twenty years complex, whose name points out its outline drawing of star, shelters inter alia the seat of the Confederation of the electronics industry and electrotechnical.
Expulsion of the waiter by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks has difficulty more and more.
Service provider Internet Amazon expelled of his waiters the specialized site in the revelation of confidential documents.
Perhaps this attitude hiding place political pressures undergone after the publications of the hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, remains apparently in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is attacked with always more force.
The group of cyber-activists "Wikileaks" does not have any more access to its waiter lodged up to now in America and seeks from now on a shelterer in Europe.
During this time, the eminent American Senator, Joe Lieberman, called the other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is sought by Interpol, probably remains in Great Britain, according to the information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded from the Amazon waiter."
"Freedom of expression with the country of freedom," (standard time) the cyber-activists indicated Wednesday at the origin of the revelations via the Twitter social network.
Little before, the cyber-company, Amazon, had removed the documents of Wikileaks of its waiters.
After the publication of the secret diplomatic notes, the cyber-activists had recourse to the Service Web of Amazon (AWS) in order to be able to reach more a large number of access to the documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Formidable, our dollars from now on are spent to deal with people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem with Amazon, "they should cease selling books."
The CNN TV channel, quoting the office of Mr. Liebermann, reported that Amazon prohibited Wikileaks from using its waiters after the investigation conducted by the collaborators of the senator Joe Lieberman.
The president of the commission of the Senate for the protection of the territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott in his opposition, reported the British newspaper, "The Guardian."
"I would have wished that Amazon takes this measurement earlier in view of preceding publications by Wikileaks of classified as information" affirmed the senator.
In parallel, Mr. Liebermann invited the other countries to refuse the use of the waiters by the platform.
"Wikileaks acts in an illegal, monstrous way and without scruples. By doing this, it puts our national security in danger and danger the life everywhere throughout the world," according to an independent official statement of the senators.
"No company conscious of its responsibilities, that it is American or foreign, should help Wikileaks to diffuse the contents of the stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is sought by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, figure on the list of people sought by Interpol.
According to information disseminated by the London newspaper "Independent The," the 39 years Australian lives in the United Kingdom and Scotland Yard knows exactly where it is it.
The cyber-activist constantly qualified intrigues orchestrated by his detractors the legal actions in his opposition by Sweden.
The spokesperson of Wikileaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, declared in London that threats were uttered against the site.
"Appeals were even launched for the murder of Julian Assange."
This is why Assange fears particularly for its safety, declared Hrafnsson.
It is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson reacted obviously to the statements made in North America.
In America, the former republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, required that the persons in charge of the revelations made by Wikileaks be continued and is carried out for treason.
In Canada, the adviser of the Head of government Mr. stephen Harper declared on television, obviously in an ironic way, that Mr. Assange should "be killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a Drone."
During this time, a polemic started between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesperson of the US president, Mr. Barack Obama, qualified the "ridiculous one and absurdity" the fact that Mr. assange required the resignation of the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if this one were responsible for the order given to the diplomats, and revealed very recently, to devote himself to activities of espionage.
"I do not know exactly why we must deal with the opinion of individual owner of Web site," Mr. Gibbs declares.
"Our foreign politics and the interests of this country are much more important than the assertions of a Web site."
The US government completely passes from now on to the test bench the protection of its databases.
According to an official statement of the White House, Mr. Russell Through, assistant editor of the Center of the fight anti-terrorist, were named responsible to fight against the escapes.
Mr. Through is charged to set up "the structural reforms necessary" made essential after the disclosures of the diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the will to check the means by which all the administration exchanges and protects the information.
Moreover, the US government announced that he wanted to deal with the safety of the dissidents and the militants if ever those were threatened by the revelations of Wikileaks.
"We very implemented to make contact with them" indicated the spokesperson of the State Department, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if that proves to be necessary."
The university of the Ice
At the "Gelato university" of Bologna, one prepares the confectioners of ice at the best seasons of the year.
The introductory course three days organized for the future glaciers had a very great success and attracted visitors come from everyone whole.
With does the fact, from which come all the ice?
Glacier and machine with ice.
The glacier, i.e. in German the confectioner of ice somewhat become old-fashioned, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of manufacturing of the ice.
The turbine with ice removes the cream of ice of the window cooled using a spatula, lays out it in waffle and then starts to sell it.
For the knowledge, one does not need to go in Anzola dell' Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wishes to know some more about the ice, cannot avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of the ice-cream freezers founded the university of ice in 2003 so that the creams of ice left its machines answer the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The introductory course three days organized for the future glaciers had a very great success and attracted visitors come from everywhere in the world.
Are also offered special courses relating to the chocolate ice and extending over several days. In the same way, of the practical meetings are organized in the private mirror factory.
In full midlife crisis, a certain number of people dream of a new career, others simply go so far as to carry out their burning desire on the smooth ice.
This time, they are 40 participants come from 19 country of all the continents, of Brazil in Saudi Arabia via Hungary.
Jacky, professor of education artistic come from California is set on the movement Slow Food. He wants in the future to offer a European product of quality to the country of the industrial Ice.
Anke of Berlin east adviser in business management and it wants, after a few years, to draw some thing from singular of this trade testing for the nerves.
Two young Egyptian women dream to open a mirror factory in Cairo.
A man originating in Malta and another come from Brazil would like to improve quality of the ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian cleaning lady came because his/her children adore the Italian ice creams.
The main glacier Luciano Ferrari initially explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ices.
Is determining not only good savor, but also the silky flexibility and good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the formation icing on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, the south: "The Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still preserves one crowned amount of romanticism."
The first stage in the manufacturing appears completely simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, dried milk, sugar and stabilizers in a large mixer which heats all with 85 degrees grace an electronic program, then cools immediately with four degrees.
It opens then a tap installed on the machine: it leaves a pasteurized basic white cream there, base of all the kinds of ices to milk.
The trainer is assailed at once by question: Is it possible to manufacture ice by using only natural substances without stabilizer?
How can one give free course to the personal pleasure of the experimentation?
Mr. Luciano warns against the fact of letting itself induce in error by the spirit of time.
That which speaks only about the ices "manufactured starting from the natural ingredients," perhaps in spite of that used of the stabilizers: generally a natural product, for example of the flour of seed of guar obtained starting from bean of guar.
It is obviously possible to manufacture ice without using of stabilizer, only it should be sold within a period of 12 midnight, if not it crumbles and the customer will anything else crunch only granules of ice.
Certain modifications of the basic mass are allowed.
That becomes more enthralling with the flavors.
The Master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients which one acquires in the ray fruits or confectioneries of the supermarket.
Moreover, there exists powder and pastes.
"the suppliers will try all to give you dozen aromatized ingredients."
"However, you should quite simply test."
Maybe in the receipts of sorbets to the fruits with fresh sugar and fruits.
Maybe in the ice creams manufactured starting from the basic mass white which, while adding of eggs becomes a yellow cream and constitutes to it, when one adds cocoa powder to it, the base of all the possible desserts to the chocolate.
Now, all the participants in the course must pass to the use of the machines to ice.
Luciano from time to time invites them to manufacture four kinds of ices: with vanilla, with the chocolate, the mocha coffee and hazel nut with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less of flavor of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
The various kinds of ices to the fruits are also subjected to the same experiment.
More aromatic substances, more fruit mashed potatoes: from the point of view of the taste, that is not absolutely better.
The ice with hazel nuts inevitably does not comprise the taste of nut, when it is composed mainly of hazel nuts.
The ice with kiwi, very popular, is manufactured starting from the group using more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mixture correctly raises the taste of an ice," Luciano affirms.
The manufacturing of the ice is a exercise of calculation: if one uses mashed potatoes of fishing with much of sugar, it is necessary that the quantity of sugar is reduced in the basic receipt.
A sugar supplement is necessary for the ice to lemon.
Luciano presents an apparatus with which it determines the sugar content of the various types of fruits (the vine growers make use of it to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate calculations.
The manufacturing of the ice does not require any more, like formerly, as much of physical intervention.
It is not only the automatic manufacturing machine tool of the basic mass which helps.
There exists also an apparatus in which one beats simultaneously the mixture of ice available to return it smooth and brought back to negative temperatures.
In spite of all automations, light breakdowns are not excluded.
Brazilian Gustavo smears fruit mashed potatoes of the head to the feet and, thus, splashes his/her fellow students when the control of the colossal mixing bowl escapes to him.
The Master Luciano thinks that a "similar incident is likely to occur at the time of each course: it is only one question of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to certain sources, the industry which tests the culture of the genetically modified plants cored the European Food Safety Authority.
This charge is now formulated by the Testbiotech group of expert which is regarded as an institute independent for the evaluation of the consequences of biotechnology.
"That sounds like a theory of the conspiracy, but us informed well," declared Wednesday in Munich Mr. Christoph Then, Directeur of Testbiotech.
Certain information mentions what the president of the Efsa group of expert for the genetically modified plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, as of other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi lobby.
This last is financed by the groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper collaborated in a way determining in the development of the regulations of test of Efsa for the genetically modified plants and is, so clearly in a conflict situation of interests, according to criticisms formulated by Mr. Then.
The elaborate regulations correspond textually, by subparagraphs, to the standpoint of the Ilsi lobby and thus carry the mark of the industry which, at the bottom, would be controlled by the authorities installed in Parma in Italy.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech denounces a conflict of interest.
A person in charge of high ranking of Efsa recently joined without condition or transitional period the agroalimentary group Swiss Syngenta. By doing this, It changed camp
Little time ago, even the Radio of Germany Centrale (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the authority of the European Union in charge of control and the industrial lobby, which woke up the suspicions as well German Federal agency for the environment as of the European deputies.
However, Efsa does not admit the existence of any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that one exploits all the reliable data, including those of industry as long as they are of a professional good quality.
One does not prohibit to the experts working on behalf of Efsa to tie contacts with this branch of industry.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the international institute for the life sciences (International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi) based in the United States.
This organization regards itself as a neutral forum gathering the experts who belong, inter alia, with the field of sciences, industry and the policy in order to evaluate the risks of biotechnology without being in the pay of a lobby.
In this business, independent experts such that Mr. Then disapprove the fact that the genetically modified plants are accepted without any test of food in the animals and that one did not test the impact of these plants on the environment.
"We wish to know which are, for example, the incidences of genetically modified corn causes with the field" affirms Mr. Then.
The current practice consists in testing only isolated proteins and not all the seedling genetically modified, which does not make it possible to get reliable results.
"If the risks are not sought, how can one then discover them?" wonder Mr. Then about an accusing tone.
It is also the point of view of Mrs. Angelika Hilbeck.
This scientist carries out research since 1994 in the field of the genetics and currently works at the polytechnic school of Zurich.
In this area as in the United States, and from now on also in Europe, the sector of industry tries more and more to influence or discredit the critical scientists.
This is why, there exist hardly still researchers who are not related to companies.
In the opinion of company, the critical studies would not be published.
Mrs. Hilbeck affirms that "industry controls research on safety."
The stone trace
Uli Gsell got some, on the whole approximately 400 kilo.
Monday afternoon, it was in front of the station of Stuttgart with its tube with the back.
There was demo.
It snowed.
The history is known: In September, the general purpose excavators and had started had suddenly demolished most of the northern wing.
The world of Stuttgart was not any more the same one: Several thousands of people expressed against the project S21, the transformation of the central station of Stuttgart into an underground station which will cost several billion.
Most of the wing was in ruins when the demonstration led to the stoppage of the works of construction.
Broken in 6000.7000 pieces.
Muschelkalk (shelly limestone) of Crailsheim, a tender paving stone and coarse evil builds between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43 year old sculptor residing at Ostfildern.
It got some fragments of them.
"These stones are relics."
"They should not disappear."
He declares with enthusiasm: "a rock modest and cheap, simple and terrestrial."
It affirming that by cutting out it with the saw, he felt the odor of the cigarette smoke.
It does not know yet what it will do of this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell too.
the traces of the stones of Stuttgart lead to an old ammunition dump of the French Army in a forest located close to Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built its stone empire.
This 44 year old man makes the trade of old stones.
It bought all the stones resulting from the demolition to Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or if they disappear in the discharge" declares it in its office located in a hut, which was formerly a guardroom.
He tells that he was the object of insults and of threats when in September the newspapers reported that he had buys the remainder of the northern wing to the demolition contractor.
But it negotiated during whole days with the adversaries of the S21 project.
And he explained to them why he could nothing make whole to be opposed to the demolition.
And if it takes place, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue to use the stones.
Approximately 200 adversaries of the S21 project carried one of the stone parallelepiped thereafter weighing on average 80 kilos whose value lies between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keeps it like remembering in while also hoping to be able to return it during a rebuilding.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 loadings complete of a truck.
Approximately half is still piled up in the forest, the remainder being for a long time sold.
Owners of gardens, landscape gardener, Private individuals.
They came from everywhere and carried all that could enter the trunk and the trailers.
These stones of scandal of Stuttgart were transformed for a long time into "Mäuerle" or limitations of the grass plat bands.
"With the fact, this stone is nothing in particular" says Mr. Rongen.
"have-be this political component."
It enters its cross-country car, makes the turn of its vast empire of 20 hectares.
It made studies of right which it gave up. Later, he undertook to study biology before being interested thereafter in data processing and to become finally a carrier.
And a stone amateur.
It stores 40000 tons.
It piles up treasures in Germany everywhere.
HE affirms that he is the largest merchant of the old stones.
It is held back.
Sand stones carved with art are posed on snow.
"Formerly, They belonged to the bridge of Marienbrücke to Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, heat, he affirms with enthusiasm.
"My preferred stone."
He sets off which goes up through the forest.
It shows a heap of the finger: Red sand Pierre, before, left the station of Karlsruhe.
And so on.
"Pretty travertine."
The parallelepiped was formerly part of the platform of Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of the stones and the stories, the travertine of Cannstatt coming from the police headquarter, the reddish granite coming from the cathedral Blasien saint, the tuff coming from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What a work, What a efforts, what a sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that formerly the stones were carved with the hand and were moved using simple hoists and of the carts drawn by beef animals, it becomes completely respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such an inheritance were put in part."
It did not become rich, even less fantastically wealthy.
But this carrier employs 14 people today. Moreover, of the stonecutters, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass-blower and a gardener settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it is gratifying," the recyclor of waste affirms.
Soon, it must go to Cologne.
Over there also, there are stones to save.
Fight of talents to conquer the high potentials
The counter knows a sharp multitude.
16 students hustle themselves to buy rolls with salmon, tomato sauce and white-mangers.
The technical university of Braunschweig and the Volkswagen car manufacturer invited the students in design and mechanical engineering with a workshop.
Within the framework of a kind of contest of ideas, they must speak trade about the car about the future with the originators of VW, and, while passing, to know the Volkswagen firm.
Nowadays, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body to body in the competition to unearth better brains and to begin, like Volkswagen, in a multiform co-operation with the universities.
Their mission: To recruit the most gifted graduates as far as possible in the amphitheaters before the latter arrive on the labor market and that they are not courted by the others.
And since the universities do not publish declarations concerning the performances of their students, one tries to locate the exceptional talents within the framework of the practical projects and the fidéliser.
At the second day of the workshop organized at the technical university of Brauschweig the automobile group persuades the talents.
A young lady of the service of staff divides the pens, of candies and the charts comprising the logo of Volkswagen.
She speaks about the calendar of the professional training courses and the student jobs to the young talents\; she shows them the ways to reach the enclosure of the group.
It is Nico Selle technical university of Braunschweig which is responsible for the project engaged with Volkswagen.
For him, there exist reciprocal advantages for the two parts: "The students make contact with this industrial sector and gain in experiment."
"As for the Volkswagen group, it can know the students, look at the serious candidates more closely and appreciate those which enter on account as a collaborator."
According to Mr. saddles, Such a co-operation is unusual.
What there is again, it is the offensive with which one seeks to attract oneself the students.
"Formerly, the emphasis was placed rather on the community project," Mr. Selle affirms.
The fight for the conquest of the new graduates will become much rougher.
In goods of the sectors, the companies cannot recruit their collaborators any more by carrying out a sorting on a string of candidates.
But they must praise their reliability and especially court the highly qualified labor.
They are especially the graduates from the sectors of engineering which are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German engineers VDI, more than 40,000 posts of engineers remained unoccupied in October.
And according to the forecasts of the VDI, the vacuum relating to the posts of engineer will still increase.
Roman Dykta goes to hunting to the talents on behalf of KPMG, cabinet of audit, accountancy and council.
It organizes expensive events aiming to the recruitment of the talents, as for example the race cruising KPMG-Race, a species of rally-paper where the competitors must find their way using the GPS coordinates.
The company will thus send eight promising students the next year so that they traverse this way the United States.
The participants can incidentally visit the subsidiaries of KPMG and know the company.
That which must take part in it decides in advance after two procedures of selection.
Only the cream of the cream of the many candidates will fly away for the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used for the search of the high potentials in the universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the batch thanks to the race cruising."
"For us, a simple cruising was not enough thing"
For the hunter of talents which is Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
"Until today, we stayed in touch with all the people having taken share last year with a similar action."
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and wish to address soon their requests to our company." affirm it.
Apart from the direct softening carried out in the campus, the small and medium-size companies proceed in a completely traditional way while taking part in the professional fairs where they are delivered to hunting for the brains.
"We try to reach the graduates while taking part in the trade shows."
"For example, with the living room of solar technologies," indicates Mrs. Sitha Stübe, director of human resources at Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This company installed in Bonn employs approximately 1500 people in Germany.
Mrs. Stübe is aware of the problems related to the changing.
Currently, 35 stations are put at the competition based on the site of the company.
"In this moment, it is very difficult to provide with the vacant posts."
"Is That expensive and takes much time," does ensure?
Another means of establishing the contact consists in passing through the professors of university.
Solarworld established a co-operation with various higher education educational establishments, for example, the university of Freiburg.
"The professors indicate that the student has the possibility of carrying out professional training courses or on our premises to write its project of end of study."
Expensive publicity campaigns are announced in the specialists in the solar one.
Therefore the company tries to make its publicity by putting forward other qualities: personalized environment, hierarchy punt and easy communication.
"Often, a great group cannot do that," supports Mrs. Stübe, personnel officer.
A long time ago that the money does not hold any more the main role in the job search.
The flexible work hours, the child care or of good possibilities of promotion constitute the other determining factors.
According to a study conducted by the institute Great Places to Work, Solarworld occupies the 55e place among the 100 best employers of Germany.
The institute constitutes an annual honnor roll of the German employers.
For this purpose, he questions the collaborators on their satisfaction degree compared to their work and to his context while looking at the condition-frameworks of the employees.
The personnel officer Mrs. Stübe hopes that this placement will make it possible to raise the image of the company near the job-seekers.
"I think that the candidates rely especially on the external evaluations with regard to a potential employer," she declares.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German academy DEBA (Deutscher To employ Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises the companies which wish to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises with his customers to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, that means above all to take internal measures.
"The best means for an employer of making itself gravitational is to pass through his/her clean collaborators," he affirms.
That is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal strategy of image, i.e. the creation of the brand image of the employer within his own manpower.
"the satisfied collaborators train the best messengers."
When his employees well are treated and that they are identified with the company, they make only the publicity of their employer near their friends and knowledge.
"It is as if one played in an orchestra," Mr. Kriegler declares.
Obama applies a brake at new oil drillings
There will not exist new oil drillings in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, State of the south-east of the United States, during years to come.
The government of Washington pronounced a prohibition an equivalent prohibition and, thus, definitively cancelled its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, of new drillings remain for the moment prohibited.
The secretary inside Ken Salazar made this announcement Wednesday.
It is the explosion, in April, of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" which is at the origin of this strict prohibition. This one must remain into force at least for the five next years.
Vis-a-vis this accident which with costed the life of eleven employees and conduit the greatest environmental catastrophe of the United States, President Barack Obama, subjected to the pressure of the opposition and this branch of industry, had indicated that it was laid out to authorize the realization of new drillings in the oriental party of the Gulf of Mexico.
The partisans of this solution want to thus reduce the dependancy of the United States with respect to the foreign countries as regards the supply oil.
The question of knowing which takes the responsibility for the oil slick devastator in the golf, so far, is not definitively solved.
The British oil group, which is confronted with compensation requests of several billion, is in the center of the charges.
A committee of inquiry created by Obama must report her in December.
In October, the secretary inside Ken Salazar had raised the freezing of the drilling issued after the explosion of the platform.
Following this decision, various oil groups had at once presented requests relative to new projects of drilling.
With more strict control measures and more severe security instructions, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new catastrophe.
The qualified controlling authority, which was discredited after many accusations of corruption, currently is the object of reform in-depth.
In parallel, Mr. Obama announced would remove them the lucrative tax loopholes of the gas and oil groups.
The actors of this branch of industry publicly warn from now on against the fact that the rate of feed in the gulf would be definitely lower than it is not the case until now.
"The objective of the government is to put a brake at the rapid growth of the sector of gas and oil" according to the result of a survey current carried out in the sector by the cabinet of audit BDO, before the prohibition of drilling pronounced Wednesday.
Moreover, American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty which characterizes this sector: "Nobody knows what will change exactly with the regulation."
The investments agreed in new projects of support were deferred until new order, to the detriment of the growth.
The Ogoni country is dry
The water which runs in the rivers is oiled brown\; it releases an odor similar to that which exists in the petrol station: Because of an escape, billion liters of crude oil destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
The men live of flight, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"You do not exhaust," the militant ecologist launches to the journalists to calm them: "You still today enough oil mud in front of the duckweed."
The 37 year old Nigerian tried to photograph a young person inserted in muddy water to the chest, as well as the fatty trail which surrounds it: This scene seems almost beautiful in the water glare to the color of the rainbow.
One cannot realize that the basement abounds in brown crude oil tablecloths.
On bank of the Bodo-Jetty river, Esther Badom tells that, formerly, it collected shrimps by whole buckets here.
But meanwhile calm water completely dried up.
Five years ago, an enormous quantity of oil spouted out of a pipeline having exploded in the immense marsh.
The fishermen living the small town close to Bodo must from now on row during six hours to reach full of fish water: The Ogoni country located in the middle of the Delta of Niger is regarded as one of the areas most polluted in the world.
All the extent of the devastations jumps to the eyes when one traverses the marshes of mangrove swamp crossed by rivers.
Instead of a clear water, the motor boat splits a water chestnut cradingue. Whoever plunges its hand there withdraws it very covered with oil.
Roots of small of the emergent mangrove swamp of the ground like sticks of liquorice. The isolated palm trees sadly let hang their palms.
One seeks the clouds of birds in vain, like one usually meets some in the wetlands: As soon as outboard motor stops, a ghostly silence falls down on this paradise of formerly which resembles a service station by the odor that it releases.
"What occurs here, it is war against the environment" declares Mr. Celestine Akpobari of a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger with regard to health."
The comparison of the wars is made.
The area where live Ogoni is a battlefield besieged since of tens of years: There is more than 60 years, the first explorers European penetrated here\; the first resistance was organized in the years 1980 by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. this one was carried out later. In 1993, the Shell group had to stop its production activities in this area because those had become very dangerous for its employees.
Today still, the return to the Ogoni country is interdict at this company: Whereas more than 2 million oil barrel are daily pumped thanks to more than 5000 wells of drilling and 7000 kilometers of pipelines in the whole of the area of the Delta, three times large like Switzerland, the oil-bearing fields of the Ogoni country are unexploited, because the situation is too unstable there for this oil group.
All the few hundred meters are drawn up in the water of the steel trestles like odd sculptures: One very affectionately indicates "Christmas trees" the heads of boreholes.
They have up to 50 years, the majority are corroded by corrosion until the reference mark.
Akpobari estimates that a head of drilling of this nature breaks of piece from time to time, because a constant crude oil flood runs in water.
According to the estimates of the experts, more than two billion liters flowed on the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the quantity of oil equivalent to that which ran out in the sea at the time of the accident of the super-tanker "Exxon Valdez" there is 21 years off Alaska, one of largest the catastrophe environmental in the history of humanity.
Who has to take the responsibility for persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the actor.
For the Shell group, the sabotage and the siphoning of the pipelines are responsible for more than 90 pourcent of pollution. The environmentalists for their part regard the explosions of the heads of drilling and the pipelines perforated as the leading causes.
In 2008, the American researcher Richard Steiner reproached the Shell group for applying to Nigeria of the safety standards primarily less strict than everywhere else in the world: Only the failure rate of the conduits is "still much higher than alleures."
Certain forms emergent of the mangrove swamps at a place which, considering by far, resembles a workshop given up, full of dirty oil and installed with the free air: They are completely naked and dirty oil covers to the neck.
A fire scintillates under one of the many barrels which sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without reason on the site must be reference mark: a small clandestine refinery.
One makes heat crude oil in the barrel during several hours, explains Michael, the team leader.
Initially, the petrol penetrates in a container via pipes, then, at the end of the control of the kerosene drops fall and one obtains finally diesel.
Thus Michael and his/her four collaborators daily produce four barrels of Diesel of 300 liters: "That brings back 34,000 to us Naira," approximately 22 dollars.
The inhabitants of the Delta benefit from the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil producing country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal refiners can sell at a price less expensive than that ridiculously low of hardly 40 centimes of Euro per liter of Diesel: Because they acquire their raw material free.
this one is offered by the "guards" who put the network of the pipelines in borer everywhere through the country of Ogoni. According to the experts, the country loses this manner at least 16 million liters of crude oil in the whole of the Delta of Niger.
Only a completely unimportant small portion of the raw material temporarily stored is illegally purified: The networks of the organized crime which also count among its members of the politicians and soldiers of high ranking, charge the lion's share in tankers and sell off it on the worldwide market.
The Akpobari militant considers that the bearing debate on the question of knowing if it is necessary to allot the environmental catastrophe or rather the subversive activities with the population or the mode of production laxist is purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived like intruders and if the bases of the life of the fishermen were not so deeply destroyed, there would be neither sabotage, nor flight and illegal refineries."
But, Entre-temps, the relations of Ogoni especially with respect to Shell worsened so much that it was not any more question but withdrawal of the group. "perhaps that the operators having other nationalities, like the Chinese, will appear better."
Then, Michael becomes nervous.
"It is high time that you give up" announcement the robust blue-collar worker of oil.
"The soldiers can appear constantly."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be the object of an arrest, but at most they will offer bribes to them.
Even the soldiers especially originating in the north of the country intend to benefit like all the Nigerians from the raw material.
"From any point of view, this rotten trick made fall our quite low country," Akpori regrets.
The investigators discover constructional defects in the engines of A380
A380 suffers obviously from a big security issue.
By examining an apparatus which carried out an emergency landing, the investigators discovered a possible constructional defect which can lead to "catastrophic failure of the engine."
The Qantas airline company wants to now carry felt sorry for against the manufacturer of the engine.
At the beginning of November, the passengers of the Airbus pertaining to the Quantas company had obviously had up to now more chance: During which she investigated, the Australian authority in charge of air safety noted that the engines of certain A380 apparatuses presented a serious security issue, and she warns against a possible constructional defect.
This potential failure could involve serious consequences: It can cause splits of tiredness and escapes on the level of the connection of the conduit of oil, one indicates in a standpoint published this Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could have led to a "catastrophic failure of the engines."
Are concerned the engines manufactured Rolls-Royce and equipping 20 aircraft with the A380 series.
The Airbus of the Quantas company, which had to land on November 4th in Singapore urgently, figure among those.
The Australian airline company from now on engaged of the legal proceedings against the English manufacturer of engines.
It lodged a legal complaint with an Australian federal court whose seat is in Sydney. This approach gives him the possibility of taking other legal measures against the company.
The director of Quantas, Mr. Alan Joyce, declared that its company would claim damages compared to the incident which has occurred at the beginning of November.
Parts were detached and the airfoil was damaged during the fire of the engine.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the oil ignition which is at the origin of the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 engines must now be replaced in the world.
The Australian investigators announced that other tests relating to safety will be carried out on the superjumbos which are also equipped with the engines in questions.
The recommendations of safety are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, indicated the spokesperson of the ASTB, Mr. Martin Dolan.
The security issue is regarded as sufficiently important informing all the parts concerned.
After the emergency landing of its plane, the Quantas airline company had immobilized on the ground all its fleet of A380 during one week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily immobilized three from its eleven A380.
The Lufthansa company replaced, by measure of precaution, the engine of A380.
The plane on two floors is the largest airliner in the world.
The snowfall on all the territory causes a chaos in transport
Very covered Germany of white: In one night, snow fell on almost all the country.
Chaos reigns on all the roads, the trains and the planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
The winter makes jingle Germany: By freezing temperatures, almost all the republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, which leads to chaos in many localities.
In north and the east, the cover of snow reaches 15 centimetres by places.
Circulation is strongly restricted on several highways and many roads.
On the A7 main road in Flensburg, the staff of the winter service worked in a permanent way, but they could not come to end from the snow which did not cease accumulating.
Moreover, of violent gusts swept the coast of the Baltic.
The Federal office in charge with maritime shipping and hydrography (DSH) expects it of the tidal waves take place known the Baltic coast of the Schleswig-Holstein with water level which can reach 1.2 m above the normal.
The snowdrifts on the highways and the federal roads involved serious problems in Saxony.
This is why the power station of alarm of Meteomedia bad weather announced the purple level of alarm was announced in Switzerland saxonne: in fact, it is the highest level.
By places, it fell 30 centimeters of snow there fresh that the strong winds and expenses dispersed.
Several trucks and cars remained wedged the night there.
Even in the Land of Saxony-Anhalt, the authorities of police announced serious disturbances on the roads.
On the A2 highway, snow and the wind involved an interruption of circulation and caused stoppers.
In Thuringe, the snowfalls touched the highways A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, serious disturbances of the rail traffic took place in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringe and north of Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on the railroads, the trees fallen on the railways, the destroyed overhead lines or needles.
In Saxony, one had to stop interregional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg.
In Sallfeld, in Thuringe, a train ICE bound for Munich had to stop its voyage.
The firemen and the ancillary medical ones had to supply the 165 passengers of the train in covers, food and drinks.
Winds of snow swept the roads.
The Snowfalls involved many cancellations of flight in the principal airports of Germany.
According to a spokesperson of the standard and information on the flights, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesperson of Fraport indicates that 40 flights were already cancelled in Frankfurt on the Hand.
The winter service ensures a permanent service it.
It is true that the passengers wedged with the airport are not numerous any more, in spite of that hardly 400 beds are placed there at their disposal.
Accidents occurred Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
The evening with Ostholstein, a driver of truck died at the time of a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The driver of the train was slightly wounded.
Because of the layers of snow present on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was grabbed at a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver died.
Four passengers were wounded in the train, this is why the road going from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until the early hours.
Moreover, a 30 year old woman died when its car flipped over on a slippery pavement with Aschaffenburg.
However, the meteorologists announce a good news: Snow will be certainly always soft and powdery, but it will whirl in the event of light gusts.
But, the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic will be afflicted by strong winds and rapids.
The weather is however very cold, until less 15 degrees by places.
Deutsche Bank seeks a purchaser for his twin towers.
The deutsche Bank seeks to separate from its emblem: According to the information reported by newspapers, this financial institution seeks purchasers for its two office buildings located at its head office of Frankfurt.
This building could pay up to 500 million Euro.
Deutsche Bank has just embellished the seat of the group: The twin towers located in the District of business were modernized\; in the meantime the bankers had to turn over in their old place of employment.
Henceforth, the financial group obviously seeks to recover the costs of restorations and he seeks a purchaser for his two buildings, like writes it the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland," quoting a spokesperson.
This spokesperson did not indicate the reasons of the sale envisaged.
He declared "we check if it is more interesting to occupy ourself the buildings or to sell them, and to put them again in hiring later on."
Thus the greatest financial institution of Germany already yielded its seat, little time afterwards.
It is only in the middle of year 2007 that the bank had acquired the twin towers for an amount of 272 million Euro near the holders of equities. She had then rehabilitated them.
The energy transformations aiming to optimization absorbed, according to certain indications, approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would bring back obviously much money to the bank.
According to furnished information by the newspaper, the experts of this branch of industry estimate the value of the turns, renamed meanwhile "green Towers," to approximately 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesperson, it is not currently known if the buildings will be again sold with funds belonging to the bank or an independent investor.
Thousands of people cry the minors who perished.
In New Zealand, more than 10.000 people had a thought for the buried minors who were declared died following several explosions which have occurred in a mine.
One had not been able yet to go up the bodies because the safe situation of the well disaster victim continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in Pike River Mine close to the town of Greymouth.
29 minors whose age ranges between 17 and 62 years had been buried under ground.
A probe had been introduced into the well disaster victim, but no trace of survivors had been discovered.
Because of the strong concentration of poison gazs and other explosions which followed, no rescue team could go down in the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration had considered that the minors were not likely any more any to survive.
Up to now the bodies could not by being gone up.
Today, parents and friends organized a festival in memory of deaths.
Thousands of people had gathered under a sun bursting with Greymouth in the south of the New Zealand island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 buried minors, one installed 29 tables on which one could see the names, helmets and lamps.
Photographs and personal effects, among which clothing and the boards of surfing, also had their place there.
The flags were put in Bern in front of all the public buildings of the country.
New Zealand the Prime Minister John Key declared with the participants in the commemorative festival which New Zealand nourished the hope that the minors would go up on the surface.
"But they never returned to the house."
Mr. Lawrie Drew whose Zen son was buried in the pits declared that it cannot be resigned to accept the death of his son as long as it will not have seen his remainders.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative festival.
Minors of South-African and British origin also buried during the first explosion of November 19th.
The first-aid workers started to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine of the island of the South of the Zealand News.
The prefect of police Gary Knowles explained to the journalists that when the oxyhydrogen gas masses are moved, the extreme temperatures inside the mine start to drop.
Goes in hell, warrior!
Is the Splatter film an artificial film?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the old kind thanks to his film, "Walhalla Rising," epopee of the combatant.
With which public the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn it could well think while turning "Walhalla Rising"?
A warrior Viking (Mads Mikkelsen) not having that an eye is made prisoner\; he releases himself from his torturer and, with an almost supernatural force, eliminates his adversaries the ones after the others. That seems ideal for the young male spectators in search of a bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal methods of assassination. When it is of bad mood, it tears off the intestines of its enemies without waiting until those died.
On another side, until the end of film, the one-eyed one does not say any word on its true name. Even the other characters let escape, at most, with the turning of one or two sentences some cries of anguish terrible.
If not, one says nothing and one feasts in the incredibly beautiful mountainous landscape of Scotland which constitutes the decoration of the universe of the Vikings, approximately thousand years ago.
It would be ideal more the mature scenario writers having an interest for the existentialism and the excellent dollies.
When a film aims several group-targets, it is damage that those are excluded mutually.
The director Winding Refn is considered, since the publication of "Pusher tractor," his trilogy relating to the drug trafficker savage and full with style, like a kind of Quentin Tarantinon Danish, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the current dominating or to introduce a little less brutality with the cinema of art and test.
Most sympathizers of the cinema of art must test horror vis-a-vis the brain which is spread around and with the intestines.
The avid film-goers of action die of trouble, when the one-eyed one embarks, for reasons which one can freely interpret, with a group of Christian missionaries violent one in a ship bound for Jerusalem\; they are drowned during an eternity by the calm and the fog before the crew arrives to America and continues to keep silent itself.
It is not then astonishing that "Walhalla Rising" did not find any film distributer in Germany and that there does not exist that under format DVD.
It is especially because of splendid images of the misery which deserved a certain attention, but also because the image of a palpitating film, time with other, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
They are not dialogs in this film, nor of a coherent action, all is environment, a feverish dream transformed into film.
The spectator cannot escape from it.
Refn grants hardly a moment to him of relaxation and crosses to him slowly the throat with icy images and a lugubrious soundtrack, but especially with an imperceptible hatred which spouts out heart of the characters.
Only a young fair boy, who is held accurately at the sides of the one-eyed one, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than all, the one-eyed hero whose mobiles are never known, but which returns from the hell constantly to fight enemies and temporarily allies while being transformed into warrior, is perhaps as an envoy of the devil itself.
It represents rotting, but perhaps also, only for those which are, in any way, rotted.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film which one can hate or admire, who has as a finality the irritation, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatizing experiment.
Mysterious excavation work
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications concerning a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a stand on this subject, even less to subject itself to controls of the agency.
In the night of September 5th, 2007 around midnight, at least four fighter plans F-15 I Israelis attacked a mysterious building of cubic form on the Syrian territory.
It is located on bank of the euphrate\; more the big city located in the vicinity is with 30 kilometers: it is Dair ensure.
Its name appears in the documents of the IAEA, because it is question of the engine which Syria built appears it with the assistance of the North Korea in stone parallelepiped, dissimulated in a valley marked by the absence of electric current.
According to a briefing of the intelligence services of the United States, the CIA, going back to the end of April 2008, the current, known engine under the name of the close locality, el-Kibar, would be quite ready to produce plutonium, which would make it possible to manufacture the atomic weapons.
On the other hand, this technique is valid since the years 1950.
The CIA showed a video of presentation comprising of the fuzzy satellite images.
Through the animation computer-assisted, it indicated the probable site of each component of the engine before the destruction of the power station which represents a copy in miniature of the model North-Korean of the nuclear power plant of Yongbyon.
Moreover, it presented the photographs showing the building located in the vicinity, even the interior of this one.
It seems that the engine was about to be commissioned, but he was not equipped yet with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombardment, one has hardly more information than at the time, and even, with time the mystery thickens more and more.
The former president of the United States George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories that before this attack, the CIA was certainly sure that Syria had built an engine with el-Kibar, but did not have peu' indices showing this country developed "an active program of nuclear armament."
Certain intelligence agents in Europe prefer being more careful on this subject and speak only about one "supposed engine," even if they regard the presentation of the CIA as "plausible."
They miss tangible proofs, like with the IAEA.
Questioned on the way in which it makes sure that it deals with nuclear reactor, diplomat of high ranking of the Nations Plain gave only one laconic answer in summer by affirming that the IAEA had "documents sufficient to ask questions."
The Syrians removed certainly with precipitation the debris of the "military building unutilised" and carried out a methodical flattening of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of the experts of the IAEA led by the former inspector in chief Oli Heinonen, discovered with el-Kibar uranium traces produces by the men.
Moreover, the IAEA received thanks to a Member State of the images of satellites of the commercial people receiving benefits showing the moment which followed the attack directly. it seems that these last are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photographs are not available on the market because the anonymous silent partner, perhaps Israel, acquired them of exclusiveness.
It is of this fact impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity in an objective way.
Syria always ensured that it had never carried out a secret atomic program and that it had not built an engine.
Damas supports that the uranium found on the site comes from the weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA challenged this argument after the analysis of the particles by describing it as incredible.
Since this time, Damas refuses any discussion on this subject, just like about the images of satellite.
Moreover, Syria does not make it possible to the controllers to carry out a second inspection on the site of el-Kibar and refusal the access to the debris of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But, even Israel keeps a stubborn silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in exercise at the time of the attack, recently declared: "We will never make comments on this subject."
Thus the investigation relative to this business drags on since June 2008 without one arriving to a result and that it "is transformed more and more into a serious problem of credibility of the Agency," as recognizes it a Western diplomat of high ranking in service to the head office of the IAEA in Vienna, finally he acts of a serious violation of the treaty of prohibition of the nuclear weapons.
The IAEA considers that to make progress, it is necessary to clear up the existence of the three other installations which must have "a functional relationship" with supposed the engine.
Until now, the inspectors neither indicated of which installations it acts here, nor which is their function or what one them suspect to contain.
According to the information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung," they are known within the IAEA respectively under the names of Marj have-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also of the name of the close cities.
The Institute independent Institute for Science and International Security (international institute of sciences and the international security) of Washington identified these localities and discovered on images of satellites a complex close to Masyaf which would be most probably one of the suspect objects.
It is possible that it is in a military base or directly beside this one\; it is exactly the reason for which Syria refuses the access of the three sites to the inspectors of the IAEA.
In Vienna, it is affirmed that the Syrians fear that the group of inspection is by way of spies who would be sent in the name of the United States by the IAEA in order to spy on the military installations.
To tell the truth, it is information provided by the American secret agents which drawn the attention of the nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including the satellite photos, indicating that vehicles made shuttles between the three sites and the parallelepiped of stone in order to transport substances.
A Western diplomat of high ranking declared in Vienna that at least one of the installations could "be used for the production of fuel."
It would not have "not indications concerning of the significant activities," such as the enrichment and the reprocessing of uranium\; processes which are essential to the production of the atomic weapons.
This kind of engine functions certainly thanks to uranium not enriched.
Nevertheless, there exists with the rigor of the plausible assumptions concerning the following fundamental questions: from where the uranium should have come and where one would have separated later plutonium necessary to the manufacturing from the bomb.
One is unaware of if rubble, which could hide traces of great value, were stored in the three sites.
When the hundreds of trucks charged with ground disappear, nobody will have information on the stock room of rubble.
For the IAEA, it, is not very probable that Syria made examine in 1998 the Al-Tibni salt mine, only located a few kilometres from el-Kibar, on the other side of Euphrate, to see whether it can be appropriate for the storage of the radioactive waste.
By recently analyzing pictures taken by satellite on behalf of the famous magazine Jane' S Intelligence Review, the former inspector of the IAEA, Mr. Robert Kelley established a bond between those and the engine in question.
Pictures taken by satellite show however that Syria undertook excavation work in the three sites suspect and moved enormous containers when the IAEA started to require the access to these places.
It is possible that it is a coincidence, but that did not contribute to draw aside the suspicions.
In he thinks in diplomatic circles that the IAEA spent several months to prepare a plan concerning the inspections to be carried out there. This plan was to make it possible Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only time invested watch which great interest the inspectors carry to this business.
During this time, Damas also despized this proposal.
One year ago, if the Western diplomats in Vienna had not mentioned destruction of the engine, the urgency would not be announced for this business, affirms, for example, Glyn Davies, the ambassador of the United States who has evoked for a few months what is known under the name the special inspections, one of the most powerful means the atomic Agency has to implement its controls.
The director of the IAEA, Mr. Yukiya Amano, which had to propose these inspections, already spoke certainly about "one option to which I am open in the future," but he still hesitates.
This means involves an enormous risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority with the Council of the governors of the IAEA and a good number of the 35 countries which are represented there does not want any to see the situation knowing a climbing.
in addition, as this diplomat who gives to reflect: "For that it would be used, so at the end they do not find anything"
Love in time of war
That is badly since Angelina Jolie made her beginnings in summer as a director.
She wrote the scenario itself: it is a history of love between a woman originating in Bosnia and a Serb man of origin.
One knows nothing more about this history, but that is enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serb torturer during the war with Yugoslavia.
The federations of the Bosnian women immediately protested. In answer, certain sequences of turning envisaged in Sarajevo were moved at the last minute in Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film is made to Hungary, but in the phase of post-production, the protests always continue in Bosnia.
According to the information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of the women war victims addressed a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through High Commission of the United Nations for the refugees (UNHCR) and it required to meet the actress. Pretty ambassador of good will of the UNHCR is itself.
It is not diplomatic. A few weeks ago already, it proposed to these women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but those declined this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," Hasecic affirms.
There no were stories of love in the concentration camps, and the scenario of Pretty into known as rather long on its attitude towards the victims.
Guardian reports that the organization of Hasecic has, thereafter, recommended to the High Commission of the United Nations to withdraw the quality of ambassador of good will with Angelina Jolie.
But, with the fact, which kind of Jolie scenario did she write?
The Bosnian ministry of the culture, which received copies of its scenario, granted after some hesitations an authorization of turning in Sarajevo, but one does not know why did not then come in spite of this authorization.
The young author ensures itself that she does not pursue political goals with her film, that it is by doing many efforts that she briefing herself of the Yugoslav conflict. It supports that it wants to put forward the terrible consequences of the war and to give the possibility to all the parts fascinating of being expressed.
It remains however vague about the contents.
Thus a second synopsis of film circulates on the Net. It is rather different: The in love ones knew each other well before the beginning of the war. It meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is off-set in the concentration camp Serbe where the man works as guard.
What constitutes all the same a great difference with the version "a victim of rape amourache of its torturer."
That the film of Pretty started well before the war, of course.
The pressure which is exerted on it, thus is expressed Jolie, been "unjust and founded on erroneous information."
From now on, only the fanatics of Hollywood can get peace to him: By illegally putting this scenario in the Net, like good of others before.
Let us draw!
This evening, all goes again well to the Irishmen.
no the trace of consternation.
This is why the local team excessively dominates the visitors from Sweden, from Finland and the United States.

Cian Tanner is a calm individual\; this subtle play with drinking and the reserved data processing specialist, these two behaviors really does not go well together.
And yet, in spite of that, the 26 year old young man seeks to have fun, to be diverted terebrant question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing Las Vegas does not appear in its projects. In January, it will direct job interviews in Zealand News.
"I test a strange feeling however" affirms it.
"The native land is so far and I do not have there employment."

Because as of dark prospects with the country, two of the three sisters To tan tried their chance abroad.
His/her sister Yvonne, a social worker, resides at Sydney, her Colin brother now holds a position as consultant in data processing in London.
The young people from go away: The situation of the majority of the families which live on the island resemble that of tanning.
The experts of the Research institute economic and social indicate that 100.000 Irishmen will leave soon their country.
They envisage even a number of 200.000 emigrants by 2015.
What represents an enormous loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts are carried out, it will be current of emigration comparable with that from which Ireland suffered in the years 1980.
After one decade of economic boom during which the Irishmen have enjoys a great ease, sorrow takes from now on all the place.
The economic crisis touches however especially the young Irishmen, well trained, who knew until now only moments of happiness.
The job loss and the social forfeiture appeared absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had an employment, there is money in excess.
But, meanwhile, three people out of ten less than thirty years are with unemployment.
The newspaper Irish Times abundantly publishes the letters of readers written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, all goes to the drift."
"There should be a rising against the politicians and the bankers, but that which has the possibilities of them, from goes away and our country thus a whole generation."

The student one in right Leanne Caulfield, president of the trade union of the Irish students, sees pointing a darker future because the government does nothing but throw powder with the eyes and no future prospect offers to young people.
"They reduce the minimum wages, but they do not have any strategy to create new jobs," the young person student 20 years declares.
She sees how his/her comrades studs themselves of a training course practices not paid with another.

"It is a sad and depressing thought."
However men like Stephen McLarnon to try to approach this topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the living room "WorkingAbroadExpo" which offers a support integral on the topic "to work abroad."
"But work abroad constitutes for the new ones in the profession an extraordinary occasion to take the first steps in the levels of the professional hierarchy," the person in charge affirms.
Its Web site shows the photographs of the surfers in Australia and the surfers of snows in Canada.
The message is clear: To work abroad is not a galley, but that also guarantees freedom and the pleasure.
Since six months, Seán O' Donovan, what means being based knows elsewhere.
As there was nothing any more to make in Ireland for this 29 year old engineer, it works from now on with 15 Irish colleagues in the sector of construction E Germany.
A house of mode precisely leaves ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, it will continue to work on other projects Hanover or Berlin.
Meanwhile, O' Donovan visits only seldom his land native, because it takes part in an additional work station, in order to be able to complete to refund the credit contracted to build its house with the native land.
"The situation is already a little nutcase," he affirms by crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I do not live practically any more."
It bursts of a laughter embarrassed while crossing the cold rooms.
The small house is in a residential zone with quite neat gardens of front, expensive cars of famous brands are stationed on the access roads.
Four years ago, O' Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for an amount of 380.000 Euros, financed with 100 pourcent by the credit.
"They was moments of madness, without any doubt, the money was easy," he affirms.
Is he afraid to very see collapsing because of credit?
O' Donovan reflects one moment, is used again of the hot tea and declares: "I do not have children to maintain and I am young\; even all goes from through, I can set out again to zero."
The engineer of the building does not like the lamentations that he hears often lately.
"Nobody must suffer from the hunger, our situation is nevertheless not as dramatic as what one lived formerly here in the island," supports it.
"To work during one moment abroad, it is not what can do without worse, perhaps it is what that we feel initially Irish.
He laughs and speaks then about his father who went to England at the time of the last great economic crisis.
"It was of return after having spent seven years there and, in Ireland, the life continued, quite simply."
This idea likes Cian Tanner.
To leave the future and to discover how the life occurs elsewhere.
In its prize list, It counts already a few years of work in London. This is why the life should not be also easy in New Zealand for him and its girlfriend.
But there is still a thing which worries it well these last days: the festival to be organized at the time of its 27e birthday in Dublin.
It fears that it can be transformed into evening of good-bye.
"Only, not much of emotions," he says by drinking a long beer mouthful.
"A good-bye, that appears worrying all the same."
"Let us call rather that an evening of goodbye, very slackened, bringing together some friends, with some drinks and some plays."
The democratic routine
The support for the democracy in Latin America continues to increase, just like that at the private company.
The crime became greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen like more influential than the United States in most of the area.
They are there certain conclusions of the last Latinobarómetro survey taken in 18 countries and published of exclusiveness by The Economist.
Being given that the survey was carried out systematically since 1995, it follows the changes of attitude in the area.
Two dependant elements arise from the results of the survey of this year, carried out in September and at at the beginning of October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of the Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of the attitudes towards the democracy and his principal institutions.
The support for the democracy increased appreciably in several countries on the circumference of the Pacific of South America (see table 1).
For example to Peru, where the economic growth reached on average 6% a year since 2002, the support for the democracy passed from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy was rectified after having undergone a strong fall of the production last year.
But only approximately half of the guarantors in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populated countries area, are convinced democrats, which cause a drop in the regional average (see table 2).
Some 44% of the guarantors of the area were declared satisfied in the way in which the democracy of their country functioned in practice\; it acts of the same figure as last year but with a strong increase on the 25% in 2001 (graphic 3)
Some 34% said that they had confidence in the Parliament from their country and 45% in their government, the same ones as last year in both cases\; but in big rise compared to 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America shook the support for the democracy.
If that held good during the world financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that the many ones of country of America underwent only one short recession and profited from a strong recovery.
Moreover, a network of social security contributed to protect the poor.
(The Economic commission of the United Nations for the Latin America brought back this week that the proportion of the Latin americans living in poverty increased only lowered this year slightly in 2009 and again, to 32%.)
But mood varies considerably from one country to another (cf graph 4).
The economic good performances of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, results in a largely shared feeling of progress
What is rarer in Mexico and in Central America where the recession was more severe and where the crimes violent one worsened.
It is only for the second time since the survey started that more guarantors through the Latin America as a whole quoted the crime rather than unemployment as being the most important problem for their country (see table 5).
Approximately 31% say that themselves or one of their close relation were victim of a criminal act during the past year\; nevertheless, this figure is in fall compared to the 38% last year and is low since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in the rise of support for the private company and the market economy: approximately 71% of the guarantors of the area say that the private company is essential for the development, against 56% in 2007 (cf graph 6).
Some 58% estimate that the market economy is the only system which will return their country developed, against 47% last year.
Interesting fact, 62% of the guarantors in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company) \; even if their president of left, Hugo Chavez, expropriates of many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the area, mentioned by 19% of the questioned people (against 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged compared to last year) and Venezuela (9%, in fall of 11% since last year)
But the United States is regarded as the most influential country by the guarantors in Mexico and in most of the Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, Dominican Republic and in Nicaragua.
A soiled vote
Nobody expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on November 28th.
But it was quite worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country disaster victim and plunged in fear.
One presented boxes of poll and a new poll, paper ballots dispersed in the goutières, of the ransacked polling stations and the intimidations
The polling stations opened the evening late.
Much Hatïens, including the many ones which was moved following the earthquake of January, wandered in the vicinity to find where to vote.
Some of them ended up giving up.
A dozen candidates with the presidential election, whose several supposed favorites, denounced the fraud and claimed the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, exploded through the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mule, the high official in Haiti of the United Nations Organization, regards the event as "a rather good election with many regards."
Observers of the Organization of the American States and the Community of the Caribbean declared prudently that they "did not believe that these irregularities, so serious are, had necessarily invalidated the process."
In other words, the spectacle continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to Rene Préval, unpopular outgoing president, and with its candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce the preliminary results on December 7th.
The second expected turn is scheduled for January.
Any hope in the election is not lost.
Two candidates of the opposition, Michel Martelly, a musician of rap, and Mirlande Manigat, an old first lady, were withdrawn from their initial call so that the vote is declared null.
But there can be problems if Mr. Célestin, who has little or not perceptible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached to it second will toura reached the second turn.
With a cholera epidemic which rages, and more than 1 million survivors to the earthquake who still live in tents, one feared that the participation would be.
In fact, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing it because of the disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards, necessary to vote, little time before the election was not distributed yet.
The challenge is important.
The givers see the election of a popular and legitimate government like a big step in the rebuilding of Haiti.
And thus, it is clear, the Haitians do it them-even.
The point of the feet towards the center
The weeks after being become suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, president of Argentina, profited from a wave of sympathy of the public which improved its rate of approval of 20 points, to more than 50%\; it is about sound plus high level since she was elected in 2007.
However, to transform that into a campaign successful for a second mandate at the time of an election the next year could depend on the choice of Mrs. Fernández, obviously in mourning, according to which it would give up or not the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, on this subject, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage the economic policy, even after his wife succeeds to him as president, was accustomed to working out budgets which underestimated the revenues from taxes, the economic growth and inflation.
That made it possible the first couple to at will spend the additional incomes.
The government of Mrs. Fernández lost her majority with the Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation sank in the distress following the death of Mr. Kirchner of a heart attack on October 27th.
Some of the dissenting members of the movement peronist to the power joined with Mrs. Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (where a member of Parliament struck with the face one of its pars and where others showed the government of corruption), the Congress does not have to approve the budget 2011.
"I will not dispute," the president stated.
Currently, the budget 2010 will be applied the next year, leaving to the president still a greater maneuver margin to spend at will.
The economy largely overheats: it is likely to grow of almost 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation accounts now for 11.1% but many private estimates and the salary demands of the trade unions, see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, which took up its post in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, made a priority of the growth and reduction of poverty, rather than of the control of inflation.
He refused to treat with the IMF, he badgered the private sector and purged the INDEC, the statistical office, which carried out falsifications of statistics on official inflation.
Can Mrs. Fernández now moderate these policies?
It called with talks between the private companies and the trade union leaders.
And its civils servant say that they want to limit pay rises the next year to 18%.
The economy was stimulated by high world prices of agricultural exports of Argentina.
But inflation eroded the nudge in the right direction with the growth following a strong devaluation in 2002.
It is perhaps the reason for which Mrs. Fernández shows signs to want to restore the financial relations of Argentina towards the rest of the world.
This year, the government concluded an agreement with the bond-holders who had refused a former reorganization forced of the debt for which Argentina had not regulated its expiries in 2001.
Now ms Fernández seems to Be edging towards year agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes nap $6.7 billion.
Kirchner always insisted on the fact that it could not imply a monitoring by the IMF, as it is of habit.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Funds would provide a "technical assistance" to conceive a new national index of the consumer prices\; what resembles a prelude of the cleansing of the INDEC.
It is not clear if Mrs. Fernández wants to remain in the policy beyond the end of her mandate, now that her husband is not any more at his sides.
If it does it, it has need to gain support of the middle class, among which the kirchnerism is very preached.
When the Argentinian ones return their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy to it will have ebbed.
If she wants to gain another election, she will have to decide to repudiate or not, without noise, of many policies of her husband.
A half-hurrah for China
The voters taiwanais are directed towards a a kind of narrower union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of his/her big brother located on other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters presented on November 27th, that is to say 70% of the acceptable people, to elect the mayors and town councillors in five urban districts, within the framework of what is regarded as a general evaluation of the president, My Ying-jeou.
Mr. My is itself become a substitute for the feelings compared to the continent, having tied innovative bonds of business, including a pact of free trade partial, in the greatest reorganization of the relations with China itself since 1949.
Successful Mr. the My test, but just.
Although its party Kuomintang (KMT) gained three of the five town halls, it failed to gain the majority of the votes.
Instead of that, the Party democrat-progressist (DPP), which leant towards the complete independence of Taiwan, gained nearly 50% of all the votes for the KMT of 45%.
If that had been a presidential ballot, Mr. My would be in difficulty.
Since he was elected two years ago, the share of vote of its party fell from approximately 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in the town councils.
The event revealed most principal subjects of the elections taiwanaises, including trucks with noisy countryside and flags of gathering of mass with girls who danced in minimal behavior.
An obligatory mysterious attempted murder was also perpetrated.
Sean Bond, son of Chan Bond, honorary president of the KMT, carried out an election tour for a candidate of the KMT the day before the election.
A man of crowd shot at young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, wounding it and killing a passer by.
Oddly, it was not given if the gunner wanted to make evil with Mr. Lien or to settle a disagreement with the candidate.
In any event, known as Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder had consequences on the election while directing suspicion on the DPP and while turning the voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps that more the big winner of the elections was China.
It was striking to note how much the question continental part itself was absent.
Instead of that, the candidates have tournament with the plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its independence in fact and hates the military threat of China.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid parading its bonds with the government of Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also abstained from poking the feeling anti-Chinese.
It is the answer to a new awakening according to which the Chinese companies are essential to the economic survival of Taiwan.
Mr. My, for its part, asserted a confirmation to know if its policy relating to China were acceptable for the taiwanaise majority.
One can expect that the government of Beijing continues to provide commercial facilities, in accordance with his strategy which aims at deluding Taiwan, of return to the fold.
China did not waste time to send a negotiator to Taipei to organize a top on the protection of the investments and the medical co-operation.
Admittedly, she would also like to see a political integration\; but let us start with the beginning.
Better is worth to wait for that after the presidential election of 2012.
The DPP was in any event reinvented.
Two years ago, it was badly: its former chief, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent in prison following accusations of corruption.
President of 2000 to 2008, he was an agitator in favor of an explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderate came out under the direction of Mrs. Tsai and the PDP puts all works about it to attract the professionals and the young people.
Mrs. Tsai was greeted like a candidate of the DPP to the presidency, like Su Tseng-chang, which was useful under Mr. Chen.
Their party is making of sound to better show than can also begin with Beijing.
Mrs. Tsai announced plans intended for a panel of experts to act like a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their talks can take place unconditionally.
Mrs. Tsai tells with the public taiwanais that its party presents a "alternative worthy of confidence" compared to the precipitated approach of Mr. My about China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a declaration published starting from its cell, he declared that the candidates of the PDP would have got better results if they had insisted on the fact that Taiwan is a distinct country.
It even ordered to Mr. Su, pragmatic, not to aspire to the presidency.
Even without the intervention of Mr. Chen, the DPP will have difficulty choosing between its potential candidates.
It is necessary that the KMT makes an introspection of oneself.
The evaluations of Mr. My were weak\; in spite of a vertiginous economic growth, the candidates of the KMT did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be mainly due to the unemployment and the widening of the gap between rich person and the poor.
A spokesperson of the KMT says that his cabinet as its local antennas will be altered.
The good performances of the PDP suggest that the support of Taiwan for the bringing together is limited.
In same time, most Taiwanais see economic integration with China like inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an eminent leader-writer, "the point of nonreturn already passed."
Nominations with the Grammy Awards: the singer of jazz Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "better new artist"
To carry out at the request of a president, and people are required to become acquainted.
Esperanza Spalding, the bass player of jazz and singer 26 year old gathered with the hand by president Obama to occur at the time of its ceremony of the Nobel Prize of Peace in 2009, marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a nomination of great scale in the category of the "best new artist."
Considering that Spalding is a figure very known on the scene of the jazz since its album of 2008, "Esperanza," the nomination remains a little mysterious but it is compatible with the rules of the Grammy Awards according to which an artist should not leave more than three albums before the recording\; what "proves the public identity of this artist."
Its ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Society Music," marked certainly a step ahead and, being given its vocal style slightly engaging, its skilful hand the pop one and of funk and its Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least a dotted line with Spalding compared to the fulgurating success of Norah Jones in 2003, the equivalent nearest for the voters to the Grammy Awards by taking account of the productions of jazz in this category these last years.
Elsewhere, the voters of the Grammy Awards rightly honoured "Historicity" with Vijay Iyer Trio in the category "album instrumental," one transferred on a reinvigorating shiver of a recording which was one of the paramount favorites last year.
Among these Iyer, "Moody 4B" of the saxophonist veteran James Moody and "Positootly" of the clavierist John Beasley will be in particular in competition.
Shorty trombone, favorite with the raucous voice of New-Orleans and frequent guest with "Treme" of HBO, were honoured in the category of contemporary jazz\; who inclines himself in addition strongly towards an unquestionable fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Society secrecy of the savage Darcy James Wire-drawer, familiarized with the steampunk, gained some recognitions deserved well in the category great unit\; competing with the rich chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Together and the adventurous eternal Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" of sound octet' S live was a good example of the democratic hand of this bass player as a team leader.
Nomination of the Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey carry out in the traditional categories
The traditional nominations for the 53e Grammy Awards annual comprise a mixture of landscapes of musicians and composers of the whole world.
At the top of the nominations, let us quote "Deus ex machina" of Michael Daugherty, for the piano and the orchestra, with five "yes"\; and "Dreamhouse" of Steve Mackey, an electric orchestral work, with three "yes."
Among the nominated ones having bonds with California of the South, there is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony n°4, "Los Angeles," a work which was ordered by the Philharmonic orchestra of Los Angeles and which opened Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Madolin Concerto of the composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in string for a reward.
The traditional nominations are distributed on 13 categories covering of the recordings of orchestra, opera, choral and in solo.
A category for the traditional producer of the year puts in the star five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the traditional album are Symphonies N °3 and 4 of Bruckner of the royal Orchestra of Concertgebouw\; "Deus ex machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Daugherty of Nashville Symphony Orchestrated\; "Dreamhouse" of Steven Mackey of Boston Modern Orchestrated Project and Synergy Vocals\; "Sacrificium - the art of Castrati" putting in the star various artists\; and the "Requiem" of Made green of Chicago Symphony Orchestrated and Chorus.
In the category of the opera, the nominated ones are "Lulu" of Berg of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio E Cleopatra" of Adolf Hasse of Ars Lyrica Houston\; "Love by far" of Kaija Saariaho of Deutsches Berlin Symphony-Orchester\; "The Enchanted Wanderer" of Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestra and the Chorus of the Mariinsky Theater\; and "Ivanhoé" of Arthur Sullivan of the National BBC Orchestrated of Wales.
The composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for the contemporary composition count Pärt for the Symphony n°4, Daugherty for "Deus ex machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted."
The Symphony n°4 of Pärt had its first in Disney Hall in January 2009 in an execution recorded by the Philharmonic orchestra of Los Angeles, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of approximately 30 minutes is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the ex-tycoon of oil Mikhaïl Khodorkovski, imprisoned in Russia.
"Mandolin Concerto" of Dorman was nominated for its instrumental service soloist with an orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles said that it aviat written work the 15 minute old especially for the interpreter to the mandoline Avi Avital, which played the concerto with Metropolis Ensemble, sitting at New York.
"I wrote it by using sounds of the Middle East and a large number of ranges and rhythms of North Africa," Dorman in a telephone interview declared.
The orchestra conductor Pierre Boulez, 85 years, received a nomination in the category of the services of orchestra, to have directed the Symphony orchestra of Chicago in a recording of works of Stravinsky.
Among the instrumental soloists who received a nomination, let us quote the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-Andre Hamelin\; the organist Paul Jacobs, the violonist Julia Fischer and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, it only did not nominate vocalistes-soloists there\; here: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of the traditional mixtures, the soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for his recording "Roots: my life, my song"
The project of the mosque of Temecula gains the approval of the commission of planning.
A project of mosque with Temecula received the unanimous support of the commission of local planning after more than five hours of public testimony, often impassioned.
Criticisms were caught some with the project by claiming that it made promotion as well terrorism as congestions of the traffic.
But the police chiefs ruled Wednesday evening that the new religious center obeyed the local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Much from people well came to support it: Christians, Jews, Bahaïs, you mention it," declared Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, taking the floor Thursday morning.
"I am proud, as an American citizen."
"That shows that justice carries it."
"The opposition is really tiny," he added.
"They have just very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting started at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, of people deciding for or against the center, at the time of word about also distributed, according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the Web site of the newspaper.
"There is no more America," a speaker wrote.
"It is about another planet of the monkeys with Miss Liberty died in sand."
"America fell."
The Islamic centers planned also caused protests in other parts of the country, including with Ground Zero, place of the attacks of September 11th, 2001, perpetrated in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in Temecula Valley.
Its congregation of about 135 families coexists without incident in the county of Riverside since years but she wanted a space larger and better than the warehouse than she rented on a property shared with a manufacturer of systems of water filtration.
The new mosque of 24.943 square feet to the architecture of Mediterranean style would be made up of two minarets and would rise with 43 feet top.
It would occupy a site of 4.32 hectares on the road Nicolas approximately two miles east of Chaparral high school.
The opponents can still call against this project upon the town council.
A microbe tolerating arsenic raises the possibility of new types of lives on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic like one of its nutritive elements, widens the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although the researchers discovered the unusual bacterium here on Earth, they say that shows that the life has possibilities beyond the major elements which were regarded as essential.
"This organization has a double capacity."
"It can developed either with phosphorus, or with arsenic."
"This is why it is very particular, even if it is far from being "a foreign" form of life really, Paul Davies C.W commented on. University of State of Arizona, joint author of the report appearing in the online edition of Thursday of the Science newspaper.
Six major elements were regarded a long time as essential for the life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But the researchers discovered that the bacterium, discovered in the lake Mono, in California, is able to continue to develop after having replaced phosphorus by arsenic.
"One wonders what is still possible," declared Ariel Anbar D. of the University of State of Arizona, joint author of the report.
The discovery is important as regards research of the life beyond the Earth because the researchers must be able to recognize the life, of knowing it with what the life resembles, says Anbar.
The study concentrates on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not reveal the details of the lucky find, generated speculations spread on the Internet according to which the report could reveal the discovery of an extraterrestrial life.
That was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, the organizations could be able to use other elements to actuate biochemistry and that "the standard" whole of the elements, that we judge absolutely necessary for the life, could not be fixed," commented on Charles Cockell, professor at the planetary scientific Research institute and spacial, Open University, Milton Keynes, the United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of an element to another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It was not a fortuitous discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Institute of Astrology of NASA, which directed the study, chose the lake Mono because it is equipped with arsenic elevated levels.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar\; thus, she speculated that a microbe exposed to the two substances could be able to substitute one for the other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"Consequently, the organizations have difficulty distinguishing these elements separately."
"But arsenic is sufficiently different so that it does not function exactly as phosphorus\; it penetrates inside and, to some extent, gums the work of our biochemical machine," explained Anbar.
The researchers collected the bacterium known under the name of GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing arsenic concentrations to which it could adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic in the place raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic can occur naturally, that is to say elsewhere on Earth or another planet or the moon where arsenic is more frequent.
Jamy S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea, according to which arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus, was not new\; but nothing never showed that could go.
Arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of the existence of the Earth, she says\; thus, the researchers put forth the hypothesis that the first forms of life could have used it.
That suggests that there could be other ways of forming the life, not only the way in which the life on Earth was formed at the beginning," Foster declared, which was not part of the research team of Wolfe-Simon.
Research was financed by NASA, the ministry for Energy and the National institute of health.
The last two stolen dogs of exposure were found in Compton
The two other dogs of exposure on four stolen of the outside of a motel to Bellflower were found, the sheriffs of the county of Los Angeles have it Thursday announcement.
The four dogs of exposure - two akitas and two corgis Welsh pembroke - disappeared Tuesday when somebody stole the van Chevrolet Express in which they had spent the night outside a motel 6 of Bellflower, announced the authorities.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the two others were found at the end of the evening Wednesday, declared in Steve Whitmore, the spokesperson of the department of the sheriff of the county of Los Angeles.
"The good news, it is that the dogs are well," known as Whitmore.
"They are in the fine shapes."
"They were restored with their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to precisely say where the dogs had been found, in which district and which were the circumstances of their discovery.
"An investigation is in hand."
"We do not want to say it," Whitmore it said.
"We follow the orders."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a comment Thursday.
They were joined together Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a refuge for animals of the county located at Downey.
The assistants of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs separately with Compton.
Akitas - Trace, a 3 year old male, and Didi, a 10 month old female - were healthy and safe, the authorities announced.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had envisaged to show with regional contests this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, were reported missing until their discovery Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, which live in Redding, are downtown this weekend within the framework of the national championship "AKC/Eukanuba" Beach Length, where they intended to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to take part in the competitions of other tests envisaged in the days preceding the exposure "AKC/Eukanuba," Peek in Times declared Wednesday.
California of the South east one of the stops of the round of canine exposure of almost a month of the couple.
Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often remain in the motels and park their van outside, just beside the window of their room.
They took along three other dogs - a Boxer pup, a burrow Parson Russell and a Breton spaniel - which remained with them in the room of the motel.
But they left Akitas and the corgis, with the thicker fur, in the van where it would be fresher.
They opened the windows a little, so that the dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard announced the flight of the van to 6 a.m. Tuesday.
Peek said that they would offer a reward to any person who could lead them to the corgis, provided with a micropuce established to identify them.
It is not clear if a reward were granted Thursday.
The lion is not ready to redden again, the reorganization of MGM does not expect any more but the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulences and uncertainty, MGM finally obtained green light to start again to zero.
A federal judge of the bankruptcies of New York, officially rented the plan Thursday "prepackaged" by the creditors according to whom approximately 5 billion dollars of the debt would be unobtrusive\; opening up the way for the company of entertainment, being 86 years old of existence, to concentrate its efforts on the production and film distribution and of TV programs.
With the decision of Thursday, according to which the plan satisfied the requirements with the code with the bankruptcy with the United States, plus any legal obstacle do not remain before MGM to recover to flood under the supervision of the founders from Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, which will become the chief executive officers of what will be a reduced studio.
Staff will be brought back to approximately 320 out of 400 at the beginning.
MGM will not really emerge from Chapter 11 as long as JPMorgan Chase will not have concluded a credit facilities from 500 million dollars, designed to finance the new operations and productions of MGM.
It is currently distributed under license by the investment bank, which encounters itself 75 million dollars, and should be financed around mid-December.
The process of reorganization of the studio began in May 2009 when the Moelis investment bank &amp\; Co. was committed to advise the direction on the way of placing its finances since it did not have the means of paying the interests a year rising to 300 million dollars.
In August, the chief executive officer, Harry Sloan, was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former chairman of Enron and an expert in rectification known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The attempts of Moelis and Cooper to solve the financial problems of MGM and to satisfy the most 140 creditors with the studio took much more time than envisaged.
After several months of discussions, the parts were appropriate, at the end of 2009, to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted few tenderers among whom none of them was ready to pay the sum of 2 billion more whose creditors were with research.
For the spring of this year, it was necessary all to remake whereas the team of MGM had started to work on a restructuring plan which, after months of dissensions and internal debates, was finally approved by the creditors at at the end of October.
When MGM leaves officially the bankruptcy in the following weeks, the companies Moelis and Cooper receive bonuses of several million dollars for their work.
Moelis &amp\; Co., which already obtained 1.2 million dollars, will receive a payment of 9.5 million dollars.
The companies of Cooper, which collected 375,000 $ per month for their services of management of the firm, will receive a "bonus of success" of 4 million dollars.
To bore and Birnbaum intends to start again the production of MGM, which left one film this year, and to put on foot an annual list of seven or eight films which would leave starting from 2012.
They also intend to cofinance two films based on "the Hobbit," with Warner Bros
The studio must conclude a distinct loan between $ 265,000,000 and $ 275 million to finance its share in these two films, which must be carried out by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who holds approximately 18% of the debt of MGM, tried to carry out a fusion of the studio with Lions Spoils Entertainment, where he is the principal shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies did not lead to an agreement.
Tech toys to maintain your budget gifts in balance
Although the principal candidate for the most marvellous toy of this year is the IPAD, follow-up, perhaps, by the system of video game of Microsoft, Kinect, both can make an important breach in your budget gifts.
Consider that, for the price of a iPad, you can buy five bicycles BMX to 99 $ and that a play Kinect costs the same price as 10 skipping ropes traditional of pearls, or approximately 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways of keeping your budget gifts in balance.
Recently, I visited three national salesmen of toys - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Custom and Wholesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic toys which I could buy for less than 80 $.
It is clear that Law de Moore evolved, the technological toy of this year is likely to have more force\; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
Moreover, whereas there are generally less new toys associated with Web sites, two of most known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And the pile button toys are in increase, as well as the rechargeable battery toys.
Here some recommendations.
(All the prices are starting from Toys "R" Custom, except if contrary indication.)
Sing-have-my-jigs (Mattel, 13 $ per 3 years and more) are soft toys of the size of a guinea-pig which sing a note when you to press to them on the belly.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second makes it possible to compose a song.
If you to buy some several, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: once you start to support, you cannot any more stop you.
To combine the song with the dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, 60 $ per 2 years and more) is the best choice.
Taking as a starting point the technology of Elmo Live of last year, the animatronic headstock of 14 inches plays of the plays in turn like Simon Says and can make the lunar dance thanks to its articulated feet innovating with wheel locking.
The children who essyaé the toy uses Mickey as an instructor of dance whereas their parents complain about a lack of control of volume.
If you are a child of the Eighties, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is of return (Hasbro/Playskool, 40 $ per 3 years and more), with a backpack filled with charts of play questionnaire designed to transform one strolls in the car in a session with an autocorrection and a sorter of valves.
If you are being wary when your child holds your smartphone, here three autonomous alternatives.
Mobigo de VTech (60 $, for the 3 to 8 years) is the least expensive and easiest to use, with a keyboard qwerty, although the plays do not educate as effectively as To explore it Leapster (70 $, for the 3 to 12 years), it acts of the first great revision of the Leapster range, with a more recent and more luminous screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
The iXL of Fisher-Price (90 $, for the 3 to 7 years) uses a system of the iTunes type to offer plays and e-books and is equipped with an entry for chart SD which makes it possible to post family photos.
Lastly, Scrabble Flash (30 $, Hasbro, for the 8 years and more) is a set of five blocks hardly larger than a box of matches, each one having its own screen LED.
The objective is to form words while placing the blocks on line before time passes, it is ideal for an impromptu contest of orthography.
More and more, the toys have a kind of connection on line.
While basing itself only on their presence in the stores of toys, two larger are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy to your child a pet in line of the Club Penguin, for example, you can obtain a Penguin Disney Club 2 " Mix 'NR Match Appears Pack, 5 $, for the 6 to 12 years) which understands a marked part of a hidden code.
When you to repurchase the code on line, your child receives sufficient appropriations to the store Club Penguin for two articles with the choices.
It can be a question of roller skates or a pet Puffle toy.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your brush with teeth, Hexbug Nano ($ 10, for 5 years and more) is last the pile button microphone-robots.
The false small beast moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone pastes in random directions.
It is amusing to make a labyrinth of blocks to see whether it can find its way through.
It is also solid.
Ours resisted a fall of the kitchen table and even a temporary passage in the mouth of our dog.
To bring a softer side to the maintenance of law and order to China
Tang Shenbin surveyed a place of the city like one sergeant urban with the training by inspecting its nervous loads severely, while emitting with low voice of the orders with military authorities.
He wanted that the female members of chengguan - responsible imposing for the public order in China, feared and scorned for their arbitrary repression and their leaning for violence - transmit a certain impression to a set of spectators.
"You Hold right!"
"Be piercing!"
Show, he tells them, "what resemble the pretty girls!"
Four girls having hardly passed adolescence out of white gloves, dressed in jackets and identical pants of color olive, solidified with the attention.
Four pairs of black shoes with heel, rows with the rule.
Four looked after hats perfectly perched at the top of hair attached by a node striped in blue and white.
"Personally, I think that they have an average appearance," Mr. Tang said, with scorn.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government tried to refresh the image of the urban inspectors of China.
A city required that all the new recruits have a diploma of higher learning.
The province of Guangdong exchanged the greenish grey of the uniforms against a blue supposedly more engaging.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the lower-the-eyes by the strong manner:: in 2009, a report announced that 50 officers had encircled an unverifiable snack bar carriage while launching black looks, firmly during half an hour, until the hawker packs up again his business and leaves.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants with Chengdu, chose to make a great operation of image.
Since 2003, the district supplemented its police of street in urban environment of 13 women, especially selected for their appearance, their contour and their young age.
The idea is to give to the trimmed police a softer side, more female.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson could have difficulties in attracting the glance on this underground urban brigade of China
And due, the critics will say.
Contrary to the police, these agents are authorized to only make respect the municipal ordinances by imposing administrative fines or other sanctions.
But the Chinese media depict the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the province of Hubei beat with died an observer after it used its cellphone to film them dispersing a protest against a discharge of waste.
Last year, a training manual for the inspectors of Beijing, concealed and put on line, described how to overcome the delinquents without emitting effectively blood.
This year in Shanghai, a water melon hawker was abandoned with a cerebral lesion after a brawl with five officers.
A video game impregnated of violence, available by download in line, watch of the Chinese inspectors trained with the attack of the salesmen of street.
"Chengguan marked the government," last year regretted China Daily, a national publication, after an umpteenth polemic on the tactics.
The newspaper claimed a "true complete cleaning."
The skepticals say that the approach is well far.
After the district passed an announcement to find in October eight new recruits female, a leading article, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether the women had real tasks or if they were only one tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a little of both.
The announcement of the district required female, old candidates between 18 to 22 years, to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five features of the face in good the order."
They must have a size higher than the average, that is to say of 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 ½ inches.
The retirement at 26 years is obligatory.
The officers declared that work was physically too painful for the women of more than 25 years.
"It is their image which is important," a certain officer of district said to Rednet.com, a Web site quasi-governmental.
"Firstly, qualities external of the candidates will determine if they agree\; it is the size, the weight, the features of the face, etc"
Then the temperament and "interior qualities come."
The women of Chengguan are like vases with flowers, he said, adding: "Besides being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, assistant editor of the office of management of the district of the city, does not adhere to this description.
But it noted that the requirements concerning the height were the standard standard in many Chinese job offers for the two sexes.
Such is the case of the requirement relating to the order of the features of the face.
That that means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Admittedly, the handicapped or disfigured people should not postulate.
"We cannot leave a person who limps or uneven to come to be useful here," Mr. Zheng says.
"It would not give a good image."
Liu Yi, which patrols on the Baoguang place close to a monastery, is old of 22 and finely has the dappled cheeks with a mouth curved.
She does not regard the development of her appearance as being sexist, At she said.
"Do you Think that I have the sexy air in this uniform?" she asked of a disillusioned air.
Xu Yang, his/her colleague with the 21 years old small cavities, known as: "Our work is to present the image of the city."
They are not opposed so that their mandate is limited, they said, because they nourish greater ambitions of career than simply to drive out the salesmen in the lanes where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a dozen travelling merchants who move quickly on foot or with bicycle, while trying as much as possible to sell rolls or bowls of tofu before running away.
"Main Wang, you must leave."
"We already told you several times!" , Mrs. Xu said whereas a salesman fled on foot, giving up her bicycle-cart with noodles temporarily.
The agents rather describe their functions like monotonous that difficult.
"It is about the same thing each day," declared Huang Jing, 20 years old, which studies marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One of the reasons is that the female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the goods of the salesmen.
They can only threaten to announce the contraveners to their male superiors.
That tends to protect them from the exposures public sudden of animosity against the bureaucracy which are common in all China.
This year, of the hundreds of citizens with Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, revolted after the propagation of false rumors according to which the agents of the chengguan had killed a salesman.
In one night, more than a dozen police officers and agents of the chengguan were wounded, 14 vehicles of the government were reversed or put at fire.
Xindu has escaped up to now with such a violence.
But calms it is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks of houses of the placid Baoguang place, where the officers of female sex patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered with the corner of the street.
The agents confiscated a motor bike which was being repaired on the pavement rather than in a store, like theirs imposes the regulation.
The owner of the motor bike shouted with the scandal.
A 15 minute old arm wrestling followed before the police officers, with the sinister face, cut through a path with blows of elbow towards their vehicle and left at any speed with the motor bike and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years, a coordinator attached to the male team, remained behind, its white badge turned over to hide its name.
Like the officers of female sex, the coordinators - 40 years old men or more - play a part of support purely.
Contrary to them, they are not formed in order to maintain an image waxed.
"Sometimes, we fight verbally."
"Sometimes, we fight physically," says Mr. Li said of a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it is the public which starts."
The prosecutors will not accuse the senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the ministry for Justice raised the criminal charges related to the senator John Ensign, rising from a business related to an assistant of an old campaign and on its efforts to obtain a work of lobbying for the husband of the woman, have announcement Wednesday the lawyers of the senator.
The decision puts an end to the legal threat most serious faced by Mr. Ensign, the republican of Nevada which was regarded as a possible republican candidate with the presidential election of 2012 until the scandal around its business does not make the national headlines last year and harm its career.
The office of Mr. Ensign declared that it was "very happy" by the decision, result of a one year investigation.
The senator could still be exposed with disciplinary measures taken by the senatorial committee of ethics.
The lawyers of Mr. Ensign declared that the ministry for Justice "had informed that the senator Ensign was not any more the object of the investigation and that it did not intend to maintain of unspecified charge against him in this business."
The ministry for Justice abstained from comment on this subject.
The announcement came like a kind of surprise for many lawyers of ethics external with the ministry for the Justice, according to which there would be significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign would have conspired to violate a federal penal prohibition on the lobbying.
Interviews, e-mail and other documents, initially communicated in October 2009 in New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, which was one of its assistants, to obtain a work of lucrative lobbying to gain the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, in connection with the business of the senator with it.
Mrs. Hampton once was useful to trésorière at the time of a campaign of Ensign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a certain number of political money-lenders to find work for Mr. Hampton and, then, it defended their rights after they engaged Mr. Hampton to make lobbying for them\; in accordance with the documents and the interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, it was to him interdict for one year by the law to make lobbying near its former employer or of the Senate as a whole.
The experts in ethics supported that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the business, seems in contradiction with the prohibition known as of the revolving door of the lobbying.
According to the proof which was made public, "there seems to be a proof prima facie of a plot in order to violate and substantial violation of the law of the revolving door," declared Stanley Brand, a lawyer of Washington which specializes in the defense of customers of an investigation by the government.
Although the judge of the ministry refused to explain the reasoning having led to the decision in the Ensign business, Mr. Brand and other lawyers in ethics said that the ministry seemed to be wary of the political continuations after a certain number of high level reverses boxed by its section of the public integrity, including the decision taken year last to give up the continuations against the former senator Ted marked Stevens of fault of continuation.
The federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, declared Melanie Sloan, the chief executive officer of the citizens for the responsibility and ethics in Washington, a defense group which received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the business.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials edge now assumes the laws don' T apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, lawyer principal of Mr. Ensign, declared in an interview that it had received Monday a phone call on behalf of a prosecutor of the ministry for Justice and a follow-up the following day, telling him that the ministry did not seek charges against its customer.
The team of lawyers of Mr. Ensign had cooperated with the prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, such as his office reaffirmed it Wednesday in an official statement, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to specify the legal arguments which it had made with the parquet floor.
"I am not at ease to go into the details of my discussions with the ministry for Justice, except saying that we think that they made the good decision," said At it.
Last month, the federal Commission of the Elections decided to give up an investigation following a complaint independent by the group of ethics, supporting that the payment of 96,000 $ by the parents of Mr. Ensign in Hampton violated the federal electoral law.
The electoral commission declared that it did not have sufficient evidence to prove that the money was all except a gift.
NV Energy, an important company of Nevada which supported the senator a long time, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton to find work of lobbying.
E-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company accommodated Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, the principal private secretary of Mr. Ensign, John Lopez, communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that it "hammered" the ministry for the Interior on a question in litigation.
Mr. Ensign also took part in a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another customer of Nevada, Allegiant Air, and he asked the secretary of transport to fix a meeting in the name of the airline company after having urged Mr. Hampton to make lobbying.
When the news of the business made surface last year, Mr. Ensign excused himself near his voters and resigned of his post of leader to the fourth republican rank with the Senate.
After having maintained a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign declared it has been two weeks that it intended to aspire to a third mandate with the Senate.
By announcing that Mr. Ensign was not any more the target of a criminal investigation, its spokesperson, Jennifer Cooper, declared that the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the ministry for Justice and would put an end to its investigation.
The senator Ensign is delighted to continue his work baited in the name of the people of Nevada, she says.
The call of Cheshire will point towards Twitter
Half a dozen between them were typing with far in the lines of the courtroom.
They sent every minute of the horrible reports of testimonies via Twitter.
At the end, defense said that there was more than 140,000 messages on the lawsuit of the rape case and the children attached to their bed in a house which was burnt.
Thursday, the lawsuit largely followed by Steven J. Beam, which was recognized guilty of the murder of three Cheshire family members, in Connecticut, should lead to an official end where the judge would impose the capital punishment, voted by the jury.
But the lawyers of Mr. Hayes have already to deposit elements with the court which outline arguments of call, likely to occupy the courts during years.
What is aggressive, it is that the intense reports on the lawsuit - as well as use the generalized and extended by the journalists of Twitter - created a "atmosphere of circus," a so widespread and instantaneous saturation with details flamers which the jury was badly influenced by passions of the public.
The request could push the judges of call to be discussed on the question of knowing if new technologies require new rules in the courtrooms.
"I made of it the experiment at the time of this lawsuit\; I think that there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies into the courtrooms undermines the rights of the person to a fair trial," Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer of Mr. Hayes, chief lawyer declared.
The judge of the lawsuit, Jon C. Blue of the Superior court of State, laconically rejected the claims in the judgment made the week last, affirming that the media "were carefully controlled" and that there was no proof according to which the jury would have been animated by passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the question.
The courses of call recognize decades since that the media coverage of the notorious cases can raise questions about the equity of a lawsuit.
In a judgment of 1966 which made date, the Supreme court of the United States cancelled the judgment of an osteopath of Cleveland, Dr. Sam Shepard, for the assassination of his wife, supporting in her decision that there was a "atmosphere of carnival to the lawsuit" because of media.
The crime is considered by certain to have been the inspiration for the TV program and film "the fugitive one."
Certain lawyers declared that the courts of call seized to re-examine a half century later the judgment of Mr. Hayes can be curious being given the argument according to which new rules could be necessary to manage the means of communication of the courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"It there has a general reason to worry about the impact of the new media" in the lawsuits of great scale, declared John J. Donohue III, a professor at the school of Right of Stanford which studied the capital punishment in Connecticut and wrote a report according to which she was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue affirms that certain judges of call could be intrigued by the idea according to which the limitation of the instantaneous communication starting from the courtrooms could allow lawsuits righter.
The case of Twitter only one among many others is described of it by lawyers of Mr. Hayes, likely to be discussed during years\; what delays the execution.
The defense counsels also affirm, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered an injury when Blue judge refused to allow them to put to the test the reactions of the potential jurors in their showing macabre photographs of criminal scenes during the selection of the jury.
Some of sworn stated to be horrified by the photographs at the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Small, 48 years, and his/her daughters, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years.
The defense counsels affirm that they also will dispute the constitutionality of the capital punishment and that they will support that the judge wrongfully expelled one of sworn, which had been critical in front of the prosecutors, and which it wrongly put the pressure for a verdict by making the unusual decision to lead the jury to deliberate in one weekend.
Sworn were not sequestered.
But their arguments on the effect of the intense media coverage of the lawsuit could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a dispute against the verdict, deposited last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that he was discussed during the electoral campaign by the candidates at the station of governor and the Senate of the United States.
They maintained that the data-processing media did not cease poking the flames of the emotion of the business.
"The daily scuffle of the tweets of the media, the cameras and the journalists in front of the law courts," the lawyers wrote, "did not resemble nothing of what had been seen before here, in New Haven, and perhaps even with the national scale."
Their accent on the cover of the Twitter system is discussed.
In the interviews, certain journalists declared that the assertion, according to whom the instantaneous news was more flamers than the official statements given more slowly, was a sight luddist which would impoverish the policy of the Court governing the media coverage of the future lawsuits.
But certain lawyers declared that the courses of call étaitent often attracted by the arguments according to which the social and technological changes required an adaptation by the courts.
The lawyers of Mr. Hayes insist on this claim.
In their file, they make a reference to the decision of the Supreme court of 1966 which had reversed the judgment of Dr. Sheppard because of the media coverage of the lawsuit and they specified that they would call upon the need for new rules for the new media.
"This business," they wrote ," that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21e century represents. "
Can civility bring closer cleavages?
After a campaign marked by the invective and negativity, a minimum of civility burst in Washington this week.
Is it about a harbinger of a true bipartite co-operation forwards or one illusory moment before the fast return to the fight well-wisher in the capital?
The meeting of Tuesday between president Obama and the leaders of the Congress did not produce any opening on the great questions which must be treated during the session of "lame duck."
But obviously, there at least was a polished discussion on the differences of the two parts like on the recognition of their shared responsibilities being controlled, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to mark points. vacuum of notation not in favor.
The public meeting of Wednesday of the commission on the deficit of the president was also civilized, in spite of the political divergences which remain between the members.
It seems clear that the narrow interaction several months created a mutual respect transcending the ideological ditch\; but which, however, still divides the members.
It is hardly sufficient to declare that a new era of co-operation arrived.
The two parts are now during a trial period and of testing period mutual in order to obtain signs of co-operation and compromise, while trying to evaluate the limits of the public opinion and the patience of the voters for a war renewed well-wisher.
This is why the meeting of Tuesday and the later comments of the participants revealed a minimum of requirements or of charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a fast change of the climate which existed during two last years.
That it acts of the taxation, the expenditure, the health care or the rights, the two parts remain away miles.
However, the election of November had moderated Washington, at least in the short-term.
"There is not any doubt that the things changed on the tone," Pete Wehner, a civil servant of the administration Bush declared, maintaining at the side of the Center of ethical and public Policy.
"It is inevitable after the elections.
The elections cause passions well-wishers and, then, they are estomptent.
It is well."
On certain questions, in particular those about the agenda of "the lame" duck session, the republicans and the democrats have of another choice only to find a solution.
The tax reductions of Bush will expire at the end of the year, and nobody is in favor of that.
The two parts want to find a way of preserving a part of it or the unit, in a permanent or temporary way.
In the same way, a compromise is possible on the extension of the unemployment pays, would be this only because the republicans cannot allow themselves to give the impression which they are in favor as of tax cuts for the rich person, while refusing the unemployment benefits to the workers without employment.
After the meeting of Tuesday at the White House, more optimism planes on a possible agreement in connection with the questions mentioned during the session relative to "lame duck," with the ratification of the pact "New START."
But William Galston, of Brookings Institution, informs that a fruitful cooperation on the most pressing problems of the session "blade duck" will not lead inevitably to a better agreement between the two parties when the 112e congress meets in January.
Instead of that, he says, one period of dissension is probable, even inevitable.
"Once the things which must be made it will be, psychology in the short-term will return to the one of confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed its skepticism largely divided according to which civility would lead to a true co-operation.
"I consider most what occurs between today and 2012 like a pre-spectacle or a shadow-boxing compared to the principal event from 2012, said At it.
The reasons are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority to the Room and the voters present at the tea who contributed to his creation.
However the republican leaders are conscious of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to be worthy of their promises to reduce the public expenditure and to repeal the new law on the health care.
These positions well-wishers are right now clear in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the commission of the deficit which understand to reform the code of imposition and to increase certain taxes, to push back the retirement age and to reduce the expenditure.
The copresidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, according to themselves, imposed the question of the deficit about the public diary in a manner which cannot be been unaware of.
But they need 14 vote at the commission, made up of 18 members, to emit their plan like an official recommendation, and they had evil to reach this number.
Greatest resistance remains among the elected officials of the group\; what suggests that there is on the tax questions, at least today, few reasons or will for compromise.
Galston envisages two phases in the engagements between the White House and the republicans of the Congress.
The first will come the next year in the form from confrontations in favor, since the republicans dispute Obama as regards budget, of taxes and health care\; for then being followed by one period of greater bipartite co-operation.
Which would be the cause of the change?
The public opinion.
It is largely proven that, in spite of the spirit in favor of the recent election, a majority of the Americans wants to always see the two parties working together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, like in 1995, then both parties will observe the reaction of the public attentively.
That which will be judged in loss will have to change course and to find compromises.
But it would be nevertheless an optimistic point of view.
The spirit in favor and polarization are larger today than they were it in the middle of the years 1990 and there seems to be more an ideological wide variation between Obama and the republicans of the Congress that there was not then between president Bill Clinton and the republicans.
In same time, the militants of the two parties see 2010 like a simple prelude to a more consequent election in 2012.
Taking into account this reality, exposed civility this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But one will need much more efforts on behalf of the two parts to find an area of agreement on the questions which still divide them.
Revealed American documents describe Moscow like a harbor of corruption
The control of the east city between the hands of a "Kleptocratie" and makes pass to the Kremlin part of the bribes and money of protection which it collects, announced the embassy of the United States in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal security service carry out enormous rackets which contribute to explain the high cost of the life in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only of legitimate companies but also of organized criminal groups.
Each layer of the bureaucracy - what the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical of the power" - takes its share whereas the money walks on to the top of the scale.
The memorandum, which was sent to Washington under the name of the Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by Wikileaks on its Web site.
The note is based on sources whose names were expurgated.
It was written whereas Iouri Loujkov was still mayor of Moscow\; and it is mainly held responsible for corruption.
It was dismissed in October by president Dmitri Medvedev but there since then were little traces of cleaning.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who has a building firm of foreground, always denied the accusations of corruption during years\; and it gained several lawsuits in defamation on these charges.
In September, he declared what follows to a Russian TV channel, when it was questioned on documentary suggesting that it was corrupted: "It is insane, it is to throw, it is anything."
The Russians believe, with one crushing majority, that their company is corrupted\; according to the surveys.
But it is unusual to find the information stated in a report of embassy\; and it is amazing to conceive that would be to diplomats of a foreign country to do it.
The direct link drawn up between the government of the town of Moscow and the crime led certain people to name it the "dysfunctional one" and to affirm that the government functioned more like a kleptocratie that a government," according to the note of the embassy.
"The criminal elements enjoy a" krysha " (term used in the world criminel/la Mafia which literally means" roof "or protection) which passes through the police, the Federal security service (FSB), the ministry for the Interior (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor, like through all the bureaucracy of the government of the town of Moscow.
"Analysts to identify a structure in three levels in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, the MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Lastly, the ordinary criminals and the corrupted inspectors are on the level low."
"It is about an ineffective system in which the criminal groups fills a vacuum in certain fields where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that FSB brews the money of the more large companies and that the police target the small ones.
A source, he said, "explained why the owners of company of Moscow understood that it was preferable to obtain the protection of the MVD and FSB (rather than of the groups of the organized crime) because, not only, they have more weapons, more means and to be able more that the criminal groups but they are also protected by the law. "
"This is why the request for protection by the criminal gangs is not also any more high."
The note announces that, although the collection of the money is wide, protection itself can be unequal\; even those which pay are sometimes subjected to an arrest.
Those which do not pay quickly see their business closing under a pretext or another.
Medvedev evoked several times the fight against corruption but he admitted the little of progress.
The note of the embassy transmits reports mentioning men who bring bags, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on the bureaucrats," declared in a recent interview Gueorgui Satarov, director of the "think Indem tank" of Moscow.
"But he belongs to this bureaucracy."
"He does not belong to a political community because there are not some in Russia."
Without the policy, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to Indem, the costs of corruption would rise, at the level of very whole Russia, with more than 300 billion dollars a year.
The country was classified 154e in a recent survey on the total perception of corruption by the Transparency International non-governmental organization (the countries are classified at least with most corrupted).
The disclosure of the note of the American embassy, which has was carried out only yesterday, late in the Moscow evening, time, will stir up with certainty of dissatisfactions within the Russian government\; although Loujkov can be blamed, to a certain extent, for the failures of Moscow, that could be the occasion for the Kremlin to show that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin put forth the hypothesis that the documents of WikiLeaks could be a manufacturing and reacted with anger in front of the remarks that diplomats of the United States had revealed by calling it Batman and by bringing closer Medvedev to Robin.
"The problem rests on the fact that it is about our interaction, significant factor of the domestic policy in this country, he says.
"But to be honest with you, we did not suspect that it would be carried out with such an arrogance, such a pressure and, you know it, in opposition to ethics."
Veterans of the Khmer Rouges obliged to face the past
In a badly enlightened classroom with decrepit concrete walls of poor quality, the secondary principal of Anlong Veng evoked the man who had built it, the last chief of the Khmer Rouges, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"It was a leading good\; and he was concerned with his people," declared Sreng Kor My, 42 years old.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when it was to the Khmer Rouges, this commander remains popular in this bastion isolated from former Khmer Rouges in the North-West of Cambodia where it made build hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures\; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization live still today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouges went to the government, the honesty of long time is finally reconsideration with Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum of truth and reconciliation made it possible the victims to publicly face people who had taken part in the mode.
In June, the government distributed to it a handbook of high school which, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouges to the children of its former soldiers.
And, in July, a Kampuchean court, jointly directed with the United Nations, pronounced its first sentence concerning a former member of the Khmer Rouges, by condemning, at 35 years of prison, the former chief of sadly celebrates center of torture of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known under the name of "Duch."
In front of this evolution of the situation, the anxiety increased near the veterans of the Khmer Rouges of Anlong Veng\; complicating the efforts of reconciliation and their wills to reintegrate itself in the Kampuchean company.
"There are resentments and fear among the former Khmer Rouges but they are impotent to do anything," declared Chhang Youk, director of the Reference library of Cambodia, an independent organism which undertakes researches on the mode.
"For them, the life under the Khmer Rouges was glorious but the mode became a symbol of the evil."
"The situation generates divisions within the families."
Under the reign of the Khmer Rouges in Cambodia, of 1975 to 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were carried out or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnameses invaded and reversed the government of pol. Pot-Plain in 1979, the remainder of the mode and its army fled towards the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurrection which lasted until the last of the movements goes in December 1998.
Whereas Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary directed the guerilla of their base located in the mountains of the West of Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok prepared one following Anlong Veng.
But in the middle of the years 1990, after a peace agreement sponsored by UNO led to the first democratic elections of the country in 1993, of great groups of Khmer Rouge combatants started to make defection with the government, culminating with the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had held head, was captured by the governmental forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison of Phnom Penh in 2006 while waiting for his lawsuit.
Without their benefactors, most Khmer Rouge veterans sank in the utter destitution, commune with the rural regions of Cambodia\; and many are those which remain nostalgic movement.
Although some Khmer Rouge officers of elite kept their posts of local leader in return for to have deposited the weapons, it acts farmers not qualified with the low rank and file.
"These people profited from very little follow-up after the capitulation," declared Sok Leang of the Center for justice and the reconciliation which organizes public forums in all Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are soaked with the agrarian utopian ideology of the mode."
"They were high within a framework where to get bargains is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, which joined the Khmer Rouges like teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 like poor rice farmer.
"The life under the Khmer Rouges was good," he said.
"Ta Mok nourishes everyone."
But now, the life is difficult because we must provide for our own needs."
The court of the Khmer Rouges in progress also caused concern here.
The court would have, with the beginning of the year next, to start the judgment of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and of his wife, Ieng Thirith, another Khmer Rouge former minister.
The mandate of the court is to judge the top-ranking executives and the principal persons in charge of the crimes but it does not have says if it continued beyond these four cases.
It would be necessary some more to calm fears with Anlong Veng.
The last media speculations turned to Im Chaem, old of 64 years, former chief of district in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the reign of the Khmer Rouges in the years 1970.
In 2007, she said to the researchers of the Reference library of the Cambodia whom she had supervised the construction of the dam Trapeang Thma, a project where thousands of forced workers would have died.
Recently, at the time of one evening torrid, Im Chaem returned from work to the field located close to its house out of wooden on pile, on a dirt track apart from Anlong Veng.
Whereas the sun threw long shades on desiccated grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss its past within the Khmer Rouges.
If the court convened it, she says, it would refuse to go there.
"Cambodia east in peace and stable," said At it.
"If there are more continuations, there will be the war."
The Prime Minister Hun Sen, who made defection of the Khmer Rouges in 1978, also informed on several occasions that an instability would occur if the court continued several suspects\; although the experts and the historians dispute that.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past, At it said.
But to face the past is all that Cambodia must do to go from the front one, known as Youk Chhang, of the reference library.
"The reconciliation in terms Khmer is to reconnect the broken pieces, he says.
"We must put these pieces together so that we can understand."
The center produced the first handbook approved by the government on the Khmer Rouges, "a history of democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
It distributed it to Anlong Veng in June like supplement with the handbooks of history of the Ministry of Education, designed for the high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouges.
As in most Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know only some details about the Khmer Rouges, in spite of the bonds of the city to the mode.
Valeak touch, 19 years old, studying at the high school of Anlong Veng, declared that the new handbook helped the students to understand an important part of their history.
But his/her parents reacted with skepticism when it returned with the book to the house to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the handbook and the court," he says.
"They are wary because they do not know exactly how much people the court will continue."
Such a resistance made the process of reconciliation complex and difficult, Sok Leang declared.
But the public forums, the handbook and the court start to have an impact, At it said.
However, the Khmer Rouges preserve one atrait powerful here.
In the heights of the mountains of Dangrek, a way, invaded by weeds and strewn with plastic bags, led to a black soot rectangle, covered with a rusted sheet roof.
The body of Pol Pot was flaring here on a pile of tires after its death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, saleswoman of cellphone in edge of road, said that it did not know any much about the man who was incinerated at this place.
"But it has a great mind\; and from many inhabitants there will request, she says.
It was the birthday of Nuom Sothea and, later this day, it envisaged to go towards the last place of rest of Pol Pot where it would leave a ripe banana bouquet in the hope of bringing chance.
Bielorussia agrees to give up its uranium stock of military quality
The government of Bielorussia announced Wednesday that it was going to give up its uranium stock highly enriched, an essential component for the nuclear weapons\; this décison lies within the scope of a surprised victory of the countryside of president Obama to make safe the nuclear matters in the whole world
The agreement was revealed in a joint news release published after the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met the Belorusse Foreign Minister here, Sergei Martynov, in margin of a top on safety.
The US government had tried during years to convince Bielorussia to give up uranium highly enriched and seemed to have released the horizon last spring.
But the American officials declared in Washington Post that certain classified operations were carried out with Bielorussia during the last two months to eliminate 187 pounds from the military uranium of quality starting from a research center of Bielorussia.
That opened up the way for an agreement to Wednesday eliminate the remainder from the matter of approximately 500 pounds, according to a civil servant who evoked the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the question.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of the Summit of Nuclear safety of 47 nations, organized on the initiative of Obama\; where Bielorussia was excluded.
Apparently, it was advantageous to get an invitation with the Soviet ex-republic following the top, in 2012.
"I am really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the Top of Nuclear safety of 2012 Sommet nuclear power of safety."
"That proves to me that this process functions," declared Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for world safety, a group of promotion of nuclear safety.
Clinton qualified the agreement "of very significant, important stage" carried out by Bielorussia.
Obama committed himself in Prague in April 2009 making safe all the vulnerable nuclear matters throughout the world in the four years to come.
Since then, the US government helped six countries to get rid of all their uranium highly enriched.
Bielorussia would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Summit on the nuclear safety of Obama, the Belorusse president, Alexandre Loukachenko, stated that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We kept uranium highly enriched, hundreds of kilograms of what is primarily of the military uranium of quality and slightly enriched uranium," Mr. Loukachenko said then.
"It is our product... Us will not manufacture dirty bombs, and we will sell it to nobody."
"We will use it at ends of research, it is all."
Bielorussia approached the United States a few months ago\; however, by expressing interest to manage an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate uranium from Bielorussia, in October, was particularly complicated because the material had been slightly irradiated, indicated persons in charge.
It was charged on a special train which traversed more than 1,300 miles to an installation in Russia to be stored and eliminated, indicated persons in charge.
The second operation was completed Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the persons in charge.
The US government spent 13 million dollars in its efforts, mainly to replace the installations of research of Bielorussia with slightly enriched uranium\; misfit for the weapons.
"A meticulous coordination and an organization were put in work in order to reinforce confidence"\; thus leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, declared Andrew Bieniawski, a person in charge of the department of energy specialized in the Reduction of the world Threat.
According to the estimates of the Center of Study of Nonprolifération James Martin, Bielorussia had this year at least 88 pounds of military uranium of quality, as well as hundreds of kilos of uranium highly enriched.
Bielorussia seeks to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
The relations between Bielorussia and the United States are tightened since years, mainly because of hard repression by Loukachenko of the Human rights.
But the declaration of Wednesday suggested a potential revival.
"All while being pleased with progress on these questions of security world, the United States and Bielorussia recognized that a respect increased for the democracy and the Human rights in Bielorussia remained essential to improve the bilateral relations\; and essential to the progress of the country and its citizens," she declared.
The government did not emit any objection with the flights of the CIA
The government did not emit any objection with the flights of the CIA with prisoners Talibans and Al Qaeda in Guantanamo direction through Spanish territory, according to a telegram of the ambassador from the United States in Madrid.
That is shown by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks with the daily newspaper El País, which add that the first vice-president of the Government of this time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had asked that the Spanish Executive be informed for "pouvoir' to show that they exerted an adequate vigilance on the foreign planes which crossed Spain."
In June of 2006, after a report of the Council of Europe which showed of complicity in contrary practices with the human rights with a dozen countries, among which Spain, took place a meeting between the former North-American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández of Vega.
The vice-president recognized that the report of the Council "had surprised the Government of Zapatero off-side" and insisted on the fact that Spain had nothing there to hide.
"Of Vega stressed that Spain does not have an objection with regard to the flights of intelligence over Spanish territory."
"They want to only be informed" to prevent that one "takes them with deprived," Aguirre in a cable reports.
The holder of the Ministry of External of this time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, announced to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give to this business profiles it low possible, even if, as it was with the hands of the judges, the Government had a capacity of limited influence."
In his turn, to January of 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy the fact that it was not going to block the initiative of the judge to ask the declassification of the documents of the National center of Intelligence (CNI) and of the ministry for Defense on the flights of the CIA.
"These reports contain any accusing element, no sensitive information," explained the Embassy after having spoken with the prosecutor.
The United States showed nevertheless their concern for "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than for déclassifiée information of CNI O of the ministry for Defense.
"This coordination between the independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discreetly operate the case between the Governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March of 2007 during a lunch between the ambassador of the United States and the minister of Interns, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, this one commented to him that "even if the Spanish judges are madly jealous of its independence and will do what they consider adequate," it had given instructions to his collaborators "so that they avoid the comments of an ignited rhetoric, while trying to lower again the temperature."
The ambassador expresses also his concern for the action of PP in this business.
"In spite of its pro-American general orientation, our experiment suggests the fact that PP certainly will benefit from any indication according to which the Government of Zapatero tolerated or deliberately been unaware of the actions of the United States who could be interpreted like possible violations of the human rights, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," she announces.
The parricide who confessed felt sorry for in network of the "overwhelming pressure" to be mother
The young girl spoke about the child when he had already died and it had a blog: "Terror with Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname which it uses as soon as it was small, communicated with a cousin and at least a friend\; the two originating ones in Noia, the village of Coruña in which it is originating.
The messages go back to 2008.
To hear them, its love life should be known, that ABC builds with the assistance of testimonies of his/her parents.

The members of the Popular party would gain 4 seats in the Congress and the PSC would lose 9 of them
With the results of the 18-N, PP could be decisive in the municipes of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the important increase in votes and deputies recorded in last the autonomic elections, PP Catalan already aimed at the general ones because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes which this formation obtains in these comices normally doubles that which it receives in the Catalan women.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes with general of 2008, while with autonomic from 2006, they had obtained 316,222 from them.
Sunday spent, the PC obtained 384,091 votes.
If one maintains this tendency ascending, desired of a diversion of votes of the PSC and the development of consumer loyalty of the electorate of PP, the analysts of this formation calculated the fact that, if there would be general elections, the PC could passed from 8 to 12 deputies in the Congress, while CiU would gain of them also four (it has 10 now of them) and PSC would lose some neither more nor less than 9 deputies (he has 25 of them).
These calculate would note that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of popular, ERC would lose a deputy - it has three of them now - while ICV would keep a deputy or one would gain some.
But if the diary electoral is maintained, next appointment would take place in May of 2011 for the municipal comices, where the popular ones can also be decisive at the end of socialist hegemony in the four capitals of province and their relay in charge of the General advice of Barcelona, one of the administrations which handles the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Such an amount of the nationalists as the popular ones is of agreement with the fact that PSC could lose the town halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not obtain the majority either the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
By taking account of the rout republican, it would not be whimsical that this formation loses its representation in the town hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain the 5% of the votes.
PP increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced owing to the fact that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they controlled with PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Felix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, PP recorded only one difference in 500 votes compared to PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, maintain very good relationships with Mariano Rajoy - during this last countryside, they were found several times.
The popular ones recorded progress also in others municipes important like Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Now, PP is present in 34 municipal governments at Catalogne and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports with Al-Qaida
Except for the seven prisoners in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three of it
The seven Pakistani and the native of Niger held by agents of the general police station of Information of the Police of Barcelona formed a cell jihadist which, directed as of Thailand, facilitated passports with different groups Al-Qaida, between which "Tigers for the Release of the Tamilian Earth" (LTTE) and "Laskar E Taiba" (Let), the last being the author of the attacks of Bombay which caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry for the Interns gave a great importance to these investigations, at the point to ensure itself owing to the fact that with "the Kampai operation" "was debilitated" the apparatus of falsification of Al-Qaida with international level and "consequently, its operative capacity."
The investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years during which it was active in Catalonia, could sent thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to the groups which integrated the criminal galaxy Al-Qaida so that its "combatants" can pass the European borders and other countries Western with a total impunity.
The dismantled cell is only the network jihadist held operative in Europe, therefore in the investigations took part, except for services inhabitants of Thailand, other European police units, this is why in the territory of the European Union there could be the following days of the blows similar to that recorded the night of Tuesday spent to Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (one held the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the native of Niger Babatunde Agunbiade), in Thailand one unrolled another, with the capture of the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the inhabitant of Thailand Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They stays those which directed from Bangkok the cell established in Spain and in other European countries.
The Catalan network - of which a part was struck in 2009 - stole mainly of the tourists the passports which satisfied the conditions marked by named "the World Islamic front."
It be-with saying the documents were to be with name of old young men between 25 and 45 years, with a validity of several years and without visas stamped.
The investigators stress that until now one did not find any detail which connects the prisoners in Catalonia with the attack of Bombay, even if the author of this attack, "Laskar E Taiba," was one of the receiving groups of the stolen passports in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless it should be pointed out the fact that a few days before this attack is committed, of Catalonia one sent through an agency of transfers some miles of dollars which "were invested" to buy charts of mobiles which were used afterwards by the integral ones of the "commando" who killed 106 people.
The Police seized an abundant documentation.
PP requires of Mas that it suspend tax complicity
The leader of PC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the occasion to yesterday expose personally to Artur Mas his conditions to support his nomination as a president of Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the countryside and which are summarized to give priority with the recovery of the economy and the lack of adventures philosophy-souverainistes as is economic complicity that the nationalist leader wishes to approach with half of his mandate.
The president of the popular Catalans arrived at go with Artur Mas with the safety which gives the fact of having obtained 18 deputies with the elections Sunday spent, a number than sufficient to be more made like, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of formations qu will exert the oppositions abstains from in the voting the nomination.
On a possible agreement with PP future alliances depend which the nationalists wish to maintain in the Congress during the general elections, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the remainder of political leaders are done out of Catalan key.
And with regard to the president of PP, to support a nomination "it would be necessary to eliminate all the speeches souverainists and freedom fighters," and economic complicity - similar to that of the Pays Basque - that the convergent leader wishes to subject even to the referendum.
The two leaders in common have their bet to make lose weight the political apparatus a very exaggerated autonomic administration and the elimination of the tax applied to successions and donations.
Details of the negotiation on the nomination of Farmhouse will be occupied on behalf of PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Farmhouse met already with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - which promised a hard opposition -, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today it will do it with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric one affirms that deaths were not due to the "lack of measurements"
The owners of the center of Olot does not eliminate the possibility of that their male nurse of night killed more than 11 elderly people
The persons in charge of geriatric Caritat d' Olot (Gérone) offered yesterday a press conference to underline the injuries caused at the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the male nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people for which it was responsible in the interval that it worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Salted, presented himself accompanied by lawyer by the center, Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of Caritat would be that to be able to exert the charge against the person in charge" for deaths but "legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the processual situation of civil persons in charge."
And except for social discreditation that the entity can suffer not to have detected in time the criminal activities of the male nurse of night, the great threat for Caritat now takes the shape of an important compensation that the legal representatives of the parents of the victims calculate already.
Joan Vila Dilmé acknowledged that the first crime dates from August 2009 and that as from this day it did not cease killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence which it ordered the exhumation of eight body - former patients of the geriatric one - care it suspected that in much case no doctor explored the deceased ones personally but, being given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
Caritat, through its director, categorically denied yesterday this situation and mentioned that "the lack of measurements can have been in no moment the cause what did without."
The lawyer of Caritat added that "in this business there is only one index of imprudence on behalf of any other person that is not the defendant."
The already baptized person as "the Angel of Death" acknowledged 11 assassinations day before yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29th, 2009 and a month and half later he killed one second grandmother.
In this case it caused death to him by injecting an insulin sober-amount to him, with difference of the first crime which it had committed with one mix of pastilles sedatives.
The director of Caritat mentioned the fact that it is complicated to control the access of the staff of the center to medicines.
The insulin injections and the cocktail of sedatives had been the mechanism used into six of the nine crimes that the male nurse, in his desire to relieve the suffering of the interns, used to kill them.
But the analyses of laboratory will clarify if Villa does not lie by saying that he sought for his first victims a death less cruel or by opposite he burned them inside by giving them detergent as he already acknowledged that he made with the three women that he killed in the interval October 12th-17th.
Caritat does not believe the declarations of the male nurse of night, either the number of assassinations acknowledged, they do not eliminate the possibility of the number is larger and justify their attitude by the various versions that Vila gave in its visits to the County court and the lack of logic in the change in the manner of successfully killing after having made eight assassinations.
Therefore they declare that they will remain at disposal of justice to clear up the range of the facts.
ECB threatens
The investors have reacts abruptly yesterday to the threat of yesterday of Trichet who prevented that "the markets should not underestimate our capacity of reaction."
The differentials of the peripherals closed with the force and the actions of the banks Europeans underwent more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the capacity of ECB either to be mistaken and the euro hardly recorded an increment, which is a concerned signal.
What occurred yesterday is typical of a liquid market which same manner that it collapses, it is recovered, but moved by ends of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will be long in losing the fear.
One month ago, ECB quoted us today to withdraw measurements of liquidity and it will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those which remain about it.
Bundesbank required the finalization of the plan of purchase of national debt because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary measurements of liquidity in the long term and leaving only access unlimited to the week.
After the Irish crisis let us hope that one prolongs current measurements of liquidity "at least until March" and maintains the auction quarterly with access unlimited at the end of the quarter to guarantee the liquidity at least until June.
We hope that one will continue with the programme of purchase of obligations and that one gives even the signal to intensify it.
If they do not achieve the generated expectancies, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue plugged to withdraw measurements of liquidity, that God helps us!
Just as during their meeting of May in which they affirmed as they had not even considered the purchase of obligations and they collapsé the markets, the history could be repeated tomorrow.
ECB must be believable and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said that he had already bought much, by causing a new collapse on the market.
Yesterday the bidding of drafts at one year in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury emitted only 500 million to the 5.28% compared to 750 million to the 4.81% of the bidding former.
Even thus, the types in Portugal lowered 30 basic points in all the curve, and clearly reflecting a change of feeling of market after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland one published the figures of the hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The figures estimative represent 10,000 short-term million and 15,000 potentials and they have a time to obtain private capital until February or they will be nationalized.
Even if Ireland does not have any credibility after not having detected the problem in July with the test of stress, the figures are assumables in the Plan of Assistance and help to reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, every next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain the parliamentary approval of its new budget and it does not have a sufficient support yet, consequently Ireland remains in a hearth of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to slacken the tension before next Sommet of the Heads of state and government on December 14th in which it is necessary to find a compromise political which shows that we are a union and that we interpret all the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wishes to interpret Wagner and the remainder the anthem of the joy of Beethoven.
In Spain, the president had opportunity of presenting yesterday the plan of measures which the Council of Ministers will approve Friday.
Reform pensions, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, reduction of the deficit, liberalization, privatisation, measurements to reactivate employment sound with hearing of the investors like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explain the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange underwent the 4.5%, the double that the remainder of the European Stock Exchanges.
With difference in February, the reaction of the Government and Bank of Spain were fast and radical and we profit from the effect surprised.
Today there is a bidding-key of an obligation at three years which will be profited by the effect Trichet, consequently we hope that this one is solved with a strong demand and helps to dissipate the doubts about our capacity of refinancing.
For Spain to ask for a Plan of Assistance would be an auto--immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity which we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in liquidity available, triple compared to March, with very expensive types and they cut the access to the markets sine die.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of the wife of César, "except for being it, appearing it."
Courage, we can leave ourselves there!
President d' Eulen will dispute the council of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm does not cease in the conflict open in the center of the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will dispute, because he considers it "no one right," the legal adviser of El Enebro the next 16, requested by five of his seven sons in whom they will try to put forward their majority and to seize the bodies of management of the titular firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María Jose grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their litigation for control on the one hand group.
The founder of the larger holding of services of business for the companies does not appear to be laid out to yield in his litigation to be present in managements of El Enebro.
From its board of directors it was excluded by five from his seven sons which named administrators in the assembly of the shareholders of January 18th this year whose dispute is recorded with the Company and Trade register.
The legal adviser of El Enebro for the next 16, convened by the Commercial Magistrate Number 2 of Madrid, again opened the box of thunders within the Álvarez family.
The recourse to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is solved, the only mechanism which guaranteed the convocation of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Álvarez like a "desperate recourse of the applicants his/her five sons to test, through a processual quibble, by defrauding the Law clearly and while misusing the right, to validate and correct the radically worthless assembly on January 18th," according to its official spokespersons.
This argumentation will be the base so that, once the assembly takes place, is disputed by considering that this one is "worthless full."
The same protagonists, who maintain a discrete silence, already tested without success which the magistrate convenes an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a patrimonial and titular company of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, inter alia credits, the sons of David Álvarez control the 100% of the capital.
The founder of the group of services requests nevertheless usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to the familiar protocols.
This business is the basic problem that the judge must decide after the audience on the request for dispute for which there is not yet an announced date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon over Siemens
A software creates improvements on the cars at real time.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe speed was marked by the surprise and success.
In a first moment, nobody held in account the options of a new stable which had just arrived, in spite of the ascending trajectory of last the seasons, the past November, in the last phase of the championship they bet all on the triumph of Ferrari de Fernando Alonso.
Without lowering the skill as pilot of the champion, German Sebastien Vette, either the capacity of the Renault engine which propels its car, in the world of Formula 1 one speaks about the legend of the "weapon secrecy" that the multinational company Siemens put at the hands of Red Bull to transform it in a team winner.
It is actually about a powerful software of simulation of process which the German company launched on the market in 2007 with objectives very far away from the automobilistic high-level competition.
Named PLM, this powerful data-processing instrument was used to create assembly lines of the factories producers of everyone, stations of energy, instruments of utmost precision.
The objective is to reproduce, accurately simulate the product or the process before building it in a real way, by thus avoiding the avoidable defects and costs.
PLM facilitated the development of the cameras of Canon, the planes of Sukhoi or most famous the commercial vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, person in charge of the industrial division of Siemens, explains the fact that the use of this data-processing instrument in its factory of Formula 1 allowed Red Bull to create and carry out "in a few hours, almost in real time," the modifications, changes and improvements detected during the races and tests.
Russwurm explains why the stables of the year 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their teams which was able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on the vehicles each season.
In the team of Red Bull 180 young professionals of high qualification work today who, equipped with powerful computer equipment analyze and project any kind of modifications on the racing cars.
The leader of Siemens explained that software PLM is able to analyze and improve all the elements of the racing cars of Red Bull except the engine, which is exclusive responsibility for Renault.
One modifies materials, fuel, the aerodynamics and the members safety.
The changes can pass from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 12 midnight, thanks to advanced systems of production by laser and autoclaves of high technology.
As single limitation of this madness of the technological improvement there is the amount of 40 million dollars which each team of Formula 1 can spend like limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull established the factory of high technology to create and produce its racing cars in a locality with 50 kilometers of London.
They are two buildings where the visits, especially for the journalists, are restricted.
All that occurs over there is considered "secret signal."
Staff for this duty counts to 580 people, Ci-included two pilots, the Vettel champion and Mark Webber.
The hero of Formula 1 of Red Bull, undoubtedly, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Between the immense technological resources that the energy drink mark has met with the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is priceless and worthless notoriety.
The director of technology of the factory, Steve Nevey, affirms that five years ago one could affirm that progress of R+D in the case of racing racing cars brought the 50% of the victories and the pilots were responsible moreover.
Today these percentages changed and technology accounts for the 85% of success, while the pilots bring the 15% of the added-value.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by data processing, because "they are unforeseeable gladiators."
HP will install in the two Twenties clean stores with local distributers
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated in Barcelona its first exclusive store in collaboration with its associate Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of the network of 20 trade between 80 and 100 square meters which the multinational envisages to install in Spain during the two next years.
The company will enter this initiative with the 16 zones already present in centers multimarque like PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave like example the altered store located on Gran Vía of Barcelona, property of Bridge Reyes, with which that made 30 years that she collaborates.
The North-American group prepared a plan to establish 200 retail outlets of mark in Europe in 2013, strategy which includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The open first were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) the past week, that of Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal next the possible stores, even if she acknowledged that Madrid could be the following destination.
The director of HM personal systems ensured that philosophy for the establishment of the stores will be always the same one, with the support of a local distributer with experiment and knowledge of the sector.
The North-American group advises and deals with the design of the exclusive furniture of the stores (with products which can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will hold an identical image.
Moreover, HP covers the staff training of the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a system of frankness and stressed that the exclusive network of trade claims "to improve the service offered to the customers and PMEs in the purchase, the assistance, the post-sale and even packing."
The store of Barcelona includes a space with a program controls pioneer on world level which solves the possible problems of computer equipment of HP in guarantee.
An on-line service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht (Holland).
"Thus, in 10 minutes we can solve problems which can often take even two days."
"This system is conceived especially for MPEs and users, because the large companies contracted services of technical assistance already," Helena Herrero noticed yesterday.
Sabadell bets on "stealing" a million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than of other leaders, the managing director of Sabadell Bank value, I like Guardiola, think that 2011 will be one year hard for the banking environment, but initially reject a new crisis of liquidity and predicted the end of the war of the liability.
In spite of that, it envisages a collapse of the margins of the interests, which one will try to compensate for partially with increments of the commissions and price of the credit.
Sabadell wait to collect in three years a million particular customers, his task to be achieved.
Sabadell found a way to be exploited during the three future years and to be able to survive thus in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will start in 2011 a new master line which will hold one goes three years lability.
The objective, except for surviving without need for resorting to the public allocations of FROB, is to gain a dimension of market by the collecting of a million new particular customers - 700,000 if one deduces those which can leave the bank, its great task to be achieved, because until now this bank had spoiled more PMEs and the companies that the particular customer.
This year it collected 250,000 particular customers and 50,000 companies.
Its dimension of market to the private individuals is of 3.5%, while at the companies it exceeds the 10%.
Another base of the plan 2011-2013 is the bet on productivity, or what is the same thing, of austerity, with cost reduction like objective, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when it has the results for the period ended.
Few banks now dare to set to make objectives and them public, because the financial crisis disturbed all the plans of the world banking environment.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year its master line Optima, establishes there is four years old, even if initially the plan were for three years, but the market situation determined its prolongation for a exercise moreover.
The customers who let escape the savings banks will be his main objective.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted on the fact that 2011 will be one year "difficult and transcendental."
The executive, in fact, thinks that the exit of the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
Moreover, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create work stations," which is fundamental for the survival of the banking business, insisted it.
And even if he thinks that the war of the liability - which penalizes the margins - is reduced, the price of the allowances for risk which the banks and cases pay for its emissions to obtain liquidity move already at the cost of credit to compensate for the fall of the margins.
"The aspect of the liquidity and the financing is structural and will be a factor of pressure on the credit."
"We did not tighten the tap, but the differentials are higher," Guardiola recognized.
Banesto already gave orders to its network to limit the long-term credit and to increase the price of the differentials - to see CincoDías of the November 22nd and 27th -.
He also acknowledged that the tendency of the banking environment now "is to increase the commissions," but "there is a competitive framework."
The master line of Sabadell is based on the organic growth even if, like always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporative operations.
It is not in vain that it ensures that in Spain "one will request larger dimensions."
"All will move the next year," he ensured.
He affirms that the needs for capital "increase enormously" and some Spanish financial entity could enter to the red numbers.
And it mentions that the FROB can in the case of replace the market in the collecting of funds new recapitalisations.
After having ensured that Sabadell can survive the temporal fence of the markets, it decreased the importance owing to the fact that some banking predicts already like a new crisis of liquidity.
It announces that one cannot emit, but contrary to what occurred in June, one can obtain short-term financing through rest, which attenuates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of one second wave of fusions among the cases
The chief executive officer of ECSC, Jose Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a new wave of fusions of savings banks and insisted again on the speed with which the reorganization of the sector is carried out.
When the lawsuit of concentration of the Spanish savings banks started, there were several entities which ensured that they were not going to take part in this first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the chief executive officer of the Spanish Confederation of Savings banks (ECSC), Jose Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations.
"I think that most of fusions was carried out, one cannot say that the incorporation of Cajasol in the group of Banca Cívica is one second phase, they are adjustments."
"The majority were carried out completion\; it is possible that instead of 17 one goes to 13 or 14, but all the great processes were carried out already under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which collaborated much in this operation also," the leader underlined.
In the declarations during a breakfast of the Association of the Leaders and Executives of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the process of concentration is carried out "at more possible high speed and we must be very satisfied with the manner that it is carried out within the deadlines that one fixed in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain," he emphatisé.
"The passage of 45 cases with an average of 28,500 million volume of the credits with 17 with 75,500 million is a lawsuit without equal in the history, by reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to be in conformity with Basle," he underlined.
Olavarrieta recognized that "there are a series of opinions rather not very happy on the slowness of the process" which shows "a lack of serosity and direction," because "what the Bank of Spain made is to recall that one must respect the time before the end of the year."
The chief executive officer of ECSC, Jose Antonio Olavarrieta, ensured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system of any Europe and "probably" of the world and it allotted to the people who question it a "lack of knowledge."
The leader mentioned that being given the current economic conjuncture, "we can remain very quiet" with the situation of the financial entities and of the savings banks, a system which began a "very important" process of concentration and "goes at the possible larger speed."
He also recalled that the Spanish banking environment of it is quite drawn from the tests of stress that ECB realized in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin chose to remain in the euro, but it has establishes the conditions for all the Union.
The tensions of the markets caused a doble governmental answer.
On a side, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, which vary tax reductions for PMEs, regulation of the private agencies of placement or suppression of the 426 euros assistance to the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatisation of the 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and of the 30% of the Lotteries of the State.
Of another, the Elena Salgado vice-president, with the support of former president Felipe González, links herself with criticisms of the chancellor Angela Merkel with regard to her responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How these should movements be interpreted?
It should be mentioned that the position of Merkel is not an error in its communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what must be its future, which shocks with that to maintain the old traditions of the majority of its partners.
Vis-a-vis European resistances, in Germany one starts to speculate in the three possible exits of the crisis.
The first, one euro strong, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, inter alia country, and the south would give up the monetary area.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, even if maintaining that seems science fiction, with a very favorable trend of public opinion, close to one 50% of the population.
The third, a new design of the euro, on line with the German proposals for a greater macro-economic control, strict budgetary policy, fines with the countries which transgress them, of possible suspensions of payment of one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of the potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and that made a long time that it is defined, consequently now it does not have there room for excuses.
Initially, in 2009, when such an amount of the IMF as the European Commission stimulated the deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them starting from 2016.
That was the first signal of divergence between what Germany thought that one was to make (plane tax rigor and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, Ci-includes France, practiced.
The second blow of the country center-European was when Merkel prolonged the decision with difficulty to save Greece.
As of this moment it was the object of a wild criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and published were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, around the end of October, Merkel expresses a clear position again, while asking reforms it treaties of the Union to make possible the rescue of a country and to oblige at the same time with the private lenders to support a share of the cost.
This position was interpreted like anti-European, because it precipitated the Irish crisis and the remainder.
But its proposal, although a little edulcorated, was approved and, the months following, should attend to us the reform process of the Union which makes possible these mesures starting from 2013.
Germany traced a red line which she does not think of crossing.
And she tells us with all that, even if now one must take measures with which one is perhaps not too much agreement, starting from this date there the old operation of the euro would have finished.
2013 will mean the birth of new monetary area, in which the countries which transgress the rules will severely be sanctioned, they can be obliged with declared in suspension of payment and, in this case, the private sector will support also a party of the costs.
Germany announces us that we must follow a severe way of growth with high rates of savings and investment, moderation in consumption, of the improvements in the productivity and competitiveness and of trade balances positive.
An alternative based on the debt and construction, with enormous holes in the balance of payments, as that which chaired the Spanish growth in the years of the boom, will simply not be tolerated.
The setting is clear.
And it would be badly not to hear it.
It is not only a question of renewing the public deficit to the 3% in 2013.
What one us request is much harder.
And what it should not absolutely do in these circumstances is to mislead us ourselves.
I hope that current turbulences let arrive towards us a larger peace.
And that one can seize opportunity that one gave us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that president Zapatero also heard it this form and its double declaration (reform them Saturday promised after the meeting of the past with the large companies and the announcement of yesterday of new measurements) suggests that, in spite of criticisms of Merkel, one opened the way with the thesis which it is necessary to put of the order for the house.
But the red line that Germany traced is there, and they do not seem to move it.
And among the possibilities that one considers, one cannot exclude that to give up a monetary area too much faggot of not very serious country.
And in this case, Germany us will be able to always say that she had informed us.
Sport and fraud of the law
The tricks similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show ingeniousness but not the will to escape a sanction.
The expulsion warped in theory by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the match of November 23rd against Ajax in the League of the Champions made run much ink on the character anti-sportsman of such behavior and if the two players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As it is known, a few minutes before finishing the match (that their team already gained clearly), the two players deliberately wasted time when they made faults to determine the referee to show them the second yellow paperboard.
Thus, and considering Real Madrid will end up being a leader of its group, the two players will achieve the lawful sanction during the nearest match of the match of stopping against Auxerre and will be able to pass without paperboards to the next phase.
Finally, the committee of discipline of UEFA sanctioned with two matches the trainer of the team, Jose Mourinho and of various economic sums to the implied players.
The provocation of a yellow paperboard in circumstances like this one or similar is not a new practice, if not rather attends in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it makes party of the ethos, of the rules not-written, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate appeared in the reported case must with the fact that this had like protagonist a team of the entity of Real Madrid (which in her anthem posts the nobility and the honor and which in last occasions condemned to a fine with its players for similar acts) and with orchestrated dramatization, it seems, by Mourinho, which adds an episode moreover to its dilated history of thespian and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate asks whether this kind of behavior not prohibited expressly by the regulation contradicts the principles of the sport, i.e., so with these actions one makes a fraud of law\; because, indeed, they are respectful actions with the sporting regulation, but seem to elude its direction.
The question is to examine the type of damage which they cause with the sporting spirit.
One of the goods which understands the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of the unfavourable players, an aspect that with these actions was not endangers, i.e. it did not have violent play there.
Another of these goods to which one alludes with the correct play is to prevent that the team of the players offenders benefits from an unjust manner of the contrary team, which is not the case either.
However, the fact paradoxical of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not adapt so that one characterizes normally like cheating O defrauds law, because its violation of the rules was not carried out seals some to try to avoid the sanction, but their action precisely tried to be most obvious possible to receive the penalization of the referee.
They waited and they accepted the sanction readily.
Another question is the type of advantage which the offenders obtain as of the examined disposed faults.
Here it seems necessary to note that one does not put in a situation of disadvantage to the rival and one does not obtain an advantage in the same match either, because obviously the result of the action supposes the fact of leaving their own team with less players.
And it is not a useful strategy for the next match either, because the club could not count on these players.
Obviously the advantage consists in the fact that the players will begin the next phase of the League of the Champions without paperboards which can threaten their participation in a future match.
But that is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and except for that, with this action the players achieve a match of sanction and pass to the second cycle of paperboards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of the paperboards occurs with one of less than with the first cycle.
So that, to climb the levels, it is not so clear that is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary with the sporting spirit, of which part nevertheless decision making is strategic which supports the profit to the maximum of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not actuate to avoid the application of the sanction (that would be indeed a case clear of fraud of the law), m if not they rather chose the moment in which they were subjected to it.
They made a strategic decision without thwarting the penalty nor to flee that one.
Even if the border between the genius and the fraud of the law is diffuse, in this occasion I think that one had a case clear of genius.
The polemic, seems to me it, appears because of two factors: because there were two auto--expulsions and because of the manner of transmitting the director to cause them.
The evil caused with the principles of the sport by these actions is not ethical as much like esthetics.
Offensive of offered to collect the dinners of Christmas for groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of celebrations financed by the employees who wish to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the touron and the lottery, when December arrives return also the dinner of groups before Christmas which continue to be the oxygen cylinder for the restaurants and entertainment of Barcelona, but which because of the crisis has to emerge in an offensive you prices adjusted to be able to collect with the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meal, coincide the businessmen and associations of the sector interviewed.
To complete to complicate accountancy, the calendar of this year (as the night of the New Year's Eve fall Friday) concentrated the requests in the week of December 13th, having like result until now an avalanche of reservations of dinners for the peak days (17 and the 17) and almost nothing the former week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies which eliminated the collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, much employees organize them by paying their own pockets.
Any is the economic situation, they ask all of the prices of battle, confirms president de Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of employers', now, does not dare to predict how will be the festivals this month.
"People reflects much before reserving."
"They want to leave but they pay much attention at the prices," he mentions.
The business will go well "for those which give quality at handsome price and with a good service," he adds, and recalls that the customers have the tendency to descend a level with the crisis, so that the slice around the 25 euros became majority in the request.
In a survey in various establishments of the center one notes the collapse of requests for the night of the 17.
The Soteras group indicates that there is an authentic boom of requests for this vendredi-là, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, which they answered by adapting their menus to the economic situation, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal of Rita, Market, Founded It and others), the characteristic of the calendar supposed more anticipated reservations, even at the beginning of November.
"We made the impossible one to maintain the same prices of the last year, with menus for all the tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they detail.
YEAR Grup, which understands El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and total of 23 buildings, is maintained optimistic after having detected a rise of the invoicing since second half of the year and good, although concentrated, perspective of business for Christmas.
Sources of the group mention that the 18 will be also a hyperactive day on the level of groups of friends who celebrate in advance the festivals.
To their six menus of group they added for Christmas, with 30 euros or more like famous budget and perception of there is a predisposition to spend one 10% more than the last year instead of requiring more details, as the Catalan wine manufactured according to the Champagne method - "undermined."
They see also the first signs of improvement in certain companies invite their employees again and the feeling which the volume of the groups increased a little.
On behalf of the employers Fecasarm (which includes entities like the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment of Barcelona), its vice-president, Enric Gomà, entrust in the possibility of starting to see final tunnel and support that overall the reservations "are animated," even if the customers "negotiate to the maximum."
That is true, the hope with regard to the festivities did not drop, indifferently which pays, he indicates.
The Pakistani nuclear program generates great concern in the United States
Produced Islamabad of the atomic weapons at "intervals faster than does not matter that another country."
Filtrations of Wikileaks confirm connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The contents of the correspondence between the American embassy of Pakistan and the State Department of the United States filtered by the Wikileaks gate confirm enormous concerns which causes in Washington the Pakistani nuclear program.
Except for the lighting and tasty details that offer on the contents of the conversations and thoughts of the North-American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that the co-operation between the two countries in the field of atomic safety, instead of increasing, "decrease" and that unstable produced Asian country of the nuclear weapons "at intervals faster than any other country of the world."
The characteristic of the Pakistani nuclear program - the fact that the weapons are not assembled, but they are stored by components to make difficult their destruction in the event of attack - is one of the main reasons of concern in Washington.
Thus the ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, enumerates in a report before the visit of the former adviser of National security, James Jones: "Proximity of certain nuclear installations of the territory under attack Taliban, the dispersion of the nuclear materials whose noise runs and vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The a large number of people implied in the nuclear arsenals and the programs of missiles is considered, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, like proliferating and a reason to maintain the guard.
"Pakistan has to engage of staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear installations\; being given the fall of the educational and cultural levels, the organizations extremists have more opportunities to recruit people who works in the nuclear programs or of missiles" the expert Yuri Korolev declared, of the Ministry of External Russian during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new one of the documentation filtered by the gate of Julian Assange is the co-operation each time more reduced between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high Pakistani degree of production of armed nuclear.
A dispatch of the Embassy in May, which qualifies like "frustrating" the communication with Pakistan, supports what follows: "The transparency is frequently non-existent\; the offers of assistance remain unanswered or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, civil servant of the National Intelligence for the south of Asia, note that "in spite of the economic catastrophe, produced Pakistan of the nuclear weapons at intervals faster than any other country of the world."
The ambassadress Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit of the chief of the Army, the general Ashfaq Kayani, whom it makes understand "very clearly" with the person in charge that "the Army of Pakistan must finish with the tacit support with the terrorist groups."
With the hunting of the chief of Wikileaks
Obama will number with a high ranking official for the fight anti-terrorist to avoid the new infiltrations.
Interpol emits a Red Alert to follow the movements and to locate in Assange.
All the related aspects with Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have a certainty on the facts.
Yesterday Interpol emitted a "Red Alert" "to locate and follow the movements" of Assange.
Nevertheless, it is not about a traditional order of arrest.
Moreover, this one is not new, if not it date of November 20th.
And this one does not have anything with even with last filtration of more than one quarter million of diplomatic documents of the United States but with the charges of sexual abuse that the Australian one faces in Sweden.
Moreover, the creative lawyer of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police knows where and how to contact Mr Assange."
The 20 body international police officer having the seat in Lyon (France) dictated the order with request for Sweden, but it did not do it public until yesterday, after having received the authorization of the authorities of this country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol received the indication to identify or locate Assange "to obtain its provisional arrest and its extradition."
Even if Interpol cannot give the order of arrest of an affected individual by a Red Alert, much among the member countries, according to the explanations of the organization, consider the call red note a free track for the arrest --that the national body of the police must realize -, especially if they have a bilateral agreement of extradition, as it is the case of Sweden and England, where it is thought that Assange is.
The movement made indignant with the lawyers of Assange, who yesterday published a letter dénonceant the fact that the founder of Wikileaks, 39 years, showed himself laid out to answer by videoconference with the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained the license to leave Sweden of the prosecutor of its case, that one compared to famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, chief of the safety of Stalin.
"That seems to be a hunting, not a legal persecution," denounces the missive.
While the world seeks it - and in Australia his/her mother defends the innocence of her son -- Continuous Assange to be in an unknown place, but it is not keep silent.
Monday it granted as of an unspecified place an interview to the director of the Time review through Skype, a conversation in which it asked the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If one can show that it was responsible to have to give orders to the American graduates whom they spy on with UNO by violating the international treaties that the United States signed, it should resign," has he says.
Its opinion was insulted yesterday by the secretary of press of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who qualified like "ridiculous and absurdity" the request for resignation.
"I am not at all sure why the opinion of a type with a Web page should interest us," he declared for CNN.
Obama himself charged a high ranking official with the fight anti-terrorist, Rusell Through, to prevent new escapes of documents.
The test of the spokesperson of president Barack Obama to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the opinions that the preserving politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who starting from January will chair the Committee of National security in the Lower House asked the State Department that he study the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate his funds and to continue with any person who provides them contributions or assistance."
Still further Tom Flanagan, an adviser of Canadian president Stephen Harper went, who has to reconsider his declarations after having said that Assange will have "to be assassinated."
"Obama should transform it into objective and use a plane without crew or something similar."
A person who did not ask for excuses was Mike Huckabee, minister Baptist, ex-governor of Arkansas and possible candidate to the presidency.
"That which is in the Government which filtered information is guilty of treason and all that is not an execution would be a too pleasant punishment," he declared for Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with winks with the followers of Carod
The republican leader will allow the party a secret voting on his continuity.
Huguet proposes executive the plural and the end of the system of assembly.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the receipt to solve the umpteenth internal revolt inside ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The president of the party is conscious owing to the fact that its threat of resignation is not sufficient for the followers of the former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time it knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as its liar and than that cannot absolutely give him headaches which it had with other extinct currents.
Therefore the leader of Esquerra will try to gain his new critics with winks which enable him to be armoured until the local elections.
To start, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national advisers of ERC will be able to come to a conclusion about its continuity in secrecy.
By paper ballots, not while raising the hand.
If the carodists want to convey a certain vote of penalization to the president, they will be able to do it without any fear with the reprisals.
In fact, the chief of rows wants to avoid the image of division and that of tender to his person.
In several interviews he affirmed that he would not be considered not ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "with Bulgarian" would not be good either.
The close people with Carod require with the president a little more than to place his position at the disposal of the militance, a gesture that not be worth when Puigcercós controls the body maxim between the congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to approve with the executive a roadmap until May.
For that, they hope to take part in the development of the strategic document of reorientation that the direction will subject to the voting of the national council the 18.
Its intention is to support Puigcercós in return for the promise of this one to program the congress for the autumn of 2011, which the leaders regard as a sure fact.
The leader of ERC acknowledged that the "polyphony" affects the stability and that its objective is to make that once and for all the organization is able to wash its linen room in family.
In this line, the article that the current adviser Josep Huguet signed in his blog results symptomatic.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the holder of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in return for various objectives" it is as if had been done.
And it enumerated five of them, of which it underlines two.
The first, "to recompose" the executive so that it accounts for at least 90% of the militance, i.e., to include new figures which come from the sector follower of Carod.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that liquid ERC of once and for all the assembly like mechanism of operation.
Thus, it defends one reforms statutes which allows the realization of the congresses through delegates elected by vote.
To finish with the model of assembly, an exception in the system of Spanish parties, was an obsession of the team of Puigcercós, which fought already in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, conclave of 2008 convulses it charged the direction with revising the model of assembly in a specific congress of reforms statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished, because the internal tide of last the years did not recommend to broach this subject.
Now, without critical sectors with the mounting, the moment could be good to take it again and close it for always.

On another side, it lit that it is not the moment to think of 2012 and there never was on the negotiation table an alliance for the presidential candidate.
Nava Vázquez was declared convinced owing to the fact that Acción Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections of the next December 4th and 5th when one should elect a successor.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect which never was on the negotiation table, at least for the moment, that was an approach for the local elections which had success and achieved its goal," he mentioned.
The leader panist mentioned that SIDE is supported by 71 years of dialog, reason for which "competition interns does not frighten us\; on the contrary "let us enjoy we it and makes us stronger," he declared.
He said that undoubtedly the council will be able to reduce le/la better dirigeant/e which Acción Nacional needs for the three following years, therefore he would give raises it "with the person determined by the council."

Obama promotes in Twitter the law with favor of the students without papers
"If you are of agreement with the approval of the Law Dream Act, call keep silent senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitté the US president in the popular social network has.
President Barack Obama east meets today in the national mobilization to support the Law Dream Act, to legalize the students without papers, with a message in his own account of the Twitter social network.
"If you are of agreement with the approval of the Law Dream Act, call keep silent senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitté Obama has.
Its short message maintains open a cybernetic bond with a fuller document which requires of the public to contact the senators immediately, because the vote with the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote which one hopes for soon, maintaining it is the moment to listen to your voice," he announces.
The message was revealed after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of the reductions of the taxes of the time of Bush and the financing of the government are prolonged.
Such a blocking, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Law Dream Act and other projects like the ratification of new treaty START with Russia against the proliferation of the nuclear weapons.
Questioned on the republican blocking of the Law Dream Act and other projects, the presidential spokesperson Robert Gibbs declared that it is confidant that once the tax problem is solved one will be able to fix a agende for the remainder of the projects.
"I think that one has much time..."
"We are all of agreement which it is necessary to solve this tax problem before the end of the year..."
"I think that we can obtain an agreement at one time given in this direction and then we will be able to plan the sequence moreover," has says it.
The leader of the democratic majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced Tuesday that it was going to ask for a "vote of debate closure" for the Law Dream Act, reason for which the initiative to legalize the students without papers could be voted starting from next Thursday in the Senate, even if most probable would be the next week.
The senatorial version of Dream Act or the Law of the American Dream would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived at the United States before the 16 years age, they remained in this country the five last years and they were accepted by an institution of higher education or the Army.
But the partisans require 60 votes to approve the initiative, reason for which they require the contest of a large number of republicans, in moments when the organizations well-wishers of the project protagonists an intense lobbying to guarantee the approval of the Law.
The democrats, the majority whose supports Dream Act, have 58 places.
Nevertheless at least one of them, the senator Ben Nelson de Nebraska, said that he would vote in against and only one republican expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
Therefore the partisans of Dream Act require the vote of several republicans so of other democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Between the most courted republicans there are the senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and the outgoing senator George Lemieux, of Florida, which supplemented the mandate known senator Mel Martínez.
Other republicans who supported in the past Dream Act are Orrin Hatch, of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, of Texas, but they declared that they were not going to support it in another occasion.
Another republican who supported it, John McCain, did not define his posture until now.
Even if the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts are of agreement with the fact that the larger obstacles of Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literatures one puts the finger on the wound
The second stage of the Pleasures of the language was a walk in which the participants made display of the narration
"Do the sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the wound? what am ego hoped for? ," asked the writer invited Luisa Valenzuela has to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle which celebrates the Spanish literature and who this time used the subtitle of his question (during another fair the round table was dedicated to the Sex in the language, explained it).
The finger on the wound..." puts to us in the embarrassment," launched gently the Argentina writer to the public, most young people, who had met in the International exhibition of the Book of Guadalajara (WIRE) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and in which took part Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz defined afterwards as a great history, with Luisa in first nobody as a protagonist who seeks knowledge which is the "wound," it goes from a doctor to another, without obtaining an answer, only tracks in the same narrative wire.
The infectiologist it leaves convinced: "patience is not my fort, it is perhaps my wound."
At the end, after one frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut the breath in the middle of the corridor to him, but which explains to him why wound is not a scientific term\; it is the psychoanalyst whom the mystery reveals: "the wound is what is actually open, the symbolic system is the scar."
The protagonist sighed relieved and concludes: "on the wound I only could know that it which is actually open and which it does not exist," but is convinced owing to the fact that the pleasures and the traps of the language must be very dependant between them.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez as exposed a charming narration as it entitled Éloge with the invention, where the finger on the wound is not numbered but at a given time is discovered.
With keys of magic realism, he speaks about a famous enchantress who touched clouds, made turn over people which had been gone far or repaired virtues that a damsel had lost, a narration which America transfers to speak then, the great news which had as of the beginning its own chroniclers and quoted in Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticizes excesses of the narrations of the capitans conquerors.
"Cervantes which invented us all (writers) is made fun of the false witnesses which appeared in the stories presented like real, but of a aitre manner one would never have told the history of America with an imagination which missed even decency."
Nevertheless, it, "they underlined insane and the liars have best imagination" and here reality converges with the lie, one does not know any more which share of the narration belongs to a band or another, where the literature of fiction reaches its apogee.
One calls that in fact the "tradition of Cervantes."
"It is thanks to its heritage which one is what one tells."
In his turn, the writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the WIRE with its round table owes It on the wound.
The Cubanone has met it his on the large wound of social violence that its country crosses - and the Latin America divides - produced arguments of adulterates and the sale of drugs.
"I think that the good literature, good poetry the good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not of course premeditated," indicated it, after quoting that the reality of the literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment which is established between the author and the readers, and who it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening is finished with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also underlined "it must on the wound of the committed writer."
He considered that in a world which also lives out of high speed as for the intellectual practices and the control of the consciences which turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, "behind each assertion there is small not and behind each negation there is small yes."
"To be the Masters of our own feelings and to be the Masters of reality, we must moderate: and to moderate means much time to pose the finger on the wound and to disturb the people who feel very convenient while thinking in caricature, white and black, established ideas and without nuance and to also disturb with the powers which prefer a world in white and black," has he says, while inviting to recover the direction to write.
Romano with the hunting of its first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finales it had tops and bottoms in its career, but it knew to reach three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there is in more two different styles which are confronted, marked by their technicians, who find between them a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finales, it had tops and bottoms in its career, but it knew to reach three times the decisive series, even if until now it did not put in the thousand and therefore this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentinian one ended up being comforted with the medal of under-champion, there remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played of the consecutive finales.
The strategist santist arrived at his first final as a trainer in the Tournament of Opening 2002, when it held the reins of Morelia with which it lost with a total result of 4-2 against Toluca\; later on, in the Fence 2003 it arrived also at the decisive duel and again lost with the total result of 3-1 and that was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the Tournament Bicentenary 2010, again against Diablos, Rubén a reverse suffered again, because its team made a match equal of 2-2 against Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the series of penalties it obtained an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to obtain the title and finally three of its players missed by 11 meters and it suffered the jump with the result from 4-3.
Rubén lost two finales with Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, its rival with the tournament, consequently it does not want to have the same fate, it tries to be detached from the evil spell to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, even if it affirms that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be champion, I do not want to break any statistics, that is for a club, not for a passion which I have and consequently I will obtain the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," the quartermaster commented on when one asked him who would be its weak points in the finales.
He remembers much the last finale, of which he ensures that he learned much, "the single lesson that we can retain it is that until the referee does not whistle the final one, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players also, because the last time, with two penalties to draw we were already prepared to run and I believe that is a lesson, before the end of the match one cannot celebrate."
It knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry it, because it entrusts in its players: "One never seeks to arrive at the series of penalties, one tries to finish within the regular time, but sometimes it remains us only to prepare us, the former tournament we were prepared, unfortunately the destiny made us a nasty trick, sometimes they are the emotions or distresses to hold the title between our hands, hands it has escaped us, that was useful to us like lesson for this final and we hope that one does not arrive any more in this situation."
Romano now has the opportunity more of not being a one technician under-champion and of tasting for the first time the glory offered by the titles.

NASA will announce the extraterrestrial discovery of life
The space agency of the United States quoted the press to present tomorrow a discovery which will have impact on the research of the being alive in space.
The National administration of the Aeronautics and the Space (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, a astrobiologic discovery, which could proves the theory of the existence of the extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented in a press conference tomorrow Thursday, at 13:00 hours with the head office of NASA in Washington for experts in astrobiology, the science which studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of the life in the Universe.
When it quoted the press, NASA ensured that it would present which will have impact on the research of the extraterrestrial life," which caused speculations on behalf of the experts of other countries.
The discovery could show the theory according to which there are creatures similar to us and in the ambient hostile ones that one thought uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming beings intelligent as the human ones if its living conditions are improved.
It seems that one speaks about a microbe discovered at the bottom of Mono Lake in the Yosemite National park, California, which saw in ambient that one thought too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
Of any form, the creature uses the arsenic one like a manner of living and this capacity makes us think that a similar life could exist on another planets which do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to the astrobiologists, if these organizations use the arsenic one in their metabolism, that proves that "there is another form of life, one second form of life, different with that which we know."
The space agency will communicate the true range of the discoveries in the press conference of tomorrow, Thursday.
In the conference the geobiology Pamela Conrad will take part, which studies the possibility of life over Mars\; and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (the largest Saturn satellite), under the prospect for that its chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.
Germinate PRD, Pt, Convergencia and Patrón "block" adverse
With reform with the Organic law of the Congress, one makes possible the arrival of the "two-party system," one denounces.
The 60è had just settled when in the Congress appeared an adverse block directed by appoint PRD, Pt, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, which was declared independent and the four questioned a thing: the arrival of the "two-party system" to the Rooms.
Before initiating the session of installation of the 60-e Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia\; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of Pt\; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD\; and Patrón Montalvo, "thundered" against reforms Organic law, because this one excluded them,
With this reforms, reiterated-T they, one initiates the "two-party system" because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, which control the Congress.
These four deputies, beside Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of PRD, were the only ones to vote against the Directory chaired by PANiste El Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in the capacity as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that with these reform in an institutional way one constitutes the political marginality on behalf of PRI and SIDE.
It mentioned that the following days they would speak to the representatives about SIDE and PRI to modify the diagram on the basis of a political will and if they do not have it, they will again be controlled by the two parties and in this manner will finish the adverse coalition.
"Up to now arrived (the adverse coalition), it is what I look at, because we are excluded, of any decision, they do not have political respect to even consider the opinion moreover."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, Pt and Patrón there are coincidences and therefore they form a plural group.
One cannot allow, has poursuivit' it, that the Congress, after having been monopolistic, is now "duopolistic."
"It is not the spirit of reforms law that there is a two-party system eternal in the Congress."
To start, this group starts with 5 legislators and they speak to other colleagues now so that they are more numerous, abounded the Convergent one.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of Pt, explained why now the Congress changed in "spoils" between two, by alluding to SIDE and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two."
Patrón Montalvo required to respect the personality of the deputy, to give him his place to the negotiation tables.
"That they do not leave by cupulaires agreements outside to 5 which will be probably 9 deputies, maintaining with five that it is seen us the, separate ones in various fractions, we decided to link us to seek a place in the negotiation table, it is the problem there, that in reforms that they made, that they decided, we are outside and we are not agreement with this reform."
$200 million more for "the purveyor"
The Town hall of Mazatlán pays another check with questioned the owner of the company of electrical equipment.
Another check of approximately 200 miles pesos has favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the Town hall.
With this one, the amount which one paid this second half-year with the owner of the company of electrical equipment raises to 1 million 200 miles pesos.
According to the page of transparency of Municipe, this last check number 9258447 was issued the past November 16th for the amount of 200 millet 144.56 pesos, of concept of "liquidation of account suppliers."
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Commune would pay other amounts with this purveyor, who was observed by the Higher Audit of the State to sell at a higher price.
What one did not report it is the total of the debt and, consequently, combiens of accounts - checks will be still issued with favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
"One bought nothing, one pays him simply what one owes him, as with the remainder of the suppliers," has he says in an interview.
Last accounts - checks "reappeared" the last quarters of the year: on September 24th, two on October 15th, 19 of October, 29 of October and this last, on November 16th.
Even if the purveyor did not publish yet in the Official journal of the State, according to the forecasts of the Law when a company is questioned by ESA, to prevent that other governments use its services, the Treasurer ensured that they did not use his services again.
All this, after July 25th Noroeste had published a revision of the accounts - checks which the Town hall issues with its suppliers, by revealing that in the interval March 2008-July 2010, the triennium of the Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Municipe with paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 accounts - checks.
It also carried out transactions with Jumapam, by boxing accounts - checks of more than 3 million pesos.
The tourist sites must be neat
The tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of bad conditions of the roundabout Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After fallen from a foreign tourist in a hollow of the roundabout Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector of Mazatlán required of the authorities that they pay attention to the zones and sites which are in bad conditions and project a bad image of the port.
El Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of the Tradesmen of Dorada Shingles, recalled that they have several times requested that the image of the destination is neat and of new activities must replace the others that the tourists find bad.
He said that the bad condition of the streets and pavements has affected because the tourists there have suddenly walked and they see the disorder and avoid the close trade.
"The politicians do not know that means to close a company one day and they do not know the fortune which one loses, elsewhere they did not do the work during so a long time and without an adequate planning."
Hotel Jose Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist has exposes the lack of prevention and maintenance on behalf of the Town hall.
"The municipe will have to assume its responsibility and to prevent that passes again, how to do it, therefore through preventive maintenance and not to make only the corrective measure," has he says.
"We wish to enjoy a clean city, because not only because of fact that is a tourist area must one maintain it, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live there and the Town hall must change its strategy for maintaining the city well."
There are other sites which are neglected and incomplete, has says it, such as for example Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, that does not depend only on promotion, it must have a good product there, a city which has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," has he says.
"One theirs did not pay the attention which it is necessary and this kind of facts underlines something which is notorious for all, maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, under Tourist secretary of Promotion, declared that the recovery of the tourist sites of Mazatlán is urgent, because they are not used correctly and project a bad image.
He spoke about a series of places which must be put in line in whole with the municipe and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, ordered and which it is gravitational because it has a tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlán offers many sites and places historical and farming which one should order initially, to clean and put to us on line to make them gravitational to be able them to add to the inventory which we have to make the promotion of this destination."
IP requires results of the Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CEC, proposed that the deputies assume the great responsibility to be an example for better Sinaloa because of various provocations with which confronts itself.
The sector of business of Mazatlán requests a Legislature of work worthy and free of agreements between the parties and the governmental Executive, because Sinaloa is convulsed and is confronted with large problems.
Yesterday one installed the 60-è legislature formed by seven political forces, 19 deputies of PRI, 13 of SIDE, three of the Party the Alliance News, two of PRD, one of Pt, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM, in total 40 representatives popular.
The list of expectancies that the new integral ones of the governmental Congress is an own and committed management with the company and the various sectors which need a responsible legislative work and which the same models of spirit of party or paternalism do not repeat.
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CEC, proposed that the deputies assume the great responsibility to be an example for better Sinaloa because of various provocations with which confronts itself.
"We hope that the deputies exert really their right, free of agreements between the parties because the habit is that they make pacts to take care their own interests and they are transformed into masquerade of carnival of controlling and the leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
Therefore I ask that they certify the commitment to establish the bridges necessary that make the Controlling current one to progress.
"We will take care that they do a worthy job and especially engaged with the company and the sectors because people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in the last elections.
Jose Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association of the Hotels Very Islas, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives is that to push and add forces by seeking the economic growth of the State, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
"Most important it is that they push the economic growth, that they generate stimulations for the investment and the infrastructure and that in a manner will stimulate the generation of work stations."
With regard to the tourist activity, he asked that the new legislators give him the importance which it has in the governmental budget to consolidate the Secretariat of Tourism Governmental.
"I understood that it is the second Secretariat of the State with a budget more reduced and it is incongruous like economic activity important and generating of currencies and investment and who competes directly with agro-industry."
Except for owing to the fact that it is necessary to classify resources with tourist projects detonators which help to give safety to the State and to bring up to date the Law of Alcohol that the former legislatures could not solve.
King magus is sought
Headstocks, cars and bicycles, inter alia toys, are wishes it children of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
For their parents, the next day of Kings Mages will be difficult to achieve their illusions, because their hearth is formed by neither more nor less than 12 people and a kid.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, Jose Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, Jose Juan and Miguel do not lose the hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will carry the toys and clothing to them which they wish so much.
The family lives a humble house of Colonia Salvador Allende and they live from day to day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it is very difficult for us, because my husband does not have a job, but we sell tangerines and potatos... and the afternoon I left with the "plebs" to sell in the street," known as Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of small.
Adelaida, 4 years, wishes a headstock or a bicycle, and his/her Isabel sister, 3 years, would like a Barbie headstock.
In her turn, Jose Alfredo, 10 years, for a long time aspires to have a "monster truck" and for his/her Jesús little brother, 8 months, Cayetana suggests clothing of size for one year.
"He told me (Jose Alfredo), "I would like to have this monster," but I told him "one will see, my son," because he was very expensive," remembers with Cayetana unhappiness.
For the larger children, who was at the school, of clothing and of the shoes would be the ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11 years, fits size 12\; Isaías, 10 years, fits size 10, while Miguel, 8 years, fits the size eight.
Jose Juan, 14 years, needs a par of sport shoe, therefore a par from the size five and half or six would help it much.
If you want to help to make reality the dream of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela you can take part in the countryside One Seeks King Mage, by giving a toy or money to the reception of Noroeste.
14 supposed stopped drug traffickers
About ten searches were carried out in Estrie, Wednesday, within the framework of the dismantling of a network of production and sale of cannabis.
Fourteen people were stopped and will face various charges.
The searches proceeded in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in places which would have been used with the production as drug.
"Approximately 750 seedlings of cannabis, four kilos of haschich, the money and the equipment which was used for the production were seized," indicated Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson of the Safety of Quebec.
In all, eleven men and three women were stopped, including the two supposed leading heads of this network, two men of Sherbrooke.
The stopped people were to appear with the law courts of Sherbrooke in the hours following their arrest.
They could face charges of production of cannabis, of possession with an aim of making the traffic of it, of plot and flight of services, inter alia.
These searches took place following a long-term investigation, which lasted very nearly one year.
"It is received information of the public which allowed us to carry out these arrests," Mr. Ruel specified.
Some 70 police officers of the regional module of investigation of Estrie of the Safety of Quebec, the Police service of Sherbrooke and the Control of Memphrémagog police, took part in this police operation.
The clandestine migration will be able to continue without problem
The government bill of the conservatives which, according to the government, should solve the problem of the boats charged with clandestine migrants, obviously will be beaten whereas the three opposition parties announced Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I am strongly pressed on the Charter."
"I am held upright with a party which created the granite under your feet," the chief liberal Michael Ignatieff declared, whereas it was surrounded by deputies after the behavior of the weekly meeting of the caucus.
The liberals claim that the government bill as suggested, which would make it possible to hold up to one year any person coming from a ship identified like transporting clandestine immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of the rights and freedoms.
The chief of the Québécois Block, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that it could not support the government bill, because it is caught some with the bad target.
"We are against and it seems that all the opposition parties are against, then one will see what the government will do," Mr. Duceppe declared.
The critic of the NPD as regards immigration, Olivia Chow, rejected reverse of the hand the critics wanting that its party is not firm enough concerning the clandestine immigrants.
"The néo-democrats are of agreement so that one takes measures against the frontier runners the clandestine ones and it is what we do through another government bill, C-35," Mrs. Chow indicated.
"We do not support the government bill of the conservatives because it is caught some to the refugees and imprisons the children during at least a year," explained Mrs. Chow.
The Minister for Immigration, Jason Kenney, showed the opposition parties to play policy and to be unaware of the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians massively say to the deputies that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations which target Canada and which treat the country like a door mat."
"They expect that Canada takes firm measures," reacted the Kenney minister.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its government bill, which could have led the country to elections additional clause its rejection.
A conservative however said to Agency QMI that the government was going to ask for a vote so that each deputy who will be opposed explains then in front of his voters.
The new unit does not win unanimous support
In spite of the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight against corruption and the collusion by Jean Charest, of many observers continue to ask for the creation of a public committee of inquiry on the subject.
The Minister for Public safety, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea does not go back to yesterday: Quebec would have consulted Department of Investigation of New York on this subject by last January.
The metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, the announcement of Tuesday in has surprised more one.
It should be said that at the time of a meeting of the permanent Council over the police services of Quebec, on October 29th, this measurement was never discussed in spite of the presence of Robert Dutil.
One did not have any more so that the critic pequist as regards public safety, Stephan Bergeron, qualifies this rabbit announcement "left a hat" and of "solution arranged on the corner of a table."
The Dutil minister as for him answered those which fear that the political power has too much influence on possible the future unit.
"You will see the result when one will announce it, is satisfied it to affirm."
"One is conscious of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Relative, nothing can replace the setting-up of a public survey.
"More Mr. Charest is obstinated not to want to create this committee of inquiry, plus people think as you and me that it has something to hide," explains it.
"The only means of having a committee of inquiry, it is the resignation of Jean Charest," explains as for him Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National school of public administration.
To leave this dead end, it thus suggests in Quebec giving a special mandate to the auditor general so that it inquires into the collusion and corruption.
"One must be able to widen the mandate of the auditor general," he slices.
It also estimates that Quebec could give to the inspector the same powers as with a police chief, thus enabling him to oblige people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the paperboards of the Charest government.
Quebec would also require of Ottawa to modify the criminal Code in order to be better adapted to this kind of crime.
This request would emanate from the prosecutor of the Marteau operation, which informed the minister of the Justice Jean-Marc Fournier which jurisprudence is not explicit in this kind of investigations.
The Federal Minister for Public safety, Vic Toews, as for him confirmed that his/her colleague of Justice, Rob Nicholson, leans at present on certain amendments related to this file.
At the time of the operation Printemps 2001, which struck the groups of motorcyclists, even if the criminal Code were not adapted, 131 people were stopped.
Ottawa thereafter made adopt the Law on the gangsterism.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several waterways remain under high surveillance because as of strong precipitations which fell down on several areas of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon, in Shawinigan, in Mauricie.
Two houses were evacuated in a preventive way.
In evening, another slip would have occurred with Saint-Flax-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road subsided.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, strong precipitations fell down on several areas, that is to say from 40 to 70 millimetres of rain.
From 20 to 40 additional millimetres of rain were awaited by Thursday evening, according to the areas.
The sectors north of river and in the valley of Outaouais were affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimetres of rain on the whole.
As it is necessary to add these precipitations with the cast iron with the snow already accumulated in certain sectors, the overflow of several waterways is feared.
Warnings of alarm of flood were emitted Wednesday evening by the Civil security of Quebec for the Ouareau rivers and Black bass, in Lanaudière.
The rivers of North, in Saint-Jerome, in Laurentides, and of the Oak, in Lotbinière, were as for them the object of flood days before and remained under monitoring.
In the area of Lanaudière, strong precipitations involved the overflow of certain lakes, in Holy-Julienne, with Holy-Marcelline-of-Kildare like Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was carried because of the strong rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated by preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes involved the closing of several ways, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-and-Pontefract.
The Civil security remains on a foot of alarm and supervises the situation of close, indicated Annik Bouchard, adviser in safety.
The Center of forecast of the risings of Quebec for its part emitted Wednesday warnings of strong risings for several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, the Assumption, Ouareau, Black bass, Batiscan and of the Wolf.
Dupont partially blames
The radio presenter of Quebec Stephan Dupont underwent a reverse partial in front of the Canadian Council of the standards of the radiotelevision (CCNR) for controversial statements on the social assistance and the Haitians just as on his coarse language in waves.
The CCNR judges that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but that certain remarks contained of "inaccurate information on the social assistance, of the unduly negative representations of the Haitians and the coarse language which is not appropriate for the emissions diffused during the day."
The Council also concluded that a discussion on the suicide, including the diffusion of the name of two people who had committed suicide, did not infringe the codes on broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints about comments made during emissions diffused between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was rendered following a complaint of the Common front of the social assisted people of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the emission were inaccurate.
The presenters must rather present solid information than misleading.
Concerning the suicide, the presenter Stephan Dupont had estimated that the suicide is a gesture of coward.
The majority of the members of the Committee concluded that the conveyed message was that the suicide should not be seen as a solution with the problems of the life.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes blamed of "Dupont midday" broached a delicate subject in a way equitable and adapted."
No blame was thus retained at its place.
The last litigation related to declarations which followed the earthquake to Haiti.
Stephan Dupont and Jean-Rene Dufort had then devoted themselves to a media face-to-face discussion which had caused many reactions.
The presenter of CHOI declared that it had not made any donation to help the Haitians because one could not know with certainty that people needy would receive really the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of the Haitians.
"I already purged my three day old suspension on top."
"My file is virgin since one year and half," the presenter declared.
In all the decisions, the Committee denounces the diffusion of coarse language.
In each case, broadcaster CHOI-FM collaborated "beyond its obligation."
The consequences are tiny for the station which will have, inter alia, to once announce these decisions during prime times within a period of three days.
A king of the kung fu in Montreal
The Montrealer of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely particular course.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung fu "full contact"), in kickboxing and boxing Thai goes up on the tatamis and the boxing rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started to practice martial arts like the kung fu and the kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemmal, installed in the metropolis to evolve since 2008 at the professionals."
"In my case, I seek engagements a little everywhere, since for those which do not like the play on the ground present in mixed martial arts, the competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, that which works as security agent and as made for the UPS company precisely delivered bad news with its rivals, gaining two gold medals with the World championship amateur of World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from October 23rd to October 30th, in Edinburgh, in Scotland.
"I gained the categories of kickboxing full contact and boxing Thai, he explained."
"Currently, I prepare with going to China for the World cup of san shou."
"The combatants who finished among the four first at the time of the last world championship in each category were invited."
"I gained bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in the Viêt - Nam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I concluded the tournament with the fifth rank, whereas I arrived third at Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What is interesting, it is that I progressed to each competition."
"With this rhythm, I will be first this time or the next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where the punches and of foot, just as projections on the ground, are authorized.
The duels proceed in an original manner on a platform and more rarely in a boxing ring.
The most famous pugilist resulting from this shape of combat is the American of origin Cung Vietnamese It, recognized well in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has to retain one event in its career, he will answer undoubtedly his presence the super tournament "King of Sanda," the Super Bowl of the kung fu.
"This competition is raised and most prestigious in China, explained the nice strapping man."
"It is a little the equivalent of the Stage Lumpinee (the largest stadium of Thailand)."
"Ç' was a super experiment."
Zemmal gained its first combat, in semi-final of its category (80 kg), before losing finally.
"That which has defeated me was a true pro, he analyzed."
"There are four combatants per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals clash finally of their category."
"Then, the winners of each category cope in order to crown only one champion, the king of the kung fu."
450 million in contracts without invitations to tender
Hydro-Quebec granted private 450 million dollars in contracts at firms of engineering for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Teal-Rupert.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a formed consortium by the firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor which obtained most important, that of the management of the project, for a sum of 295 million dollars without invitation to tender.
This consortium called Énergie management was made up in 2004 in a concomitant way to the choice of Hydro-Quebec to entrust to the private sector its responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project of 5 billion dollars.
At the start of 2005, the consortium Énergie management obtained the lucrative contract without there being public invitation to tender.
For the Québécois Party, the recourse to consortia of companies poses a serious ethical problem which risks to eliminate competition and to cause a rise in prices.
"It is the new way of were the collusion and to cut down competition."
"I.e. people, instead of doing that in a secret way, maintaining do it in an opened way," declared yesterday the deputy pequist Sylvain Simard in press conference.
Earlier in morning, Mr. Simard raised the question at the National Assembly because he says to see with difficulty how the interest of the public can be served as this way.
The Minister for the Natural resources, Nathalie Normandeau, retorted in afternoon, denying vigorously that there was collusion for this contract.
"I start to have my voyage," she has plague, supporting that the PQ had been "dishonest person" and "had missed rigor."
She said that "they would be least things" than the PQ is excused.
The formula of the consortia is a common practice in the whole world.
It is usually about an alliance limited in the time which allows two or several companies to gather their respective expert testimonies in order to answer an invitation to tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project comprises a high level of complexity taking into account the extent of work.
The building site is in hand and must spread out until 2012.
However, the contract was allotted without the play of competition acting\; there was negotiation.
Also, the formula of the consortia is not any more one exception to Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As last week the Duty revealed it, the formula of the consortia in the sector of the genius-council is the object of an investigation to the government.
A fast overflight of the register of the companies of Quebec makes it possible to count more than 200 consortia, of which some seem permanent.
Thus, the Dessau firm works in partnership with most its principal competitors, of which CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Rock and Tecsult.
Each combination, and it there has tens, brings back of them to only one and even legal person, is Dessau.
As regards the consortium Energy management, the Normandeau minister stressed that "the territory of the Bay James answers dynamic of the labor particular ones and that Hydro-Quebec answers it in a particular way since the Seventies."
The big boss of the project Eastmain, Réal Laporte, of the Company of energy of the Bay James (SEBJ), gave an explanation which made frown on the fact that the management agreement of the project was granted private.
"If you go in invitation to tender and that there are few tenderers, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: maybe that you take people who are in this market and that you say: one will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a handsome price."
"But the idea, it is that in fact the price is important, it is the competence of people," Mr. Laporte affirmed.
This contract granted to the consortium Énergie management is part of a long list of contracts of more than 50,000 $ obtained by the Québécois Party.
The contracts were granted by Hydro-Quebec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Teal-Rupert project.
After checking, the Duty counted 109 contracts of genius-council granted between 2002 and March 2010 at firms or their subsidiaries, in particular of the laboratories of grounds.
SNC-Lavalin nicked 22 contracts, Génivar obtained from it 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not counting its participation in Énergie management.
All the contracts were negotiated.
They add up 449,783,344 $, including the contract with Énergie management of 295,131,564 $.
Sylvain Simard made it clear that the four firms which compose the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well-known with the Liberal party of Quebec."
The Normandeau minister dropped that the PQ is also related to these firms which "finance it," before specifying that they were rather his leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption - the "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
The Québécois consumer trusts very little the actors of sustainable development, but also with the equitable marks and certifications écologisantes to guide his choices.
Worse, even if it bathes in a media universe where the messages in favor of a more responsible consumption pullulate, it deplores a credible lack of information, deprives that it qualifies even brake upon its engagement, indicates the Barometer of the responsible consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Even if they made increase the socially responsible consumption of said products in 2010, the Inhabitants of Quebec seem however to grant very little credit to those which try to sell to them.
Two thirds of them indeed say not to believe the environmental commitment of the companies just like the green publicity of the companies, reveals the measuring instrument worked out by the Observatory of consumption responsible for the Sherbrooke University.
Another report: half of the consumers doubts the reliability of the official certifications affixed on the products known as equitable, but also of the credibility of the products and the marks posting itself as being écoresponsables, the Barometer indicates.
In the same vein, the speech of the politicians on this topic is taken with serious by only 14.6% of the Inhabitants of Quebec.
Information as regards responsible consumption seems however paramount to stimulate this side of consumption currently animated by nearly one the third of the Québécois consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and the doubtful character of information would calm the heats of 46% of the consumers.
It is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, a third of the Inhabitants of Quebec is also said being wary towards the pled performances of the products or green services which one seeks to put to them between the hands.
On another note, the consumers were about half to have in 2010 changed their practice and especially changed of mark of one or more products to answer their conviction.
To a total value of 61%, they also supported purchases near tradesmen of their district and privileged the product purchase food cultivated in their area, the Barometer indicates.
Greener and responsible - the index of responsible consumption reached 64 on a maximum of 100 for this year -, Gay the consumus of Quebec likes to be presented as the king of the recycling which seeks to reduce its environmental print in alarming of protection of animals.
But its social conscience and ecological seems however to remain outside its car, indicates the Barometer: in 2010, hardly 28% of the Inhabitants of Quebec indicated to have used public transport or recommended the car-pooling to defend their green interests.
Walk and the bicycle were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this vast behavioral investigation, which has just taken its first stereotype.
A loan of the State for the repurchase of eXcentris
The government from Quebec, in which one required to engage financially in the repurchase of the complex of cinema eXcentris by the Angus Company and the Parallel, agrees to collaborate, but to the amount of a loan only.
The Company of Angus development and the Parallel, which hoped for a gift of seven million dollars of the ministry for the Culture to repurchase in Daniel Langlois the cinematographic complex eXcentris on the St. Lawrence boulevard by giving again its full cinephilic vocation to him, do not obtain what they claimed.
The government agrees to be implied in the file, but in its own conditions.
Rather than the expected gift, the government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would be lower than initial waitings besides, which could constitute a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least of the opinion of the sources resulting from the dispensaries of the State.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million already had been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests for summer have re-examined downwards.
A proposal and an action plan were sent to the minister St-Pierre by the president of the Company of development of the cultural companies (SODEC), François Macerola, who controls the file of eXcentris.
It forwarded to him an ultimate report about ten days ago.
But the counter-proposal of the cabinet arrived at the SODEC Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have to answer it until December 31st.
It seems however that the assumption of the gift of the State must really be isolated.
Let us recall that the Association of the owners of cinemas and cinéparcs of Quebec was opposed to a direct investment of the State to support the repurchase of eXcentris, asserting that the ministry for the Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinemas.
But several speakers of the medium claimed on the contrary a substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, master of the house, during ten years carried at arm's length the cinema of author in his buildings of the complex after having financed itself his construction, which could justify an exemption on behalf of the Council of the treasure.
The lack of rooms for independent films is shouting in Montreal, and eXcentris had known fidéliser its customers.
The Angus Company and the Parallel, with at their head Christian Yaccarini, control, on their side, a financing campaign with deprived, hoping to collect 700,000 $ to push with the wheel of acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of the three screens, the Parallel, continues to diffuse films with eXcentris.
The goal of the future purchasers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27th by showing very beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois Of the men and the gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not point out the Duty and one is unaware of what him and its group downwards thinks of the proposals which are made to them.
The veil raised on complexed Canada...
The new American diplomatic cables revealed by WikiLeaks raise the veil on what the United States regards as the complex of inferiority of the Canadians towards the Americans, but they betray at the same time the feeling of superiority of the latter towards Canada.
Thus, the American diplomats are astonished that each Canadian voter does not have the canado-American relations with the spirit while going to vote and believe that the visit of president Obama helped the conservative government to make adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread out over the public place yesterday, offer more crusty details that substantial contents to put itself under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22nd, 2008, is in full federal electoral campaign, reports at which point the United States is not part of the challenges discussed by the political leaders.
With the great astonishment of the American ambassador in station with Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations to this situation.
Perhaps "an almost inherent complex of inferiority Canadian conditions the Canadian political leaders with speaking about interior challenges of the daily newspaper rather than to make carry this election on the United States (as at the time of the countryside on the free trade of 1988) ," he writes.
The United States is thus, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak about it."
The ambassador understands of as much less this "deafening silence" that the two countries have an intense political relation and economic.
"Logically, he estimates, the capacity of a candidate, a party and even more than one head of party to manage this essential relation should be a key factor which the voters have with the spirit while going to vote."
The other expression of this feeling of importance is read in the cable sent on January 22nd, 2009 by Terry Breese, person in charge in Ottawa, preparing president Barack Obama with his first visit in Ottawa.
"Your voyage will help to ensure the survival of the government at the time of the vote of confidence at the beginning of February on the federal budget, by which Canada will post its first deficit besides one decade because of a revival program from 30 to 40 billion dollars," writing Mr. Breese.
Nowhere it is not made mention that the government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas to prevent being reversed by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional to the quality of the revival program suggested.
Another communication, gone back to January 2008 and signed of the ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the diffused drama series with CBC return from the United States.
The ambassador worries about the emissions Border, Little Mosque one the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which one observes not very subtle references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or to removals for muscular interrogations of the CIA.
Another cable reports that, at the time of their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe were ready to accommodate certain prisoners of Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of "individually."
At the end of the meeting, he is written, "it gave a paper to the Secretary of State in connection with Omar Khadr, a 15 year old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The secretary agreed to re-examine the file."
Let us note finally that the spirits warm up concerning the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, declared on the waves of CBC that the person in charge of this massive escape should be "assassinated."
He quoted Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A world plan to renovate lighting
UNO proposed yesterday in Cancún a plan of restoration of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries in order to obtain a greenhouse gas reduction (GES) which to the third of the additional reduction that corresponds almost should be carried out to stabilize the planetary climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the tread of the concrete great projects that UNO hopes to make adopt in Cancún to compensate for the absence of constraining commitments of reduction by the industrialized countries.
According to the plan deposited yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs which still monopolize from 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by bulbs fluocompactes or, better, by bulbs with light-emitting diodes (LED or "English LED"), the main part of the 1.8 billion tons (WP) GES emitted on planet to light the human ones would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of the world emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the planetary car fleet.
In Copenhagen, last year, large transmitting countries, like the United States, China, Europe and others, of which Canada, engaged in voluntary reduction plans which should make pass the total emissions of GES of 53 WP with 49 WP.
But it will be necessary to withdraw of this assessment still 5 WP to manage to stabilize by 2020 the rise of the climate to 2 centigrade degrees in order to prevent that it does not become out of control.
In the incandescent bulbs, 95% of energy are dissipated in the form of heat and the remainder, that is to say 5%, produced light.
With bulbs fluocompactes, the energy expense is reduced of 75% and with the new bulbs with LED, one reduces this energy requirement of twice still.
The bulbs fluocompactes last on average from 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new bulbs with LED, as those that launched the Philips manufacturer this week - this company took part besides under investigation of UNO -, have a 25,000 hours life expectancy and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives an idea of the possible economy with a plan of replacement which would apply to 100 countries.
These very new bulbs can also function with rheostats besides emitting very little heat.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have posted reserves towards bulbs fluocompactes since they contain mercury and that they should be eliminated like dangerous wastes, which is not always possible in the developing countries, except if the manufacturers set up instructions.
But, indicates the report, the main source of mercury emission on planet is not the bulb fluocompacte, but rather the thermo plants with coal, which emit much mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States only, these power stations emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the profits which each country thanks to this international program would make.
For example, Indonesia would thus save a billion dollar a year in purchases of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, is the equivalent of 3.5 thermo plants of which construction would cost him 2.5 billion.
The Ivory Coast expects in the nervousness the announcement of the election results
The general secretary of UNO, Ban Ki-moon, claimed the publication "without delay" of the results of the presidential election in Ivory Coast, after the expiry of the fixed periods.
"The general secretary underlines the need for the independent electoral commission for completing his work and for announcing the provisional results without more time, underlined a spokesperson of the chief of UNO."
"He asks all the parts of the Ivory Coast and the institutions to show proof of responsibility and to abstain from any initiative until the announcement provisional results."
In spite of the pressures exerted by certain foreign governments, the electoral commission let pass the deadline of Wednesday midnight without publishing the results, three days after the poll of Sunday.
Approximately forty minutes before the expiry of the period, the president of the CIS had affirmed on television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
The calls multiplied Wednesday in the world so that the CIS proclaims finally the name of the winner of the second turn between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the camp Gbagbo counts on cancellation by the Constitutional council of "fraudulent" votes in the north, held by the ex-rebellion of the new Forces (FN) since the coup d'etat lacked September 2002.
Pascal Affi Guessan, campaign director of the president of the Ivory Coast, affirmed that the devices of intimidation of the voters practised by the FN in the north of the country had dissuaded the partisans from the outgoing president to go to vote.
All the election could be cancelled if the lodged complaints by Gbagbo are retained by the Constitutional council.
However the adversaries of Gbagbo estimate that the high court of the country is not neutral because it is directed by Paul Yao DRE, a political allied close relation of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the North which contradicts any bond with the ex-rebels, considered to be "unacceptable" the delay in the announcement of the results and requested from Gbagbo to respect them, but it did not go until asserting the victory.
Its allies affirm that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because it knows that it lost and that to carry felt sorry for before the Constitutional council, after having prevented the electoral commission from distributing the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, Sunday, was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country remained divided into two during years.
The United Nations informed Wednesday the political community of the Ivory Coast which it could be held responsible for possible violences.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished at the top of the first turn, on October 31st, with 38% of the voices compared with 32% with Alassane Ouattara, which got public support of former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% with the first turn).
Unemployment rate remained stable in France in the 3rd quarter
Unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Labor Organization (the ILO) remained stable to 9.3% in metropolis (9.7% including the overseas departments), show the corrected data of seasonal variations (CVS) provisional published Thursday by INSEE.
The number of unemployed is established to 2.631 million in metropolis.
The data of the second quarters were confirmed to 9.3% of the working population in metropolis and 9.7% with the DOM.
Over one year, unemployment rate is posted in rise of 0.1 point.
More largely, 3.4 million people in Metropolitan France did not work with the third quarters but wished to work, that they be or not available in the two weeks to work and that they seek or not an employment.
The situation of the young present on the job market was still degraded, with a new rise of unemployment rate, carried with 24.2% in metropolis (+ 0.9 point over three months, +0.5 point over one year) and 25% by including the DOM.
With the third quarters, 637,000 young people from 15 to 24 years were with unemployment within the meaning of the ILO.
The seniors known for their part a light rise of unemployment, to 6.4% in metropolis (+0.2 point over three months like over one year), that is to say 482,000 people of 50 years or more, and 6.6% with the DOM.
Only the 25-49 years profited from a stability of unemployment to the third quarters, to 8.3% in metropolis (- 0.1 point over three months, +0.1 point over one year) and 8.8% in all France.
INSEE does not publish any more monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a polemic on its method of calculating.
Eurostat, the agency of statistics of the European Union, continues on the other hand to do it and announced Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini put in examination and placed in detention
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years, manager of undertakings of treatment of waste and brother of president PS of the general advice of the Rhone delta, was put in examination and imprison at the prison of Luynes, close to Aix-en-Provence within the framework of an investigation into public contracts supposed fraudulent.
Alexandre Guérini was put in examination for abuse of corporate asset, embezzlement and of public goods, concealment, active corruption, trading of favors and detention of ammunition, its lawyer indicates.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and makes a point of being explained on all the questions which the magistrate will ask him, and not phantasms."
"It is easy to continue it for a multiplicity of reprehensible chiefs, it is other thing to prove them," had declared in AFP its lawyer, Florence Rault, before the hearing of her customer.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the strong man of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, held, via his lawyers, to make pass to the judge before his hearing a memo in order to be explained.
One of its close relations, Philippe Rapezzi, was also put in examination Wednesday evening and imprison.
According to his lawyer, Me Lucien Simon, his customer never made another thing but make function the discharges which it had to manage.
As for attribution of the markets or with the destination of the funds related to their operation, it never was informed, has of it tells Me Simon.
In this business, Daniel Pinna, general ex-director of the services of the urban area of Aubagne, were put in examination Wednesday for misuse of public money and complicity, and leave free under judicial control with prohibition to meet the protagonists of the file.
"My customer knew to provide explanations to the facts which are reproached to him."
"The examining magistrate took account of it by not depriving it of freedom," said its lawyer, Me Yann Arnoux.
Four other people had been put in examination and handing-over in freedom on Tuesday night, with placement under judicial control for two of them, indicated the assistant prosecutor of the Republic Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, executive vice president with the cleanliness of Marseilles Provence Metropolis (MPM), is continued for "passive corruption and trading of favors."
Two civils servant of the urban area of Aubagne, Michele Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are put in examination one for "subtraction and diversion of public goods by a person in charge of a public service mission," the other for "complicity of misuse of public money."
Finally the partner of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was put in examination for "concealment of abuse of corporate asset."
Among the people who were confronted with Mr. Guérini appears Stephan Brunengo-Girard, imprisoned recently in a business parallel of fraudulent public contracts concerning in Corsica.
The investigators suspect its companies of having been used to bleach money of the organized crime.
The investigation is conducted within the framework of several open legal information against X in April 2009 following anonymous mails, for frauds supposed in the making of public contracts, in particular in the sector of waste.
Of source close to the investigation, the investigations concentrate in particular on the conditions of attribution and operation of a discharge of Ciotat, which collects waste of Aubagne as well as certain cities of the urban community of Marseilles (MPM).
Business Clotilde Reiss: the Elysium exaggerated the mediation of Syria
During more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, fate of Clotilde Reiss, the French enquiring young person decree in Iran for "espionage," held the opinion in breath in France, put the diplomacy in alarm, and accentuated the deterioration of the relations between Paris and Teheran.
The whole under the attentive glance of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain lower parts of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysium explained its strategy with the Americans, going until their giving councils for the treatment of their own crises of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman had not had as a counterpart the handing-over in freedom of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian held in France and sought by American justice for material traffic for the benefit of Iranian nuclear program.
Lastly, they place under a raw light the way in which the French presidency sought to handle the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian president, Bachar Al-Assad, had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, it of it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on August 12th, 2009 in Paris east entitled "Iran: French comments on the way of managing cases of hostages."
The adviser of the Elysium for the strategic business, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the French Foreign Office for Middle East and North Africa, Patrice Paoli, discuss with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise with the Americans to make some as much to repatriate their own nationals selected of force in Iran.
"Made noise," they say, "unceasingly hammer" in the media the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate liberation."
It is necessary it in order to embarrass the Iranian mode, sensitive to its image.
"Do it more especially as the Iranians ask you not to do it."
Because, last the attempts at discussions by discrete channels, "silence will not regulate anything," the Iranians are "Masters in delaying tacticses."
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest from abroad is "a familiar Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for the political blackmail."
He announces that the release of prison of Clotilde Reiss (who will intervene on August 16th, day when she takes refuge with the embassy of France) "will require the payment with the Iranians of a broad amount of money" (230 000 euros of guarantee).
And it states that the Elysium anticipates other crises of hostages, a phenomenon which "will worsen."
The Iranians could "in the near future stop another of some 1,800 French citizens alive in Iran," he says.
August 28th, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been coming out of prison for twelve days, but remains blocked in Iran.
An information is disseminated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose United States claims the extradition for an illegal traffic of sensitive electronic material towards Iran, is given in freedom to Paris, on decision of a judge.
The American embassy, like many observers, wonders about this disconcerting coincidence.
For Washington, which tracks the Iranian clandestine networks of acquisition of material intended for the nuclear program, the widening of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France accept a bargaining?
Release of the Iranian against that of the Frenchwoman?
During a new discussion with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4th, François Richier ensures that it is not the case.
The Elysium, he says, not only "was completely taken by surprised by the decision of the judge," but sought to be opposed to it.
"There were sharp exchanges between the French presidency and keeps it at the time seals" (, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot reconsider the legal decision," he observes.
Mr. Richier wants to as show as Majid Kakavand remains placed under "narrow" the monitoring of the French intelligence services.
The adviser of the Elysium composes a phone number, hangs up again, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently localised in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysium does not spare its efforts, by means of official statements and of "escapes" organized in the media, to make believe that Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad plays important" and "influential" part an "of "mediator."
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and note that handling bears fruit since several press articles reflect the French official version.
A telegram dated August 25th, 2009 evokes ""media blitz the" of official French."
On what such an amount of "gratitude" expressed towards Mr. Assad is based, wonders the embassy Paris.
"In spite of their declarations full with praises, official French recognizes into private that they have only one vague concept of what the Syrians really made."
The document leans then on the reasons which pushed the Elysium to be poured in this fiction.
The intense effort of communication "aims at validating the policy of Sarkozy of opening in Syria," he analyzes.
A policy launched in 2008, which "had then been perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, like premature and unmerited."
In "exaggerating the Syrian role," Paris seeks "to show in Syria which praises it can attract itself by playing a constructive part in the area."
The objective is also "to sow seeds of discord between Syria and Iran."
The American embassy knows it good source.
On August 11th, François Richier entrusted to him: "of course, we do not know if the Syrians did anything."
"But thanked we them nevertheless."
"That should at least sow confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16th, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in the Elysium.
In an official statement, he thanks the presidents for Brazil, of Senegal, and Syria, for their "active role in favor of the release of our compatriot."
No online games for the young Koreans last midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law known as "of Cinderella" who will prohibit the teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, indicated governmental leaders.
A government bill will be submitted to the Parliament in December to require of the companies of online games to block the access to these plays after midnight, to the young ages of less than 16 years, indicated representatives of the ministries for the culture and the family.
"Much of children play these plays all the night and have then difficulties in studying at the school and to have a normal life during the day."
"We estimate that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," declared in AFP OJ Rin, the ministerial person in charge in charge of the government bill.
The online games will be again accessible at 6 o'clock in the morning.
The companies will be one year old to prepare with the application of the law, he specified.
The government also plans to ask the companies to limit the daily access time to these plays for the young people whose parents make the request of it, added the person in charge.
It also will place at the disposal of people who claim it freewares which make it possible to limit the time spent on Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries "connected more" and the newspapers regularly bring back news in brief related to an intensive use of Internet.
The country is also the uncontested champion of the world competitions of online games.
In November, South Korea had gained four gold medals in World Cyber Games, vis-a-vis 58 other nations.
World 2018-2022: the Fifa indicates the organizing countries
In full storm because of suspicions of corruption, the executive committee of the Fifa indicates Thursday the organizing countries of the World cups 2018 and 2022, an eminently political choice where the power struggles and the lobbying are likely to take the step on the technical criteria.
A thing is sure, the edition 2018 of the competition queen of the Fifa will take place in Europe, bastion traditional of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Country-Low-Belgium).
That of 2022 will be much more exotic, the International federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its establishment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of the personalities being part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, Jose Shine Rodriguez Zapatero, Jose Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the heads of government Belgian and Dutch, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measurement of the economic issues and policies of World.
The negotiations in slides are thus likely to last until the last minute.
For the remainder, difficult to establish a hierarchy enters the candidates.
According to the evaluation report of the Fifa, the English files, hispano-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) have better arguments that their competitors.
But these considerations will not weigh very heavy for the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of vote.
The Sunday Times, at the origin of the revelations having led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have thus ruined the chances of its country, cradle of the football which accommodated the World one only once, in 1966.
The BBC gave from there a layer, Monday, by diffusing documentary which pins three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What to dissatisfy the Fifa and to put in the embarrassment the English officials, who launched out in an intense lobbying these last weeks with David Cameron in first line.
The chief of the government hopes to republish the blow successful by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained in 2005 for London the organization of the JO-2012.
Will this intense activity be enough to regild the blazon of England at the EC?
Nothing is less sure because the duet Spain-Portugal does not miss assets with its already ready stages, its expert testimony (World-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its culture football.
But the dark economic and financial outlooks for the two countries could shower their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal do nothing but increase the dimension of Russia, become an outsider of weight in spite of the gaps of its file (stages, hotels, transport).
But the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to carry out displacement in Zurich and denounced a "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote," in an allusion hardly buckled to the charges of the British press against the members of the EC.
"They are covered mud, one tries to compromise them," Mr. Putin launched.
For 2022, the United States, forts of the experiment of 1994, seems the logical favorites.
First world economic power, seat of the principal sponsors of the Fifa, the country seems to have a length in advance on Japan and South Korea, which built a very beautiful project separately.
But these new candidatures appear premature in 2002 for two countries Co-having organized the test.
Another threat: the granting of World-2026 in China, ardently wished by the Fifa, which would make in fact null and void the Asian chances for 2022.
With Qatar, which left the big game by proposing futuristic stages, and Australia, the Fifa would continue its expansion towards new regions, but these two countries present more risks than of certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of the fees TV paid (because of the jet lag) by the European countries, Money for the Fifa.
Second mandate: obviousness
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand had made believe that he hesitated.
Valery Giscard d'Estaings and Jacques Chirac did not have the least hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
A mandate in the Elysium calls another of them.
Thus the current Head of State will be candidate in 2012.
But the obviousness does not make good household with the share of mystery attached to the presidential function.
Then it should be made as if the doubt always existed.
In a direction as in the other.
In 2006, even without believing in it, the friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third mandate was not excluded.
On November 15th, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy ensured that he would make up his mind "some share with the autumn of the year 2011."
That it evokes in front of UMP members of Parliament, Tuesday evening in the Elysium, the prospect for "two mandates" thus sowed a little febrility.
Was this the official announcement of its candidature?
One was far.
The president did nothing but recall that the constitutional revision of 2008 limited to two the number of five-year periods.
It made a report, not an announcement.
It is not the first time that it evokes the presidential election, on the tone of humor, at the time of such meetings.
"In the worst case, or at best, you still have some for seven years and half with me," it had launched to them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Do not believe only I do not think of the stage according to."
Its remarks of day before yesterday do not return it more candidate that the day before\; they do not return it less.
If they cause comments, it is for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race to the candidature for the PS, on the one hand.
But that is not the entry on the lists of Ségolène Royal who pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to be revealed.
It is on the contrary because its candidature in 2012 is obvious that much with the PS claims a battle order ordering earlier than envisaged.
Bad surveys, in addition.
For the first time the right-wing voters would prefer the candidature of Francois Fillon for that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L' Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion in UMP on top," immediately and prudently the entourage of the Prime Minister reacted.
"If he believes the possible defeat, he will not be candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin entrusts.
"He will always believe to be able to gain," Alain Juppé corrects, resigned obviously.
Euro: the ECB forced to maintain its purchases of titles of State
The last meeting of the Council of the governors of the European Central bank (BCE) of the year was to be the occasion to specify the methods of way out of crisis or, at least, to announce the stop of a good number of the nonconventional operations of monetary policy which must be completed at the end of the year.
Crisis of the European sovereign debt obliges, the issuing house of Frankfurt will not be able undoubtedly to be allowed to be as peremptory under penalty of worsening a situation as tended more today on the European bond markets.
The political cost would be all the more high.
Yesterday, at the time of a press conference, the Minister of Finance Frenchwoman, Christine Lagarde, thus greeted the active role played by the ECB in favor of the resolution of the crisis of the national debts in Europe.
She did not wish to say if she estimated that the central bank was to make more, by increasing for example her programme of purchase of sovereign obligations.
"I reserve my reflection with my European partners (...) ."
The day before, in Brussels, during its hearing by the commission of the Economic affairs and monetary of the European Parliament, the president of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not shown more eloquent as for its intentions, being satisfied to indicate that the programme of purchase of titles of State on the resale market "continued" and that "we will see what we will decide" during the meeting of this Thursday.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its unchanged directing principal rate with 1%, its low historical level since May 2009.
In the facts, the purchases of Treasury bonds by the ECB doubled last week, with nearly 1.35 billion euros.
And, according to the indiscretions of operators of market, it would have carried out new purchases of Irish and Portuguese titles, yesterday.
On the whole, the central banks of the eurosystème bought for 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among the operators of market, anticipations of a continuation of the purchases are not any doubt (see page 29).
The economists either do not expect notable change of course.
If the lending operations to more than three months already disappeared from the arsenal from the ECB, the latter still carries out unlimited allowances of liquidities according to generous conditions and for durations being spread out one week in three months.
The economists expect today that this device is prolonged of a few months.
"I cannot think that it modifies in an important way its program."
"If not it would be to take the chance to cause new short-term tensions," Michael Schubert, economist of Commerzbank estimates.
"A progressive exit announced during the first quarter 2011 appears more probable," anticipates on its side Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
As regards its interventions on the market of the national debt, "the ECB should maintain a volume purchase of these obligations to animate a dull market," Norbert Bräms adds.
Taking into account the importance of the exposures of the European banks to the markets of sovereign debts of the euro zone, the issuing house does not have other choices only to maintain its presence on the market.
"It is necessary for him at all costs to replace the lack of investors on the market and to act of such kind to prevent a racing of the outputs paid by the most fragile States," an important bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates fly away, the States will be all the more constrained to reduce their debt, if not to stabilize it.
The safeguard of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the government Berlusconi makes the round back
After a worrying beginning of the week for Italy, the situation slackened a little, yesterday, with the backward flow of the bond rates at 10 years.
A return to a state of calm precarious.
To leaving a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the presidents of region said to have intended Giulio Tremonti to qualify the situation of "indecipherable" and to expect one "unforeseeable" weekend, which the interested party then contradicted.
Tuesday in any case, the variation with the German long rates had reached the record of 210 basic points and the price of the contracts of cover against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had flown away at 263 points, involving a certain panic in Rome.
As a Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain, the variation with the German rates was higher than 400 basic points.
But its right-hand man, Gianni Letta, were declared "strongly worried" by "turbulences of the markets" and by a possible contagion coming from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, third economy of the euro zone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist with the Hudson Institute.
In light, its problem is the absence of growth and the lifelessness of the tax re-entries which goes with, making run to the State the risk to more be able to meet its financing needs.
The last forecasts of Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
The Italian growth from now on is expected 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... whereas the budget under examination with the Senate counts on respectively 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the public deficit will account for 4.3% more of the GDP the next year (against 3.9% envisaged by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
From where the rumor of new supplementary estimates which could be set up after the festivals, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, of new austerity measures beings will have taken," the police chief estimates in the economic affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy gets support of the international institutions.
"The fundamental ones of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we repeat it for a long time," ensures Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the Bottoms international currency in charge of Italy in the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate future, neither on the court nor on the long run, because in spite of its important debt (119.2% of the GDP in 2011, note), the efforts of stabilization requested from Italy are less than those requested from other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, economist in chief of OECD.
Remain the question of political instability.
On December 14th, Silvio Berlusconi will face a vote of no confidence with the Chamber of Deputies, following what of the anticipated elections could be organized at the end of March.
A period not very favourable with decision making in the event of serious crisis would open then.
Europeans think of the reinforcement of the anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde still hammered it yesterday within the framework of a press conference in Paris: "Europeans, I believe that one still showed it Sunday in the course of the day and the night, obviously interdependent, are determined, engaged to defend their currency and their monetary area."
Although quite relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday on the rates of the European government bonds brought water to the mill of the governments and ECB.
But one cannot speak yet about a beginning of standardization.
The Standard credit rating agency &amp\; Poor' s.a announced that it could degrade the note of the debt of Portugal, the target most aimed today by the speculation.
"Like in May, there is a real lack of clarity and of political visibility, which weighs in particular on the banking systems," the economists of Exane BNP Paribas estimate.
More especially as "political time is much slower than the time of the markets."
Conscious of this hiatus and the dangers which it conceals, the European countries intensify the discussions to reinforce the already existing anti-crisis devices.
The abstract consultations between the Ministers of Finance most directly concerned and, more largely, with their pars of G20 go good progress.
And this altough for the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin of the beginning of the next week.
The ECB meets today.
With the menu, fate of nonconventional measurements of support for the countries of the euro zone in the firing line of the markets (see above).
As for the Funds European of financial stability (FESF), his executive director, Klaus Regling, began Tuesday in Singapore a turn of Asia to inform the investors natives of the Far East of the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the objective of these visits is not rising of the funds, it prepares of it certainly the ground.
The first emissions of titles of the FESF are envisaged the next month.
Yesterday, an American official representative entrusted to the agency Reuters which the United States would support a possible increase in the funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment of the IMF.
The countries which are in first line, Portugal and Spain, as for them, prepare to adopt structural reforms, in particular as regards market organization of work.
Reforms which are added to the austerity measures for purpose more brought closer.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a way different from those of Greece and Ireland.
One and the other make a point at all costs of avoiding requiring an international aid before setting up their own budgetary corrective measures and deciding essential structural reforms to give again confidence durably.
The European money-lenders, finally, discuss on the options available to accelerate the process of standardization of the sovereign bond markets.
Of passage to Paris, on November 24th, Axel Weber had the first advanced idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the Funds international currency were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to give the hand to the wallet.
The economists of Barclays Capital, an actor of very first plan of the market of the European sovereign debt, judge that an extension of approximately 100 billion euros would be enough, "preferably" in the form of direct injection of liquidities.
The vehicle exists: it is the equipped European Mechanism of financial stabilization, to date, of 60 billion euros.
A council which is likely all to be examined attentively in the European capitals.

Snows and glaze: 24 departments in orange alert
The snow-covered episodes still generate traffic jams, in particular on the district distributers in Brittany, and are likely to disturb certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are from now on in orange alert because of the risk of snow and glaze.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, Two-Sevres and Vienna, were added to the 20 departments already in orange alert, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Weather France, constant snow showers affect the north of the Gironde and Charentes and it snows slightly on the Ile-de-France.
Layers of snow going from 2 to 5 cm, punctually from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes of Armor, Finistere, the Gironde, the Dordogne, of Poitou and those of the areas Lower Normandy, Ile-de-France and the Limousin.
The snow-covered episodes are sufficiently notable to generate traffic jams and to disturb certain economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Coasts of Armor, several secondary roads were prohibited with the heavyweights of more than 7.5 tons, of which the axes Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
Circulation on the district distributers in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend to travel by his vehicle only in the event of need and the circulation of unquestionable bus FOR THE THIRD TIME was suspended for the day.
School transports were prohibited for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measure was planned to restrict the circulation of the heavyweights Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "invites all the motorists with the more greatest caution on the roads and to adapt their control consequently."
The Head office of the civil aviation (DGAC) required of the airline companies to cancel Thursday 25% their flights on the Parisian airport from Roissy and 10% in Orly because as of snowfalls to come.
The DGAC recommends to the air passengers to contact their company.
In Great Britain, the airport of Gatwick, in the south of London, and that of Edinburgh, in Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Subway Large Paris: first financial drafts
Since time that the debate around the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France beats full sound, the billion rains.
In the discussion at least.
One evokes in particular 23 billion for the subway Grand Paris which the Company of Large Paris must build.
To start this SGP, the State an equipment in capital of 4 billion euros announced.
In the theoretical diagram, it is this sum which will then make it possible the SGP to borrow on the markets a share of the financing of its double loop.
Today, one arrives finally at the first additions.
The corrected finance law 2010, examined in committee of supply of the National Assembly this morning, contains the devices designed to find the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special tax of equipment and increase in the tax on the desks in Ile-de-France.
The first, one reads in the text of the government bill, article 15, is "with the profit of the Société public corporation of Large Paris."
It is quantified: "The product of this tax is of 117 million euros a year."
The second is a refitting of a tax on the desks which already exists "in order to modernize it, to increase the product and to assign this increase by it to the Company of Large Paris."
Would that pay how much?
Mystery.
It is not quantified in the text.
One is far from the 4 billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the equipment in capital which will be mobilized by the State and will be brought to the Company of Large Paris as project," one can read in the explanatory memorandum.
With the SGP, one does not find this system shocking.
"From the moment when one created receipts (two taxes, note), one can cover the studies over three years then to type in the 4 billion afterwards, explains there one."
"It will be registered in the budget and will progressively be drawn."
The SGP estimates that the 4 billion will start to be registered in 2013 for the budget 2014.
This device, in which the 4 promised billion is still to the absent subscribers, is likely to cause a a little agitated parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on December 7th.
Hackers avengers and spies in diligence
The WikiLeaks business has a double value.
On a side, it appears an apparent scandal, a scandal which appears as scandal only in front of the hypocrisy which governs the relationship between the States, the citizens and the press.
Other, it announces deep changes with the international level, and precedes a future dominated by the regression.
But let us proceed by order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, it is the confirmation owing to the fact that each file consisted a secret service (of some nation that it is) is made up exclusively of newspaper cuttings.
"Extraordinary" the American revelations on the sexual practices of Berlusconi do nothing but pay what since months could be read in any newspaper (except those whose Berlusconi is owner), and the profile sinisterly caricatural of Khadafi was for a long time for the artists of cabaret matter to sketch.
The rule according to which the secret files should be made up only of already known news is essential with the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go in a bookstore devoted to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on Graal, the mystery of Rennes-the-Castle, the Templars or the Rosicrucian brotherhood) exactly what was already written in the former works.
And this not only because the author of occult texts does not like to make new research (nor does not know where to seek news on the non-existent one), but because those which is dedicated to the occultism believe only so that they know already, and who reconfirms what they had already learned.
It is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
Idem for the secret files.
The adviser is lazy, and lazy (or of limited spirit) the chief of the secret services (if not it could be, which I know, writer with Libération), which regards as true only what it recognizes.
Information secret signal on Berlusconi whom the American embassy of Rome sent to the State Department was the same ones as those which Newsweek published the week of front.
Then why the revelations on these files did do such an amount of noise?
On a side, they say what any cultivated person knows already, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the Heads of States can telephone or take a plane to meet with dining, lost their diplomatic function and, except some small exercises of representation, transformed themselves into centers of espionage.
Any spectator of films of investigation knows that very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that one makes pretense be unaware of it.
However, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and is used to place under a bad light the American diplomacy.
In the second place, the idea that one to hack unspecified can collect the most secret secrecies of the most powerful country of the world deals a considerable blow to the prestige of the State Department.
Also the scandal does not put it as well in crisis the victims as the "torturers."
But let us come to major nature of what arrived.
Formerly, at the time of Orwell, one could conceive all to be able as a Big Brother who controlled each gesture of his subjects.
Prophecy orwellienne had completely proven since, being able to control each movement thanks to the telephone, each transaction carried out, the visited hotel, the highway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of the power.
But when one shows, as that arrives now, than even the crypts of the secrecies of the power cannot escape control one to hack, the report of control ceases being one-way and becomes circular.
The power controls each citizen, but each citizen, or at least to hack it - elected official like avenger of the citizen -, can know all the secrecies of the power.
How can a power which does not have any more the possibility of preserving its own secrecies hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel said it already, that a true secrecy is an empty secrecy (and empty secrecy could never be revealed) \; it is true, as, as any knowledge on the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secrecy of secrecy, because concerning the public domain\; but to reveal, like made WikiLeaks, that the secrecies of Hillary Clinton were empty secrecies means to remove any power to him.
WikiLeaks did not do any wrong Sarkozy or to Merkel, but in made too large in Clinton and Obama.
Which will be the consequences of this wound inflicted with a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, the States will not be able to put on line any reserved information any more - that would come down publishing it on a poster stuck to the corner of the street.
But it is quite as obvious that with current technologies, it is vain to hope to be able to maintain the confidential relationships by telephone.
Nothing easier than to discover if and when a Head of State moved in the plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could the private and reserved reports be maintained in the future?
I know well that, for the moment, my forecast concerns the science fiction and is thus romantic, but I am obliged to imagine government officials which moves in a discrete way in diligences with the unverifiable routes, while being carrying only by heart learned messages or, at most, by hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be stored in single copy in drawers closed at key: at the bottom, the attempt at espionage of Watergate had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the occasion to write that technology advances now out of crab, i.e. with move back.
One century after the telegraph without wire revolutionized the communications, Internet restored a telegraph on son (telephone).
The video-cassettes (analogical) had made it possible to the researchers in cinema to explore a film step by step, while going ahead and behind and by discovering some all the secrecies of the assembly, whereas maintaining CD (digital) only make it possible to jump of chapter in chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With the trains at high speed, one goes from Rome to Milan in three hours, whereas by plane, and displacements which it includes, it takes three hours and half.
It is thus not extraordinary that the policy and the techniques of communications return from there to the horse-drawn carriages.
A last observation.
Formerly, the press tried to understand what was woven in the secrecy of the embassies.
Now, in fact the embassies require the confidential information of the press.
Climate: how France fiddles with its promises of financings
One year after the Agreement of Copenhagen, it is time to examine the respect of the promises of financings quickly resolved (known as financings fast start or early) carried out by the developed countries.
And the large French messing around is revealed.
In the agreement of Copenhagen, the developed countries were committed providing 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union promised 7.2 billion euros over three years and France 1.26 billion euros (either 420 million a year).
At the time of the opening of the COP16, the EU left the big game to persuade its partners of reality of his commitment concerning the financings fast start: report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, large side vent, distribution of booklets...
The operation transparency appreciable and is appreciated with its right value: the developing countries and the civil society would like that all the developed countries make in the same way with the same level of precision.
The EU announces to have released in 2010 2.2 billion euros, which puts it on the good way for the respect of its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when one looks in detail, the things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the agreement of Copenhagen, "new and additional," in order to ensure that an extra effort is carried out without being to the detriment of the government Aid with the development.
Unfortunately, there does not exist agreement on what means "new and additional."
Whereas the European Commission had proposed a harmonization, certain States members whose France blocked the procedure.
Today, each one chooses the reference which is appropriate to him best.
The European Commission for example regarded as reference the year 2009: the international financings are maintained, and she adds 150 million to it over three years under the financings fast start.
Other countries chose similar references in terms of year or terms of level of government aid to the development.
On the other hand, France estimates that the financings of "all the new projects" of year 2010 are "new and additional."
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of the previous years or the total level of government Aid to the development.
Concretely, the full amount of the support of France for the developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), she claims to respect her commitment as regards "new and additional" financings...
Another crucial factor, the distribution between gifts and loans.
There still, there does not exist rule and each one chooses its way of calculating.
Some, like France, consider that 1€ lent is equivalent to 1€ given.
Obviously, that is not easily justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
If use of loans can to be justified for certain investments which are profitable (often projects related to the attenuation of the emissions which rests on more effective technologies), it is fallacious to present one euro which one will recover as equivalent with one euro that one gives... At most, should be counted under its commitments only the cost of the loan for the country lender (either the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has to only make of such a reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% from loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros) - to see the document of the EU to check by yourself.
It is the only Convention country to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires there to 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in others) respect their commitments with 100% of gifts.
In other words, when the very large majority of the European Union puts 1€ to satisfy her commitment, France puts only 10 centimes and considers that the effort is comparable.
Pretty conjuring trick!
In short, in its financing fast start, France operates a double swindle: on the one hand on the evolution of the action in time and on the other hand on the reality of the financial effort.
While spending only 36.1 million euros, it manages to make believe that it spends about it 420 "new and additional" million in coherence with its promises.
The handling of the Finance Minister (because it seems well that it is Bercy which carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why the other States members would continue to give if it is enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not completely easily deceived...
The chapter of the early financings is only one small question, of relative short-term, compared to the whole of the discussions about the climate.
But it could be a grain of sand moreover in the immense machine which is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that will not be the case.
At all events, it is essential to learn the lessons from this first year of early financings.
First of all, France could announce a change in its mode of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect of its commitments and equity with the other countries of the European Union.
But especially, France could advance the discussions on the challenges of long-term financings (another crucial chapter currently discussed): one will not escape the question from "the additionality" or the mode from accounting from the loans.
France could change its position to become as progressist on these challenges as it is it on the different one.
The hope thus rests on new the Minister of Environment, Mrs. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive at Cancun the next week.
An announcement surprised on the fast start of France and its vision of "the additionality" and the use of loans would be natural to increase the degree of international confidence necessary to advance in the discussions.
Alarm with the pesticides introduced by the children
A 10 year old child introduces in one day 81 different chemical substances, according to a study published this Wednesday of association Future generations (ex- Mouvement for the rights and the respect of the future generations).
Association, which prevents that its results "do not have significant statistics taking into consideration number low of analyzed samples, but are illustrative treated problems," bought between July and September food generally consumed in four meals and a encas in one day by a child of about ten years, in the supermarkets of Oise and of Paris.
These standard meals, including the official recommendations - five fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liter of water per day - as well as delicacies, were examined by laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The assessment of the plate is overpowering: 81 chemical substances of which 42 are classified carcinogenic possible or probable and five classified substances carcinogenic some like 37 substances likely to act like endocrinal disturbers (PE), according to studies of several institutions the such international research Center on cancer.
"Even if, in almost the whole of the cases, the legal limits for each chemical substance taken individually are not exceeded, one sees well in our investigation that the reality of the exposure of the consumers to the possibly carcinogenic contaminants and/or EP is alarming," association notes.
For the breakfast, butter and the tea with milk alone contain more than ten possible carcinogenic residues and three proven like unquestionable carcinogens like nearly a score of residues likely to disturb the hormonal system.
The apple, imported Brazil, envisaged like encas by the study, present of the traces of six chemical substances of which a fungicide however prohibited in France.
Even thing for French beans of Kenya, included in the lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide prohibited in the EU.
Moreover, the ground beef, the tuna out of box, and even the bread rod and the chewing gum were truffles of pesticides and other chemical substances.
In tap water the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and administers chloroform to.
For the dinner, the salmon steak was more "rich" with 34 detected chemical residues and even the examination of the plate in figure used to heat the meal with the microwave of it was not free.
The final risk for the consumer of this "cocktails of contaminants" "is probably underestimated," according to the study.
Green Alliance Europe Ecology them (EE-LV), on its side, proposed "vis-a-vis the urgency of the situation" founding a moratorium on the use of the pesticides, in order to stop "the increase in the diseases of civilization."
In July, a study of the European agency for food safety (EFSA) mentioned the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in the fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
