Black box in your car?
While the u.s. road Planner, to repair the collapsed highway systems are struggling with lack of funds, there are many people that are looking at the small black box solutions that fit your car dashboard cleaning.
This device, which is motor-driver vehicle tracks each mile run and transmit that information to the authorities, to finance America's main streets-nowadays to have been old system renovations to Washington and the State Planning Office strives to be a controversial issue.
Generally, highway planning and intensive debate lively as boring work suddenly became an issue of alliances.
You drive by the mile, and possibly drive the location tracking â and then use this information to prepare tax bills-these black box to allow to raise endorsed libertarian side of environmental groups to get along.
Tea party bhauchakki.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also taking a variety of privacy issues very worried.
While Congress could not agree on further action to take, many States are not waiting.
They're looking for that in the next decade they might be in such a system, in which the driver is on the road to pay for each mile that decide.
Thousands of motor-drivers, test drive already has taken the black box, of which a few survive in. Monitoring.
It is really essential for our country object.
"This is our chosen or not chosen is not a matter of" it says Hasan ikhrata, Executive Director of the Southern California Association of Government of that year in California by 2025 were fixed by motor-drivers to track each mile is planning to start.
We change the way you pay taxes is going to be.
To do this technology.
It is the main reason that the nation's Highway Trust Fund nearly went bankrupt, which finance nutrition American citizens by paying taxes on the gas pump.
The American people don't buy now as gas.
Now-a-gallon gas in the car more miles.
In the last 20 years in a federal tax hike, which is 18.4 cents a gallon.
Due to the high price of gas a penny tax increase to politicians avoided.
University of Minnesota transportation policy expert Lee munikh says, "is not exactly sanvahniya gas tax."
Their State has per-mile pay system to test the recently planted tracking device in 500 cars.
He says, "as long as this policy will serve as an alternative the most."
Mileage-based user fee it winches.
It is not surprising that the idea looks good to urban Liberals, because it makes the car run, for example, to change the way tax changes, which reduce jams and could assist in reducing greenhouse gas.
Look forward to this California Planner system while they mahatvakankshi the State global warming law targets are developing strategies to complete.
But House Transportation Committee Chairman, RIP. Bill shuster (r-PA) also the most viable long-term alternatives to the black box.
The region Foundation independent vendor driver are paid by the mile.
VP, Adrian Moore of the policy in the region, said, "it is not doing so well in the blind."
People who are receiving something, are paying for directly.
The two former u.s. Transportation Secretaries have also supported by who in its report in the year 2011 Congressional pay per-mile move in the direction of grace.
The u.s. Senate last year approved a $ 90-million test project, which involved 10,000 cars.
But work on the concerns of rural law-makers, who are representative of individuals who daily go to work or to go much higher in the city have led to mile walk to offer him the House ended there.
However, many State and city suo are moving in this direction.
It is most interested in using the nation's largest Oregon 5000 driver are listed.
These are the gas instead of the State driver soon will pay mileage charges.
Nevada has already completed initial testing.
New York City also is moving in this direction.
Based on the limited trucks run with Illinois.
And I-95 Coalition, which with 17 East sibord State Department of transportation (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), are studying whether they can change what kind of implementation.
The idea did not find support at all venues.
Nevada, where shortly before 50 voluntary car drivers was planted this device on the cars, the drivers were very impatient this thing thinking that the Government could monitor their every move.
Nevada Department of transportation strategic and performance management to direct, allauddin Khan says "big brother and other things to worry about in the same way major problem."
It is not something that people want.
At the same time, continue the trial nevada a. c. l. u. On its website warned: "these devices change the tracking device would be fairly easy.
Aprabandhaniya technology infrastructure giant, there is no need to develop that everyone likes to keep a record of moving around as inevitable.
Nevada is one of those very States, which possible to get affordable technology, trying to help the State can receive a car many miles daily, but it's not where and at what time.
Khan said if you can do it, so people can feel more comfortable.
Looking for this technology has some State agencies the true mileage transported to a small California start-up.
This firm is basically in the business of assisting State tax drivers.
It auto insurance in emerging markets was attempting to, in which drivers pay based on your mileage.
But the device is tested, highway planners to, because it contains g. p. s. Do not use and provides very limited information, which of course uploaded by modem at the time interlude.
True mileage Chief governing rayon Morrison said, "If you don't track their speed and location, they will be more inclined to adopt this approach."
The State has some big mistakes in these early programs.
To do so, much less expensive and less ways to intervene.
Oregon, Planner drivers are using different options.
They live. Rich or live without. You can choose the device.
Or you can choose not to do any of the device, rather than State residents by the average miles may choose to set fees based on.
Other locations in hope that device instead of worried citizens by providing more convenience can be sold to retention.
New York City, transportation officials are trying to develop teachings device, including parking meter fees to pay too, "according to your drive payments" will provide insurance and drivers made a collection of real-time speed data from the will that the motor-driver will be able to avoid traffic.
City planning was mentioned in the document, "motor-driver it due to the benefits it will draw to interact."
However, some transportation planners wonder whether perhaps a whole discussion on pay per mile is the big distraction.
San phrainsisko Bay area Metropolitan Transportation Commission said that by increasing the gas tax Congress bankrupt Highway Trust Fund problem very easily disposed of.
On the drivers of other cars hybrid or a time or annual fees, which do not use too much gas the vehicle so that they pay their fair share.
The Commission's Director of legislative and public affairs, raindi rentashelar said, "when aspirin might work with radical surgery for what is needed."
If we do so many millions of car drivers own privacy and other things to be worried.

Frontier Airlines will carry-on baggage fees
Frontier Airlines passengers on board their plane in luggage to carry-on store plans to charge $ 100 to.
Frontier Airlines is a carry-on bags $ 100 plan to start charging for it, coffee or soda for $ 2 of free will, although on Wednesday it announced that passenger can put the entire box.
New carry-on bags in an overhead bin charges, therefore, small bag under the seat will still be free.
Frontier said that will charge $ 25 if paid in advance, $ 100 will have to wait to get paid if people wait until they are at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said charging passengers $ 100 fee to take care of in advance of acquiring.
"We don't want to charge," he said.
The first and second checked bags in 2008 the airlines charging for.
Those who are trying to avoid the passenger charges are stuffing as much as they can carry-on baggage in the overhead compartment stash, it means this is often in less space.
Fee to bring passengers on board for a method.
O'Malley said this new charge is not really about raising money.
It has the most loyal customers of Frontier that overhead bin space has become increasingly difficult to find.
Airline passengers who buy tickets in your website it does not give up.
This means that the next person in that line for a similar bag might give $ 100, whereas a frontier line at the gate a traveler can get a free bag.
O'Malley said Frontier's website and check processes being replaced before the gate fees for passengers to make sure that it is aware of.
Frontier's new Carrie won't start until the summer-on fees, although a date has not been determined.
Travellers often baggage fees and other charges about the discontent, but the airline prefer them.
He argues that baggage would spend money to handle, and who want the passenger service should pay for it.
Baggage fees on Wall Street as an indication there are that many airline losses after years of air travel to cover the costs of charging enough money.
Most, although Carrie-on bag fees are not touched.
Spirit Airlines Inc. has Carrie-on duty three years ago first started, and fellow diskauntar Allegiant Air later.
Such a fee as well as other airline Wizz Air, which is of Hungarian airline consultant Jay sorensen said, and which add-on fees track kitahara.
He said the Spirit of Carrie-on brings $ 50 million a year in fees that were estimated in the report of December 2011.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executives recently flew in Spirit and passengers at the gate suffered unusual Carrie-on bag fees have wondered.
"Boarding process which I saw in their airline career was comfortable," he said.
I look out at the gate a gnashing of teeth and battle was expected.
"The plane was full and he said it boarded lickety-split."
Frontier also coffee, tea, soda, or juice to follow Spirit's $ 2 fee.
Frontier nekha which travellers will take the entire box, soda or juice, and it will give free coffee refills.
It still will give off water.
US Airways charging for beverages in 2008 briefly tried, but after seven months of complaining travelers after they reneged and any other main airline there followed after.
Frontier's passenger if purchased directly from the airline do not carry-on charge on the Frontier of this step to your own website for customers to operate their latest endeavor.
Airlines online travel seller Orbitz pays the $ 10 to $ 25 each sold out tickets.
This is why many airlines go through an online travel agency instead of buying directly from those passengers an incentive to operate.
Frontier however, this sector went ahead.
In September, many often took half the flight miles give those customers that these individuals had purchased from an online travel agency
25 percent on Wednesday, helped trip miles mileage award slashed.
So, an online travel agency has been purchased from a 1000-mile Frontier trip will earn 250 miles.
Also they only buy directly from the Frontier website for travelers to choose your seat in advance.
Frontier's Denver his home in town, but a loyal base of customers in this business is becoming less and it is losing money.

Scientists shed light on the subject and that the dog's tail antics and what is the relationship between his mood.
Last oversees research has shown that the more your dog happy tails move to the right (from the point of view of the dog), while restless dog his tail to move more to the left of the main form.
But now scientists say that fellow dog can recognize this subtle distinction of the tail and responded.
The study was published in the bayloji journal karant.
University of toronto Professor nyurosaintist from Georgia vellartigra reported: "all humans are well aware that the left and right part of the brain stimulation in different manner that generates positive or negative feelings.
Here we see it also in other species.
He pointed out that humans like dogs in the right part of the brain the left-hand antics and was responsible for the reverse order, and the two hemispheres has played different roles in different emotions.
To learn more about this dog with other dogs tails blind-sided by how moving response, researchers have tracked other dogs to see movies of animals.
They measured heart pet dogs dhadkanon and their behavior analyzed.
We will take more time in understanding his rump shaking, on the other hand, a side so why ever.
Pro. Vellartigra said: "we have dealt with dogs dogs movies-confused that realistic version or other issues to deal with shadow-pictures, and we could see the action of the tail and tail present more left or right."
When the animal has a lackluster dog his tail on the right side (from the point of view of the dog), he looked completely comfortable waving.
But when he replaced the tail direction mainly on the left side (from the point of view of the dog again) has seen his heartbeat as you rotate and restless.
Pro. According to vellartigra they don't think dogs through these antics were deliberately communicate to each other.
Instead, they feel that dogs have learned from experience that they should be concerned on how to act and what not.
He said: "If you have met several times with other dogs, and if they move their tails to one side are constantly so it's more friendly behavior, and right part presents less friendly behavior, you experience response."
Researchers say these findings owners, veterinarians and trainers to provide better information about the feelings of animals.
University of Bristol School of veterinary sainsez guest fellow, dogs behavior expert John Bradshaw pointed out that it is not the first study to test whether dogs is important to the left or right part.
Last year the University of Lincoln's team found that when given an aggressive dog dog, my head pan left and right your head on clockwise looking at the dog.
Other research at the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "contrary to Italian studies-when the robot dog's tail was left rather than right hilai, instead of being restless dogs more likely to reach near him."
He said that the difference was because of the different studies in animals or robots dog movies dogs were not completely canine.
He explained that it reacts by real dogs dogs can help to study how to.
"While much of the evidence from various mammals found two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, is still receiving more detailed information-and in this case, the dogs are no exception," he said.
However, that can be easily recorded their behaviour, given that we don't understand in time that never ever their rump shaking one hand why the other side.
New research it turns out that time of the morning we work with integrity and dedication.
Do not speak a lie and cheat to steal or do not care like mind.
But when the evening turns our minds and we put aside the rule against ideal walk the walk.
Harvard University and the school of business of David yuta acls research researchers in several interesting facts.
According to the researchers, the morning work stress while not we give precedence to ethical values, but evenings are fatigue or more pressure decreases because of the integrity.
The researchers used two.
Some people tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For instance, people had to let that point is on the left or on the right.
Those taking part were told that if they give the wrong answers instead of the correct answer, they will be money.

Obama voter disappointment screamingly
I expect the changes to have Obama twice voted in
They say that g. o. p. Due to the blocking policy of Obama's great efforts are interrupted
Blocking policy obamacare website reappeared, us drone strikes could not pretend
Reminiscences of Obama's year 2008 reminds me of those things campaigns that could
Nathaniel p. Morris II year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am very sad reading books these days.
It's a book, about which I think it during my second year medical school will utsahvarddhan and nostalgia in my silver lining jagayegi.
Its name is "dare to win", and Barack Obama's presidential election campaign of sansmarika of the year 2008.
When I'm with my patients pamphlets are on the bed and the phursata finds this book I take a round in which politics has inspired millions and keep your breath preventing speech.
The election proved, and affricate news speakers at that time had taken a break to reflect historical significance.
My classmates were fun in the eyes of the Teardrop, and my parents kept the newspaper each save.
A team of young visionary individuals was going to the White House, and the entire nation was ready for change.
In the year 2008 during Obama's presidency he has 82 percent approval rating.
And then I closed the book.
The current reality is a hard truth, such as dream world come from.
It is hard to remember the days of hope-they seem a distant memory, remembering a tragic lost opportunities.
They worked the first time I really change after the voting.
To be fair, this simple approach could never imagine of.
I'll give Obama credit for many achievements, the affordable care Act withdrawal of our forces from Iraq, "don't ask don't tell" with the end of Osama bin Laden to be killed.
Also I believe that the biased policy of opposition to our country's efforts to prevent a lot of legwork: the public option for healthcare reform, immigrant, gvantanamo Bay Airport, and others.
But asankhya times in which I myself and colleagues and peers to take the Obama administration's favour-I have answered over here that I can give them.
I reached the point of political frustration.
Republicans oppose foreign leaders of spying is not the answer, nor answer the drones strikes innocent children abroad.
It was written by the national security agency are American citizens private life may not respond to stored data or the person who exposed the Government's incorrect antics of reply to prosecute.
This is no trial of US citizen Anwar could not explain the cause of El avlaki, nor less public funds during the presidential campaigns and expenditure limits.
It cannot respond to the findings of the report, which says that the White House effort to make it up to the media "Nixon administration since most offensive."
And most recently, the affordable care Act signed into law after three years of being a simple failure of excuse to design the website.
I don't know what I would expect.
If, at the age of 18, I should guess that governance, bring forth the political campaign contradicted.
Direct that elected Office is not a ponomariov route because political parties and random events such as nyutaun will offer our headcount, shape public discussion.
Nevertheless I gave above as examples, they mostly seem to be elected by the Administration itself.
This will make you the most annoying.
I voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was fascinated by his candidacy.
Erased Romney has presented a confusing and uncertain options that determine their policies or their Office would seem to not like.
I thought Obama for a second term, which would be free from the pressure of future elections, will complete the hopes which we hear for a long time.
Even so, while Obama's anumeadan rating at 45 percent, this week to book through the years has become very difficult to return in 2008.
Seeing him I miss their promises vanished!.
This week was a part of the book in which it was described how Obama in Pennsylvania primary because clinton was the huge loss nahua.
A post-mortem campaigns uttered his subordinate staff in the meeting that they need to return back on track, and its objectives remain on satyanishth.
He said "I want to get my Mojo back".
We must remember who we are.
Today, five years after a President I couldn't agree more with you.
The comments were expressed in thoughts nathaniel Morris.

Premature puberty: fast growing
Research show that African-American and Hispanic girls compared to its older blonde girls get puberty at a young age.
This means that physical change is near puberty
There is no evidence that hormone replacement therapy or other chemicals may be to blame
Experts believe that coarseness in the age of puberty, the outbreak may be one reason
A case of premature puberty in boys is not much effective
C. n. n. past reporter Pat ithrij specialize in children's health and family issues journalist.
What mother should be concerned, if his daughter at 7 or 8 years of age develop breasts and genital hair just to get started?
In orlando, Florida this week at the annual Conference of the American Academy of Paediatrics Pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul kaiplovitj has explained that it is common practice in American girls initial physiological changes, these represent a new trend.
Kaiplovitj says, "I have very little time to unleash it spends parents rely â that generally this full demonstrates the rapid progress towards puberty."
Characteristics such as breasts develop direct germinate, genital and armpit hair and body odor girls prematurely.
But over the past four decades, rajodarshan (first monthly-religion) at the age of very minor changes.
The United States, average age 12 years, what year was 1970 12.75.
"When the first breast started to be developed rajodarshan takes at least two to three years to" kaiplovitj explains that "in time-East girls puberty: this is necessary to tackle the problem are the author of the Guide.
Puberty is the most accurate test development time.
What is the beginning of puberty, would argue about this, but when 8 years old before breast development would increase with two "child-adult".
In most cases it will slow the process or will freeze-which can closely inspect the hair doctor.
In case of more rapid progress by endocrinologist may be required so that your chances of serious problems like tumors or s &amp; ystem.
Time-monthly-religion and to delay the treatment results are: increased time ribs, underdeveloped Southeast age â and as adults may be undersized.
Drug treatments for hormone replacement therapy or shantytowns, the child's age, growth rate, growth rate, and depend on emotional adulthood.
The psychological aspect is also important.
Kaiplovitaj are aware about drugs but admits, "puberty may increase vyavharatmak to press the issue, and the girls look different from their peers to realize."
The other big problem is understandable: parents just don't want their daughter of monthly age-religion.
Kaiplovitaj said, "they tend to worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they won't keep maintain hygiene."
One woman, whose daughter 10 year was started in the umre recalls, "it was shock.
Although there were signs of this and we are also talking about monthly-religion, but he was not emotionally ready.
He returned to his school scared and worried that its started her first menstruation in sahelian.
Precocious puberty causes lots of suprachlit theory.
However, this is not a sustainable evidence that hormone replacement therapy in eatables, milk or other chemicals in the environment or in the media accused the yaunonmukhi messages.
Boys like girls too-are receiving time-East youth.
Kaiplovitaj this rule set that the main reason for the outbreak of coarseness.
He year 2001 6 to 9-year-old girls had helped conduct the study above, the body fat with the timing of puberty.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are so many other factors that also contribute.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls before puberty girls your age in the tendency to get Belle.
There are many explanations.
Global level, time-ranging from economic conditions before puberty parameters, weather &amp; jeans, all things appear to be affected.
Other puzzle: Although guy facial and genital hair gaining at a young age, but full of puberty plays one of them girls than is unclear.
A. a. p. other practitioners to be present at the Conference the topic jatiltaoen.
Even babies and children also saw common muhanse and genital hair.
Childrens hospital at the monastery, New Jersey grab physician endocrinologist, Dr. Laurens Silverman exhibit says, "we need to be careful about is that we recognize what kind of actual start puberty."
Parents feedback about this guide to your child's doctor should not hesitate to take his children how to speak.
Kaiplovitj has advised, "it may be premature to talk required."
If you remain so calm your child usually will reply properly.
The early development of girls confidence needs to dilae that even if it is early, but this is part of normal life.

Intersex kids parents choose their children's gender can no
Germany became the first country in the European Union, who was born with ambiguous genitalia to children recognized the third gender.
Now newborn babies did not specify male or female rudhigat manner.
According to the new law, children parents do not need to declare the penis, this law they child birth certificate on gender "undefined" or "unspecified" allows to declare.
The new law aims to reduce the pressure of those parents that infants penis-specifications from surgery can take a hasty decision, and discrimination against children struggling with extrusion.
BB c. According to an extrusion person years later said, "neither I'm male, not female.
I have a fascination for paiband created by physicians will be fractured, making.
Estimated each year 2000 children from a child so that neither guy is not a girl.
They are a group of approximately 60 positions, extrusion, which comes under the scrutiny of the disorders of sexual development, it is the collective term abnormal chromosome, jannagranthi (ovary or testis) develops abnormally, or used for sex.
The Wallis Simpson extrusion.
Gender identity is still not properly understood, but most experts agree that in the United States when determining gender may not be the gender-specified using the best available information to make better and surgery, if such impact, before the child's psychological and physical development.
New York City psychologist Dr. Jack dresser who specialize in cases of gender-identity, he said Germany's new law "good stuff."
Extrusion children moral confusion.
He said, "some people are in a position like life-crisis for which surgery is required, but most children with it."
You specify the penis without surgery, and then see how identity develops.
How a child will grow a penis, the science is not very accurate.
It's about anybody who can give proper answers why it happens.
It's a puzzle why people are gay.
Year 2011 in the European Commission report submitted to those transsexuals or transgender extrusion has been described as different people, because their status is not related to gender but also from its biological composition, which is not clearly male or female, but either have both jointly or none of the two is not clearly defined.
These features may display gender abhilkshanon the secondary, such as muscle weight, hair, tits and length; Primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals; Or gunsutriya structure and hormone replacement therapy.
The report by extrusion and transgender individuals face the discrimination in jobs, as well as harassment, violence and bias crimes also overview.
Now non-conforming gender the boys to camp.
Australia and Nepal on their official documents to the adult male, female or "third gender" has been allowed to mark already.

According to the Interior Ministry, in addition to the German passport for extrusion or f as x third specifications.
According to the news report on France 24, neighbour France gender issues involved are still controversial.
The year 2011 as the strict Catholic country in dozens of French law-makers has school books "gender theory" back to to sign the petition.
U. s. Catholic online, the website of Germany opposed this law saying, "while the world is being in a State where the penis itself selected options, but sexual activity, we have two columns of civilization are taking opposite sides."
The mother of the newborn baby in Maryland asked the kids zone at birth to be specified like penis.
He said on the website about the raising, "without extra limitations upbringing is very stressful, especially if you get to know your baby's gender may not."
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, with both male and female genitalia births babies hermaphrodites (bisexual), which was named after the Greek deity handsome bisexual and transgender.
Less than a decade ago, and about the medical world was considered as the penis slate that can be erased and rewritten.
But now many people are challenging the ethics of surgery, they are understanding that gender-identity is complicated, and sometimes may even mistake from physicians who do not know children grow up feeling about your penis on specifications.
Dresser says "in the middle of the twentieth century," psychiatric emergency ".
When these children were born, you were not called a psychiatrist, you called surgery doctor.
Treatment of children with ambiguous genitalia in the existing theory of John hispanic University Dr. John money was presented by sunirmanniya the penis.
He composed "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental signals â how do parents raising kids-baby set by interact with genes and hormones that it be identified as male or female.
But in the case of the year 1966, "John/Joan" known as his theory became disputed.
They have a child, whose sex-lingagracharm-uchchedan (sarkamsishan) was accidentally during sex, advised parents that they leave his testicles removed by full of infertile and interactive nursery rhymes-follow kind of girl.
Dresser said, "money said the case presented as successful avasthantar case, but that it happened."
15 years of age, the child has changed as you back up your men and one woman marriage.
But the 38-year-old, committed suicide.
Dresser said that still have some doctor "follow the same pattern".
But after years of year 1990 with the advent of the Internet, these gender through surgery, started to come in front of persons "not happy with the results.
The case is the author of 36-year-old montana was with Jim Bruce, x y. Male chromosome had fathered, but her genitalia are ambiguous.
Physicians clearly did not understand that his penis was small, or clitoris was big, but they were sure that he ever male as "satisfied" life could not live.
So after some time of his birth in the year 1976, Bruce external organ and testicles were removed by surgery and his upbringing was like the girl.
At the age of 12, her female hormone replacement therapy.
She told ABCNews.com, "I knew I'm not a girl."
I was not happy, but the question was too hard to do.
18 years of age, with her vaginoplasty was occurring.
But depressed and feel something wrong, she sought medical records.
It revealed the appalling reality.
At birth I was infertile-and never told me.
By Bruce d. s. d. Was born, with her body from making sufficient testosterone, which may not be properly developed her genitalia.
After finding out the truth, she male, he took testosterone supplements and your breast hatva.
Surgery because he was infertile.
Today, the interface is called project organization people about their perception of extrusion individuals to build normal explains.
However, the California-based legal group advocates for inpharmd choice of Governing Director Annie tamara â maitis express concern that Germany's law "invites chipp and stigma."
She says, "a lot of people think the law of Germany activist parents quick decision-making and child" undefined "will inspire you."
We fear that it will encourage the intervention.
We think to specify male or female gender, rather than better process.
But we don't know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Tamara â maitis said that his organization's support of Australian law because "it was adults allows recognized in third sex."
He said, "legal gender of adults should be able to take their own decisions."
Law of Germany to specify at the time of birth is related to it.
This time the war fought by infants.
Large, decisions related to their bodies they can take themselves.
But Pittsburgh breast radiologist Dr. Airline biarritz whose daughter sexual development disorder support group, which help others hundreds, said the law of Germany parents and children both "power."
Biarritz's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but complete insensitivity syndrome called androgens d. s. d. .
Since then was to blame, so receivers androgens in women in developed Katy characteristics.
The uterus or vagina in her body but not dimbagranthi.
Now the 29-year-old Katy child psychology at the University of pennsylvania married and resident in the Department.
Although he is infertile, but through the adoption or gesteshnal sources are expected to be the mother.
Biarritz said, "this law lets the parents that they not take a hasty decision."
Them, ' male ' or ' female ' before writing some tests by properly understanding and time.
In this way, you are right-child upbringing, love child.
You have a cute baby and.
We don't make hasty don't need such surgery that cannot be.
He said, "it brings up the children in the decision making process and got the parents-to-dushchinta-free because they don't believe that they are doing fine."
Eventually, the child will determine what he is more comfortable with gender--and it's great.
It's the kids in their own decisions.

George gave the Scots a dissolution euro caravan option
Another day, another tale of scared of freedom
This time we have been warned that e. As a condition of membership of the independent travel across Europe as the area of Scotland free to join.
Breakaway at passport control and harden on the walls of barbed wire border indicate stories about.
The truth is that free traffic with the rest of Europe by straithaklaid paper's potential economic benefits described, though-as anticipated-handles in the description.
Nor has anyone described e. Members own most of the time spend in their formal rules to suit your needs change.
Since now shining area Scotland, so Brussels is actually from Scotland who also wants to obtain it in return for continuing non-compliance to Brussels discount.
So, again, non-story.
And the thing that is so distressed for a long time, he froze. first I "means freedom passport control" baseless news heard nearly 40 years ago.
This interesting anecdote in passing the interesting point was lost.
Anyway to free Scotland from why should Europe's bidding?
Why the yoke of Brussels London purchasing sales, especially now?
Here is the actual European news: Europe to organize the great, a post-war plan eventually freeze.
Euro crisis, project Europe officially dead.
The whole e. In e. Opposed to euro as currency or similar to stop are firmly dedicated team.
Even in Germany, Germany yuroskeptil alternative for party-founded this year has only come in the federal election of September â suddenly nearly five million votes received, and thus free Democrats (equivalent to our own lib Dames) effectively out of the bundestag.
The Federal plan to build Europe's always domestic opposition.
However, the current economic crisis proved a radical parivartankarak.
Berlin and the European Central Bank at the same time, rigid rules imposed by equal exchange to comply through national economies due to the constraints on many people having to think the project Europe has gone too far.
National Governments of the euro's excessive budget deficit wasn't too much role â it is only in the case of Greece was the truth.
Rather, the euro system has its members in favour of the German exporters to stabilize currency exchange rates â something that German politicians want to keep.
Domestic currency devaluation without the possibility of Germany, southern Europe compared himself with the underlying loss in productivity.
The only way to pay and reducing public expenditure-which has been encouraged by Berlin.
The current budget and currency problems have further deep European productivity than morbidity.
Consumers ' expenditure to provide discounted French and German energy firms â put up by Brussels "green" energy policies as a result, European industry compared to the power of the United Nations to pay for gas doubled and quadrupled.
It's going to cripple the cost disadvantages, which we've seen before in grangemouth.
Everyone in the world get a salary freeze, European petrochemicals industry affordable. Shell gas can save from being affected by.
The result is a sense of rebellion broke out in people, especially in France, which e. Main fan.
After France's top politicians yuddh has e. To control the Germany, and Paris in the world to provide equal billing to vanshigtan measures.
But Berlin is now political legitimacy as a passport to Paris is not required, and has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, which is why France's economy will be shaky at.
Results: marine Le Pen's right-wing, e. Anti national front recently ranked third in the by-elections, the ruling by pushing the Socialist victory.
This time, with 24 percent of the vote in France is the most popular party front â it is time for the British Labour warning that they cannot assume that the collapse, for right to left automatically returns heaga.
Le Pen French whites, working class with its new found fame?
The following year this team e. Use the polls in the European Parliament e. Cannot access common currency, wants to make an outfit.
If, as is quite possible, these elections e. Opposition do well so the bloc could affect the European Parliament for the first time.
My approach is this: soon in Europe, e. Anti and cannot access common currency will wreck the euro convergence of conflicting emotion.
The euro will not completely, but it is retail "(sovereign) Nations of Europe" will be back in some form such as that of General de Gaulle.
Germany and its retainer can maintain some euro economies are interlinked, but France and southern Europe will restart its currencies.
I expect that the u.s. hopes of keeping close with. Keep yourself away from this project.
However, the growing interest of vanshigtan in the Pacific indicate that the UK will be left in the cold Atlantic.
These are the most after Scotland?
We little England area (essentially) can be made.
Or we can protect its own economic interests â in which Berlin and Brussels to tell apart at the right time.
I think Scotland loose European system could better performance, provided that we keep their own currency.
Non-federal countries in Europe that countries get other similar easy to work with.
Otherwise we go the route of narve about maintaining its economic independence must be considered.
S.n. in Scotland. Government-ullekhnaniya as-anti-austerity in Europe's most successful political campaigns, who proposed by the Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling (and executing) opposed to reductions and then stumbled on the-lib based on Dame Coalition won the majority of the year 2011 was amazing.
Vote for independence, this time for Scotland to be hogwash, because in that case it's Berlin and Brussels to accept the austerity imposed by the rule.
