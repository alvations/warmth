Congress is concession: US government must $700 billion in banks pumping 
The leader of the American Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush, have a broader form an agreement on funding for the American financial system. 
It is to be voted on at the beginning of next week. 
The American lawmakers reached in talks on a Rettungsplanes in the form of a loan for the American financial system in a total of $700 billion (approximately 12 trillion kroner) a breakthrough. 
However, this means no victory. 
The Members of Congress must negotiate after some details of the agreement, before the final version of the law and are allowed to vote. 
The plan to support the financial system is on Monday in the US Congress. 
On Sunday said that the chairman of the Committee on banking and financial services Barney Frank, the Reuters news agency. 
In the Senate vote could be different, probably until at least Wednesday on the plan. 
Economists show that a communication that the plan be approved, the first significant psychological factor for a revival of the financial markets. 
Then come it to a "sobering" because of the complex mechanisms, such as the markets in practice could help. 
Paulson: The plan must be effective 
"We have made significant progress. 
We have clarified our different views, such as a package to stabilise the market should look like, "said the agency Bloomberg the democrat Nancy Pelosi. 
Their words suggest that it could still on Sunday to a final vote. 
Representatives of the legislators took on the night of Sunday, with the US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, to give the Regierungsfonds its final form. 
This is a Abkauf undisposable Hypothekenaktiva by the financial companies, the financial firms in heavy losses, and the stability of the entire system at risk. 
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and on the market also be effective. 
We must pursue the Gesundungsplan still further, but I think we are getting close, "Paulson. 
A message for Asiengeschäfte 
The global financial crisis is also apparent in the stock markets, which have been falling sharply. 
The words of the Democrat Senator from Nevada, Harry Reid, according to the lawmakers, before Sunday in Congress to a final agreement. 
So if you want the investors to participate in the Asian markets, which, in the first time zone, where could influence a decision of Congress the business on Monday. 
But it is not yet clear when will vote both chambers of Congress about the law, there is also unclear whether the could not fail in last minute negotiations but still a problem. 
The lawmakers hope that it in the next few days. 
The law but will still have to be some changes. 
To help the system certain total amount will be divided into two parts. 
The initial $350 billion are as quickly as possible should be made available, as President George Bush called for. 
The Congress can but the payment of the remaining money block, if he has the impression that the programme not his function, and in another $100 billion, and later the final $350 billion. 
Bush sees progress in negotiations positive 
The President has this decision a veto, but the Congress veto outvote. 
Despite these changes, however, is the basic idea of the programme remained in place, the point was based, finances for the Abkauf worse Hypothekenwertpapiere, whose value has fallen, to gain because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages. 
"We have everything. 
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday about the law, the Senate on Monday, "the Republican Senator Judd Gregg. 
With progress was happy too, President Bush. 
His spokesman Tony Fratto declared, Bush with progress on Saturday and "appreciate both efforts to stabilize our financial markets and our economy to protect". 
Restriction golden Fallschirme 
The chairman of the banking committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said the lawmakers had a responsibility for the Money Programme, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the perks and a timetable for the financing of the plan. 
The new law will also restrict the so-called golden Fallschirme for directors of societies, which are participating in the programme and a committee, the supervision of the fund. 
This is the Treasury. 
"We have worked very hard and achieved a major step towards an agreement that works and is for the market and for all Americans is important," Paulson. 
The plan could also aid for homeowners, which have problems with the repayment of their mortgage. 
The government should negotiate new rates for mortgages, which she buys, which aims to reduce the monthly costs for the debtor and to enable them to keep their homes. 
Marek: Psychologische aid 
The proposed plan after the Hauptökonomen of Patria Finance David Marek, a good idea, but the implementation will be very difficult. 
"And, because you don't know by what mechanism and at what price the troubled assets are bought. 
This will determine how to divide up the financial sector and the government's losses among themselves, "said Marek this week, the server iHNed.cz. 
Whether the plan now or early next week, is not Mareks view. 
"It is much more important that the congressman, to support the plan and that they it as quickly as possible. 
The psychological importance of the agreement that there will be an adoption, is, at this moment the most important thing, "said Marek. 
Duel on a knife edge: MP3 players against mobile phones. 
We advise you to your appointment 
While nearly every cell phone MP3-Dateien are unfolding, not MP3 players use. 
Why is, of course, that it is better to buy only a telephone. 
Despite this, there are plenty of reasons why a stand-alone player should gain. 
The election depends on the type of use and the challenges of the future owner. 
Sure you buy it for home a splendid expensive Plattenspieler order the latest album from Boycko Turbulenc to listen to. 
Even seem such musical items not on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view, there is no objective reason for this. 
Have you LPs with type rock, jazz or blues shelf, dream you probably at least by one. 
It is also the music on trips, with condensed music, simple - music in MP3-Format. 
Here too there is price and quality categories. 
For the one hand, it is perhaps not acceptable for a player eight thousand kronor, as we will be a Pink-Floyd-Fan hard pressed headphones for twenty kroner market. 
Two extremes, between which everyone enough space. 
The selection is vast. 
Also the lifespan of the batteries is crucial. 
Some good music player can very much more than just music, but what can mobile phones, they do not even hints. 
No modern equipment is as universal as the telephone. 
Besides the primary functions, the cost and the Simsen, cannot be it music and videos, both, it has a better, or worse camera and can perhaps also. 
And if you add the Smartphons and communicators, it was almost a small computers in the bag. 
It is a minor miracle, because no fridge can grillen and no television taking photographs. 
But the universality of the mobile phones also disadvantages. 
The more responsibilities you on your cell phone use, the more often you will but it nachladen must. 
And that music is one of the largest energy. 
Only a few mobile phones can music longer than zehn-zwölf hours, most of it is much less. 
In this respect are Music player (especially the simplest) significantly more efficient. 
You should therefore cheap count mobile phones to expect that they will no longer than a few hours of music. 
If you then and still telephone, buy the safety prefer a Ladegerät scarred for office - which also applies to more expensive equipment. 
In MP3 players, you will not have this problem, even the less good keep at least 9 hours of plant with a time loading. 
Another problem is, if it wants to ignore the music on mobile phones. 
Unfortunately, only a small part of the equipment on a USB-Abschluss, also does not support any mobile phone without special software directly to a PC. 
Of course, cannot ignore the music directly to a storage medium means, but only a few Kartenlesegeräte will without reduction with the tiny Speicherkarten ready, which are used in mobile phones. 
In players need you to exceptions (iPod) no special software. 
They need to feed the device only USB-Port with music from your PC. 
Most mobile phones and player conduct itself a Musikbibliothek to, according to the name of the performers, the title of the Albums, the Genre or the assessment by users. 
Some devices are the only Baumstruktur of the Adressverzeichnisses onwards, similar Windows Explorer, some of them both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent telephones with operating system). 
Players are easier to use mobile phones can more 
The selection of a specific piece of equipment you should the lifespan of batteries, the storage capacity, ask the quality, and the type of Klangs and of course the Bedienkomfort inquire. 
For music above all, and you hear it every day only briefly in the trams, then any mobile phone, is the MP3-Dateien. 
What can really almost every cell phone. 
They must not check, what Musikformate a mobile phone or a player can deal with. 
MP3 create all, and most of the music, which you receive, will be in this format. 
The format is one of the most widely disseminated, and also the most equipment also music in WMA-Format taking place. 
Less is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use). 
Better mobile phones allow online also buy music. 
One need only on mobile Internet the pages of a Providers (or any other provider), and it can be a song or album. 
This service can already in and of itself clincher, be it a Musikhandy should gain. 
Unfortunately this is offering the service providers and confined mostly only on quick Radiohits. 
The prices are not the lowest. 
In general, but the assumption is that this is exactly the sort of music (on GSM, Internet and wireless Internet) will dominate in the music industry. 
The mobile phone, the most itself. 
If you want to listen to something, you after the mobile phone in the expected, while the player forget is at home. 
However, it is important to whether your headphones or at least a wireless Freisprecheinrichtung carry. 
If not, can you use the integrated loudspeakers, on the almost every mobile phone, but only the MP3 player. 
Perhaps the biggest benefit of the Musikhandys will for many on price. 
The cheapest cost usually less than three thousand kronor. 
For three and four thousand kroner get you a decent Walkmans. 
The biggest handicap will be for the majority that are not normal headphones. 
The best and technically ausgereiftesten telephones with a 3,5-mm-Öffnung for normal headphone cost up to fifteen thousand kronor. 
The advantage of the player is in the restaurant. 
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (selection) - player can each. 
A minimum of functions, the similarity in the restaurant with the earlier normal Kassettenrekorder or the Plattenspieler is obvious. 
There is no collision in the form of a mistakenly salaried mobile Internet and then exorbitant bill for data transfers. 
The device should now take 
Also the cheapest mobile phones (such as Vodafone 527) usually have a Slot for exchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD etc.). 
Even if nachkaufen you a karte nachkaufen, rich two thousand kroner. 
But beware. 
In the Basismodellen be supported in the rule only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB. 
Only the most expensive can read 8-GB-Speicherkarten read. 
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 players, you then attack after Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver. 
According to capacity (max. 2 GB) you will have not more than 1100 kroner on the table. 
You are among the more demanding transmitted, you prefer to specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung). 
These devices have independent Bedienknöpfe for MP3, and the Bedienkomfort comes as to the one MP3-Players regurgitating them. 
Most is Sony Ericsson, the mobile phones from the series Walkmans the same Nutzerschnittstelle have such as the one sold MP3 player. 
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand kronor, but with increased storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long Akku-Lebensdauer (usually 15 hours, maximum of up to 35 hours) make you MP3 players of these manufacturers. 
The first virtual providers is already this year in the Czech Republic. 
Perhaps 
The mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite perfected, the Czech providers offering virtually all the services, as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe. 
But what is missing here - a virtual providers, of the classic to lower prices. 
Perhaps this will not be long in coming. 
For the Czech mobile phone operators to the most expensive in Europe, we have also often on Mobil.cz reported. 
This confirmed the telecommunications authority ČTÚ, who pointed out that the price of a text message here is higher than in the rest of the European Union. 
After the final steps of the European Commission in regulation of roaming charges it is as likely to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile phone operators will text message from the Ausland be cheaper than at home. 
How is it that the prices in the Czech Republic in comparison with Europe are so high? 
The answer is simple, there is the competition, which really is a challenge. 
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical in Czech, there are three mobile networks and a Penetration of far more than 100%. 
The mobile phone operators rant gladly, however, that it on the Czech market much competition. 
The share is often the chairman of the Council of the Czech telecommunications authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, the often expressed in the past, that there was no place in the Czech Republic for another supplier. 
It is likely that not a classic providers with their own network so many opportunities (would find it probably hardly frequencies). 
But there is still a possibility - a virtual providers. 
The entry of virtual providers on the mobile phone market brought a strong price reduction, in which had then take the traditional mobile phone operators. 
There was even before the advent of such firms such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market in Britain similar votes as in the Czech Republic. 
However, it turns out that it for such providers place and that they can be successful. 
Incidentally, needs to not long after examples. 
In February of this we have on the launch of the virtual supplier Mobilking in Poland. 
In just half a year it turned the supplier, more than 100 thousand customers to win and for fünfgrößten providers in the country. 
Behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, the Czech Republic, among other things, U: fon possesses. 
The advantage of virtual providers is, therefore, that much more specific target group. 
In order to function effectively, need virtual providers much less customers as a classic providers. 
They need not relatively high costs for construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network. 
In the world are joining the virtual providers are usually seen as Low-Cost-Firmen heraus - they offer cheap phone calls and text messages, which, often from a less extensive service Leistungsangebot begleitet wird. 
Providing such as Tesco Mobile in Britain SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors. 
As demonstrated by the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be quite a good move, not to put on a klischeehafte target group. 
Those suppliers is: specifically to men. 
"True just choose Mobilking - the supplier who they like and whom they can trust," David Seibert, the chief executive of the Mobile entertainment Company, the company this virtual prey. 
It's hard to say whether it would take a similar concept as in Poland, Czech Republic. 
Doubts also the official press Vodafone Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is a market segment in which the most virtual providers, relatively small. 
It is from the perspective of the service Leistungsangebots relatively saturated. " 
In the Czech Republic a chance, my mobile telephone providers 
But it is almost certain that, if a virtual mobile phone operators conquered the Czech Republic, this will not be Mobilking. 
"We talk about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic, the negotiations were not hope. 
It will be more of a market entry of Mobilking in other countries in our region, "he says in a phone call for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, Pressesprecherin the financial group Penta. 
Indirectly confirming it so that the current mobile phone operators in the Czech Republic this idea. 
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible to ensure that there is not a potential competitor. 
Their interest in a launch of a virtual Mobilfunkanbieters shows for some time, the group GTS Novera, which would like to take a further step, in order to be a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the area Firmenkunden. 
"We have an interest in our customers not only fixed, but also Mobilfunk-Telekommunikationsdienstleistungen to offer. 
And the sooner the better. 
This possibility we have negotiated repeatedly with all Czech incurred by customers. 
Some of them we have already negotiating progress, "the spokesman of the group Pavel Kaidl. 
Perhaps now better times. 
With no official information that is expected to be the first virtual providers perhaps by the end of the year. 
But is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence. 
"At this moment, we do not imagine that, in the Czech Republic for a full virtual providers. 
The Czech market points to other markets big specifics. 
Has contacted us yet no subject with a complex and serious project in this area, "says in his statement to Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2. 
For the specific nature of the Czech market also include other providers. 
The Pressesprecherin of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the statement of O2 added: "So far we have not yet viable and mutually advantageous project, which could continue building." 
And adds: "In network of T-Mobile will come before the end of the year was hardly a virtual providers. 
At this moment, we would have been have a practical way, in order to think so short term can. " 
Vodafone is its attention more to meet the demands of its own 3G-Lizenz. 
Miroslav Čepický thinks: "For negotiations with potential virtual operators are we open, particularly in the field division of costs and infrastructure. 
This is exactly what we see from the perspective of the customers as the best. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is in search of a partner to create a shared network for a fast mobile Internet. " 
The competent authorities, with the hand in hand 
The mobile phone operators is easy to understand, another supplier would be more competition, that would lead to lower prices and also to the profits. 
So why should facilitate a competitors from entering the market? 
That the providers, when it comes to something, illustrates the long trek to the emergence of U: fon. 
Probably the strongest in ČTÚ was at that time, U: fon came on the market, by society T-Mobile. 
It also publicly accessible information from the ČTÚ-Webseiten. 
But now stands just U: fon than argument why a virtual providers should not allow. 
Martina Kemrová said: "The Konkurrenzumfeld of the mobile phone market was recently by entering the market a fourth Mobilfunkanbieters strengthened. 
In light of the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that would include a new player in the market itself and above all his services high demands. " 
Given this approach the mobile phone operators surprised the absolute lack of Czech regulatory authorities. 
It is not the attitude of the ČTÚ, in Czech, unfortunately, in contrast to Britain and other developed countries - not the competence in the economic competition. 
Has this exclusively the for the protection of economic competition (ÚOHS). 
This but referred to this whole issue its very typical attitude. 
"Market entry of a virtual Mobilfunkanbieters would then be possible, it is a contract between a mobile phone operators and a virtual providers on the leasing of the necessary infrastructure. 
So far there has been no such contract completed, because offering potential stakeholders was probably for the traditional operators not sufficiently interesting, "in his response to our request Kristián Chalupa by the external relations department of the ÚOHS. 
Representatives of the companies would not be surprising, such an approach. 
By one authority, which represent the interests of consumers and to make, among other things, that none of his position in the market, this is more than worrying. 
In particular, add Kristián Chalupa adds: "In Ausland, where work virtual providers quite normal, is to observe that its market entry to a price reduction in mobile telephone services". 
But probably the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and not a price reduction to the interests of the ÚOHS. 
Really shocking is in this case the almost touching line the three mobile phone operators, stemming from their reactions. 
The question of whether it was a coincidence. 
Just as the same petrol prices at the pumps sure only by chance and a hard competition. 
"The authority has discovered in this matter no evidence to suggest that a competition; action, and it also has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter. 
None of the providers has a dominant market position, so he has not the appropriate increased responsibility for his actions in the market. 
The tools for opening the mobile telephone market for virtual providers may lack also the regulatory authority for telecommunications, Chalupa in his statement. 
The interpretation of a dominant position in the market is one of many points. 
There are of course an analysis of the relevant markets, drawn up by the ČTÚ, after the telecommunications in the view of the economic competition a single market. 
In such a market has of course, none of the Czech mobile phone operators a dominant position. 
Some legal experts but offer a different vision - for access to the market a virtual supplier is always the approval of the network operator. 
And the mobile phone operators - logically - for its network the monopoly. 
That means that he is taking in a particular segment necessarily a dominant position. 
Even if this argument not able, it should be for the ÚOHS at least a warning that three mobile phone operators striking resemblance. 
This show complaints a number of interested parties (including the society GTS Novera) that they are in negotiations with all providers in very similar obstacles. 
The drain on the ČTÚ is in telecommunications services a fairly common trick, the ÚOHS by the whole affair. 
This was observed in a number of similar cases. 
Unfortunately, it is not in the recently decided to amend the legislation expanding the powers of the ČTÚ on the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts from an improvement in the situation had promised. 
The representatives of the ÚOHS know only too well, but probably they have other interests. 
It is, if nobody watching 
Unseen until the operation of any pseudovirtueller providers, of which there are in the Czech mobile networks several. 
There are companies that spend their own price lists for mobile telecom services, which are only partly publicly. 
It is usually because firms operating in the area Multilevel-Marketing. 
Own mobile telephone services offer for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others. 
The price lists companies arrive normally only to select. 
The joke of the matter is that the company with the operators as a classical Firmenkunde occurs, the orders a large amount of SIM cards. 
As important customer he then special price offers (and other services). 
The problem is that the conditions of all Czech operators a similar sales ban. 
"If there are some cases that you describe, then it can be a violation of the contractual conditions, we will be dealing with it, which can lead to a break-up of cooperation with the society," said Martina Kemrová to our question on this problem. 
But it is unlikely that gets something in the upper echelons of the mobile phone operators. 
Particularly in the case of the three mentioned firms can be thousands of customers. 
No operator resists, however, such an approach. 
From the activity of these firms spent they forgettable profits, it - unlike the real virtual suppliers - not through the official marketing. 
Potential problems is Miroslav Čepický closely: "The law allows these types of speculation, despite all the service companies, only a very small percentage of customers. 
This must accept that the SIM-Karte in her telephone not on their behalf, so they can not reason as ordinary customers of the mobile phone operators ". 
That alone but should be the ČTÚ strange to say the least. 
Besides an issue for the ÚOHS. 
The mobile phone operators in this way, why are they against a virtual providers? 
It added that the ÚOHS for detecting such activities fairly strong powers, and if they do not, it must not with the statement of the providers, they know nothing about it and its business conditions it is prohibited,. 
When the Czech Republic more at is 
As the text has already been said, the market virtual providers a sharp price drop in the various services. 
Have practically in all countries, where virtual providers, the traditional operators tried, which virtually more or less. 
The arguments were virtually identical - a small, or very gesättigter market, problems with the quality of services, etc. 
In advanced countries but, in these moments, the regulatory bodies, not the interests of the mobile phone operators, but to keep trying to their customers. 
Whether through formal or informal pressure, they reached that the first virtual operator, and this was followed by further. 
Unfortunately, throw the Czech regulatory agencies throughout the case like a hot potato. 
Based on our experience we can help get rid of that uncertainty over the powers in these cases is good. 
But we will be throwing in the towel none. 
If the background and soon a virtual providers, will be the Czech mobile market may soon moving again. 
If a supplier to the emergence of a virtual Mobilfunkanbieters leaves the ÚOHS not remain inactive, wenn es darum geht, further interested parties reject (to discriminate against). 
And the Czechs will stop expensive phone than the rest of Europe. 
The new Czech anthem has four new versions. 
You choose the best from 
You hear the four versions of the new Czech national anthem. 
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek celebrating the day of the Czech statehood in a ceremony at the new footage of the national anthem Where is my home country.

One of the seven state symbols remained even after the advent of the original Czech Republic. 
As the "new" anthem 
The Prague are striking transport on Wednesday for the first time also on a chip 
The Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will go down in the history of the Prague are striking as a date, in a subway, tram or bus the first passengers, the instead of a Papierfahrscheins an electronic coupon in their pockets. 
These can now approximately a hundred thousand people buy, have a badge Opencard possess. 
Passengers can choose a 30-Tage-, a 90-Tage- or a Jahrescoupon (valid from 1 January 2009) buy and simultaneously on its chip card, and in the information services and branches of transport in the subway stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka. 
The coupons are since yesterday on the Internet on the sides of the transport www.dpp.cz available. 
The service was in the Nachmittagsstunden of more than 400 customers. 
Those who use the Internetverkauf can forget the Ausgabefenster in the subway stations, where they had to wait until now regularly in long queues at its Papierfahrscheine wait. 
They buy the coupon on the Internet, posed this to the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library. 
"On these issues is the travellers also counters with well-trained staff available, interested in Internetkauf advises and also the coupon on the map in five," the spokesman for the project Martin Opatrný. 
Besides the libraries can can take the electronic coupons, also Selbstbedienung vending machines on the Opencard, which are appropriate in some U-Bahn-Vestibüls. 
What are these machines? 
They are red, remember Fahrscheinentwerter passengers they may have in the subway stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská noticed. 
"There are in the town of five of them, by the end of the year it should be but eighty", Opatrný added. 
The coupon controlled instead of the driver an automaton 
Servicing the vending machines which tomorrow will work, is simple. 
Witness the chip card, and the first acquired coupon plays itself. 
The electronic coupons apply from tomorrow, not only in the capital, but also in the vicinity. 
In the Vorstadtzügen and onto the bus with the numbers of 300 to 499, with which the residents from communities in the region Mittelböhmen in the capital. 
"In the trains, which belong to the Prague integrated transport, the Zugbegleiter reading equipment with which they can check the validity of coupons, according to time and zone," said Filip Drápal from the organisation of Ropid the Fahrscheinkontrolle. This organisation is the timetables for the Prague are striking. 
The Vorstadtbusse have Kartenlesegeräte at the checkout in their cars. 
In boarding the chip card must not only the drivers', but the Opencard is a similar post at the side of the line. 
So controlled the driver of the validity of the aufgespielten coupons. 
"Wants a passenger the validity of the aufgespielten coupons, nothing is nothing less, than the driver to this information to ask," Drápal. 
A passenger, not with Vorstadtbussen moving and no longer knows when the validity of the coupons, can turn to the Selbstbedienung machines, the coupons on the map in setting. 
Here are the information on the validity of its documents on the display of the appliance. 
The Sudeten were calling on the United States a plebiscite 
The Sudeten Germans have asked in 1945 at the affiliation of the Böhmerwaldes to the United States. 
This is from a letter, the in the collections of Südböhmischen scientific library. 
If we are not part of Germany and Austria, can we at least under the auspices of the United States of America. 
With such a desire to be in 1945 some groups of Sudeten Germans to US President have approached. 
This is from a letter, which has been preserved in a Privatarchiv and kept the today in the collections of Südböhmischen scientific library. 
The Germans of Krumau ask in the letter from the American president, the return of the "Sudetengaus" - on the basis of the Munich agreement of Hitler was taken - to Czechoslovakia not allow. 
"We have the situation properly understood and want us really the words to be sure that the American units not as oppressors and enemies German territory, but as liberators," it says, in a letter, with the words "people, which the fate of the Sudeten on herzen lies" sign. 
Since joining the Czechoslovakia the Sudeten Germans - in the Czech national character - suggests that it brutality, reckless, incomprehension, oppression and slavery would expect, the author of the letter and the American President, for today and in the Schutzherrschaft on the Bohemian Forest. 
"We can't believe that you credit without regard to the view of a quarter-million people in this area to us foreign state, oppressed minorities and to eliminate tried and nothing on the victory of Allies has contributed," is in the letter read. 
The reason why the author can sign is supposedly the fear Rachegelüsten of the "Czech oppressors". 
If the US president expressed doubts about the affiliation of Böhmerwalddeutschen cherish, whether it be sufficient, if he Böhmerwaldgau a referendum in motion, whether the part of the United States or under the Schutzherrschaft of the United States live. 
Although the text of the letter in the post-war may sound a little naïve tonight, that he is, however, some say witness a good picture for the expectations of Sudeten Germans. 
Even if the Bohemian Germans at least guessed, that we had on their return from the Republic would negotiate, only a few of them such a possibility at all. 
Some waited, that would negotiate the United States and Britain for the Sudeten autonomy for them. 
Others believed others, they could simply in Czechoslovakia. 
The also confirmed the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis. 
He was at war as Budweiser a German in the navy in the Baltic Sea. 
When he looks at the end of the war in British captivity came and placed him in a Kriegsgefangenenlager after Holstein, were dozens of other beings most Germans to him that he should teach them to Czech. 
"She reasoned that if they heimkämen, were to try them come the Czech," Chalupa. 
Nobody in the German prisoners of war, before the war in Czechoslovakia had lived, had his view that he would be on the basis of the Beneš-Dekrete from the Republic of drive. 
Heard you not - then bucks! 
An emotional campaign to motorists. 
Most expensive action to safety on the roads in the Czech history. 
So could the emotional media campaign, which will launch the Ministry on Wednesday. 
The authority of Prime Aleš Řebíček promises them, drivers of dangerous behavior behind the wheel away. 
The campaign for 150 million kroner will TV, radio, in cinema, on the Internet, but also on Flyern run. 
They will discourage drivers to faster driving and driving. 
And she, too, anzugurten themselves before Fahrtantritt. 
The campaign wants especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not least professional Kraftfahrern into conscience. 
And what is shown in the advertising spots shown? 
Especially stories of people who appeal to our emotions. 
The "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign: 
Heard you not - then bucks! 
The words "heard" not in Großbuchstaben on a Kennzeichenschild. 
And in a Blutlache is then the word "could just as". 
This should mean that can pay for a moment mistake with their own lives. 
The spots will viewers by 2010 "shock". 
The ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries inspire, where normal images with dramatic footage of accident victims can see. 
It promises to be confident that the number of accidents and the number of deaths on the Czech roads. 
The spots were created by the agency Euro RSCG worded. 
Both carrot and stick to the motorist. 
"For drivers is the carrot and the stick. 
Carrot means that, if they drive in red, save time. 
The stick is the threat of a punishment or an accident. 
The driver must be reminded of the risk, "the Verkehrspsychologe of the hospital was Homolce Martin Kořán. 
And why campaigns in the press and negative advertising necessary, the psychologist. 
Less effective in his view, tables, making the driver to a threat. 
"Is a static blackboard, on a danger warns, will probably soon with the verfließen, and the driver they will not be," says Kořán. 
Olmert would give almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace to return 
The chairman of the Israeli government Ehud Olmert has called for the return of virtually all the territories it occupied in 1967, including the Jordanland, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if we in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria close. 
It stressed in an interview, which was printed on Monday by the newspaper Jediot Achronot. 
"We have an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary, almost all (occupied) areas back, if not all," said Olmert told the newspaper. 
"We keep a percentage of these areas, but we are going to the Palestinians as high percentage (Israeli territory) must step down, because there will be without this no peace," he added. 
He acknowledged that a possible return also East Jerusalem covering. 
"The security in Jerusalem wants and especially not that tractors or bulldozers on his feet, as it is as one of my best friends, will have to forgo part of Jerusalem," said Olmert in allusion to two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured. 
After the Prime Minister, it will be necessary, "a special arrangement for the Tempelbern and sacred and historical sites", which are on the territory of the old town. 
", of the Israeli sovereignty over the whole city, will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs. 
This will not work, "he endorsed. 
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights 
Olmert spoke for an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which is that he believes a condition for the signing of a peace treaty with Syria. 
However, this would also certain efforts on the part of Damascus. 
"I would suggest not, with Syria and to close on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights for peace," confirmed Olmert. 
"The Syrians know only too well what they have, to give the Golan back. 
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran do; they are on their relationship to (Shiite) have movement; they will have to forgo the constant support terrorism (Shiite) Hamas, the al-Qaeda terrorist network Al-Khaida and jihad (holy war) grant in Iraq ", became the Prime Minister. 
Questions after the accident: are stewards in the bus is illegal? 
The law does not know it, in a Fernreisebus is not the Umherlaufen 
In connection with the tragic accident involving a bus of society student Agency in the vicinity of the Italian Padua begs the question is whether stewards and passengers during the journey in the bus and running away. 
"We wanted strictly and formally the law, the work of a stewards in defiance of the law on road transport," the spokesman for the Department of Transportation Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident, in the last week a giving Stewardess died, caused probably by the drivers of the vehicles, the kreuzte the bus the path kreuzte. 
The young woman was in this moment to top it all, in addition to the driver, at the least safe place in the car, even if they have two more seats available. 
A bus can also have an accident or sharply curbed, in which the Steward coffee or newspapers austrägt. 
Played a role, too, whether the bus the Fahrzeugbrief viewed with Stehplätzen facility. 
If it is not in a bus, must sit the travellers. 
The Fernreisebusse of student Agency have no Stehplätze; what the director of the company, Radim Jančura, to Aktuálně.cz confirmed. 
"This we have with the Treasury, and it has not agreed to let the movement of passengers. 
Later withdrew it, and we came to a consensus that the passengers during the journey to the toilet can, if they have their seat ", he told his position with. 
The law makes no Steward 
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a stewards - no law describes this role. 
But there are also no law, which prohibits the carriers to provide services. 
The law on the road only the concept Fahrzeugbegleiter; rights and obligations defined it ", the spokesman of the Ministry Hanzelka clearly. 
The director of the department vehicles Department of Transportation Josef Pokorný other hand, believes that the law this problem. 
"It is a question of whether the bus in the product approval also Stehplätze has. 
This is everything, "he says. 
Buses are divided between buses, where it Stehplätze gives and the speed limit is limited local with Stehplätzen and higher level of speed and Fernreisebusse without Stehplätze with the highest permitted speed and seats, which are equipped with seat belts. 
As the plane, says the professional 
The BESIP-Fachmann for road safety Jaroslav Hořín sees in the movement of stewards on board a bus not essential. 
"In a liquid driving will threaten not many dangers, the situation is comparable with the service on board an aircraft. 
Here, too, is not sure when turbulence, and the Stewardess can chafe. " 
"Slow but a bus sharp, then naturally apply the laws of physics. 
As in Stadtbus or in a tram. 
The safety of the stewards must clarify the carrier through internal rules, "he says, and also says that will not solve this issue from the perspective of the law. 
Jančura is prepared to remove the services 
Student Agency is the only Busfirma services of stewards. 
The company employs around 200 people in office. 
The director is their even after the accident, not as risikoträchtig. 
"As soon as I get the impression that the job of stewards risikoträchtig is it, I will remove him. 
Coffee and newspapers can passengers in boarding. 
This would also reduce costs, "he says. 
As interest in the safety of the director of Asiana Alexy Litvin the absence of stewards in his buses. Its society is but only a fraction of lines compared with student Agency. 
"We have no stewardesses, defend us from birth. 
Sooner or later the journalists with a fatal accident, "he had not quite a year ago for Týden.cz expressed. 
That was an enormous tragedy 
The accident involving a Linienbusses after Naples was a young Stewardess from the region Pilsen, who had worked for two years for the society. 
The Slovenian lorries was abgebogen probably without lights the pull abgebogen and had the bus journey. 
The attempted drivers of the bus, with a close manoeuvres to avoid, collided with the right could move with the lorry. 
That had been sold two seats for the stewards, denies Jančura. 
"These places can be reserved not great, they are blocked." 
Firm wants to sue lorry drivers. 
With compensation for the family of the young woman the agency will not wait for the court, a financial compensation expected them but also of the culprits. 
A change? 
Not in sight. 
A more detailed regulations of the movement of stewards on board a bus could have legislation, which an investment activities experts team of the Department of Transportation already over a year. 
This, however, is not yet practical. 
Buses are also on the agenda, rather the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones in the journey, "expert Hořín. 
"The Department of Transport the work of the stewards not as something that the safety of the traveling public much could threaten," Hanzelka, with control over the security of the buses in the hands of the police and the Arbeitsschutzbehörden lies. 
Düsseldorfer hope lies in Frankfurt 
In words lacking in the letter from the WestLB-Vorstands to the staff of the House. 
By a bringing units of the Düsseldorfer money Institute with the Frankfurter Deka-Bank "could be the central Kapitalmarkthaus the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe", it says on Monday revealed letter. 
The WestLB would be a "Kompetenzblock" with sustainable profitability in such a deal. 
And could such a link the future Bündelungen in Landesbankensektor be. 
So reads it wants to demonstrate a governing board at a difficult time to act. 
Because the folding WestLB remains under tremendous pressure. 
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Institute for Finanzdienstleistung supervision, which has made it clear the nordrhein-westfälischen country government recently, pushing the time to find a solution for the future. 
From a as any link between the Deka-Bank, the Sparkassenkunden because of their Investmentsfonds know, and the WestLB is for some time - also in Frankfurt. 
Although has told Deka-Bank-Chef Franz Waas during the presentation of the Halbjahreszahlen end of August, in a merger of the House to the Mainzer highway with a Landesbank, around the Helaba or WestLB, he would make no sense. 
But the Board of the Deka, which is half from each of the state banks and the Sparkassenverbänden, asked the board, with the WestLB talks on joint business activities. 
This could be the Kapitalmarktgeschäft or parts of it. 
The talks have yet, as it says on financial centre, only just begun. 
By the Deka-Bank who, with their 3,000 staff to more important employers on financial centre of Frankfurt, is not the first time the speech, when it comes to consolidation in Sparkassensektor. 
2003 it looked for a moment that would merge the Deka-Bank with the Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate and the Helaba. 
This Dreierbund was nothing. 
Hardly had plans became public, the Hessische Land government against the Helaba about. 
The two other houses were not there. 
The Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate was instead to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart. 
But it has repeatedly thought through a combination of Deka-Bank with regional banks. 
Least had, however, Günther Merl, CEO of the Helaba, spoke out against overstatement about a rapprochement with his house. 
Regardless, it seems to mature, but the knowledge that a pattern to the various houses of the public sector is needed. 
Now that the Landtagswahl in Bavaria is over, could begin connecting the BayernLB with the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg radical. 
For the Helaba this is not necessarily good news. 
Should increase the pressure to further mergers, they are the after partner for. 
In the south would only junior partner, although she has i.e., the financial crisis so far, far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. 
A rapprochement with the West LB has the well catered Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, with 85 percent of the Helaba is involved, at the beginning of the year. 
If anything, the North LB. 
Such strategic considerations but only one side. 
On the other, there is the question of how the different business models of individual houses with each other. 
In June, said Merl, the crucial question, which should ensure business model the Zukunftfähigkeit of the regional banks, was not answered by Germans catered and Giroverband hitherto. 
In the end may also be a dismantling West LB, which is not, however, of course. 
Indeed, in the letter of the boardroom, it will be a "solution" for the house. 
As with a combination of individual entities with the Deka-Bank under one hat, will tell. 
The second Wiesnwochenende is as "Italienerwochenende" known 
For Elena, it is the first for Luca the third or fourth time. 
But this time is Elena as his girlfriend, and everything was different, he says. 
Behind them, the Fünf-Liter-Bierfass of the trademark emperor, a heavily built Bärtiger and proves the some 200 Oktoberfest-Reisenden that can produce deep tones down his throat. 
Elena is Luca only a smack, then a kiss. 
From Bologna, they are to Verona. 
From here, the Busparkplatz alongside the station Puorta Nuova, launch this evening at 11: 35 p.m. four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arrival expected 6.00 p.m.. 
Three buses are especially the Italians, in a bus travel exclusively Brazilians. 
In a corner of the Parkplatzes sing the South Americans alongside their flag has been celebrated already have them in the night. 
And so, says Marco Guarda, nothing for Italians. 
Marco, which has a long coat with Pelzimitatfutter and glasses with broad silver bars, one of the buses. 
For five years to drive them to Oktoberfest, three swing it this year alone. 
At night, the day on the Wiesn, at 10.30 p.m.. 
Would spend mean only unnecessary expenses, says Marco. 
75 euros costs the journey, the Willkommensumtrunk with Kaiser-Bier, brewed in the Bavarian purity law, health insurance and the German Reiseleitung - Marco has in Frankfurt an Sprachkursus visited - including. 
And from the buses in the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brennero". 
There is no beer, yet. 
Soon it will calm in the bus passengers sleep. 
Well, they will need their forces still need. 
Being kept Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where there are also many other buses with Italian number plates on the motorway 8 near Munich once again take a break. 
As is Marcos group finally scheduled at 6.30 a.m. in the morning in the parking lot near the Theresienwiese actually arrives, there are already some 50 other buses from across Europe. 
Elena, Luca and the other, Marco considers a last address, declared the plan of attack. 
First: the yellow Käppchen of controversy. 
It says the left Oktoberfest ", in a fracture, the Internet address of Marcos travel agency:" conoscersiviaggiando.it ". 
Secondly: "If the doors Bierzelt Blancs, it says, run!", Marco in the morning. 
"Go!" And fill the seats at the back of the Zelts occupy. 
"Productivity, otherwise we, and not all Gelbmützen on same seats, in the room!" 
The measure, brüllt Marco, cost 8,25 euro. 
And tips. 
"The guards show that we behave well! 
Once their verlasst the places they are gone. " 
Thirdly, "this evening point half eleven again arrive here!"? 
And off to Wiesn. 
En route linking a yellow introduced a complete as milestones of the trees, signs and even the election poster of a large Bavarian People ’ s Party. 
We want the withdrawal be armed. 
It is the second Wiesnwochenende, as "Italienerwochenende" scheme. 
Precise figures do not exist; there is talk of 50 000, on the road over the Alps and invading the Bierzelte tip, ten percent of all visitors to be here this weekend from Italy arrived. 
The Munich police will by seven police officers of the South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bayerische Red Cross, which Nationenstatistik leads, in which the Italians before British (approximately 60 operations) and Austrians (80) with some 200 medical Versorgungen the first. 
Particularly popular with Italians is the Hofbräuzelt. 
Sleepless nights for creditors of Hypo Real Estate 
The German banking system is relatively stable, passed Bundesfinanzminister Steinbrück only in the last week. 
As well, that the politicians of the word "relatively" used and einflocht, that the German banking sector of the crises not spared. 
Because the now at the weekend. 
The Dax were fortunate in Munich Immobilienfinanzierer Hypo Real Estate (HRE) receives by a consortium of German banks a Milliardenkredit, in order to protect themselves from the turbulence in the markets. 
With the situation, familiar person told Reuters on Monday, the loan assistance amounted to up to 35 billion euros. 
The Hypo Real Estate should having only part, they also note. 
The money will come from both private and public banks. 
Background are losses in daughter Depfa. 
The Staatsfinanzierer had, according to a newspaper report on Langfristprojekte, for which he money, this extremely short refinanced - what because of distrust in the markets now is no longer possible. 
In the first half of 2008 was the Barreserve the Bank by 95% to 2,37 million euros, also the capital levels had easily from 1.6 to 1,45 per cent. 
The operating income and net proceeds from financial transactions were compared to the same period last year to zero, the proceeds Zuschreibungen to demands and certain securities and the dissolution of reserves in the wherewithal to more than 70 per cent to 5 million. 
Only thanks to higher revenues from refunds of downstream Verrechnungskosten for the restructuring of the former Depfa-Gruppe and from the reimbursement of interest rates after the tax and from the Geschäftsbesorgung for associated companies, had the Ertragsminus with approximately 16 percent more moderate. 
The former Staatsfinanzierer had itself after its privatisation in 1990 with commercial property loans verspekuliert, which only in the Aareal bank being dismantled. 
Because they earned in the classic state financing, had the Depfa themselves then in infrastructure projects and the financing of community projects private investors and the State committed (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) diversifizierrt and internationally diversifizierrt. 
The value of daughter must make the Hypo Real Estate now write-offs, a "substantial material effect" will have on the profit and loss account of the group, rather vague. 
The fact is that the dividend was deleted. 
For 2007, it was cut by two thirds. 
The Hypo Real Estate since the Depfa-Übernahme a significant and Infrastrukturfinanzierer. 
It is more than other institutes of refinancing the interbank market dependent, since it has no Kundeneinlagen. 
With the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago is lending among banks largely dried up as banks liquidity hoarding. 
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a part - around 50 billion euros of Kreditportfolios by Depfa short-term funds to refinancing. 
After the Hypo Real Estate, is the needs of the group with the credit for the time and the company "the impact of currently largely funktionsunfähigen international money markets" cocoon. 
Other sources saying that, thanks to the money the refinancing by the end of 2009 was secured. 
The HRE-Vorstandsvorsitzende Georg Funke said, that the Hypo Real Estate Group in the money markets for the foreseeable future will not need more. 
The Federal Reserve and the Federal Institute for Finanzdienstleistung supervision (BaFin) that was secured onto the market Hypo Real Estate Group. 
That is for shareholders and creditors of the bank. 
But given the momentum and uncertainties of the crisis, there is no certainty. 
It is not inconceivable that must not be funding in full. 
But the reverse is not auszuschleißen. 
After late on Sunday evening, according to reports, the bank before the insolvency, was also the least temporary rescue people not to soothe. 
The share price falls by 75% to 3,30 euro. 
Right good against the Anleihenkurse. 
While the priority debts hardly budged show, the prices of Nachrang-Anleihen clearer. 
Most affected are the bonds of the former subsidiary caused Hypo and understandably beyond 2009 and above. 
Seem Hypo-Real-Estate-Anleihen SCG a speculative Anlagealternative, so must -- after the sharp tightening of the banking crisis and the Institute, which had of the Depfa the crisis, will be considered by the stability of the international financial system. 
While central banks, governments and less risky investment banks to support the system still prepared, as long as it can be taken by one of its cancellation of the pensions. 
Or it enters what hope does little people - that we will overcome the financial crisis in the next 15 months. 
But given the with the Teilverstaatlichung result has been a string of speeches Happened to safety probably only a hopeful. 
This is especially Langzeitgläubigern some sleepless nights with the decision, whether to get rid of their commitment. 
Kurzzeitanleger can end its use to a losses for the future Abgeltungssteuerzahlungen on Kursgewinne certain subsequent years. 
Sylvana and the secrets of Bento-Box 
As Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is to present the first day of the Tachibana Highschool, to kichern the girls: Deutsche is totally "kawaii"! 
What does that mean? 
Sylvana knows that word from Mangas - in the new Austausch-Log retold from Japan. 
"The first day of school in Japan. 
I was excited. 
Even before the school I had Bammel. 
I live on the edge as witnessed in Kawasaki and move 40 minutes by train to Tachibana Highschool. 
The way I had to find myself alone, fortunately, I have not. 
The starting class seems determined not Tachibana as strictly defined as at home in Lower Saxony. 
The pupils trudeln onwards eight p.m., until twenty above nine a brief Besprechungsrunde with the teacher begins, the 'home venture. 
But before the teaching began, I was in the, me. 
I am not the type, the like to talk to people, even from a class of 40 pupils. 
Because I had no uniforms, I have an old rock my Gastmutter, this blouse, blue knees assets and black leather shoes. 
In this lift I before the rostrum and sought, everything right to say: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - I Sylvana, come from Germany, and in a week of birthday. 
At the time, I was very happy that I had got off more than two years ago, to learn the language. 
The 31 girls in the classes have all getuschelt, sniggering and gewunken and all I have the word "Kawaii". 
The knew I from my Mangas. 
It is a means to ignore vocabulary Japanese girls and means' nice, sweet '. 
Then gehuscht I quickly at my place. 
The girls beside me has gegrinst much gegrinst, they thought it was a privilege that the Austauschschülerin alongside her should be. 
The rest of the day was relatively quiet, but as the Gong was, I was really have been. 
All were confused and kicherten and asked me holes in the gut - it is really difficult, Japanese English to understand. 
In the break packten then all their Bentos from. 
My Gastmutter had me such a box - this was something other than the vapid German Pausenbrote. 
I had rice with herbs, small trucker, salad from cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in Tofumantel. 
Mostly I have not got a clue what exactly I eat here in Japan. 
The matter is strange and taste completely original. 
What is clear is that everything really lecker is. 
Well, up to the salty pausing plums, perhaps, brrrr! 
The Bentos are in Japanese schools not only lunch. 
It is sometimes that a girl a boys a even share Bento notes, which they particularly artfully herrichtet - in the hope that the boys in Pausensnack closer. 
This is something I have read in my Manga-Comics. 
I am curious, I can watch it here. 
'Why because Japan?', I have my asked, as I said that I, for one year in Tokyo to go to school. 
I have always said: 
"Because it is now." 
Finally I read for years on Mangas. 
And the comics and the culture is better understand, I have at some point, a bit in Japanese to learn. 
For me it was obvious that I eventually here had. 
Because I also have a penchant for tradition and customs. 
And the judging this great value. 
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is tough, disciplined and traditional. 
And because everything is so well lost I felt not here, even if it is Tokyo's biggest city I have ever seen. " 
Also rats have feelings 
A rat or a Schabe is fleeing in danger, that means that they fear felt? 
The Neurowissenschaftler Joseph LeDoux is convinced: much animals have feelings. 
Only as we could see whether they feel the same way, if they do as we do? 
In the Internetzeitschrift "Edge" has been going on for several years contributions certain famous scientists published. 
Mirror ONLINE presented in a series of specific answers to the question "What do you think true, without having to prove it?" 
I believe that animals feelings and other Bewusstseinszustände have without that I or anyone else, that is where we are not even able to prove that other people. 
But in this case must we hope, at least since all human brains same Grundkonfiguration landmark. 
When we checked other species and the questions of sensitivity or general awareness of touch, we impassable terrain, because the hardware disagree. 
If a rat is at risk, it is the same as many other animals: she is dead, retreats or addresses. 
People behave similarly, which some scientists on a comparable subjective experience. 
This, however, I do not believe. 
Two aspects of the Gehirnstruktur make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to the animals. 
One close the almost always with human consciousness associated some lateral prefrontal cortex (because of his participation in the speech, and the Ausführungs- / management functions). 
This broad region is developed in humans is much higher than in the other primates and seems to be in other creatures. 
At least those aspects of our consciousness, which depend on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge who we are, and to the ability to decide, there is reason to believe that differs, Man from the other primates. 
Another dramatic character is in the nature of the human: that is such a large part of its Erlebens with language, it is often said, that was it. 
In this case could exclude animals. 
But even if conscience of language would be, this would certainly affect, animal awareness, as well as it may be, probably very of most of our Bewusstseins-zustände unterschiede. 
It is hard to identify, as awareness among other animals may be. 
If, as something that meeting and odour, neither measure yet, because of the specific hardware, from our own experience analyse, presents his research into major problems. 
Most of my comments relate to the content of the deliberate Erlebens, but there is also another aspect of awareness, which will be scientifically more easily accessible. 
We could study the Bewusstseinsprozesse of animals without regard to their content, and that is exactly what is happening in studies on the like of primates, especially in the visualize,. 
But this approach, the Christof Koch and Francis Crick incidents, more likely to be on the neural Korrelate of consciousness than for the casual mechanisms: both may be identical or not. 
Interestingly, stressed this approach the importance of the prefrontal cortex to the visualize,. 
What is for the sentiments? 
I put them back that activated an emotional system such as the fear in his own activity deliberate brain activated. 
What we call a "fear", is the mental condition in which we find ourselves if the activity of the brain lokalisierten defence system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) Arbeitsspeicher self-justifying. 
So are tied sentiments closely with the regions of the cortex, the primates, and especially the people. 
Combined with the linguistic nature are subtle gradations of it, because we cannot distinguish and categorize the words and grammar, at only among ourselves. 
This means, for example, Antonio Damasio, that feelings from pre activities in the Körpergefühlsregionen of the cortex and the Hirnstammes emerge similar Jaak Pankseep, but more to the Hirnstamm concentrated. 
As this network over the course of human evolution not very changed, there could well gattungsübergreifenden sentiments. 
Theory I cannot disagree, but I think it unbeweisbar. 
Pankseep argues, which in rats and humans as fear, is also probably in two cases: how but you can check whether over-the-top rats and people the same, if they behave in the same way? 
A Schabe is fleeing in danger if they fear felt? 
In my eyes can prove very Verhaltensähnlichkeit still no experience of equality. 
Although helps the neural comparison: rats and people have similar Hirnstämme, not Schaben against it a brain. 
But is the Hirnstamm for feelings? 
And even if the people fear: How wanted it in rats show? 
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even Schaben (who knows?), have feelings. 
But I would not know, as I meant. 
And because their feelings presumably significantly differ from our (since human consciousness on specific Schaltkreisen and language is based), erforsche I prefer the emotional behaviour as the emotional feelings of rats. 
At least offer progress here on the neural level, unless you measure in rats and people the same. 
As I erforsche language and awareness in rats, not including feelings, I do not know whether they exist. 
This may mean, but I prefer, than to constantly against a wall. 
I am just a practical Emotionalist. 
Cleaning up Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine 
He said Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik, that would be the preparations soon under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister. 
"The government sees the decision of the Uefa in Bordeaux as proof in Ukraine and its ability, the championships with Poland to organize," said Wasjunik. 
"But this is not an amnesty for our country. 
The work has only just begun and there are still much to do in both countries. " 
In the timetable for the construction or renovation of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports are the two hosts. 
Will probably reduces the number of EM-Stadien from eight to six. 
"We cannot waste any more time. 
We must now work with speed, "said the Ukrainian Verbands-Präsident Grigorij Surkis. 
"UEFA will keep us constantly."

Obscure in town, often forget and perhaps soon to sell 
New York City has thousands of Hauptverkehr roads, avenues are side streets and other bypass roads, which some famous and other self-indulgent. 
Nevertheless, it is even for experienced taxi drivers and long-time local difficult to tell where extra ’ Place is, simply because most people have never heard of it. 
This tiny street is in the East Village and is from the First Street north between Bowery and Second Avenue, without the Second Street. 
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alleyway as a actively used Durchfahrtstraße from. 
There is also no road signs. 
It is practically impossible to find on a Standard-Straßenplan. 
It has nevertheless her admirer. 
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company, which has recently luxury buildings on the First Street. 
It wants extra ’ Place newly ignored, a clean passage to the shops and Boutiquen, in the new buildings are expected to create. 
On the other Verehrern heard the long-standing neighborhood, who says she was fascinated by the short alleyway, simply because it is one of the vestiges of the past of Häuserblocks is. 
But the city government department for protection and the residential buildings and is for the street, has no interest to preserve it. 
During a meeting of the Committee for land use of the parish council this month drew representatives of the City Council and Avalon Bay a proposal for the purchase of the street by the construction company. 
But prefers the committee that the road in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan, which will be presented next month, Susan Stetzer, the Bezirksverantwortliche on the town council. 
"Very little space is owned by the city, and we want that extra Place continue the city," she said. 
"It could offer, as repairs, the road and what could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure that the public access guaranteed." 
Avalon Bay has announced a few months ago, the small street newly can and set up seats, which are intended for a café, would like to rent out the company. 
The idea that you could buy Avalon Bay, was the first time during the meeting this month. 
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman from Avalon Bay, said that he wanted to use the road, although it may not have it. 
"The main purpose of the Avalon Bay it is these dilapidated alleyway to renovate and to a public meeting point," she said, adding that the city itself the sale. 
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Department for Gebäudeschutz, it was actually the desire of the city, the street to sell, and stressed the need for the department is to develop the property rather than to administer. 
Compared with its diverse neighborhood The Bowery, has maintained an extra ’ Place his historic impression. 
Some believe that the road their name in years 1802 has received a great Farm, Philip Minthorne, divided between his numerous children and was in a close strip of land by any manager. 
The back door of the Musikklubs CBGB, the Punkrockdenkmals, which was closed in 2006, scoured the extra ’ Place and street is most known as backdrop for the photo on the Cover of the Albums "'to Russia" of Ramones. 
The plaster was great, said Danny Fields, the managers of the Ramones, which has made the photograph in November 1976. 
The street was full of scrap metal, shackles and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and rope. 
Some residents, einschliesslich the bloggers who write about the Gentrifizierung of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra ’ Place, rejected the argument that this public land, slender as it is, is to remain publicly. 
Others have extra ’ Place as a rarity - a virtually unchanged splinters from the city that should be left in peace. 
Jeremiah Moss, the blog called "his verschwindendes New York" policy (untertitelt with "The Book of complaints: a bitter nostalgic look at the dying city"), has published a part of the discussion of the Stadtgeschichte on extra ’ Place, published in the journal "The New York" in 1952 was published. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra ’ Place is a small narrow alley, even daytime darkness remains and by verrostete Metalltüre the warehouses, closed windows and Regenrinnen misses flying wochenalte newspapers is". 
With few exceptions, has been the streets as recently on an evening. 
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door, previously part of the CBGB led, where today a more expensive clothes. 
Graffiti were seen on the walls to see and an empty beer bottle was on the ground not far from a fresh set of countries newspapers. 
Some said passers-by, they would have considered rare on extra ’ Place, but suggested that it could be up to the road. 
Fields, added that in his view, some folks the lure of the road in its current state. 
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places in the dark, wet and disgusting.

More than a third of the students, many of which have only recently in the country are, learn English. 
But in 2008 a staggering 100 per cent of pupils in the fourth category of the Staatsprüfung in math on a good footing. 
Also surprising were 93 per cent of children from the fourth school year in the Englischprüfung evaluated as such. 
This astonishing success was achieved with other methods, than those who are favoured by Obama. 
The school Sixth Street a specific focus on verification and exercise, to steady control of knowledge and an attitude which tolerates no exceptions. 
The case, the school's approach, which the training in an English-language surroundings. This is precisely the point to note the Obama, the Schulleiterin Linda Mikels. 
This approach sets great store by almost ausschliesslichen use of English in Fachunterricht. 
Mrs Mikels, which the idea of bilingual education, said to me, the school had a remarkable success with a pupil who was only about from Mexico. 12 months later would deny the schoolroom enter and not be able to identify. 
"It works," said, "it works for us". 
Would Obama a school such as the "Sixth Street" In "as a model for other schools with great proportion of Latin American and other English learning pupils? 
The school would make the answer to this question, but the educational positions within his own party (the national Bildunsgvereinigungen support has long been the idea of bilingual education), and his own unstinting support for the bilingual education make predictions about Obama's response. 
The point, that immigrants English should learn, he has recently the subject trivialized, he said, that people should stop worrying about the "only English" any legislation. 
Instead, he said: "They are designed to ensure that your child Spanish". 
If Obama's achievement gap actually wants to close, he carefully educational models take into account which work, rather than to them and to trivialize. 
The price of oil falls due to renewed fears about the economy 
The price of oil is on Monday because of fears that might not even the US rescue plan for the financial markets to revive the economy to regain strength. 
The Rohöltermingeschäfte on the New York Handelsbörse have fallen in the Vormittagssession by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel. 
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20. 
In the last two weeks are the Gütermärkte both by the financial turbulence on Wall Street and by strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico have been shaken. 
After the prices in July peak of $145.29 per barrel, they are in this month to almost $90 per barrel, then again, as a result of the huge uncertainty in the financial markets to rise. 
On Monday, showed investors already concerned, although Kongressvertreter had announced that they had agreed at the weekend on a rescue plan, which would be the largest in history. 
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis is still far from finished. 
In the meantime last chapter of the growing crisis, should, according to a Regierungsmitteilung on Monday, bought the Citigroup, the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation. 
Meanwhile have Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments the European Finanzkonzern Fortis partially nationalised. 
After analysts at Barclays Capital, is it despite the tense negotiations, which took place at the weekend and have led to a rescue plan, did not seem to make the mood in the markets. 
As the economic situation deteriorates further, is to be expected that the demand for goods, including oil, will continue to fall. 
Analysts at the Deutsche Bank wrote in a note to investors, the forecast for the global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become overcome uncertain. 
We believe they write that the Gütermärkte also will be affected. 
"From the perspective of Gütermärkte we are most concerned about whether the US American virus spreading throughout the world, especially in China." 
Analysts have adjusted their expectations for oil consumption because of weak economic growth for the coming year downwards, and their forecasts for the oil and gas prices for 2009 by 20%. 
Mannschaftsrekord by series in the second quarter aufgestellr 
Innenverteidiger Shaun Ellis thought that he had seen everything, he in the last eight years, more often than any other in Jets-Trikot auflief. 
Then he saw on Sunday for the second quarter, in which the jets a ergebnisloses game in a Triumphzug enclosed. 
"Something I have never seen," said Ellis. 
After a schlampigem game between the jets and the Arizona Cardinals, this was bad weather, began the second quarter. 
But when Quarterback chess pieces Favres passport in Lavernues Coles for a 12-Yard-Touchdown arrived, which marked the ideal prelude to an afternoon in which their burgeoning cooperation taking a giant step forward. 
Favre was held Coles in this quarter for two Touchdowns, one as a Aussenverteidiger ausrutschte and the other just 10 seconds before the end of the half. 
"I was not particularly hard," says Coles on the passports to Coles. 
"He is a Superspieler. 
Our vote has voted, no matter what the people think. " 
While playing Favre and Coles scooping out, the defence Quarterback Kurt Warner. 
Außenverteidiger Darrelle Revis first was as a wrecked junk and turned it into a 32-Yard-Touchdown. 
Libero Erik Smith came to a different passport and started it. 
Linebacker David Bowen's was for a loss of Warner. 
The last Ballverlust, imposed in Bowen's, was probably the verrückteste. 
The Cardinal had the ball with 10 seconds left in the game won when the jets the ball this and turned Jay Feely a 20 Yard shot for 34 to 0 leadership. 
These were the most points the jets ever in a quarter had. 
When he was asked the madness to describe, said Erik Mangini, coach of the jets' second quarter or the third quarter? " 
On the Antworte both, because the jets left in the third quarter of 21 points without a single to reach, said Mangini: "Glaub me, I have the second quarter more enjoyed from the third. 
A lot of points were made in a short space of time. " 
Ausgeruhter Gebrselassie proposes his world record 
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has demonstrated again, why do some of the best Langstreckenläufer of all times, after he broke down in the Berlin marathon on Sunday his own record and has become the first people, who has made the journey from 42,2 kilometres in less than 2 hours, 4 minutes. 
With the victory on the flat course in 2: 03: 59 has Gebrselassie his previous result of 2: 04: improved 26 by 27 seconds, he had achieved last year in Berlin. 
Gebrselassie, 35, has set his 26 world record in his multifaceted career, in which he achieved on every route from a kilometre until the marathon at least one finals title or a world record. 
Last month Gebrselassie the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing that in hindsight perhaps being was, that the air pollution his asthma problems could get worse. 
Instead, he was for the race in Berlin. 
In nearly perfect conditions, with sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees on goal - has won Gebrselassie with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile. 
Since then have changed Bahnläufer as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya over long distances, is the record time for marathon in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes, for Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil in 1998 in Berlin with the result of 2: 06: 05 has won. 
After his victory on Sunday Gebrselassie told the press, he would have had two weeks ago Krämpfe in his Wade had and did a week not socialize. 
It is obvious he break bring and not eingerostet not. 
"I am so happy," he said to reporters. 
"Everything is perfect. 
I have been training a week ago, and today some concerns, but at the end of what all super. " 
He was criticised for - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - that he Rennläufe excessively obsesses, many world Marathonstars in general, rely too much on the Rennanführer, as if that were a Bahnrennen, and world records on the race. 
But this hurts the size Gebrselassies than Langstreckenläufer hardly. 
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday had Gebrselassie the centre of the line in 1: 02: 04. 
Two Eliteläufer from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi have Gebrselassie continue defying, after the Tempomacher waivered. 
A little more than three miles from the Finish has made Gebrselassie his last start, from Kwambai to separate, the second in 2: 05: 36 is and therefore his Bestzeit almost 5 minutes has improved. 
Kamathi came in third in 2: 07: 48. 
Among women has Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now Germans, completed a remarkable year, doing so with 2: 19: showed 19 the siebtschnellste result of all time. 
The world record of 2: 15: 25 is Paul Radcliff from Great Britain. 
Last spring was 36 years old Mikitenko surprising the London marathon in 2: 24: won 14. 
She has the Games in Beijing missed, for problems that were as Rückenverletzung described. It has, however, recovered, resumed in Berlin to win and their Bestzeit in her third marathon five minutes to improve. 
It has its course, by using a quartet from Ethiopian and Kenyan Läuferinnen only ausreissen, outdated but after 30 kilometres. 
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2: 21: 31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya as third in 2: 25: 01 arrived. 
The pride and the strain in the life of the black population, a city of special kind 
Tucked away between the excesses of recreational parks around Orlando, a few miles from the flashy, noisy and huge type, is a quiet city in which the pride and the complications of Afro-amerikanischen culture. 
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the city Zora Neale Hurstons, is not as simple as Hurston it in 1935 did, "the city with 5 lakes, three Krocketplätzen, 300 brown hide, 300 good swimmers, more than enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prison." 
Nowadays it is a Pilgerstätte. 
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee are to the annual Zora! Did intend festival in Eatonville come of the most famous author the Harlem Renaissance. 
And yet is and remains the city, the describes - and it made to a Touristenausflugsziel, calling them in the Florida tour guide, which was produced for periods of depression by Bundesschriftstellerprojekts produced - in many ways the very particular kind. 
Eatonville is so independent, overall and privately how in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused their true thoughts with the weissen Mann to share, "so little about the rest of us know that he does not know what he escapes." 
Even today, in a year in which a black Präsidentschaftskanditat, Senator Barack Obama, called on open conversation about Rassenverhältnisse, there are so many here, watched by Aussenseitern to be. 
"We are very anxious as our history being told," Hortense Jones, 59, from birth, a resident of the city and Gemeindemitglied the oldest church in the city. 
It must be true. " 
Eatonville was defined for a long regarded as paradox of triumph and the fight. 
It is a historic example of the black movement as well as a community of nearly allowed inhabitants, in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average. 
It is a stronghold of literature and an example of change - sometimes sentenced, sometimes touted - black culture of the rural South, which has its roots in the American slavery. 
It is not surprising that people here both proud and wary. 
And so began the concerns about Eatonville '’ s image with Zora, as all Hurston mention. 
It was the world their hometown in books, in the of my heart and written in written, as "Mules Advice and Men" (1953) and "old eyes were watching God" (1973) 
Five paragraphs in the Floridareiseführer modified the city, the very close to the route 77, leads a road through the oft-vergessene centre of Florida, to the scene of black history and human drama. 
Insolent as Oskar both in real life and in the literature, Hurston reader to the shop by Eatonvilles inaugural mayor, Joe Clarke, and was then privateren Affairs. 
"Margins of the road on the left," she wrote, "the brown -weiss angestrichene modern school, with its leafy gardens and Spielplätzen for always Howard Miller, even though he cannot read and write." 
They also mentioned the new man of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sold drinks all sold and was-auch-immer to Stundenzimmern fits." 
In only a few hundred words brought Hurston therefore Eatonville with self-government in, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex. 
This was certainly no tour guide. 
In fact, this was not a Portrait, that all of you. 
"Zora described the things as they were," the 90-year old made Dinkins, one of the Johnson-Mädchen the Hurston offers, by the men,, quoted the songs on their beauty sang, the full sexual innuendo. 
They added: "The people disliked." 
We remember here still Hurtson than a lively Exzentrikerin, which returned regelmässig, after her family after Jacksonville, Florida was drawn. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that if Hurston in the city gebraust came, they usually without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, rauchend and with trousers, in a city which today in its venerable clothing style straightforwardly. 
Mr Franklin were the most populous fascinated, whereas many of you despise. 
"Were always glad Zora to see," said Mr Franklin. 
But "it was never too long," he said he added during in his chair schaukelte, on a back home terrace, on the Sabelia sea, in which the Hurston all likelihood baptized was. 
As Hurston in 1960 died was avidly poor and their books. 
Together with the bulk of the world seemed to forget Eatonville they have. 
Although they once a famous author, was a Zeitgenössin Langstin Hughes and the only black woman sitting at Barnard College in the 1920ern, it was in Fort Pierce, Florida, where they lived, buried in an unmarked grave. 
In Eatonville there were no ceremony, no public readings. 
"I do not think that they their contribution in the world or its heritage in the least understood," Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography on Hurston the was published in 2003. 
The turning point came in the 1980s. 
Orange County authorities wanted a fünfspurige motorway through the city, the Kennedy Boulevard to replace, the slow two-lane main street of the community. 
Orlandos suburbs already had the motorway 4 through the western edge of town. 
The proposal was presented as Eatonville itself still of a difficult phase in its history, rebounded. 
Forced integration, among other things, gave the relatively idyllic isolation of the community. 
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing hatred in the community. 
"At this time was often a bunch of white boys and they threw oranges and toys on the sidelines in front of people," said Mr Franklin. 
"There was even a woman who was killed. 
They threw a Wassermelone from the car. " 
In 1955 hinterfragte Hurston in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel the demand of the Supreme Court, integration, giving them their decision in the case of Brown against the Schulrat as "insulting instead my race respektierend." 
Residents say today that although the lifting of racial segregation in some respects, was positive, it's the Gruppenzusammenhalt in Eatonville and self-assurance of its young people influence. 
"Black children were used to it, hugged to be - I remember - we embrace his teachers in the morning and you embrace your teacher at night," N. So-and-so Nathiri, daughter of made Dinkins and Managing Director of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville Community. 
This could be as long, she added, by teachers and pupils no longer from the same place. 
"We embrace his white teachers, because he was a white teachers - I think there is a cultural gap exists," said Mrs Nathiri. 
But the civil rights that was created room for further Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who transcended itself on prejudices transcended, as they did, with positive self-esteem and statements such as: "How can refuse any joy my society deny! 
I do not understand it. " 
In 1975, the novelist Alice Walker on the path to Hurstons nameless tomb and began to fight for the revival of their glory. 
Five years later was a much praised Hurston-Biographie of Robert E. Hemenway in the Bücherregalen to find, and made it back to part of the American Literaturkanons. 
The Fernstraßenprojekt just at a time, was published in the Eatonvilles most famous single daughter once again in the public eye. 
And this time saw Hurstons old neighbours as Retterin. 
The town began in 1988 with the construction of a Hurston festivals to show what the district with the construction of the highway could destroy. 
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January put many for the celebration. 
A few years later wrote the district of his Straßenbauplänen. 
"The plans a fünfspurigen highway crowded the city, accelerated the whole thing with top speed, gave real Bürgerstolz," said Mrs Nathiri. 
Mrs Boyd Wenzhong put it somewhat easier, "Zora saved Eatonville." 
The victory against the Fernstraßenprojekt has contributed to change the image of the city. 
There were more and more Zugereiste, just as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who is since 1993 in the Church, and residents began to appreciate the past. 
Eatonville in 1998 in the nationwide historic register. 
A new einstöckige library (named, of course, after Hurston) opened in 2006 at the neugepflasterten and verschönerten Kennedy Boulevard. 
Today is Eatonville remains for a feature in Florida: just 6 miles from the city centre Orlandos can sometimes anfühlen as a Hintergasse in summer rain, as small as the time when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880ern. 
(It is now up to 90% black.) 
Outsiders in search of the history Eatonvilles and its importance are often still treated with caution. 
For most of the interviews is an approval in advance and certain things - just as the Wandbemalung of Eatonvilles eldest Church, by a Weissen painted and black men in the field of work - must not be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, as Mrs Jones, a bold, assertive teacher with a penchant for Dunkelrot, still fear that their secretive community misunderstood. 
And yet, at the same time the Hurston-Festival larger, was also a greater degree of Heimatstolz born. 
Young people in particular tend Eatonville to see how Hurston their whole race saw: so beautiful, with all its problems, either worse or better and proud, creative, and hardworking, silly and mixed as any other racial and Völkergruppe in America. 
It is the sincere love for this town in the voice of Mr Franklin nephew can hear, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who intends to after Eatonville to returning in the town council or to the police to work, which according to him a little aid could use. 
And even the relatively young, as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from winter Park, have learned that Eatonville correctly. 
"Most people on the road, only here, will think, 'Well, this city is nothing compared to the other," said Alondra Kenon other day on Sunday after the church. 
"But if you stop and look at for a moment of its history, it is a very nice city." 
Here in New York one speaks fluent Finanzlatein. 
At first glance nothing has changed. 
If tourists in Manhattan by the newspaper stands and the huge television screens in Times Square absented, they would not feel that they are in the middle of a debacle. 
They would never above their heads, in the schuhschachtelartigen offices with the Glasfassaden, bankers and Hedgefondverwalter, which have the monopoly in New York, daily the worst Horrorarbeitstag since the stock of 1929. 
The suppliers may still be Klappern the metal Teewägen along sidewalks and carrying trays with Muffins for the Frühstücksitzungen laden. 
Latin Americans schlurfen still between apartment around, as human Packtiere loaded with the 50 gebügelten T-shirts, attached to a on their shoulders the Joch-ähnlichen piles. 
Office workers still waiting at the pacing at its Essenständen on their Frühstücksbagel and it is still impossible on a day between 16 and 19 p.m. a yellow taxi. 
It was not as a crisis, and until I Thursday afternoon because of the Weltuntergangsgeredes decided to open a new savings account. 
Although I had decided to put my Pflichtgang time-wise on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase Stammfiliale, were around 20 people queuing. 
Not the Geldschaltern about money out or pay, but to the Kundenservice-Schalter where order habitués checkbooks, tourists path to shopping arcade Macy 's ask and where new customer accounts. 
Most before me, so I learned later from Starr, my "personal bankers with licence", the same argument as I queue. 
In contrast to me, however, it has already had their savings of smaller banks removed, in places from where they pendelten, just as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Iceland. 
They had money from so-called Thrifts (a little a Bausparkasse ähnelnd), cooperative banks and the local savings banks, which have only in one state offices cycled and say that they treat their clients like family. 
Last year went 15 of those banks quietly Pleite. 
In the last few days was Washington Mutual, a bank with assets of $327 billion, went into receivership on and as of last Friday in New York over the weekend, was Wachovia, another bank, the savers, $440 billion, in search of a clutching buyers. 
In the fear of further collapse, the star and Ladenangestellten who preceded me were viewed her Bares to a bank as a safe haven, a bank, for the most Rettungsaufkäufe on Wall Street is responsible. 
Ordinary New Yorkers have in recent weeks running Finanzlatein taken illegitimately. 
A woman who telephoned in my Chinese Stammsupermarkt telephoned, with so much familiarity on Lehman Brothers, the bust up bank and their abgemagert slabs CEO Dick Fuld, as it would on a bad colleagues joke. 
And Lyn, around the 50-year uniformed Concierge my residential blocks is from our usual entertainment issues on Brad and Angelina Jolie and my Lebensmittellieferung have digressed. 
"I have now all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit with the bank. 
"I have changed, I am no streams more." 
Muslemische graves desecrated during Rechtsrutsch in Austria 
Heinz-christian Strache, a Linksgerichteter of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, on Thursday, 17 January 2008 in a demonstration in Antwerp, the organisation "cities against Islam".

At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam. 
Both parties want to ban the building of mosques and minarets with the argument that they are political symbols of a constant Islamization of Austria and Europe. 
Opinion polls and analyses, which were carried out immediately after the election and the conclusion that the far right of the politically powerful bloc in the country are, suggests that this new development on young voters, who are worried about their future in the European Union.

'I am the behind the scenes to keep his character', Günter Brauer, photographer. 
No paragraphs, no Rüsche, no Kostüme for the performance. 
The nature of the big Flamencotänzer, to the concentration and focus the interpretation of a entspanntes appearance as a woman or a man. 
One artists 
Other personality 
I am in life, these moments, for the audience are alien, I know when I for the personality typical gesture, the depth of a stolen to look or Ausdrückstärke of hands, which are worried, because they are not the entrance, can find. 
In his project 'Flamenco-people' is the German photographer Günter Bauer abwechselungsreiche have cleverly some gatherings on the stage with singer, dancer and Gitarristen. From this side, he was for the artists still little known. 
With this proposal creates the photographer a special Ikonografie the Flamencodarstellung at different levels. 
The exhibition, part of the programme of the month the photograph of flamenco, 'reflects the international importance of flamenco, which will be the day to day, against', the artists and makes it clear that 'Flamenco-people' 'any human being can be, but if you look at the photographs, as does the observer, that there is no typical pictures of artists on the stage. 
Ordinary people at the portraits are artists, who are in a position on the stage, sadness, happiness to the audience. 
In order to the personality of the artists record, there is no photographs on the stage. 
Personality and character is in their hearts. 
What interested was to create a personal atmosphere, which would allow, with the Fotokamera the characters of the largest Flamencomeister hold fast. 
Bauer, inspired by the festival 'Cante de las Minas', in 1997 on a long journey, singer, Gitaristen or dancer with a digital camera to photograph. 
Thanks to the Bildsortierungsfunktion of the camera and the existing material, pictures, reminiscent of classic photograph. 
The use of various literary funds destroyed the traditional basis of the image, so that the image of modernity and the idea, as the Bauer flamenco, be: 'music with traditional roots, which changed and every day surprised'. 
These are not only the dance, the song or Instrumentalspiel itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, with his art to the public. 
The search for the essence, after a certain thing, in the form of Hörens, of being seen, and was the firm objective of this work, which will be presented in the coming period in the gallery of the El Fotómata. 
Celebrities in flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente crony and others are among the strong selection of almost 70 artists, who were photographed. 
The project has been a Anthologie of the Flamencos and will soon as book, with all portraits from the exhibition. 
Bauer ’ s passion to the portraits led him, this idea two years ago again and 'portraits of veterans of the sport' to 'SportARTproject'). 
Although the planning of the project 'Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer to 'I like very much to photograph the people they know to learn, and to put myself in the Lebenszustand, be it for a brief moment or a long time. 
I think that, in the field of photograph the portrait, the most difficult genus. 
You triffst indict you or to people, who know you sometimes, or they can for a few minutes, in order to be able to make a photograph taken. 
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer trying to realise I always my ideas. ' 
The collection of portraits of the Flamencos of today with the title of 'Flamenco-people' is in the gallery of El Fotómata issued in the street with a name la calle de la stigma and parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. The exhibition can see you until 16 October visit. 
Vargas admits Llosa, that the Roma, he writes, just a foolhardiness' is. 
He still do not know where the action of the saga and what it is, however, Mario Vargas Llosa tried the project, in which he is currently preparing to move, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland, the twenty years in Congo lived and dragged into Amazonengebiet. 
Yesterday, while his presence at the festival Hay Festival Segovia, was the favorite to win the Nobel prize that the project, with it deals a foolhardiness' and 'everything is pointing out that he does not novel writing should'. 
'If I were reasonable, I would not have made it, but I will do it and hope to end at some point, the novel', so he concluded its participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words exchanged,. Within the four days he has hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia. 
The author of "La ciudad y good riddance perros' was one of the most exciting personalities on the third festival and forecasts.

"Sangre de mayo ': Heldenbuch of Garci 
Inspired by 'Episodios Nacionales' of Benito Pérez Galdós, is José Luis Carci in 'Sangre de mayo' the revised version of the famous uprising of Spaniards against the French, which is an admirable film in the Filmografie, with about 15 million investment for the Dreharbeiten. 
In this way has tried the Cineast tried a lot of personalities and social analysis, which he had always admired to the sites of the famous novel writer admired, said today Carci in the presentation of the cinema with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of performers. 
"Sangre de mayo 'with a Filmlänge of more than two-and-a-half hours, will be presented this Friday in cinemas and later at the station Telemadrid than a four-hour Miniserie shown. 
José Luis Garci, a big fan of the literature of Galdós, assured us that this Dreharbeit his' Kindheitstraum 'came true, he can thank Esperanza Aguirre, who gave three years ago by the autonomous community in Madrid, to a Gedenkfilm to second Jahrhundertsfeier on 2 November in Madrid, particularly because the story on the basis of' Episodios Nacionales' is based, the mission. 
The total of 15 million, which was contested by the autonomous community in Madrid for Dreharbeiten, offers Garci, as he ever has, the unique opportunity 'with polite and clothing that image of the "distraught Spain, which aussuchte the wrong leader for the fight, because the people in the fight for the independence and under the rule of the Ferdinand of VII in arrears had been present. 
But regrets the Cineast, if the funding as' Alatriste 'or' Los fantasmas de Goya (twice as high as in 'Sangre de mayo') have not been able to count, why were some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with the Garci almost his whole career working, not made. 
For this reason, has Garci, who also Filmdirektor in 'Volver Wyatt empezar' was, by his own operation involved: he went to the scene to the actors, with whom we first rehearsed must before you start to swing and for those who do not Casting felt had seemed he 'humiliating' and respect verschaffend, 'part of the profession of the Filmdirektors consists, aid in theatre and cinema, in order to know what is in the cinema industry, in which they work, is happening.' 
Many performers, he in 'Sangre de mayo' faces, must reiterate his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos ’ or Fernando Guillén Cuervo. 
Garci, Oscar-Kandidat in four nominations (of which he has won a), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates, who this year Spain before the Academy of Hollywood, represents a new generation of Spanish Filmographie represents. Neither 'Sangre de mayo', "Siete mesas de billar francés' and not the film Los girasoles ciegos'. 
For this film expected Garci no awards. 
"In the beginning I bet you that you arbeitest for the descendants arbeitest, later merkst you discover that it is only for continued health is, and you are now satisfied, while a film has produced," said Garci after more than 30 years of work.

The US can without Paul Newman badly imagine 
'sometimes creates God perfect personalities. 
Paul Newman was one of them. 
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who, with him in 'Sensationsreporterin' together, and of the prevailing idea of US cinemas, which was abandoned, of America until Newman, with his enthusiastic presentation and her. 
If are, what it cost to award him the Oscar. 
And when he withdrew in 2007. 
And he knew that he was very ill. 
But this was a major blow to all. 
"Feels what sometimes, is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend, 'said Robert Redford in tears,' my life and my country were the biggest Drolligkeiten of his life. ' 
No one was afraid to make themselves look ridiculous to exaggerate. 
'Father' of the cinema and the country is in a sad moment, died in the fear of terrorists and before the Marktzusammenbruch, in which the niedergeschlagene Selbstwert feeling of Americans on the desperate search for reasons, dignity, is. 
If in this hard time without virtue, few people can admire, remain, so you do not necessarily Luis Cernuda be, by Paul Newman. 
For all he represented a platonisches ideal of beauty and truth. 
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and has suffered as various losses both profits: from the Foundation, which has committed to the fight against drugs and paid tribute to his son from the first marriage, to overdose died, was set up to their own brand of internal and organic products. 
All this is a gift to the country in which it cost him much trouble competing against a deadly food culture. 
A great wave of surprise proposes hard-wearing on Hollywood without regard to nationality and nationality. 
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person is dead, but the whole era. 
The Englishman Sam Mendes, Filmdirektor and Oscarpreisträger, said that the work with Newman no more and no less than the peak of his career. 
Russell Crowe, the bad boy, from Australia who dared to call Newman as his greatest inspiration. 
'Do has the greatest of all of us leave, confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few today who dare to try such as Paul Newman lived: high demands on the honesty, a responsible life, far from the cameras away. 
It is not always easy or not even possible in contemporary Mediendschungel. 
But there are some have tried, and Paul Newman was an example of this. 
He was once a divorce and was married after 50 years with Joanne Woodward, he was, although it certainly many opportunities were not to be there. 
'Why should eat a hamburger on the street, if I have at home fillet?', scherzte he often itself. 
In the sky will he be proud that on Earth his daughters the same opinion as his fans, which in America do not necessarily is customary. 
'From every major roles he played, no, he was as proud to the as the loyal spouses, of the loving father, of Opas and the power of the philanthropists', they say. 
For the Olympic Games are the roads in Madrid flawed. 
Yes, the dream of many of us, some Olympic sports in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, as it can perhaps be 2016. 
But I wonder: Are we ready for this? ' 
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say, that it is not true! 
It was described as a perfect street, and in my opinion, it was the worst road with punches and off, there was. 
Of course, that is a lot of rubbish, would be the assessment of attention and I might review, so clearly were not accepted. 
But, we start by everything. 
The nonsense begins with the Ticketholen to that allows you to go, as the first. 
It seems to me to be a bad thing, but if they can do for you, then they give you everything (including chip, in order to avoid the congestion on the road). 
What does not. 
There they you only ticket get (the first nonsense, which is the only reason to go) and (after an endless queue) is the surprise, the satirical there were only in the size of 'S' (a second nonsense, because I the size XL need) 
Where we live? 
Or is it that the crisis was resolved only small, much cheaper shirts from less substance to buy? 
Well, things like this are a small in comparison to the days on the road. 
Apart from the fact that must go very early to go to the chip, which is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, moreover, must leave the schoolbag. 
The wait has more than 35 minutes, which in the case of a street, where we expect 11,000 people, is incomprehensible. 
Finally, as it was to be expected, the streets and we had our Rücksäcke not, even if it once was, but they use would be more difficult. 
Also, it was, in those 40 minutes waiting for rain, so that it came to the temptation to organise a popular uprising and throwing it to invade. 
I believe this morning will certainly some 500 people pneumonia and some as I be because this chip, which I received, not even in time of classification, I am quite sure that the wrong branded. 
Of course, if I were asked for a perfect street ask, it would never occur. 
I believe that we will still have a long way from a dream, which for the Olympic Games well prepared is 
Microsoft in search of a (virtual) Rezeptionistin 
On the 'emerging Technology Conference' kind of MIT, Microsoft the advance of new Bilderkennungssystems and the Mensch-Interaktion presented, a creature of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, but what is able to do some primitive tasks, such as a taxi to order (or in the case of Microsoft, this is a Routenplaner, on the campus of the company to get). The system does what it during the conversation. 
Thanks to a camera and a violation and Gesichterkennungssystem, can this' Rezeptionistin ', how many people are in the area, who they are and even as they were there to listen to and understand the key their entertainment. 
It may also present the talks in the groups. 
In remarks delivered video noticed the Rezeptionistin 'a third person, but she understands that this person belongs to the group, which is associated with it, is not, and that is not Firmenangestellter. 
She asks, whether the person who visit wants and replies that soon they will listen. 
All without the blue screen Hot 
Impressive 
This is the future. 
Now the company has better things on which it can concentrate, for example, at the next version of its Betriebssystems Windows. 
This week they talked very superficial on the change of strategy of Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be and do not have as many particularly programmes. 
Steve Ballmer, said that if the computers with the free resources, rather than with the commercial waste to fill it, it would be five times faster. Man, Steven, this will be just for the few. 
Everything is just a statement, given that Microsoft Windows versions one or other function and 'extras' ever. 
The shift is worth 
The Microsoft is right, the operating system loses in importance, as well as the software. 
As did Google chromium in network appeared, it was a part of the theory that it is the first step of Google, struggling to compete with Windows. 
Sent many point out that the browser no operating system is. 
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary to ensure that hardware and software at the same time. 
The operating system meets the function, with the role his wife or their husband cannot be compared, wenn es darum geht, his mother-in-law something to say. 
This is true. 
The system will never disappear, but must be made to its' death ', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth, think. 
What Ballmer said this week, is the affirmation of this idea. 
People pay every time less attention the operating system, the Web-Browser. 
The computer will only launched so that Firefox, the Explorer or hexavalent execute and every day we spend more time on surfing, as in the vicinity of 'window'. 
What serves half in computer of existing applications? 
Less is more 
And Windows 7 must more compact, more compact than Vista. 
Easier, not so exaggerated, less complicated. 
The interest of Microsoft's is more to integrate its online services, which could then become the alternative to Google. 
In reality they need it, without doubt. I am a small example. 
The photograph of this place, I have in Redmond, in one of the recovery rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month. 
At the Erfrischungsgetränkeautomat is a shield with: 'your search. Our future'. It will print a request from its own tool for Online-Suche to use. 
In 2006, was an independent study the conclusion that the 66% of employees at Microsoft, Google for research on the network. 
Incidentally, last week was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 in delay. 
It will not start, but at the end of 2009, more even 2010. 
Microsoft seeks the possibility, Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 on the same time. 
Every day transformed the telephone in a computer. 
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the delay will cost money. 
Le Fabuleux Marcel 
Pablo Picasso has angehabt it in Costa Azul angehabt, Leonardo di Caprio had hits in 'Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick to, just as Al Pacino in "the godfather 'by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it clothing a well built pastor. 
If we start a list of the many Stars-Auftritte, so we can go back to the image of a very large man, with a sharp Bart, who matters in a circus heavyweights of. 
Basically, this is a typical male satirical from cotton, ärmellos and tailliert. 
The Englischsprachigen call it 'tank' '. Lle Fabuleux Marcel de with greater than all other brands. 
Firstly, because of its great name, although they close circle 'Marcel' is. The legend is that the Namensentstehung with sport and by Boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf, stamm. 
"La Marcel 'transcends all his excellent cotton, his offer Unisex-Schnittes and is marked by a small Belgian flag (hardly see), these T-shirts as a detail on Halsausschnitt have. 
And, the Belgian company focuses not only on the production of 'tanks'. 
They also have college Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Kaschmire, trousers from cotton, T-shirts with swath, babies, Mini shorts 
Modellierte and comfortable underwear. 
Although, it is a great pity, to use it as Unterbekleidung. 
They are very attractive. 
'I want to be a young mother; the candidate I am not worried' 
Their strong performance with her sister, did not prevent them, to develop their own personality. 
Mónica Cruz is in front, but full of life. 
Currently the siblings Gruz their new work in the fashion very seriously. 
For Mónica this means much more than for some pretty rich and Mädels, who maintain their reputation. 
She was in Paris when the company Mango, moved then resident and makes the presentation of the main prizes in the fashion, the sponsor of the Spanish Modehaus sponsors. 
Mercifully and timid, winner for the short distances. 
Erzähl us, what you are doing in Paris. 
I came here the new range for this autumn / winter season, the sister Penélope and I have devised for Mango, to present, I have the presentation of the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' visited and the dinner to Valentinos honors. 
A very thorough working time, which is exciting. 
They work for the Spanish House, what is the basis of your new range for the fourth season Mango? 
My sister, I too are the films of the 1950s and 1960s years fascinated; there, we find many ideas. 
Gladly, I through a town and see women as they are held, as they have their clothes combine, which I often. 
Dancers, actress and Modedesignerin, you are a very different women, do you? 
Yes, I believe, but finally, everything out in and these areas have much in common. 
Since I was young, was I of the clothes enthusiastic; I always wanted to go to my grandmother, in the Kleidungsschränken my aunt herumzuwühlen and to see their clothes. 
This was super, almost better than going to a recreational park. 
Already later, as dancers, I tried to the clothing. 
You know, we dancers like it so much, our own style in teaching and to have with the samples, to look into the mirror and feel good. 
As an actress if you get the matches, put it in the real Darstellerrolle. 
Finally, coupled with everything else, it is much respect for the Kostümdesigner and professionalism. 
Recently, you are 30, you are in no crisis? 
Ah what. 
I feel better than ever, as 30 year I feel good. 
I think the woman is ripe, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer errors. 
I am not afraid for my biological clock. 
I have the projects, which I have since I was young, wanted to make and this has given me much to enjoy. 
So, heard you point to become mothers, or not? 
For a long time, I know that I am going to mother because my body and also I want a young mother; that I miss. 
What the candidate, because I am not worried. 
I will, my baby great Glücksgefühle mediate and it with much love. 
As for the film, behältst du in the eyes of the work, in which you have attended and were made last year. 
As it is and I would like very much that they will be presented to the public. 
I, as a woman who comes from theatre, am very impatient and restless, and to have everything at once, which cannot be immediately. 
I very much hope that 'La última hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo' list for the first time. 
Time, as you like 
A couple days, you are published on the Laufstieg with Naomi Campbell, is it? 
It is all well and good, say not so what. 
It is not that I do on the Laufstieg, to modeln. 
Naomi Campbell, which I have known for some time, I was simply called and London invited to London, in a parade for the Wohltätigkeitveranstaltung their organisation 'women for a better world' and the clothing that we show, and I know that were auctioned off two garments from our range for Mango, in order to raise the money for Naomis NGOs. 
People do not know Naomis good heart. 
There are many things about it. I, than the one they know, would you say that they do not. 
Nevertheless, I will support this good idea, it is involved. 
She asked me to take part in the parade for these warm-hearted thing, but if it does happen and refuse to make a Handstand, I will do that too. 
In order to support women in the developing world, which is also necessary. 
The drivers can be of the alcohol limit, the 'Alcolock' must install. 
The authority instructions that the driver of the three official penalties because of the alcohol limit, in his car this system installed, forbidding him in a drunken state car. If he is drink-drivers, then bounces of the car. 
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already a part of the report of the Generalstaatsanwaltschaf. They claim it is a Piloten-Projekt, which will last for one year. 
The purpose is the recovery of the driver, and so this a course for the rehabilitation of the Verkehrsverhaltens. 
The Attorney General's Office, experience, will be the Department of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for safety of cars. 
According to statistics, between 30-75% of motorists who were reported more than once for driving drunk, sat back in tax. 
The alcolock 'would prevent this, because it is a system with the car together, it attaches the alcohol content in the ausgeatmeten air and prevent Autostart, if the driver breathalyser test; or if a alcohol concentration, which is higher than that. 
It costs more than 1000 euros, the cost to be borne by those who impose the sanction. 
In this context, a study carried out in the United States in 2007, showed that prevent with these devices equipped cars in the first year after his introduction to 65% of the abuses. 
In Spain it is estimated that there could be saved annually 115 human lives. 
The measure is confined to the administrative sanctions for two reasons: this behaviour, before it a criminal offence Faust. 
And to facilitate their implementation, may be a legitimate reform in the ordinary way happen, and yet a reform of the constitution, which is for the prosecution process. 
Nor is the machine on the Spanish markets, in any business, although it has been in some commercial vehicles and vehicles of public transport was built. 
It tomorrow, is the House of Representatives for the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which suggests, this system in Schulbus vote to install, vote, and that was made in France already.

The sun went down, but their radiation have forced their hand as Sonnenschirm to use, the royal couple, from the plane ausstieg, to see. 
The gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities 
A few hours before I had a taxi driver in the street, whether he knew that visited the prince and the Fürstin of Asturias the city, to formalise the official trip. 
- Ah, very well, you can at the airport at this time than people take you is from here or 
No, it is the Spaniard, but she has lived a few years. 
-ach so, very good 
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and the Tin of Asturias are and know the importance of the trip. 
There are many, waiting in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, also military protection of 27 soldiers of the navy, the Ehrensalve. 
The prince seems smiling, held in marineblau, and they, the Tin, with long by the wind gewehten hair, without normal 'peep-toes', perhaps told her that it is expected a storm in DF. 
Before they enter the room, smiling and are prepared for the photographers, which is the official entourage. 
At the door of the hotel, in which they are housed, one of the four biggest in the city, is waiting for a Reporterin by Mexican television who like to play games. 
The best Premium of fashion

And if there are too few, are all in a book, it is, how to defuse. The book in bookshops on 30 September. 
The Wecker is a fine, jangling he by 7 a.m. rings, but worse still seems the idea back into the rhythm, which requires current life, reinzukommen. 
The office is the tension and the computers that lead to the back pain. 
The stress is the evil of the 21st century. 
But there are not one and not two methods, the maximum daily exhaustion and the problems, as does one of the world, to fight. 
The figure is rising, but, no more and no less than 1001. 
In addition Yoga-Stellungen, the classic massage or Spa-Behandlungen, is Susannah Marriott in book lists the opportunities, to the taste and the time of each are adapted. 
The work against the stress means' 1001 possibilities to 'and the rest, the book, in the bookshops from publishing company Pearson Alhambra and DK. 
Anyone who thinks that it is impossible, the calm in the fields as the workplace through personal contacts to achieve, refuted this manual such beliefs. 
There will also be offered the methods, as they are in contact with the natural world remains or proposed the 100% natural remedies that lead to the relaxation. 
If footbridge and not the adrenalin in your intravenous more to restore balance to the body and the stress has become a problem, so this is the time to sit down on televisions, switch off the brain and to focus on reading. 
In the bedroom talk 
Some children speak at night 
I do not mean those who wake up and tell us something, what happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep. 
If it happens you for the first time, in the best case will be frightened, but in reality there is no significance. 
This is a positive Schlafstörung, who is speaking in their sleep. 
It is fairly common, especially among children and young people. 
Certainly, was more than one of you that have spoken at night. 
This phenomenon can occasionally (a time in life, such as during the high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day can the child nothing. 
There is no reason this phenomenon. 
Often links with other phenomena in their sleep, such as nightmares, panic at night, Enuresis noctura (Bettnässen at night), speaking in his sleep, but there is no reason why. 
As we mentioned earlier, can it very Fiber, are Stresssituationen or failure. 
In any case, this is a little erforschtes phenomenon. 
The frequency with which it occurs, is very variable. 
It may be that one speaks calmly in individual words, grabbing or it can quite a contrary (cries, wines, long discussions). 
In the cases, if the state very hard, to keep the baby and a specialists to consult, to check whether there is a problem that has caused fear and in this way. 
We have said that it is a positive disruption is, it will not be there, whether it is linked to a different Schlafstörung, which can be treated (for example, with the Schlaf-Apnoe or with the stress). 
What you can do, is a series of simple preventative measures: 
Try the baby before bed not to. 
So, calm game for the child and avoid stressige television programmes, which are terrible and a little too wild. 
The nervous children, which are recommended Entspannungen, can be applied relaxation techniques to help them, to get some inner calm. 
This helps the child to sleep quietly. 
If the speaking in their sleep again, trying to remain calm. 
Remember that it for the child is harmless and the next day it will be nothing can recall exactly what happened. 
Useful advice 
Weck it does not. 
This is useless, because the child is unconsciously, will take her from the sleep. 
Although the baby speaks, sleep, then built it. 
Remember, though it remains a pair of phenomena anguished shows, it is recommended, to consult, or the reason the child for the fear. 
If they understand what it says (which is not usually is), is not the baby under pressure, an interrogation and discover more information wedges. 
So if you can achieve anything, because if the baby is sleeping, it is not and can not reflect. 
Also, you will hear, as it says, but you do not know what it is dreaming and why it says, so they are cautious about the interpretation of the information and the conclusions, which it. 
Perhaps, says it is not a child, that the night and know his secrets. 
Not even as a joke. 
This causes a lot of fear. 
So, you no worries, it is nothing wrong with it, this is a moment that lasts only a few minutes. 
Illhäusern... finally 
After a long drought is Illhäusern on the pitch finally forging ahead. 
Without much effort erspielten itself the Gelb-Schwarzen numerous Torchancen and abandoned it, one of them, and so to win the game. 
The speed of that meeting, in which the attacker trouble, their skills to show, was not very high. 
After a first attack of the Gastkapitäns Kauffmann, whose Fernschuss scarce on the corner of escaping, should Illhäusern with ease the game dominate, and it was alternately only Fonderflick with a Fernschuss, then brain with a Hochpass, and Romain with a shot with the Fußspitze, the defensive Denmark. 
The rival team blockte in the Feldmitte and left only the lively Riahi at the apex of the storm. 
The start of the second half should be crucial with two by Riahi and Temporale hard-fought Torchancen, and immediately afterwards, with the first goal for the Illhäuser by Marais, the was, to adopt a ball that was eliminated in the initial attempt by Diebold repelled. 
But the illhäusische Torschütze should enjoy not his luck long and be sent around 12 minutes later to the bank, which lost had to keep his team Kameraden numerically inferior continue. 
Denmark but did not play and has a illhaeusischen Elf no major problems, only a little bit, to their defence to 'only', except in the last seconds of the game, in which escaping the ball after a mess very close to the bar escaping.

Obama should its lead on Thursday with the good performance from its competitors Joseph Biden in the first and only public debate with his rival for Sarah Palin, is expected to confirm 
'It would be a mistake to underestimate them. 
It has good instincts, but this weekend, Bill Clinton. 
The Siebzigjährige McCain continued to promote its undeniable experience in foreign policy, and clearly the naivety to underline his opponent on these issues, which was the focus of this first Fernsehduells vigil. 
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that? ', he emphasised several times. 
"I do not think that Senator Obama on the necessary experience and knowledge, to become president, said he also. 
A suppressor, the since yesterday in the Republican Wahlwerbespots preached. 
Obama himself has said that he represents the future. 
He spoke briefly and precise, without the balance. 
He became his ability, to make good decisions and the image, which has the world by the United States, to renew. 
"McCain has still not understood, Obama has', this weekend a democratic Wahlwerbespot against it, in which Republicans been accused, not the full extent of the crisis to have on the 'Americans off the streets' faces.

"Have you seen that in an election held? ' 
Young people and opposition activists marched Sunday night on the Hauptplatz capital of Belarus, in advance of the results of the parliamentary elections. 
A few hundred White Russians gathered Sunday evening for the polls in the marketplace of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections. 
Although still no result was, many young people, to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator should resign. 
Some say that they do not even have chosen: 'What is the point, if they ever with my vote, what they want, "says a young people. 
They do not believe that the regime that showed foreign observers in the best light has been shown the negotiations with the European Union, is prepared to take a democratic change. 
The sanctions, including the Nichterteilen of visas for 40 leading Belarussian personalities and the Aufeislegen certain assets, could be lifted if these elections the observers as clean. 
According to the opposition, they were not there. 
"We have been excluded from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to take part in the count," lamented Yuri Potemkin, the Union of democratic forces, a heterogeneous communion of 12 parties. 
This is a cosmetic change, said Alexander Milinkevich, a former opposition candidate for the presidential election in 2006 and leader of the medal, because it is of importance, who counts the votes auszählt, and it is the executive branch.

But her joined Parliament can air time on television, meeting in the regions and the legislative proposals ". 
The opposition is so guilty, in the political game, because the dialogue with the European Union must be opened. 
Because if our economy, which is debt to Russia, in a crisis, and we are not reform, we run the risk a protectorate in Russia. 
Now, we want to be independent. 
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the voting process, not the election as valid. 
They stressed that the Wahlbeteiligungszahlen seem too high, and that the extension of the vote in advance (26% of the voters of Minsk) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation case.

The silence of the night cut back on the October Square. 
On television congratulate President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission to their success. 
Conversation - From blood that safe again was 
Hema-quebec fêted yesterday the 10th anniversary of its founding and its President, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most effective blood banks in the world. 
And, above all, it has the confidence of the public reclaimed by the scandal by contaminated blood in the 1980's and 1990's shaken. 
As we know, were contaminated by the Blutspendendienst of the Canadian Red Cross managed national Blutreserven during the 1980's with HIV and hepatitis C virus. 
Given this tragedy and public discontent led the Canadian Government in February 1994 a public, the judge Horace Krever Khare investigation, which aimed to bring light into the circumstances which led to this tragedy, and, in order to prevent another disaster of this nature. 
While reluctant judges Krever still hesitated, his report, then several provinces a committee on its feet, whose goal it was a new system for managing blood in Canada. 
In Quebec, met the committee Gélineau that referral. 
After the reports of Gélineau and Krever were founded in Canada two blood banks created: Hema-Quebec, which for Quebec is responsible, and the Canadian Blutgesellschaft, the other provinces and the two territories. 
'1998, as has Hema-Quebec their work, had hardly had 38% of people confidence in the Blutkonservensystem in Quebec, remembers Dr. Décary. 
The situation was disappointing. 
Through the enormous efforts to ensure the safety of the blood to improve and work in this area over the following years, we have the confidence of the public regained ", she says, before they are proud that early 2008 now almost 94% of the population of Quebec confidence in Hema-Quebec had. 
Dr Décary but retains, knowing that 'trust is something extremely fragile'. 
Since its founding on 28 September 1998 is Hema-Quebec following the principle of caution. 
At this time, we saw the emergence of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new kind of CJD, told this woman, who has since its inception in 1998. 
And we had no idea whether there could be transferred this disease by blood. 
So we invoked one of the Hauptrichtlinien of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, according to one Ausschlussmaßnahmen applies Ausschlussmaßnahmen, if it does not know and when a disease only slowly, as it appears in the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death. 
So, in April 1999 no blood of people who had immigrated since 1980 longer than a month in the United Kingdom. 
Now, a few years ago, has been without doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood. 
So has shown us the event that the principle of caution that we could well meaning. 
In 1999 he appeared on the market a lot more technology to detect HIV: the Nukleinsäure-Tests (NST), which directly in the blood of the donor the existence of the virus itself, and not the antibodies against the virus, as it did in the hitherto tests. 
The NST allowed it to shorten the incubation period, between the time the has been infected person and, if it can be found to be the first viruses through our techniques in the blood, the specialist. 
This time could be reduced to a period of less than a week. 
So was the risk that it could be infected some donors, without knowing it, could not see and this, considerably reduced. 
These improvements enabled, the risk of AIDS through a blood transfusion, to reduce. 
Today is one of 12 million people in danger, with HIV infected blood. 
"In other words, that means that 12 million blood distribute, before would be infected with HIV. 
Since distributed Hema-Quebec every year between 400,000 and 500,000 blood, it would take more than 24 years, before a case, was the HIV on a Blutkonserve transferred. 
I believe that we now feel can, if a blood transfusion gets or the health to restore ', the head of Hema-Quebec. 
"Our challenge for the next ten years, it is the safety of our products. 
One never knows what pathogens into the system. 
Only last year is in Reunion, the Chikungunya-Virus appeared, which, as the Westnil-Virus, is spread by insects on the blood. 
We must constantly monitor ', Dr Décary continuing before they emphasised that must Hema-Quebec alongside a safe supply a sufficient supply available. 
'The growing demand, because the population is getting older. 
There are the treatments for cancer aggressively, need patients often new red blood cells or platelets. 
The aging of the population is also affecting the Blutspendernetz from, where on average only 3% of the donations appropriate inhabitants of Quebec. ' 
Can any healthy people, the 18 years or older is and meets the eligibility criteria, all 56 days, six times a year, give blood. 
On average 14% of the people, their blood available to, not because they are sick of AIDS or malaria, visited and who, in a country that is prevalent in the malaria, will be excluded for one year by blood donations. 
"With these 3% to keep an inventory that meets the needs of the hospitals. 
Lack of stockpiles are very rare. 
But we must change the members of this Spendernetzes renew as they grow older and can give blood. 
It is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all, to keep them and to encourage them to be regular donors. 
Life is now so hectic that rarely take the time to spend an hour in donations', regrets Mrs Francine Décary. 
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars is not Hema-Quebec only blood, but also human tissues, including Knochentransplantate, heart valves, Augäpfel and skin, which is used almost exclusively for serious fire violations. 
These tissues are being analysed, processed and frozen before they Hema-Quebec be stored, which administers the only public Nabelschnurblutbank of Quebec. 
In the umbilical cord, which had been regarded as biomedical waste, stem cell rich blood, which can help, serious diseases such as leukaemia, to deal with. 
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the stockpiling our thousandth Nabelschnurblutprobe, and we plan every year more than buy a thousand lessen. 
'We should probably early next year begin, for transplants to provide ", explained Dr Décary further, this programme of Nabelschnurblut- abnahme describes as very popular. 
"Many mothers are convinced no such access to have ', because Hema-Quebec lacks the means, this complex and expensive programme in all hospitals of Quebec.

Charest is relying on the north 
The Prime Minister does not rule out before the end of the year elections. 
Once was the General Assembly of the Liberal Party to an end, Jean Charest yesterday after Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new health minister Yves Bolduc (left) tried, elected in today's Teilwahl to be. 
'The part of our last great northern borders postpone': this is the long-term goal, Jean Charest yesterday with visual equipment at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levi presented, the guidelines are followed. 
During his speech was projected behind him a kind Bildermühle larger-than-life. 
Three huge screens dominated spectacular images of water Kraftwerken, mines, Quebec 'Google Maps' view, maps, etc. 
As great as in the legislature. 
The press refused the Prime Minister, incidentally, that he will hold the elections this autumn, although he claimed that his diary very crowded. 
The plan North 'is the fourth element of' vision ', which the Prime Minister to Quebec, namely a' new economic area, "an agreement with France on labor, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario envisages. 
Although it was in the recent past, often in the speeches of the Prime Minister, was the opening of the north - the northern area on the 49sten latitude - never issue a presentation. 
The Prime Minister was limited but to explain why the north 'a jewel with enormous potential' was, but no date, no investment amounts or specific priorities for the next projects. 
Only a few prospects for what could be done more, especially in the water, energy, forests, but particularly industry sector, encouraged by the growth of emerging countries and the renewal of the public infrastructure. 
The listing Mr Charests according to the north 'nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds. 
This' area twice as big as France '' is close to us, is in Quebec. 
It is not only close to us, it is in us', he emphasised, how to show clearly that he is a national Gründertraum. 
Quebec is very through his association with the north, he emphasised: the streets for gold in Abitibi, the technology of Quebec, the James-Bucht. 
'It belongs to us, it is our future, "he added, after he had a dramatic pause to see the huge card behind itself. 
The north, 70% of the area of Quebec, ends a part of Labrador, the Quebec has always tripped, said the Prime Minister of the press. 
'This is a traditional attitude, all governments. 
There is a distinction on which it is for a very long time, if the opportunity presents itself, I shall this attitude on behalf of the government will resume, "he said. 
Also, with the climate change we need to rethink our vision of a new ", he said, speaking about the Nordwest-Passage, which will be given the Eisschmelze the whole year navigable. 
This new geopolitical context does the Prime Minister, that it is a duty to occupy the area. 
And the people of the area, the indigenous people and the Inuit? 
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec very gingerly handle them would deal, and that they would benefit from the project, particularly the boys. 
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former pekistischer Member of Ungava) have already started deliberations in approximately 30 communities. 
A Dejemeppe Pelletier is raised, Ministers, in which Julie Boulet (transportation and natural resources) high, the work. 
The Prime Minister does not a grand assembly, "is not a summit ', but an opportunity in the' we share a common vision will create '. 
The development of the north will be in line with the principles of sustainable development. 
The plan North ', and we respect', he promised. 
Jean Charest described these 'vision', as if it were a continuation of the liberal Prime Minister, who before him were in office. 
'How, the Liberals of us were in office, we turn that around, about the challenges in new growth and Entwicklungschanchen to transform. 
This was one of the issues raised by the weekend, which on Friday with a large Cocktailparty to mark the 50th anniversary of the start of the party leadership by Jean Lesage is opened. 
One of the decisions adopted, to the station Beauharnois in Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm. 
'From Godbout, who has created Hydro-Quebec, on Lesage, who has achieved the quiet revolution and the nationalization of Wasserelektrizität, to Bourassa, which made the James-Bucht, knew our party, to determine the future', said Jean Charest. 
The press to he to another, conservative project, and in the programme 'Roads Award to the North' by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister of 1957 until 1963. 
In relation to the project Wasserkraftstaudamm Eastmain1a-Ruper, said Mr Charest, which is approaching its commissioning for 2012. 
'The remains among us, but I plan to be there, he said his party members what inspires those ovations. 
The Prime Minister, who said in April that it 2008 and 2009, would be no elections, has, in fact, this autumn election, what is the law is possible, not impossible. 
He notes that is his diary full, mainly because of a mission of Gemeinschaftsrats in China and a summit between Quebec and New York. 
The General Assembly on weekend earned the liberal party boss a platform from nationalist plans, mainly from the constitution these objectives ", which were adopted without discussion: the PLQ calls for the recognition of the 'special Quebec' in the Constitution. 
They also hope that appoints Quebec Council members of the Canadian broadcasting and telephony, and that they have a veto on the in Quebec are decisions. 
From the opposition were the guidelines of the plan North with skepticism. 
The leader of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has raised the policy Nord-du-Quebec resurface, which has introduced the government Landry 2001. 
According to her, the liberal government, as they did in 2003 came to power, not to use them. 
If they had done, 'we would today be much further, "said Mrs Marois alongside their candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Françoise Mercure. 
The ADQ has committed to support a plan North by the government. 
"But what we want is that this will not only a great idea," said the leader Sébastien Proulx in representation for Mario Dumont, who returned from holiday. 
The letter - a entehrtes country 
Mr Vic Toews, Ex- 'justice' -Minister (how ironic) cabinet in Harper it was, the last summer say about Louise Arbour to say that it was a "disgrace" for Canada. 
This woman, not a end has led to endless fight for justice and worthy of our admiration deserves, with to cover, says as much about the people to the prime minister around, as Stephen Parker. 
We are dealing with a government that has brought not only from all the countries affected their concentration camps in Guantanamo captive fellow countryman home. 
A government, who did not take into account that Omar Khadr still a young man, as the things crossed him. 
The only government which, despite the fact that Canada the Geneva Convention has signed their word and overlooking a child soldier in inhumane conditions lets. 
The only people who deigns to Justizparodie, to assess the guilt of the accused. 
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian lawyers argue, Omar Khadr home, so that he gets in Canada a fair trial. 
The government, but also the torture: they are more interested in little that one young adults after so many years of torment for always spiritually broken. 
We are not yet aware, but what we are witnessing an insidious circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word, which Harper constantly as a flag off, and from his mouth as meaningless sounds. 
Arbitrarily imprisoning abuse, torture, and quite it is the time has come, in which there is no morality more: Never ill-treat a Canadian citizens a head of state as, the only now will be supported by the minority (he after 14 October to belong to minority...). 
Many voters feel their salvation in a party to find the virtue, law and order preaches. But they do not see that this government of the, which has the reputation and dignity of our country. 
The disgrace, Mr Toews, lies in this Lossagung, and nowhere else. 
Free - the Orwellian speech by Barrick gold 
In its edition on 17 September, Le Devoir a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, Vize-Generaldirektor the Canadian gold mine Barrick gold. 
This confirms, and followed a nineteen logic, that the greatest Goldgewinnung society in the world a libel case over six million against three authors and a small mittelloses publishing house was, with the goal being a 'public transparent plastic debate' to open. 
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then do not judge them on the truth, especially in the case of libel lawsuits, but above the law. 
As expected, this fundamental difference was concealed by Mr Garver completely. 
For Barrick gold is the best way to conduct a public debate, in the ruin, who dares, one of the its opposite views. 
No matter how the process, the authors and the editor of the book Noir between Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and with very unequal arms against an army of lawyers, who are paid from the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine. 
The tactics in these unequal struggle is often to ruin the defender, to enforce an amicable settlement, which the other side, silence and is also anyone who dares to look again at the question. 
If wanted Barrick gold really a public debate, they would have their attitudes from public opinion must present. 
In contrast, as in many of the countries in which works Barrick gold, and is, to be played in Canada debates normally through the exchange of ideas and not by Knüppelhiebe. 
It would have sufficed, if the gold mine its books and files and have opened a real debate, through the papers, media, publishing and financing independent Prüfteams, the light on this issue could have. 
But Barrick gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and embraced the petitions and letters of support for the authors by Noir between Canada with a snap. 
Perhaps Mr Garver explain, as he simultaneously a 'public' debate may ask and opinions that public scorn? 
Apparently includes this word in the world of only the generous paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very nice beengte vision of the term. 
In a democracy to speak even detractors the right. 
What Barrick gold does not understand - or not understand - is that the general public, which the authors and publishers of Noir between Canada, above all, it is, of course, because they are the brutal attitude of the gold mine. 
Public opinion is willing to listen Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in a framework, which many saw as Knebel-Klage (during the 'public debate "has Barrick gold just a request to the authors of Noir between Canada, in which she asked of them, to not use that word more...). 
Apart from the surreal speech by Mr Garver, is the case brought by Barrick gold a direct assault on the freedom to academic research and seek out the truth, which are essential to any democratic society. 
They denied the right, credible sources to quote and about facts and interpretations, which are the basis of intellectual work. 
If it a country such as Canada is impossible, subjects to research and discuss the rich companies of this world, who else can this do? 
If wanted Barrick gold really a public and open debate, could bring them in line with the scientific standards, which were used by the authors of Noir between Canada. 
She has a right to reply. 
The university environment to which we belong has long debates and inconsistencies in the and to resolve conflicts. 
The disproportionate complaint of Barrick gold clearly shows that, contrary to what they claim, in no mood to a transparent debate. 
This is a loss for the university world, as it was for the public debate, and it is time that the governments of measures which restrict this sort of undeserved complaints. 
Bailout for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand 
The administration of Bush and the senior Members of Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, yesterday to an agreement on the most Wirtschaftsrettungsplan since the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
The new version of the plan over 700 billion dollars, to stop the financial crisis which has shaken, for months, Wall Street, must be approved by the two Kongresskammern. 
The main are: a better control of MEPs on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to refund the used public funds to secure, new orders, to reduce the number of deaths of arrears foreclosed homes, and the right, to monitor the senior executives of the the support companies. 
The American financial secretary Henry Paulson, the President of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and the negotiations during the representative of the Republicans, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, for a two-day marathon negotiations. 
"We have made great progress towards an agreement, which will be marktwirksam ', said the representatives of the administration, Bush Henry Paulson. 
"It was everything the real economy and to protect the American people before the Kurskrise on Wall Street, said the democrat. 
'This is the key point: If we do not, be the trauma, the chaos and the unrest in the daily lives of Americans be enormous, "said the Republicans Judd Gregg. 
The negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, fearing the impact would have had a second failure on the mood of investors. 
The deadline, which had been agreed, was the Markteröffnung this morning. 
The two American presidential candidates, the late in the negotiations, rather than supporters of the agreement, without, however, to register their dissatisfaction that it had taken to the extreme way. 
The Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on adding some orders for agreement, particularly those that allowed the owners to keep their homes to keep, and such, that the salaries of senior executives from the state rescued companies. 
If the taxpayers asks, due to the irresponsibility of certain people extraordinary measures to take, this is nothing, and we congratulate could. 
But these measures are necessary, "he said on the American television stations. 
When he was asked at another station, whether he will vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain: "I would like to know the details, but I hope it. 
"The guidelines, which I have read [to show] that this is a matter which we will all have to digest, and we will be able to continue. 
The option to do nothing, is simply not acceptable ", he said. 
The 700 billion Dollar-Plan is designed with the taxpayers' money 
He is 14 months after a crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble, the collapse of the risky mortgage loans (sub-prime) before they did it to other forms verbreiteterer bonds (PCAA), and finally in freezing the financial strength and ruin of banks and financial institutions. 
A group of Republican lawmaker was last week ’ s first attempt to reach an agreement failed. 
Since the democrats have accepted that some 'toxic' secured the societies in only by the government and should be bought, it thinks the impasse. 
The angle for everyone in Congress to complete, one has a disposal added, which says that, if the government with this programme within five years of losses, they could impose new taxes, about recovering as their sponsored capital. 
The new plan provides for the payment of a first 250 billion, that can be added to the 100 billion, if the President takes it. 
The other 350 billion needs to be approved in a vote by Congress. 
In exchange for his help comes Washington shares in the supported companies, which supported him in the case of profits dividends, and it can sell again when the storm passed. 
The federal government will have the opportunity, the house repossessions procedures regarding the homes, which are tied to the this plan affected property loans, and deadlines for repayment and set the compensation being paid to senior executives of the companies affected. 
The developers of the plan would like to, that the House of Representatives today votes on it, and the Senate on Wednesday. 
Despite all its efforts is not yet certain that their plan given the green light. 
Actually rose yesterday more votes against this project, by both the Republicans and the Democrats. 
'very obviously does not understand Washington us', said the Republicans Scott Garett, a member of the Finanzkommission the chamber, his voters. 
Yes, we have a big financial problem. 
Yes, there are solutions. 
But not, which is the taxpayer to '. 
The democratic Members Brad Sherman, who heads a group in Congress, 'the Kaukus of the sceptics' is known, is different, but the same conclusion. 
"Vierhundert excellent economic professors, including three Nobel Prize winner, have written to us and told us to: We ask Congress, not under pressure, and to consider carefully any route is', he said yesterday. 
At the same time we in Europe, once again, the proof that it is a worldwide crisis. 
In a Notfallversammlung important resource-rich the three Benelux countries the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16,3 billion US dollars). 
Intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that they do not, their Konkurrentin buy out in big trouble, since it 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) in the crisis the risky loans in the United States has lost. 
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and the ten largest insurers. 
'This is not a wasted money, said yesterday the Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos. 
To, we have a right to vote and influence in the bank. 
This is exactly what the savers and budgets, now as insecure times. ' 
During that time, it was on the other side of the Channel of the British government, another of the financial crisis at the bank to nationalise. 
According to the English press the government all loans with the bank Bradford and Bringley assume, more than 41 billion (75,5 billion US dollars) from property loans. 
The Spanish bank Santander was yesterday announced that it was the branches and the Kundenkonten of the British bank would serve. 
Bradford Advice and Bringley would be after Northern Rock's second bank, which has the British government since the beginning of this financial crisis nationalise. 
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a dedicated icon 
Its beauty with the azurblauen eyes was a long time to be an ace, nobody would say its weakness. 
Had liberated the American actor with the charming smile from narcissistic mirror liberated? 
Yes and no. 
Sensitivity, his sensitivity and an obvious talent have him as a position of power, the truly dreadful monster to death. 
But what a great Dauerläufer! 
The Friday at the age of 83 years from the effects of lung cancer at his ranch in Connecticut late Paul Newman remains one of the last icons of the American cinema the golden years. 
He was less monumental than Brando, where he said, and for which he has long been a kind of rival on the screen, careful in his spectacle, also fragile, but as an apostle of freedom and the Sprengens dramaturgischer conventions. 
Our reading blood is often wonderful children. 
He was born in 1925 in Ohio as the son of a German Jews and ethnic Hungarians mother. 
From its European roots should one of the glorious Faces of the American dream. 
Without excessive ego, ultimate quality. 
Because it reflected a whole country again, in the Self-made-man love with was, in the fighters in the Pacific in the shoot-out was injured, the beginning of the 1950s Schauspielkunst at Yale student and then the Actor Presley Studio in New York, before he success on theatre, television and, soon, in cinema. 
This man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver, the 1979 when 24-Stunden-Rennen of Mans place second, and also a Sexsymbol, although he lived together with the actress Joanne Woodward since 1958 in a Vorzeigebeziehung lived. 
With him disappear and the unknown facets of this mysterious, modest, committed and the glamour of show business allergic stars, whose mystery we never completely will solve. 
A decent man, in the true sense of the word. 
The death of Paul Newman's left the Kinoliebhaber this weekend in infatuation, while on the screen of memories, all of his great roles might have been. 
More than half a century of American cinema was in constant change brings with him over. 
As is the charming cowboy "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969), and the young man, his sinnliche wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the cat in the hot Blechdach rejects, which was filmed in 1958 by floor Sea Williams filmed. 
There will be a much less ambitious recent memory (1990) raised on its sensitive Mr Bridge, who in his old age by a wedding is disrupted, which did not all their promises. 
So many other Paul Newman's there in the course of history. 
This criminal, sizzling, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up ’ There Likes Me (a handful of dirt) by Robert Wise, a role that was intended for James Dean, after his death was restored and the Newman 1956 correctly known. 
This pleasant crook in towering The Sting (The what), which was decorated in 1973 with the Oscar for best film. 
As verbitterter and vengeful Billardspieler in wonderful The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), 
That face by the time, that he was. 
Still he. 
In his CV unite itself eras. 
The youth, knows it, mostly from Kultfilm Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little Orthodox trainer a Eishockeyteams. 
His fans found it in The Hudsucker Proxy the brothers Coen again. 
With a final role in 2003 as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes joined the circle. 
In contrast to several Kinolegenden, which have withdrawn soon enough from the Filmwelt, should stay Newman long in the background, and Hollywood, your assets, betrayed his future and his concessions. 
The French filmmaker Bertrand Taverniers saw him, not without humour, as living challenge to the 'Underplaying', as he viewed his too powerful. 
The preserve has not always been easy for the fine Paul Newman, the zuflogen the roles for a long time. 
He played but rare Sunnyboys as outsiders: Neurotiker, alcoholic, Fieslinge or desperate people, with the perfect portrayal he be slipping and his defiance reflected. 
As director revealed Newman unknown sides his real subtle sensitivity. 
Be Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (following the saga of Canadian citizen Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, was a feinsinniges Frauenporträt full melancholy. 
He, who lost his son Scott by an overdose, devoted this 1984 his film Harry and Son, full of subtlety and sadness. 
The flood of honours ergoss itself yesterday on Newman, said his close friend and former Waffengefährte Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) found extremely: 'His presence has improved my life and this country'. 
Generosity and love of life were essential qualities of the late actor. 
Apart from his legendary career is now also a great defender of civil rights, the environment and the independent cinemas, an opponent of the wayward Hollywood, then. 
We have him often with the foot in parings fully Vinaigrette, in Saucen, seen pastries or other foods, and rather distasteful, although we were initially funny. 
The profits from its trading was in his Foundation for children in need. 
Rather than on his myth rest, threw himself Newman until the shot. 
He has left his five daughters a letter with these words: "Every and until the very end was your father an incredibly grateful for his auspicious. 
It was a privilege to be here '. 
And for us it was an honour, the life of an intelligent and generous American actor to follow. 
A good citizen, intimate and in its broadest sense. 
What has been produced in the Rechnungsfabrik of contract & Co? 
On October 8 the negotiations begin in criminal proceedings against János substrate and his accomplices. 
The defendants will particularly in the organised crime, and grossly reckless damage and Geschäftsbetrug, and other offences - including counterfeiting of documents -. 
According to prosecutors were used the competitions from capitalized resources for their own purposes, while the provided were services often with fake invoices. 
Public spending and subsidies from the government - HUF 65 million - and in the coffers of the organisation Fiatal Baloldal, be spent partly in the Privatkassen an individual. 
As the investigation known, made when the Ausschreibungsgelder fictitious accounts, and the clubs are their duties also failed. 
According to indictment is a large part of the bills have been falsified. 
The Rechnungsblöcke were on the market by Józsefváros bought, the Rundsiegel it allowed in Kiskunhalas. 
The decision, which will be issued firms the bills, was on the trip north from Lake Balaton, was sent to the István Lados of János substrate. 
In this "fact-finding tour" should Lados pensions and restaurants. 
He asked bills on the Konsumationen, later on these proposals based bills for the youth and Sportministerium, social and employment, and the self-governance of Budapest to be. 
These bills are mainly by István Lados and his accomplices, have been manipulated András Őri, which is representing our information for the Constitution of those reports. 
One of the objectives of Lados' "fact-finding tour" was a Bierlokal. 
As two of the contract and is Co in 2003 issued bills, the Gastronomiebetrieb the neunzigköpfige group of associations Biztos Pont Egyesület meal. 
But now is the head of the livestock, such a large group had not at once in the restaurant hineingepasst. 
Another bill, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Foundation Jobb Jövőért, later known as Együtt Wyatt Harmadik Évezredért, was also serious violation and Inhaltsfehler on. 
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj, the only three rooms and no more than ten people at the same time maintain can, according to the account 130 guests. 
The imagination of Rechnungsfälscher were set seems equally no limits, as the Pigal Kft. was involved, a Gastronomiebetrieb, in whose accounting records of customers Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá according present public prosecutor not to be seen. 
As business leaders Győző Farkas the hvg.hu, told he was immediately clear that it was forged documents, as he presented by the Public Prosecution Service during a consultation documents were submitted. 
"Our Firmenname and the tax number were on the mark wrong appropriate". 
And further: apart from procedural irregularities was also the fact that the farm 100 people sheltering, after all, eleven Zimmer, the impossible so many people place. 
Also was also on the bill, it is not the restaurant for some time now. 
The diligent account counterfeiters have also failed to check that their target of Budapest travel agency exclusively travel abroad, and so have indicated they Ungarn-Reisen on the cash, which was also the Rechnungslegungspraxis of the company. 
As in the course of the investigation became known, they have the bills including VAT, although Reisebüroleistungen, which relate to a country outside the EU, mehrwertsteuerfrei are. 
The level of VAT was generally to four by the hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Foundation Jobb Jövőért issued bills wrong, because the 25 15% VAT charges, will also be prepared by the staff only mechanical bills, the false documents were by hand. 
Another mistake, the Rechnungslegern "undermine was, was that in one case" goods transport "as comes had stated performance, although it is not offered by the investment advice specialist firm, said the prosecutor. 
Further irregularities - wrong Rechnungsformat, false mark - was that the Együtt Wyatt Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and XXI. Could be exposed századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont issued bills as forgeries debunked. 
Just as in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the Sportlager Kunfehértó, protested the manager, the bills were never issued. 
Another "mistakes" made the counterfeiters in the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This society was at the time (2001), particularly at sunset, when we have eaten the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület there - the Masseverwalter were consequently, not the bills themselves. 
Deliberately falsified 
The other group Rechnungsleger are people who have been well aware that they fictitious invoices. 
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták has the Foundation has Esély Budapestért Alapítvány bills for the Foundation Együtt Wyatt Harmadik Évezredért, in a of about HUF 4 million issued. 
According to indictment was the executive director of the Collab Kft. by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, for issuing the fictitious invoices. 
The moment in winds up being Biogate Kft. is to have worked with premium and Co: in 2003, the GmbH, the Foundation Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, and the clubs Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület with counterfeit bills in a total of HUF 5 million, which is not to provide related services. 
However, there was also little money, as were cancelled the bills for exhibition, which have forgotten the group in its documents to be recorded. 
The third group of Rechnungsleger encompasses people brought directly with the defendants. 
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of Ukrainian business leader of the delta Trió Kft., in Budapest resident, but not auffindbaren issue where fuel and Fahrzeughandelsfirma. 
The company is in the period from October to December 2005 several bills on the sale of EDV-Komponenten in total of HUF approximately 18 million issued. 
According to the investigative body is to have the since 14 September 2005 in liquidation or cash investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas as buyer these bills. 
Directors of that company was a reason that should be delivered to the Firmendokumente also of Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005. 
According to our information has been Kubatov during the investigations, bills on behalf of the GmbH. to the clubs Atlasz and Hoppá, issued and Együtt Wyatt Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and whose value to themselves. 
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. are believed to have been founded by exclaimed bricklayers - on Iván Kubatovs point. 
In truth, however, was not firms active, according to the accused to the lack of contracts. 
Still benefit from the companies: request his accomplices, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was charged with the preparation of the Firmengründung documents, has issued on behalf of the companies' bills with award in the clubs, such as in Atlasz and Y-Generáció. 
As a whole Kubatov 15 bills in a total of HUF 14,2 million on behalf of the companies raise cash investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, have issued Jos investment and Linaxtrade to the organisations. 
The prosecution argues that could have cashed Kubatov each 10% of the Rechnungssumme and VAT. 
Kubatov Vorrang haben even abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictitious invoices - in this case were settled the bills the nominations of Biztos Pont. 
The company Y-Generáció and Szövetség Wyatt Modern Magyarországért have in January 2006 suggested in the voluntary organisation of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA"). 
Both were ever 500,000 Ft, have genütztVVPP highjacked these amounts. 
In order to cover it up, they have the TMA five fictitious invoices the Works team Kft. presented. 
These bills were seized in the raid on the offices of Árpád Kemecsei in Unterrichtsministerium ensured. 
In the negotiations will now by some defendants with a confession on the in the Rechnungsfälschung, as they have already before the public prosecutor's office filed were expected. 
A sensation could be, if chooses the Hauptangeklagte János substrate to a comprehensive confession. 
His previous claims were less detailed, and although he had already promised, to report on everything, his confession. 
The question remains unanswered, whether it is in its interests, whether the Socialists a pact with him have on the compensation of the majority of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether premium in exchange, agreed to take responsibility. 
But it is quite possible that winning the "sulking" plays after his requests to alleviate the imprisonment and house arrest on deaf ears. 
While other criminals who, with financial crime far greater damage and that they are not paid, at large, or at least placed under house arrest, denied substrate that possibility. 
The psychology of Überbietens - or why we are willing to pay more 
In auctions tend the buyers to spend more and the Feilgebotene thus to exaggerate. 
Neurologists and Wirtschaftsforschern of the University of New York, it is now, the neurologisch-ökonomischen bases this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior. 
According to a "Science" magazine published study want the people in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, not beaten and therefore are willing to pay even excessive prices. 
The researchers have tried the neurological system this "game" with experimental auctions to explore. 
A group of volunteers should play lottery, while attended the other in a encouraging play action - in both cases were active brain regions enrolled functional magnetischer resonance (fMRI). 
Both games got the money, however, it has been increased activity of Striatum, a complex of below the Gehirnrinde, measured at the losers in the auction, in which the script outbid the adversary, plays an important role. 
Among many other functions is this brain region for the "Selbstbelohnung" of the nervous system. 
The researchers said, the price increase could be explained by the avoidance of overreaction of Striatums explain. 
In order to maintain their thesis, have made economists in both the research team additional studies to follow up on the money. 
In this case should three groups against a partners under different conditions organizations had. 
The control group was told the true value of the product, then they have their operations. 
A different group were 15 dollar reward promised, in the case that they winners from the game. 
The third group received $15 before the auction, in the event of a lost game also were lost. 
The difference between the two groups was merely that the emphasis in the one on the profits, while the other is on the losers. 
As evidence of the neurologists expressed hypothesis, but the members of the "against lose" 's games group to higher operations prepared than those in the control or "gains" group. 
"This results derive from any previous economic theory. 
These have at auction saw behaviour only with the joy of the profits, or the risk avoidance. 
The contradiction between these two theories was dissolved the imaging neurological processes, and that we now have a third statement giving, "said Andrew Schotter, professor of Wirtschaftsfakultät of the University of New York. 
Hepatitis is: when will go to the doctor? 
Worldwide suffer around half a billion people suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary is listed these chronic lost much weight among the leading causes of death. 
The number of those infected will here at home to be treated 100,000, only seven thousand, which is inherent to the fact that patients often do not know that they are infected. 
Hepatitis is the name for various viruses, infected liver disease. 
The symptoms are often similar - Leberentzündung and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases. 
Depending on the virus spread the hepatitis viruses on two different species: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example, by contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C and D can the viruses through blood and other Körperflüssigkeiten (such as sperm, Scheidensekret or spittle). 
Travellers will be recommended vaccination against the viruses A and B, against the virus C, there is no vaccine. 
The symptoms of hepatitis A show around zwei-drei weeks after eating the contaminated food and are generally of Unwohlbefinden, weakness, stomach pain and splutter. 
Then comes the jaundice on the skin and in the eyes, the chair is bright, the controller of dark, and the recovery could take up to zwei-drei weeks take. 
World dies every year around 1 million people to the hepatitis B infections caused far more serious illnesses such as liver cancer and cirrhosis. 
The main reason is that it is estimated that only one in ten patients in drug treatment. 
Also hepatitis C can have serious consequences: untreated it can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. 
Most of the people do not even know about their illness, because the pathogen the liver are destroyed - in many cases show the first symptoms after 20-30 years. 
So is early prevention, such as regular inspections, is essential. 
There are three groups, in which the disease is more common: those who have undergone before 1991 a blood transfusion, drug addicts, and Tätowierte. 
Currently estimated the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide to 200 million. 
Since the disease during a routine Laboruntersuchung is identified, it is advisable, at the first signs of unknown origin the family doctor. 
In time, the disease is curable, the virus cannot be eradicated, which makes the infection and to prevent the development of cancer. 
The 30 September is the World Day of hepatitis, 2004 for the first time by Patientenvertretungen worldwide. 
The aim of the scheme, the awareness of these viruses causes chronic Leberentzündung, its creation and to reinforce the importance of early detection. 
Have believers less pain? 
As latest research suggests that the religious belief as a kind of "pain" overtones, which is already the death Catholic martyrs have facilitated. 
Scientists at Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: It has influenced the belief in God the Schmerzempfinden of the people affected, the British 'Telegraph ". 
In the wake of the more bizarre investigation received every 12 believers and atheists electric shocks, while a painting of the mother of God afterlife. 
As the results showed, the believers of most of the pain. 
A Hirn-Scan technology could even be shown that could activate the Catholics of the part of her brain, who is in charge of the Schmerzregulierung responsible. 
The study was the first in a research project, which, as well as scientists also philosophers and theologians from various departments in the university. 
The attempt was the subjects a funkelndes equipment at the left hand, the electric shocks. 
The participants were asked on two paintings to focus: a picture of the mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other hand, Leonardo da Vincis "lady with the sable." 
The researchers had hoped that the sight of young Maria under the believers a kind of religious trance would provoke, while they Vincis picture started because of the other paintings and reassuring was perceived. 
The subjects were ever half an hour in an MRI scanner, and received in this period, a total of 20 threats in four stages, while they either religious, or the other paintings should look. 
The Catholics reported that they had in the mother of God "in security" felt as if they "-", and they would "calm and peace". 
During the Betrachtens of religious painting they have reported 12% less pain, as if they had Leonardos opus. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias, the also attempt attended, said it could be similar effects with other, strong images also atheists, we should just the photograph. 
"We must find a picture that very positive emotions, such as a mother or father," the psychologist. 
The anglikanische Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research. 
"Practice of the faith should change our personality, and in many cases," Wright. 
After these excellent results the only question is what could effect a Madonna-Bild Leonardos or any other comparable Malers at the Schmerzregulierung of believers. 
Would the high-quality young Maria still better results? 
You are, what you on your way mitteilst 
At its tenth birthday can Google with fair to say that it is in the pockets of the people as to find above their heads in the sky: you know, where the people their holidays, which are specialists they go and what they are. 
And that is still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, the chief executive officer of Google. 
In the sceptics who of Orwellian nightmare visions be plagued, he hosts: these were just the essence of the Web 2.0. 
In an interview with the Financial Times said Schmidt recently, the main objective of Google, more personal data about users to collect and so the original purpose of the company to get closer to that "all information this world class". 
Schmidt said Google was after ten years weltverändernder work still only at the beginning of the Informations-Sammelns. 
The status quo in five years, "said Schmidt: he wanted, Google would be able to questions like" What can I do tomorrow? "Or" what job fits really to me? "To answer, however, are software programs not yet in a position to do this, because they do not know enough about the users. 
Not all Internet-User are aware that were registered in Internet-Recherchen the Suchbegriffe, and also the IP addresses, from which sought, and the visiting sides. 
For example, the two years ago introduced "Personalized Search" allows us to store the visitors his own Suchverlauf and drawing later, that can bring the hit later much more precise and, on the same logic are the so-called "Recommendations," with whom the system tailor-made recommends products and services because of the previous preferences. 
The users wondering what in the event of a Datenmissbrauchs happens - "If you check what I do" - show some concerned whether the Google-Datenmonopols. 
In most cases it is more of the firm, potential power, frightening, and less feeling guilty or the fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the rebellion against the power, with many Internet-Usern of rejection. 
However, it is a proven fact that stored the Suchbegriffe not only, but instead will be passed on occasion even to third parties, and in these Gesetzesfällen there is no protection for the rights of the Internet-Users. 
A perfect example was recently against pedophilia in Brazil, in which Google the Brazilian government information by the Gemeinschaftssite called "Orkut" were collected and did also identify the Pädophilien possible. 
Personal rights was users could breathe a sigh of relief, but in May, as Google together with the Bürgerrechts organisation EFF successfully against the FBI in court: so can be forced Google in future with any of the Constitution, information the FBI secret question. 
(However, the federal government successfully the 50,000 Webadressen and 1,000 Suchbegriffen with reference to the years ago adopted Jugendschutzgesetz hydrocarbon, but it was the list of individual users, denied or whose Web- and research on list to two months backdated.) 
Googles image remains controversial: those who hand over their personal data reluctantly, because they fear by the use of the Google-Dienste the loss of their private and make-up, chastising the company with the conservative performing firms due indignation. 
But the American "Geek-Kultur", which, in many countries is present and enthusiastic Computerfans, unites activists and users, the next generation of the "coolen entrepreneurs" in them, in contrast to Microsoft, which thanks to Windows market leader, even if fighting both at the same goal. 
One possible reason is that Google its users, in contrast to Microsoft no identification codes, and his services are available for free, and that a more open, constantly updated source code and Programm-Package far more attractive, young and cool seem to be, as the official practices of the computer software. 
On the other hand, says the Geeks the problematic relationship of individual rights and the Internet caustic - a relationship, especially in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0" is at the core. 
The "Web 2.0" is nothing more than collaboration, in other words, the users left deliberately traces and use the available channels of communication and, even if the individual are different, remains the main thing, the same publicly to show. 
An ordinary person can simultaneously in several Gemeinschaftsportalen be high profile management - from Facebook on Xanga, can these other services, such as Twitter, or music services like last.fm with each other, and can include all this in a follow-up system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they could lead to blogs, which are the latest Fotogalerien automatically, which are geostet on Flickr or Picasa geostet. 
And a number of other classic cases shows: that if the Partyfotos to last night's the girlfriend soon, with whom it disloyal friend Bush-bashing has, or will be, because he makes in his blog too honest his anger at the corporate governance air - one thing is certain: the word "privacy" has now been completely new. 
If you have a Online-Leben, is what he reveal - or less can be given in the basic idea behind the behaviour of today's youth. 
And anyone who tried to keep something secret, or even the Google-Monopol to circumvent, can gladly do that - as with Scroogle, a Tool, the grab at the search engine Google grab, but deliberately no trace. 
Many people register not deliberately on Gemeinschaftsseiten, so that they are not accessible, but also the Online-Applikationen of Google, such as Textverarbeitungs- and graphics tools and RSS-Feeds, with alternative versions, which are tied to huge Serverparks and generate not the best profile by users. 
Public opinion has yet been averted, until Google her up. 
With its current value of $156 billion the company even before IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), the Werbeflächen of AdWords / AdSense threaten the revenue advertisers, and the faster imported services are not only Microsoft, but also other software developers headaches. 
Critical observer will find the disturbing polarities, has rejected the directors a protest by the staff, having doubled the price of the company ’ s nursery have been doubled, also said the management, the frequent meals of staff is too expensive, which is as mild against the fact that Google in 2006, the Chinese government even in the knees and was with an agreement agreed that all dissident hits, or those who breach the good taste, filtered out. 
The internal rules of the group that will be advertised in advance no new service, but only if it is already available, but could the events of the months and years ahead again some sharply change: while some think, Google's Buch- and Magazinscan- or archiving project have now, that the company soon with the Supreme Court to address, are different because of the "" health "concerned that the calls for a complete Gesundheitsprofils basis of findings, doctors and problems. 
And the fact that Google a genetic database builds, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors the substance, as "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in the best Orwellian fashion a future in which a man thanks to Google's data chillingly nahbar will. 
Two young men to help the Doppelmörder of Ózd in the Spurenbeseitigung 
In connection with the double murder of Ózd the police has now two youths interrogated, suspected in the removal of the traces helped to have, the spokesman for the Polizeikommissariats Borsod on Tuesday. 
The young people were concedes, currently being accused them of complicity.

Together with experts now investigating the police the explosive and the circumstances of their use. 
Warsaw Stock Exchange does purchasing for Prague Stock Exchange. 
Some 200 million, or 5 billion Czech crowns has offered the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the possible purchase of stocks and bonds the Prague Stock Exchange. 
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock, reiterated the offer the Poland, despite the fact had that they were used by the Czechs as owners of their stock exchange. 
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange into the state. 
99% of the shares in the hands of the Polish state, wants to sell more than 60% of papers in the coming months. 
After news of the Czech newspaper "E15" includes the stand of Poles the highest purchase price, the ever been offered for the Prague Stock Exchange. 
As the newspaper reports that have until now the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the offers. 
Petr Koblic, chief of the Prague Stock Exchange said last week that none of the players the Warsaw Stock Exchange may well be the worst new owner would be, and he, too, that in the future, even to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange could lead. 
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 10 billion kronor. 
According to the agreement of the shareholders could 90% of the shares will be sold.

The financial crisis from European newspapers 
In their the exacerbated international financial crisis's comments spoke on Tuesday some leading European newspapers by "second 9 / 11". 
The global Finanzkatastrophe we have the American president, Neither newspaper La Repubblica, the President was not even been able to his own party for the bill to a,, some relief in the appalling situation should... 
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor," as the multi-billion dollar investor Warren Buffett said, it would be more of a "second 11 September." 
The press in Madrid locate the scapegoat in Washington. 
According to the "El Mundo" is the lack of political leadership to blame, that the world economy is now on the verge of collapse. 
The American financial system faces more and more crumbling, and the whole world. 
Bush's plan was not perfect, but risks after the vote in Congress, the danger that Washington is not a political tool for crisis management. 
The world economy is in the air, and, just at a time when one of the greatest transformation in the history of capitalism. 
It is not the threat, saying the Geneva "Tages-Anzeiger". 
Yet could some states their rock - featuring Rettungspakete available, and the banks with the taxpayers' money from bankruptcy. 
However, a domino effect and there are even more banks to fail, then neither further cash injections, other emergency measures. 
Long term need the EU member states on their specialization and control of the money markets centralisation. 
Alone on Monday were paid more than EUR 100 billion of faltering financial institutions, the Vienna "The Standard. In addition, the newspaper, the concerns always realistic, that according to the Americans now European taxpayers something deeper in their pockets, out of this crisis. 
So far, has not directly addressed the EU seriously with the crisis, like a tsunami on the old continents. 
The "savior" would not immediately with several hundred billion "makes it look," but it would be advisable, in which case it would be reasonable, the taxpayers ’ money to see an even greater damage. 
Intelligent car imitate the flight of the Hummel 
What would be the best method for development of new technologies for accident avoidance, if not the Hindernis-Sensoren from nature to imitate? 
For example, the bees. 
In the CEATEC in Japan was a startling project, in which the Nissan-Ingenieure of Hummeln in the establishing new accident vermeidender systems were inspired. 
In cooperation with the Tokyo University has Nissan of Autorobotern foreign-backed built biomimetische system from BR23C, a Mini-Auto, equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim to support the development of a system that avoids any collisions. 
In flight is any bee their own, oval "privacy," our own "shield" is very similar, said Kazuhhiro Doi, Produktmanager for Technologie-PR and research development, in the exhibition. 
The line-up of the bee that can see in every direction and in a corner of over 300 degrees, plays an important role. 
The function of the buzz if ratings, the researchers the idea of the lasergesteuerten Abstandsmessers on. 
It identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a slanting of 180 degrees within 2 metres, calculated their distances and sends signals to the Mikroprozessor on board, of the kollisionsvermeidenden process. 
The barrier will in seconds Bruchteilen registered, and the Autoroboter alter the course, the movement of bees, is the tyres around the corner. 
In contrast to previous systems will take place this ploy purely instinctively. 
"If it were not so, might not react the Autoroboter quickly enough to avoid the obstacles here," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the "Mobility Laboratory (TRL)" and Autoroboter-Projektes. 
The system must react instinctively immediately, because this technology to the most intimate and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer, within the accidents still as inevitable. 
The entire process must reflect the behaviour of the bees, if they other bees. 
And that must be a split second. 
But can the fudge, in contrast to the bees, not up, down, or even diagonal be done - it can only two, and then only in the direction of the Wendbarkeit of tyres. 
While bees here infinitely many opportunities to avoid other bees, the researchers at the Autoroboter only the Drehbewegung, or of speeding up and Abbremsens. 
The BR23C contains Lithium-Polymerbatterien, which are easier and more efficient, and therefore a longer life than traditional Lithium-Ionenbatterien. 
Andoh declared, it is the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on processing the data, and even less to the ability to store them. 
This device must per second only inputs and appropriately respond to them. 
It needs to store them, or on previous manoeuvres a intuitive, logical reaction produce, and it has just a handful KB Memory in. 
There is no need Gigabyte- and Megabyte-schwerer Memories. 
This is the first step in the development of the immediate Kollisionsvermeidungstechnologie, which will be in Nissan within the next ten years they set out in production. 
Another application could find the technology in the GPS-Satellitennavigation find by motorists aware of barriers around and it so. 
A name for the sündteure child 
Now the written version of the 700-Mrd-Dollar serious Rettungspaket-Gesetzes ago, in several stages will apply and to the purchase of bad loans to banks. 
In the first round is half the money will be spent. 
In a meeting on Saturday after midnight local time east coast came to an end, the Members of Congress the congressmen after when debates to reach an agreement on the 700-Milliarden-Dollar heavy rescue package, of course, reported Reuters. 
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, democratic President in American Chamber of Deputies, and we need to reconcile the agreement only to paper. 
The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the result: the programme will be effective and that it will be effective, we must do even more, according to Pelosi were not about saving the Wall Street, the economy rumzureißen but. 
The written version of the package was made even before the opening of the Asian markets, Washington time Sunday night at 8 p.m. (central European time Monday 2 a.m.), was published, but has no flights on the stock market. 
On Monday, is first parliament on the bill to stabilise the economy of 2008, then the Senate. 
President George W. Bush spoke on Saturday evening with Pelosi, and also the White House welcomed the news of the agreement. 
We are satisfied with the progress and appreciate the efforts of both parties to bring stability to our markets and to protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, spokesman for the White House. 
The programme is different from the original recommendation of the Bush administration, which claims that the $700 billion dollar at once for the purchase of the empty, with loans of contaminated securities should be spent. 
In a first tranche is to be spent more than half of the 700-Milliarden-Betrages spent, with 250 billion immediately available, after the vote in the Congress as expected Monday on the issue, for the purchase kreditbelasteter, bad securities, and the 100 billion should decide the President. 
The programme will be reviewed by an independent Commission, which is also the President of the Federal Reserve. 
The other half of the 700 billion depends on a further decision of Congress. 
In the spirit of the law can the Treasury Department also combined tactics apply: It may simultaneously bad loans, mortgages, and with mortgages securities purchased, or other "toxic" loans. 
As reported responsible and the ministry, can the purchase both in an auction as too directly. 
The law allows the affected firms, take part in an insurance scheme, in which the Treasury the worrying funding secured, and the company expected damage such charges. 
Henry said Paulsen: The law defines the resources that can be raised up to 700 billion dollars as relief for the American financial system, be it for large-scale purchase less funds, its insurance, or avoid systemic risk, which is caused by the collapse of a major money. 
We take the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law when it was signed, so Paulson. 
The directors of the hard-pressed and now on government aid lifeline banks can expect, however, that their process in the Übersee-Slang colloquial "golden Handshake", will be cut by the government. 
A cut in the pay will only in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Treasury each aushilft. 
The cuts are basically means that when buying the ministry in an auction, the "golden Handshake" is taxed, unless the outgoing Bankenchef is being pushed in the pension. 
In the event of a direct purchasing the bad loans, will the government aggressively, to ensure that the directors ’ pay not be exaggerated. 
The picture also heard that will not change the existing Golden Handshake-Verträge - the restrictions apply only to new agreements in order to participate more and more people in the programme. 
This is the first case in American history that cuts in Manager-Gehältern by law, commented the Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, the measure. 
The state is participation rights for the participating banks, so that the risk to taxpayers, because they also can take part, as soon as the economy and also the rescued bank recovers. 
The draft law stipulates that the President of the Congress over the next five years to make a proposal must, as the taxpayers its lost money from the financial sector back. 
There were, however, on both sides skeptics in relation to the plan their doubts. 
That is not what the American people expect of us, the plan will help protect the taxpayers' money, as the California Republicans Darrell Issa. 
His colleague from Ohio, said Mary Kaptur: the measures were driven by the same people, who are also for the collapse of Wall Street.

The right is intact, the electorate was within the camp more - described as "Der Spiegel" the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria. 
In Austria are Haider and Co ready to govern, a rot-schwarze coalition to prevent. 
The mirror (spiegel.de) 
In the Online-Ausgabe of the left where German news magazine analysed Franz Walter the reasons for the dramatic defeat the CSU in his article "Bavaria revolution vertilgt their fathers'. 
According to the renowned political theorists began the erosion of CSU long before the sad Beckstein-Huber-Duo his office. 
The Christsozialen have renewed Bavaria for decades - now turn the modern citizens from them. 
The Epochenbruch is a problem of Christian democracy, as well as for Angela Merkel. 
Quite suddenly was the disaster of the CSU, but on Sunday is something that has come to an end, however, was almost exactly 10 years loomed: the undoubted hegemony a ZANU-PF 
Because ten years ago, in 1998, moving towards the CSU in 47,7 per cent and was this the first time since the 1950s under the Fünfzig-Prozent-Marke 
The repeated itself three years ago, when the federal elections in 2005, in the Stoiber-Ära. 
The CSU in the Land of consistently pursued modernisation has vertilgt to their own mothers and fathers vertilgt. 
Sociologists have already 40 years ago predicted, but pace considerably over-estimated their. But without effect could secularization, the Bildungserfolge, visitors will of eastern and northern Germany in the prosperous regions in Bavaria on the allegiance of the CSU-Wähler do not stay. 
Modernization is always accompanied by Optionsvermehrung. And it has political consequences. 
The right is intact - only the voters inside the camp were critical and eigenwilliger. 
It is telling that in the last few weeks the classic civil society groups the greatest distance to CSU: the professions, industrial citizenry and voters with A levels as university.

The conservative Vienna newspaper reported in its "with whom? Party leaderships reticent in coalition" betitelten article on the chaotic domestic situation in Austria after the elections. 
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP. 
Support from the interference the SPÖ in internal affairs. 
The BZÖ shows in all directions open to talks, while the Greens in relation to a coalition not yet. 
The elections are over, and now everything is about the coalition; in the debates in public television left the party in their hands. 
Spö-chef Werner Faymann reiterated its desire, with the ÖVP negotiate. 
The SPÖ wants to show that a cooperation between the two parties is perfectly possible - in some federal level and in the social partnership is already the case. 
The question of whether he a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP-Chef than Vice-Chancellor, could imagine, Faymann open. 
As he said, if the voters Schüssel-Molterer-Kurs voted out. 
A repeat this direction would be not in question. 
Mr Molterer has on red offers reacted cautiously. 
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, if Faymann tried in internal concerns the ÖVP interfere.

’: the vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken 
Today in Paris the European summit on equal opportunities, the election-year politics of EU-Ratspräsidentschaftsland France will focus. 
In the House's speech was Mrs Járóka, Fidesz-Abgeordnete of the European People's Party, particularly the educational segregation, since this is one of the most serious offences of the law, the Roma children see, this is the biggest obstacle to their desire. 
The high-level conference by French employment and Social Welfare Minister Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for employment, social affairs and opportunities. 
Among the participants were representatives from governments, European partners, and the main European protection and civil organisations in the area. 
’ pointed out that, in addition to discrimination, as the press office of MEPs Fidesz asks, has to find new jobs, the Roma, primarily because of their low levels of education from ousted. 
"The vast majority of the Roma-Jugendlichen has no Mittelschulbildung and, thanks to a bad reason Schulausbildung can only a small portion of a university conclusion". 
Also said ’ that education is a basic human right, the a key role to play in the assertion other human rights. 
Investment in early training of Roma children could the economy of the EU member states. 
The MPs, it is important that those links a broader constituency - Roma and nicht-Roma - will. 
Because the sooner a Roma pupils at the school begins, the increase his chances to become productive member of the labour market; and through income tax and VAT they should make their contribution to the national expenditure. 
"As citizens should be guaranteed the right to quality education, the bad and segregated education must be stopped", Mrs Járóka. 
As the delegates, is a common, managed and ’ actions of the European Union needed to accelerate the Desegregationsprozess on education. This is the correct application of the existing and planned Anti-Diskriminierungsdirektiven essential. 
"We need the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment and Roma children the democratic opportunities, on the future of Europe as full citizens to contribute," said ’. 
Since Congress in Berlin last year hosted the summit a year with the objective, a unique forum for the Voranbringung of the objectives of the equality and freedom from discrimination at European and national level, in the spirit of the European Year of equal opportunities. " 
CSU: mercy on time 
At the end of October, will determine the fate of the fallen Franco-German Huber-Beckstein decided 
Despite the Wahldebakels trains from using still no heads, the head of the Bavarian CSU were the Personaldebatten postponed. 
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their posts, the only question is how long the mercy lasts. 
The fate of the partnership following the disastrous 17-prozentigen Stimmverlust will be decided at the last Oktoberwochenende at the extraordinary council meeting. 
The much gescholtene duo has already hints that it is not on their bellies posted up. 
So that they want the angry group and energize the party base, the day after the "Bavarian tsunami" with the loss of an absolute majority of personal consequences. 
Five years ago, admittedly, under the leadership of his Karrierehöhepunkt Surely Edmund Stoiber - the christlich-Soziale Union still 60.7%, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they were only 43.4 percent of the vote. 
The CSU was 46 years "Alleinregierer" in Bavaria, the 18 per cent of the German GDP. 
The conservatives remain the dominant force in the Hungarian economy important southern province, will have to govern but in a coalition government. 
The first sign of no precedent restructuring will the potential successors Hubers, Vice-President and Bundesagrarminister Horst Seehofer in the fact-finding team, with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "Free voters" exploratory talks about a possible Munich coalition. 
A twist of fate, it is, that with the list of "Free voters" Gabriele Pauli in the legislature, has exploited its Anti-Stoiber incidence that Huber-Beckstein duo first, abzuservieren then the determined politician. 
The CSU-Führung concentrated now all its efforts to stabilise Becksteins. 
In this transition will Stoiber, the date the strings from behind the scenes, an active role, and the former Prime Minister and CSU-Vorsitzender called the 28 September "bitter day his political career." 
On Monday made Huber a few toxic comments in Richtung CDU - his opinion had the CSU far more support from the sister party deserves. 
Other CSU-Politiker interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and also to Angela Merkel. 
Should the CSU, the 2005 national level to the success that has contributed, not a common effort to rebound, Merkel can after the federal elections in September 2009 will not Chancellor. 
Merkel, who has made their disappointment at the fiasco no secret, believes that will not affect the Terrainverlust the CSU negative impact on the grand coalition in Berlin. 
But relatively is: the wounded CSU be ungovernable easier to govern, and the crisis in the Socialists, however. 
18.6 percent reached the SPD has hitherto best result in Bavaria since 1946. 
Lukaschenko-opposition: 110-0 
In Sunday's elections, has no member of the opposition in the parliament. 
Russian observers say that this is exclusively on prosperity and stability in the Alexander Lukashenko's country, the OECD predicted but illicit goings-on in the counting of votes. 
The OECD, which has sent from 43 countries – 450 observers, did not recognise the elections. 
De lifetimes of the 10-Millionen-Einwohnerstaates will do for decades without opposition. However, the "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) assembled other party before yesterday's elections seriously hoped that Lukashenko, the renewed the flawed elections and a constitutional amendment 2006 be presidential mandate is already for the fourth time, some in the opposition in Parliament "allow". " 
Why has the ODS even by the previously proposed boycotts. 
Ukraine will thanks to the rising prices in Erdgasimport by Russia economically ever more dependent on. For the relief of the price increases were even received credits, and the country also has the disposal of the Beltransgas, the owner of the country's leading gas pipeline, agreed with the Russians. In the background of the expectations of the opposition was then Ukraine wants to improve its relationship with the EU, after Lukashenko and other senior politicians for the anti-democratic classified political system in the EU ban. 
For a temporary smoothing the evaluation report the elections of the OECD, in which the emphasis on the positive movements, rather than the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of one third of the opposition candidates from elections -. 
However, the Schnellbericht the OECD on Monday, the campaign - so there should be no opposition in the press - and especially the fact that was not the opposition in the counting of votes. 
However, despite the opposition an improvement in the political system: Political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is even smaller confrontations with Moscow prepared by the recognition of the independence of the breakaway Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, the Ukraine on paper a Föderativstaat penalty, which are two areas for a month regarded as independent. 
"We have two steps forward and backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started," said Alexander Milinkevich to our story. 
From the vantage point of the opposition candidates in the presidential elections of 2006, is a continuation of desirable, although "the powerful fear got only an opposition parliament". 
The opposition has no plans Protestmaßnahmen given the results, but rather the need for economic reform the electorate. 
"We have many problems - the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting us in the distribution of getting in the way, but nevertheless, I have noticed that more and more people change, or even the older," said Milinkevich in insinuation that not even the meistunterstützte layer of the pensioners agree with the regime, whose sole credit for creating social security. 
"Thanks to the debt of the country and the rise in the trade deficit is merely a matter of time until the in the silence of a Friedhofes gemahnende" social security "to crumble," Milinkevich. 
Unlike the opposition politicians have called Russian observers the elections to be democratic. 
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States told the news agency Ria Novosti: "The people believe the deeds, not words". The lack of opposition is therefore a showcase for the maturity of the Belarusian voters. 
Brunetta, "from now on the work breakfast" 
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi are there drehbare doors for the import and exits of officials. 
Today will be the measure against those Schlaumeier in force, the only label and then during the hours Kaffeetrinken go. 
The new - Anti-Faulpelz-Gesetz "was today by Renato Brunetta, the minister for public administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the President of the Council of Ministers. 
">" Drehbare doors are a way to increase the efficiency by a higher turnout and more services, "Minister Brunetta. 
"Now starts a new era of accountability and transparency. 
This is bringing ", Brunetta once again. 
With the Palazzo Chigi ends the investiture in all buildings of the President of the Council of Ministers. 
Masi thinks this: "the choice of the drehbaren doors is of great symbolic value". 
The officials there was no resistance, assured the Secretary-General, "This process was supported by all the collaboration came from all sides." 
All in all, there is now no breakfast during working hours; Stop coffee or Croissant. 
'advice this with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 a.m. works wonders". 
During a meeting of the Oberausschusses of public administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione) 
Rome announced the minister, that "within three months of the Abwesenheiten of civil servants at 50%, which means that 60,000 people per year more at work here". 
He adds that it is necessary, the efficiency of the public administration Italy to strengthen 
"Whose Lohn-Dynamiken - so the minister - were in the last 10 years twice as large as the private sector and far above the rate of inflation". 
Meanwhile, have joined thousands of officials to prevent the Brunetta-Dekret within the framework of the Codacons Kremlin-backed appeal. 
"During high profile the minister for public service themselves with figures on lower Absenzen in the work, the Verbraucherzentrale - increasing the 'make lazy' continued unabated. 
In fact, have joined thousands of correct and valuable of public service ended the illegal standards of the decree to declare war. " 
In particular the regional administrative court (TAR) fought for additional financial compensation for occupational disease; so too will the planned expansion of the mandatory release of the sick Arbeiternehmers, while can be made which visits and other aspects of the innovations of the minister contested. 
Napolitano: "preventing accidents is crucial" 
Every day in Italy 2500 work accidents, three people died and 27 remain permanently disabled. 
For the year 2007 confirm the data from the Inail (European University nazionale contro gli infortuni sul could): that the deadly accidents in about 1,200. 
These figures illustrate the seriousness of a phenomenon, almost twice as many deaths caused by murders. 
Today, the Anmil (petition Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in every province of Italy the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work, so the attention of the social institutions and to draw media attention to this tragic situation. 
"The worrying, of Anmil propagandized data and the tragic news these days, confirm how crucial the issue of prevention in the workplace.", confirmed the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano in its communication to the President of the Amil (petition setting-up mutilati ed invalidi del could) Pietro Mercandelli. 
The head of state expresses his "big appreciation for the constant commitment to prevent jobs, for the protection of the injured workers, to support for the families of the victims and to raise awareness of public opinion". 
"Empörtes" Basta "has this, understandable when tragedies, relative to its size, some eddy in the media and commitment to the public. Confronted but the reality is often with dramatic events, which can be repeated in its momentum even". 
Napolitano is not in any case, that "it is also a resource problem: it must be invested significantly in education and information." 
A special significance in the numerous initiatives for a more direct realisation in Schulrahmen the part of the young people who feed the world. 
It is our duty, attention to this phenomenon and not by his social seriousness. We must bring a legislative norm in and would improve. 
For its part has stressed that the President of the chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed "as the phenomenon of Arbeitsbedingten deaths a pressing social emergency, which insulted the conscience of all of us and forcing all institutions to work to overwhelmingly rules, aimed to bring the problem to an end". 
"The data may seem to indicate a slight improvement, this does not, however, that is the number of deaths far too high," said President of the Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli. 
"We do not want these" positive trend "means less attention precisely what caused the tragedy." 
"As believe that, in fact, too little to tackle the phenomenon of accidents and we can through various actions to fight against it. 
More inspections are considered necessary - Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to the workers who already start at school ". 
"One more effort is needed - he is - what the communications and the awareness of public opinion. 
But above all is a bigger responsibility on the part of the employer of a phenomenon, a social event, ". 
Mercandelli came out to "the gradual deterioration of protection for the Arbeitsunfallopfer" to speak and condemned the "abolition of the social security system, which in the last few years we fight". 
"The goal is, therefore, give the workers a guarantee to insurance, so that the fate of the victim of a injury not to voluntary or accidental donation, which will be decided from time to time by a lawmaker, will depend on". 
MP3 players under indictment: risk of hearing impairment 
Loud music over a substantial period of time with portable Musikgeräten, such as Mp3-Player, to hear can into permanent Gehörschädigungen lead. 
This is asking the European Commission, which in a in Brussels today published report the opinion of the Csrseri (scientific committee about the present and recently identified health risks) quoted the EU. 
"From the report - a comment - it is clear that 5-10% of those who listen for at least five years a week longer than an hour a day noisy music with portable Musikgeräten, risking the permanent loss of hearing at risk". 
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people, who are usually combined Musikgeräte and mobile phones to high volume, her voice without knowing it irrevocably damage," Meglena Kuneva. 
"From the scientific findings - from the Eu - shows a clear risk, which is pressing for quick action. 
What really counts, it is the consumer to raise awareness and this information to public domain. 
We have given this scientific knowledge to look again at the already existing systems, so that they completely effective and to keep up with the new technology. " 
Brussels had asked the independent scientific committee because of the widespread use of portable Musikgeräte among young people. 
The "scientists - does the communication of the EU - confirm that rightly is concerned and that the Eu Commission together with the other Eu-Mitgliedern and stakeholders will now take the necessary measures will examine, children and young people to the noise comes from sustainable Musikgeräten and similar devices, to protect". 
There is in a European standard, which the level of noise of portable Musikgeräten to 100 decibels. The concern about the damage that can be too excessive noise. 
You can limit the damage, in which to solutions such as the reduction in the volume and the length of the Geräuschaussetzung bitten. 
In its report, the scientific committee of the Eu point out that, if the users of portable Musikgeräten only five hours per week noisy (louder than 89 decibels) music, so the legal limits already passed, which are on the maximum noise levels in the workplace. 
Those who music this border crossing, the complete loss of hearing within five years. 
The then to 10% of the users of these devices can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Eu. 
Roma, Alemanno gives the green light to the "Commission for the future of the capital" 
We are today, in March, so be over in June will stock. 
This is the Capitol Hill set course for the work of the "Commission for the future of the capital Rome". The Commission has this morning in the seat behind the Caracalla-Thermen taken. 
In six months, will prepare the President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission's leadership lines for Rome. 
Once the project will be completed, the city and the county council's analyses and projects, in June in the strategic plan for Rome with "official stamp" of Kapitols and the Lord Mayor ’ s Gianni Alemanno to present. 
"The Commission is absolutely independently and all cultural, social and political opinions are represented in it," - said Alemanno. "It will give proposals for a development plan for Rome give, whose political leaders of the city and the county council. 
There is no a distribution of powers, the will, a place to have, where there will be a great project for Rome. 
In March, its role will be completed and the Commission will go up again, as a project a certain end must have. 
In June, announced the Lord Mayor - we will present the strategic plan, in which the work undertaken by the Commission will use ". 
Who is the competence of the European Commission, since ermangele whose opinion to binding ermangele, the reciprocated Alemanno: "Everything depends on the work that will make the Commission and the quality of their proposals. 
If, as in France, the Attali-Kommission, provides high-quality results - and this will certainly be in Rome - will be their contribution is fundamental. 
Too often the policy with the day-to-day problems and emergencies, from time to time. 
We, however, want a longer period of time, in order to work with in a deeper perspective seriously to the development of Rome and the future of the city ". 
The Lord Mayor of Rome is very keen to clarify following "This Commission is neither a body, yet a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will be the Roman citizens not one cent cost and it will make us think. It will be the best minds the capital". 
According Alemanno "it is necessary to have a strategic plan, which is neither more nor static, our city a qualitative leap - she has really needed - to allow, and to pretend to be a common step in the future." 
A future, the Lord Mayor of Rome, "not only in the current Kommunalgrenzen confine, will look but much further," not only because of the role of Rome as metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as a future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean. " 
Obama - the first of anti-American President? A statement 
A well-known American politicians, the eager as independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-american President. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, through its decisions, the US economy was wiping out and with the befeindeten Islam terms (and even today as a private citizen does) ". 
The attacks on Obama are heating up, especially now, where the elections. 
A lady in Miami has written in an Internet page: "This person is ambitious. 
Obama is very insolent: he thinks he will get the highest office of a nation, received two black governors and five black senators has seen! ". 
Actually not to say these attacks but far; it is racist attacks and they do not answer the question of voters: will it be a good President? And then there are the polls; all say that will win Obama with a large margin. 
In this case are people who are in contact with the heart and not the head. 
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the south of the United States, wrote in its editorial in: only in the Wahlkabine we will know, who will be the real American patriot his voice. 
Here is a mentality of the US, the hidden was up to document. 
"What you want, then we will decide, for whom we will make our Kreuchen, whether for Obama or McCain." 
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will move from America to emigrate. 
Something never before heard, only now, where the success of the black candidate so safe. 
In all cases, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush. 
1500 individuals were asked: What mistakes Bush during his tenure? 89% have replied: the war in Iraq. 
America is changing. 
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent with a kick in the pants back home. 
In Iraq have 500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack. 
Still, Iraq remains to a majority of the weakness of Bush. 
The one who will take his place, faces a huge task. 
USA. The financial collapse leaves traces also journalists: in the newspapers can sense it the cuts. And many blame the internet, "murderers" of the printing press. 
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control concerning the future. 
Today nearly all journalists pessimistic about their future. 
But they to the information on responsible people do not really concerned about the overall credibility. 
They do not feel so alone. 
The problem for the American journalist is the money. 
The crisis of 2008 is for these journalists a crisis an economic model, which has been destroyed. 
The major problems through the Newsroom preempting cuts, of the area in which the editors at the newspaper. 
It is a problem that must be resolved, so the off journalists - if we want to avoid that the traditional journalism, as the big audience understand it, not much. 
A clear, but more complex pessimism achieves the American journalist. 
Six out of ten journalists and executive Seniors of the printing press are of the opinion that the journalism at national level on the wrong track. 
In the local area are in the Executives even to the 65%. 
Written vs. Broadcast. 
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine, in which direction the web. 
The main Verlagsgruppen gaining the way to the Internet, which by many as the "killer" is seen the written press. 
The "economic pressure," experienced journalists, has risen by up to 79%. 
The 500 Laden journalists have admitted that the new technology to want, in the hope of "it does something good for the journalism". 
The biggest rift in American journalism today between the editors of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them. 
56% of the editors at national level are sure their reporters share their values with them, while at local level only 23%. 
Some think it has with the "safety in the work" to do. 
The managers, who fear losing their jobs within three years to lose, 47% nationally. 
In the journalists are 30%). 
The theme of the "safe work" in team (our "editors', which will be released that Red.) is in the United States is always a hot topic. 
Only 13% of the journalists working under contract. 
In a vast nation, as it is the US, with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV-Sendern and Internet-Betreibern, offering employers as they want and there will be a question of a take it or leave it. 
The editors get very often very high wages, the editor can get sometimes only 10 euros per month, plus pension and insurance funds. 
As for the holiday, is the complexity matter: a certain amount of days in the first year, so many after the third, after a certain number of years 15 Ferientage to achieve. 
But the American journalist, it is, in the course of the year frequently "sick". 
It is a question of climate change. 
Unipol: GERICHT IM ROME: DANILO COPPOLA BLEIBT HAS GROTTAFERRATA 
The President of the second criminal division of the court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of the Immobilienmaklers reject this had asked, moved from Grottaferrata to Rome shifted. 
It is under investigation Coppola because Bankrot in the framework of the investigation into the Gegenvereinbarung in case of Unipol-Bnl. identified. 
In the course of the trial against him over the last week, has been transformed his release from house arrest in a Aufenthaltspflicht in Grottaferrata. 
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and with Gaetano Pecorella had requested that, to permit the estate agents, moved from the provincial town in a home in the capital. 
According to the court could him such transfers (against which the prosecutor had) allow his company to influence its society and to get to him anklagendes evidence. 
The elite is in danger 
The phenomenon had already issued a few days ago, as the Chamber of Deputies against the 700 Milliarden-Dollar-Sparpaket of the White House agreed: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in the to punish Wall Street than to save the economy. 
This confirmed yesterday's edition of the New York Times, which reported how divided the crisis in Laufschritt, the Republican Party, the Republican Party the increasingly divided in their old and moderate East Coast-Seele, which the state institutions and the business community and the neo-conservative, "which in Washington, and the financial world hostile reception and particularly in the south and centre of the states electorate. 
This part of the party owes his rise particularly the voice, I referred to above. 
This just now is only a small part of the big changes before the current economic earthquake or even already: not only in the United States, even in the West and perhaps even on this, will be affected by these. 
In both states, as well as in Europe seems the crisis which has long feared events to speed up what, in these new conditions finally take shape and come to light. 
The first of these phenomena is the recent discovery, the extraordinary renaissance of the state in connection with a sort of renationalisation of the economy. 
In fact, means the crisis the decline of banking and financial institutions, which have close connections to the outside and at a huge amount of assets of individuals, who live in one state. 
This means a direct political problem for governments: as it promised the families to do, what a great Wählermasse constitute. 
The crisis seems economically globally, political campaign is almost purely national. 
The political internationalism seems so itself put to one side and his right to have lost: the obvious proof is given by the EU, which, because of their division into various national and knows international conflicts, a common path to know. 
Therefore expect all now with the intervention of their own country; rescue plans, the new rules, and particularly of aid distribution fund: since the crisis increasingly serious, only the US in the economic situation without foreign aid to save. 
And apart from the resources they have to use it also this: no two to überwertende preconditions, in what otherwise no international organisation and no market in a similar way use. 
The new emphasis on the staatlich-nationale element, is in well with the ever-increasing importance, which recently in the economy with a closely related sector in: the territoriality. 
Paradoxical way it is now, as we were so moved into a networked Gesamtreich to be, in a kingdom of increasingly sophisticated technologies, non-material, realising that at once, as will depend on our future but more and more from the essential material things: water, harvest and oil. 
These can be transported, certainly all from one place to the other in the world, but with a narrowly defined piece earth - a territory. 
It is the one who has such a territory, another, in a ernteertraglosen, lives wasserlosen or from oil free area, have an advantage. 
I now turn to the second novelty, but the move. 
Who territory, who government, who says policy, saying leadership. 
In that sense, I think the financial crisis two converging phenomena. 
On the one hand there is the recognition of the need for the prestigious Leaderships, so the need for someone who knows how things. 
On the other hand there is now a wave of indignation at the current leaders, particularly those of the economy, as inadequate and full Schattenzonen increasingly showing. 
There is a deeper cuts, and in some ways even more worrying aspect: a loss of confidence, an impatience, a picture of the futility, a sense of distant, all to a whole class of managers of Western countries. 
It seems to find the perception among large sections of the population, that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but their Ideenwelt, their way of life, culture in the widest sense of the word, whose salary the majority always as foreign and outdated. 
The demand for leadership feeds therefore below a diverse but powerful movement the removal of the leaders and the old political establishment, this translates into unplanned "revolts" of the electorate and sudden change of collective heart condition last time, starting with the rise of the Conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, to the American politician for Bush (and perhaps also plays the victory of the rights in Italy here). 
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, magazines, intellectuals creditors, some would say its format, more and more communication problems and therefore less representative value on, which in the lower social strata of the West and is driven by the financial crisis deepened and to Überdimensionalität being driven. 
Given all this, it would be quite excessive, "the masses". 
The eyes but to keep track of is certainly not. 
The Superkleber, the walls due leaves 
The forces of gravity, thanks to a Klebstoffes to defeat and walls hochklettern to as Superman. 
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which now seems almost reached that goal. 
With one of only 2.5 qcm disgruntled Kleber it is the researchers have succeeded 100 kilos body on a senkrechten wall to fix. 
The STUDIO - has a US magazine, the results of the researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, of the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory published. 
Of the research team was invented material is a further development of already used in glues, what a special Kohlenstoffstruktur, named Kohlenstoff-Nanoröhrchen, use. 
"The principle of Klebers can be as a series to a pile of spaghetti rely tubes," said Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
The scientists were inspired by the feet of the Geckos, which is covered by mikroskopischen Härchen are, which the animal a perfect stop. 
The various materials such as glass Teflon and Schleifpapier carried out tests have shown that the new Kleber ten times stronger than the Haltefähigkeit feet of reptiles and "easily by the wall removed leaves," Liming Dai, researchers, the School of engineering at the University of Dayton. 
In MAUERN ENTLANGWANDERN? "This material could as deciduous glue between used", Liming Dai. 
About as Spiderman to walls emporzugehen? Perhaps, but the researchers think more reminiscent of a less fascinating benefits, such as the combination of electrical appliances, because the Nanoröhrchen are as head of heat and electricity. 
Other areas of application could be in the area of space. 
For the moment the Superhelden therefore still waiting. 
The ANDERE ART DER FORSCHUNG - including the University of Berkeley, California, is a new Kleberart. 
In an article in the American Chemical Society show the Californian scientists a glue from Mikrofasern the as hair by movement on a surface itself by dust and it is always a perfect liability. 
Medicines: never with fruit juice pack 
Beware Grapefruit-, Orangen- and apple juice. 
These drinks, which are consumed by their engaging quality and their Vitaminreichtums particularly in the summer, can cause serious health problems, if they have to be taken with certain essential drugs, since they have to the admission by the body in an extreme way. 
David Bailey, Professor University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points to the risk comes as fresh fruit juices in conjunction with medications. In the framework of the 236. Arranged the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he suggested the alarm again: a glass pay attention, Orangen- or Grapefruitsaft, in order to reduce the absorption of certain vital drugs that are eliminated these and the health of patients. 
Grapefruitsaft was already under suspicion, responsible for the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, Antiasthmatika, Herzkreislaufmedikamente, anxiolytischer and neurological resources, up to toxic levels. 
Medicines HAS GEFAHR - same agency the product had warned in a report two years ago, doctors and patients about the risks of this mix, and to see what is being consumed in conjunction with resources such as Diazepan or Metadon drunk. 
It IS NOT ‘ GRAPEFRUIT - according to the experts also contain juice and apple juice, which the medicines holdback. 
The list of the fruit juices gehemmten agents. 
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, the director of the Università owes di treasury securities climbed: "such results will usually immediately to the various international manufacturer, which are free to change the consumer information. 
Therefore, we should always read the leaflets and, if there are still ambiguities, to have no fear of a pharmacist or to ask their doctor, "said the expert from the Ansa-Agentur. 
Wirtschaftsnobelpreis goes to Paul Krugman 
The Wirtschaftsnobelpreis is the Americans Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the location of economic activity. 
Of the 55 years old Krugman is a Neokeynesianer, of the University of Princeton teaches and known for his regular article for the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of economic and catches up by the Bush administration. 
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of the Enron-Zusammenbruchs, had claimed Krugman in an editorial in the New York Times, the second event is crucial for the history of the United States as the attacks. 
A prediction, not the little controversy in response and has the economists still years later, but today as completely is correct. 
"I am surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals in the framework of the collapse of Enron or Worldcom from the public eye," said Krugman end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi by the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank is Krugman a "economist of value", but also a Banalisierer with a "very aggressive style, particularly against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration." 
Open Office, it seems the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package 
The day of publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 is; the Open Source Software wins than strengthening substitute for Microsoft's Office a growing number of users, both at home and in the office, both in leisure Schaffenden as well as in public administration. 
After a year of hard work by the voluntary developers, which SUN Microsystems is monitored, the new Open Office now with some new features the audience: in addition to a revised and now spartanischer adding considerable Anfangsmenü, is now a fundamentally ensured achieved compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x, and support for the new ODF (Open Document format) 1.2 format, the latest Standard-ISO version. 
Eight against was also to compatibility with Microsoft Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice. 
Interesting are also some new features, as the, which makes it possible to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, for example, sending via email facilitates. To import the possibility PDF files Grafikbearbeitungsmodule and to preserve the original appearance of the side. 
We can also "hybrid" generate PDF-Dateien extend the diagram of the Adobe-Formats order the elements of a table and a Textverarbeitung system. 
The cooperation is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now mehrhändig by various users, which conflicts with changes be avoided; in the case of the Textverarbeitung system will each own a Frabe allocated, so that a better Korrekturverfahren to guarantee. 
Some companies are to publish different functions of OpenOffice publication on the Internet (on the cloud), while in the coming weeks, the final outcome will. 
The Italian version is on the, not the download available to: http: / / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.html. texts is the English version, which has since Friday at the event. 
Ausser for Windows and Mac OS is the programme for the operating system Linux available. 
To question the Installations-CD home or at the office send. 
Can the charge to the spread of the programme in the private budgets, so it is also in the field of Business, where could OpenOffice the great chance: after all, are already have a different units of public administration and schools to OpenOffice. 
Indeed, there is no lack in a Trainings-Angebot, which means an aid for small and medium-sized businesses, and therefore even commercial opportunities. 
Openoffice is composed of five main Bestandteilen together: Writer, the Word corresponding Texterstellungsprogram; Calc, the Tabellenprogram, which aims to achieve a replacement of Excel aims; Impress, for preparing presentations with Powerpoint; Dbase for doing of data banks to replace the better-known Access; and, most recently Draw, a Grafikmodul. 
The objectives for the year 2008 it is 5 million downloads to achieve - an objective in already reached 3 million and 600 thousand also easily outnumbered. 
Also Kohl positive tests and thus the fourth doping case

Italy, "the former country of immigrants has become recently one of the best countries for immigrants become," which will be included only with reluctance. 
Making this Belpaese a nation of racists? Asks the New York Times in a lengthy article, the subject of racism in Italy is devoted to and from the case of the young, from Burkina Faso America Abdul William Guibre, which is a month ago in Milan was murdered after a packet of biscuits the theft of. 
The case of the case is what The Times as "paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and job opportunities", and yet still the highest degree of anti-immigrationistischen Sentiments and the most support of the Northern League is ". 
As confirmation of the growing tension between Italy and immigrants invokes the Times to other episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and present Volturno. 
And not only that. 
The new, the Northern legislation put forward against immigration and to speed up the deportation of illegal immigrants will as a sign of climate change in Italy. 
A movement, which the Pope and the president: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope during a meeting at the Quirinal for interaction between church and state to combat racism". 
Students victims of up to 900-Euro per room high rental prices 
The market for homes for students knows no crises. 
According to the latest investigation of Sunia, the Mietergewerkschaft, can a Einzelzimmer a students up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome. 
"This phenomenon has already very serious adopted. Whole numbers of students lose so effectively their right to study, because their families are not in a in this amount to support" - the leaders of the Sunia, Laura Mariani - "in these cities leads the major demand by the students of distorting the market, which has also undermined the other inhabitants. 
Moreover, the most Mietangebote a series of offences: free Treaties, lack of registrations, without Mietpreisgrenze, impromptu Untermieten. 
For the Sunia there is the need for exceptional measures which, in a review of the taxation to lower Mietpreisen lead. 
On closer inspection of the investigation reveals that in Milan, a restful place in quarter Brianza some 450 euro; and a Einzelzimmer begins with 650 euros (in the quarter gang Nere) and ends with 800 euros in the quarter Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or even 900 euros in the quarter Vittoria. 
In Florence costs a couchettes on average 350 / 400 euros, a room 700. 
In Bologna, where the students in the quarters at the university, is 250 / 280 euros for a couchettes needed, 370 to 500 for a Einzelzimmer. 
In Rome, the prices in the areas around the Uni in about 600 euros for a Einzelzimmer, 450 for a couchettes in a Doppelzimmer. 
Little more are rents in neighbourhoods to the other universities in Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà. 
Only those in outskirts can save money: 300 euros for a couchettes and 450 euros for a Einzelzimmer in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters. 
In Naples, needed one 300-450 euro for a couchettes, for a room is the price of between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei. 
In Bari costing a restful place 250-350 euro, a Einzelzimmer at least 350. 
In the smallest towns are prices lower, but they have a greater impact in the urban economy. 
In the city, in which the phenomenon of the lease to non-European students more is, as in Perugia, there is even a further anomaly: a rents, which rose 30% above average of foreign students. 
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso - the towns close their historic cinemas 
The historic cinemas to close because of the beneficiary Multiplexkinos. 
"A city with no cinemas is a blind city, as a face no eyes." 
This image of the film director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect as now in the large urban centres, and in the provinces. 
The process of exclusion cinemas, which began with the birth of large Multisaalkomplexe in the periphery, in the long term death Einsaalkino centre. A process that seems not only inevitable and irrevocable, but also a cultural crime. 
Are mostly historical sites reminders, "it is like to lose a friend, which has made it a little streets full of emotion," the director of the film "Japan--devoted Cinema Paradiso" him 20 years ago, Oscar and the high price of Cannes. It is the story of a Vorstadtkinos and whose nostalgia, what it is, in a well for ever lost cinema world to live. 
The figures, which Anec, the central Gewerbeverband, speak a clear language: in the last five years have had to reach the vast quantity of 316 traditional cinemas; this bill paid most the lion ’ s share of the cinema in the main cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo. 
To the most affected regions included the Emilia-Romagna with 82 of cinemas, followed by the Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41. 
This is evidence that are the main culprits the Multiplexkinos, because it is precisely these three regions, in which there was the largest number of this modern cinema registered: with 195 in the last five years the Lombardy which lists, 81 are both in Tuscany in Emilia-Romagna. 
"The business has developed in an irrational manner," Paolo Protti, the President of the Anec, "it is useful that are also new structures, but is the maintenance of the already exist, because it includes a room in the city, they are not all its habitués willing, instead of the old one Multiplexkino in the periphery. 
And here there is the lack of budget for the fund of Gewerbeverbands äußer eight states: the state's debt burden is 10 million. 
It is a disgrace from an ethical standpoint, that the government is not the existing laws. 
The sector to be, between 16 and 18 million per year of needs ". 
What is interesting is the case of Bologna, Italy's first city, which, because of the fears of the old cinemas, has decided that an agreement between the community and the Anec to protect; it is the first such agreement in Italy, which aims to traditional cinemas to protect and support, and both in the historic centre, as well as in the periphery. 
Among the expected measures are also tax Bevorteilungen for the Kinobetreiber and benefits for the audience on the transport: it will be allowed in the verkehrslimitierten areas of the centre to drive and also to lower parking fees to park. 
"It is a good initiative," Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that will join other cities our example and further new concepts. 
Certainly but we also need a better audio and Videoausstattung, in order to facilitate against the superpower of the Multiplexsäle something because, after all, is the audience of more demanding. 
The defence of the traditional cinemas for me is always a topic: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, place my childhood and youth, was the tipping point that moved me, "'s cinema Paradiso", even though I for 10 years with the idea had been playing. 
For 25 years, I live in Rome; if I Rialto or on Quirinale in the Via Nazionale vorübergehe, where I saw so many different emotions, but I side on, not the staubbedeckten posters to see. 
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro 
"Mayor of Gioia Tauro was prepared to adjust the decisions of the community against the interests of the Mafiagruppe Piromalli constricted. 
The accusations the Bar of the Antimafia-Behörde Kalabriens against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in Mafiageschäfte are severe. 
In was handcuffed also Gioacchino Piromalli, the elder mediator between the clan and public administration, and nephew, the lawyer, which bears the same name as the boss of the clans, has already been sentenced for involvement in criminal organisations the Mafia, then to a total of $10 million. 
"Any sort of moral and legal standard to mount," write the lawyers, "the two local administrations decided, the lawyer Piromalli money for advice activities to pay." 
"So it was the Mafiagruppe possible has been made, so the judges - in any formal way in town halls and the policy of public administration co-determination." 
The President of the regional committee Kalabriens Agazio Loiero annihilating not that it in its region "anything but is an exception, on links from local administrations and organized crime." There are places where, in the concentration of Mafia is greater than in other sectors, which are such links inevitable. 
But there are also local politicians, the pressure from the 'Ndrangheta resist: heroes who survived a perfect. " 
The arrests of morning follow those last July, was beheaded, according to the police in the clan Piromalli. 
Since the end of the last April was the town council of Gioia Tauro been dissolved, but already in 1991 - and also because of alleged ties between organized crime and the local administration - were the local politicians to councils has been removed from councils. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, elected after the run-off from May 2006 to head the Mitterechtskoalition been elected. 
He shouted scandal as the police the dissolution of the parish council ordered. 
He belangte out in the Vizeinnenminister Marco Minniti, which he accused, invented everything from strategic political reasons. The judges but explain in connection with the arrest warrant this morning that the Piromalli-Clan it had even dared to call for a change of A3-Projektes. 
From a bugging in connection with the inquiry into the case Dal Torrione, has shown a willingness to accommodate the aspirations of a company, which as a representative of the large group at the Piromalli - were the measures of the public administration identical with the interests of this clans.

If the energy from waves, are suddenly the Great at 
It is not a non-exhaustive money source, which covers over 70% of the surface of the planet and only now seem to understand that the large energy companies in the world. 
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources to the now all, and also to occupy, as giants like Chevron. 
The possibility of energy from the movements of the sea to win, we have for 70 years into consideration and investigated; not accidentally stepping up these studies since the first oil crisis. 
As the price of oil by 1980 caved vergas the idea of marine energy, but now pressing environmental organisations and the increase in oil prices to new impetus in this sector. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated that 15% of the Global Call energy needs from the Ozeanwellen produced energy could be covered. 
That would mean that figure the by nuclear plants produce energy. 
Be added the currents and tides. 
Giants in the attack. 
The first firm, which is now on the marine energy, is Enersis, signed in 2005 a contract for the construction of a power station in northern Portugal. 
As the news was published seemed a revolutionary step to act. 
Two years later, there are now more and more companies in the traditional energy sector who rely on marine energy. 
"Chevron analyzed these technologies", the spokesman of one of the giants of well-known company in The Wall Street Journal - and bets the possibility of working with us. " 
It is to obtain a licence by the American Energiekommission, which is needed to launch a project off the coast of Alaska. 
This is not to be underestimated as a sign, particularly when you consider that in Alaska still oil through the United States and President Bush recently the plans for new drilling. 
In addition to Chevron are also the firms Verdant Power genome map generated from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, in the new industry invest; are the details not known, observers by a rising interest. 
Still items technologies. 
Experts speak of a still on its technology, not least, because there have not been clarified nor the recent doubts from environmentalists. 
So far are projects such as Portugal and also Scotland rather minor dimension and seem to be no serious environmental problems. 
In order to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with far greater impact on the environment. 
There are several possibilities: Ocean Power as using a system of interlinked put observation buoys. 
The burst of the waves, which the buoys and knelt down, within the swimmer on Kolben and magically appear in hydraulic pressure. 
This is a Turbine, see what is a generator. 
The electricity will be sent out on Unterwasserleitungen to coast. 
Until now, there are four planned facility of this kind, which only added to the government approval. One part of the energy could also for military installations. 
Verdant Power produces but already energy for a Warenkaufhaus and a Parklatz EES unterseeischer turbines in the East River from New York. 
The Wasserbewegungen during the tides drives the turbines, which is fuelled by the emerging Drehbewegung the generator. 
According Verdant has been waiting for to use a long queue of potential clients on the necessary authorisations for these sources. 
The waves, then the tides. 
A special interest earned according to the Institute for Stromgewinnungsforschung stage just the potential, in the tides. 
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, are the tides but better predict as Windströmungen, the sun and the waves and, therefore, a more reliable source of power. 
The tidal energy is what states like New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal states, already 7.5 million dollars in 2008 to invest - for 2009 are already planned up to 35 million.
