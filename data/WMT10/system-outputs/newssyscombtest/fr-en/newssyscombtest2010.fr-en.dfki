The shortage of snow in mountain worries the mountain hotel
The deserted tracks do not put problem only to the farmers of ski tow.
Lack of Snow dissuades the people from reserving their visits at the ski in the hotels and the pensions.
De ce fait, discovering Chambers free for every date in winter, including Noël and the New Year, is always possible.
We have visits on our website.
Internet users skim through the offers, they ask for the prices but they do not dare to commit to reserving for the time being.
And if they call us, they ask immediately if snow will be or" he "of the mud at ", has declared Martin Jandura, farmer of the portal of information Spindl.Info.
If one wants to pass Špindlerv Mlýn the New Year of his dreams, better is worth no more too many to hesitate to reserve.
If one gives the priority to the economies and that the quality of accommodation comes only afterwards, then one can try still to wait a few more days.
Hotel owners of propose for the moment only stays of a week for the.
I think that they are going to try still a moment of putting them, but them cèderont them also and will accept shorter periods.
And afterwards the number of Chambers free rapidly is going to reduce", has valued Jandura.
The agency of tourism Ingtours du Vrchlabí proposes also still beds of free for all the winter periods.
Week of interests us the most for the time being, it is completely not sold.
It remains still of free, let's say, half of Chambers in our offer.
It is why already we have prepared any stays of last minute Noël less expensive", has indicated the manager of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The agency of tourism of the Vrchlabí can also propose the New Year to Krkonose, but there are places free.
The fourteen first days of February leave tout aussi well, the remaining wintry stays are sold averagely.
This year, the interest in the stays of winter has negatively been influenced by the fact that there is not always snow at Krkonose.
The people wait for it to start to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the winter at the mountain without snow.
If the tracks are covered for the week, Noël also will be complete", thinks Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupation of the hotel Horizont at Pec pod Snkou is lightly superior to last year.
One has an improvement of almost five per cent.
He remains us some last places for the new year as for.
There is a great interest during the vacations of January of the Polish ones and February is sold well also", informs Karel Rada, manager of the best hotel of.
The hotel Omnia close to the central car park of Jánské Lázn is also complete at eighty pourcent for the period of the.
On the contrary half the beds remain empty at Noël in the most recent hotel of Jánské Lázn.
This year, we have pleasantly been surprised by the month of January, that we have already sixty per cent of occupation at the present time.
February is a bit weaker for the moment but as soon as the snow is going to fall, the interest in the visits in the will grow still probably has indicated the manager of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
Hotel owners of must not hope though for more snow.
Thursday it will be cooler and if there are rainfalls, they should be snowy in mountain regions.
But thereafter the time should warm up, informs Jií Jakubský of the station of Hradec of the Czech hydrométéorologique institute.
United States: Repetition is mother of wisdom
It becomes even comic, assiduous effort with which Barack Obama, direct the reputation of sage, reproduced the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan question, that he considered itself as pretty simple.
When he has ended up letting his doctrine so burningly waited for sweat, it has proved that it had copied out it to the carbon paper from the Iraqi script of Bush of three years ago.
Not happy to use even several times in the text the expression "as in Iraq", he has not hesitated, moreover, to use the title of the speech of Bush of January 2007 as part of its own speech: " new way forward"
At the same time, personally he has criticized the idea of Bush of sending reinforcements in a new in one Iraq consumed by civil war as being "irresponsible and a disastrous decision in its effects. "
The next months though have shown that the strategy of Bush, which emanated of the recommendations of the commanders of countryside, was the only one possible and susceptible of to such an extent that the newspapers at the present time do not speak at all of Iraq.
This has not improved the reputation of Bush, that says, objectively talking, it has left to his successor a final situation much more favourable than one could not hope.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan the miracle is going to recur
It is again the commanders of campaigns that have asked to him for an increase of the military quota, notably the major of the Afghan operation, the general Stanley McCristal, who has even severely criticized the reluctances of the White House in spite of the habits of subordination.
He asked for 40 000 men in order to be able to make the situation more favorable.
The president has hesitated for three months but for want of a better option, he has at least swindled the general of 10 000 soldiers.
It has succeeded in extirpating the promise of 5 000 additional ones on behalf of Europe, even if he counted on 10 000 originally.
What takes the most problems to the whole strategy of Obama seems to be his intention of withdrawing the armies from Afghanistan of here 18 months and of finishing all this process of here three years. the whole Obama doctrine takes more questions that it does not supply with answers.
A lot doubt the fact that an increase of half will take the same results that the increase in Iraq.
In spite of the fratricidal wars over recent years, the Iraqi society is well organized relatively and its leaders honor the agreements.
Afghan situation does not distance itself by the exact opposite - one can not count on anybody and no treaty is respected.
In these conditions, difficult of preparing Afghan strengths of security, accustomed to changing leader from day to day according to what sorts them out.
Political institutions, although founded officially, will remain only powder to the eyes behind which are going to proliferate the patriarchal ethnic relationships.
Balancing the interests of the diverse ethnic groups considering the lack of light as for the relations, which are still complicated by the Pakistani influences and Iran, is singularly complex.
Even the foundation of a "state prompt to acting", which is the goal of base of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The worldly horizon of the strategy of Obama makes perplexed throughout his determination.
In the last eight years the situation in has made only to worsen and it is presently at the edge of chaos.
Only a heart purely romantic and out of the reality can be persuaded that the small soldiers sent in the uproar on the war in seen of their "prompt return at home" are going to bring there a miracle.
Of a political point of view, to define a date for the withdrawal of the troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban ones will consider it as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last summit of the NATO has shown that the will of the Europeans to participate in military operations in directs itself to the negative.
The European political ones do not know nor do not want to explain to their voters in whom the safety in Germany or in Italy is related to a war in the mountains of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of altering the situation radically is the evolution of events linked to.
If the situation continues deteriorate and that the reinforced sanctions do not have effect on the Iranian ones, the American ones will meet themselves in view of the very difficult question of a resolution of the problem by the use of military force.
One will have to reply to it for example at the moment where, according to Obama, America will turn to the victorious one withdrawal of troops.
Solution of this kind will lead though to a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Obama is the fact that it remains three years up to presidential elections and consequently it remains still enough time so that he works on a new strategy, to the case where this him would be revealed to be a flop.
The leaders of the bank Goldman Sachs will not receive premiums anymore in spot cash
The leading employees top put of the American bank will not receive more this year of premiums in cash.
The society has announced it to react to extensive criticism as for its wage practices.
Group of 30 leaders of the main will receive actions instead of money, which they will not be able to resell before five years.
The leaders will be able to be deprived of the actions if they would take too many risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs lands thus in mind from line of the effort aiming at connecting the payments with performances in the long term to Wall Street.
I suppose that Wall Street is pretty conscious of the global sense which it is needed to take, has indicated the previous banker of investment Douglas Elliott of the society JPMorgan
The worry is in the details, it has added.
The bank Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after him to be left aside nearly 17 billion dollars for bonuses towards the first three quarters of this year.
For the year underway, the total amount of premiums will probably overtake 20 billion dollars in spite of the measure announced today, according to the agency Reuters.
With arrival of the financial crisis the strong premiums in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in a good number of countries.
Great Britain has announced Wednesday which she intended to affect of a unique tax of fifty pourcent bankers ' bonuses of the bankers overtaking 25 000 books.
France prepares similar measures.
This year the women have obtained Nobel from the Nobel Prize in all areas apart from the physical
They are five women a record number, that have received today in Stockholm the hands of the king of Sweden Charles XVI the Nobel Prize Nobel in technical disciplines and in literature.
Beside the four scientists there was the writer also German of from Romania Herta Müller.
American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider have received the price Nobel of medicine for their research in the domain of the chromosomes with their compatriot Jack Szostak.
The price of chemistry has been awarded to the Israeli one Ada Jonath with the American ones Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz to have clarified the structure and the duty of the ribosomes
The last winner has received the price Nobel of economics, the American one Elinor Ostrom with his compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of the economic gouvernance.
The only technical discipline that has not had winner this year has been the physics.
This price has been replaced today in to scientists Charles Kao for her research in the field of optical fibres and George Smith avecWillard Boyle for their invention of the fleas CCD, which are presently to the basis all digital cameras photo numeric, fax or glasses astronomical.
Every winner has received the Nobel qualification, the coin and the certificate of acquisition of the financial rewards.
This affects Swedish kronor in each category. (about 1,1 million euros)
If one of them comprises several winners, they will share the reward among them.
The very waited Prize Nobel of the peace already has been replaced this afternoon in Oslo in Norway to in the US President.
This, in his speech, has recognized the controversial nature of his reward since it is only at the beginning of its path and that moreover it is in two wars - in Iraq and in Afghanistan. at the head of a committed country
In defence of its policy it has added that in certain situations the war is essential to obtain the peace, even if the price is put up.
The minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus has invited him the Castle
The president Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning the minister of the finances Eduard Janota, which balances his stay to the government because of his disagreement with the budget of the State for next year such that he has been voted by Parliament
One considers that the budget and maybe also the position of the office will be to the agenda of meeting on Friday.
Klaus criticizes also the budget.
According to it, the deficit is too important, what digs the crisis of public finances more.
It is the presidential spokesperson Radim Ochvat that has informed of the meeting.
Janota wants to discuss afterwards of his office on Monday with the prime minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget that is going to be subjected to the signing of, it is a deficit of 163 billions of kroner that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the bedroom of the deputies has validated on Wednesday the suggestions of the left as for to transfers of money and has increased the payments of the officials, of the working of the social services and of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government reproached to the suggestions of the democratic social ones is it that they were going to increase in indirect way the deficit of the budget.
For this reason, a violent disagreement has been born between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other hand, disagreement that questions the future of in the cabinet of that had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the SSD and the Party of the Green.
The criticisms assert that the budget, such than it has been voted for by the deputies, removes the packet of measures of savings passed by the government and that owes according to confining it the indebtedness of the State.
Klaus, which can ratify the law on the state budget but who nothing obliges, has declared today during a breakfast of discussions with contractors, who the policies have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "irréfrénable deficiency" of public finances.
At present there is not solution, according to it, favorable.
Only a strong government could bring an improvement, if it could rely on a consensus of the political parties, according to the president.
The president of the ODS Mirek Topolánek has indicated that the budget is astounding and that the government should question its future existence.
The vice-president of the ODS Petr Neas has declared to the TK that the idea of an administrative office supported by the SSD, the ODS and the Greens does not work obviously anymore.
In its response, the Prime Minister Fischer has qualified such words of "drastic verdicts".
Head of the Jií Paroubek has reacted to Topolánek, saying about kronor that the deficit of the budget prepared for this year by previous government of is astounding and that it is going to overtake 200 billion.
Wednesday already, the SSD has described as success the ratification of the budget of for the next year.
People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman is going to play Mandela in the new film of Clint Eastwood
In spite of criticism of the fact that the principal roles are played by actors are American, the South African ones assert that the new film of Hollywood Invictus - Unconquered will expose to the world many things on the country, its fighting and its success.
The history talks about sport, of relationships among races and of Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, American actor rewarded to the Oscars, incarnates the film on the lives of, indefatigable fighting against the system racist of the apartheid in South Africa and first black president.
Freeman has declared, that it is a Mandela aged of ninety-one years that has asked to him to incarnate it in the film.
Matt Damon plays an important role.
I have told to him: "If I must incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally.
The actor aged of seventy-two years who has been rewarded of a price for his role in the drama Milion Dollar Baby of Clint Eastwood situated in the middle of the boxing, for example, has incarnated the leader of a movement against the become slavery itself slave a shadow of the US president, indeed same God in the film but never somebody of yet living and of also important for so many people that is it Mandela.
The ex-man of South Africa has been imprisoned 27 years for his fierce work in favor of the end of apartheid in South.
It has been replaced at liberty in 1990 and has become president of the country for four years.
In 1993 it has been awarded to him the price Nobel of the peace.
Invictus is a Latin word means unconquered and it is the title of a poem of the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge, it was to speak as it.
The film tells the true history of the linked efforts of Nelson Mandela and of the captain of South African rugby team François to unify the country. The recently elected president Mandela knows that his resteencore country and always divided racially and economically after the apartheid.
It is persuaded of being able to unite its people by the sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders with at global level.
South African team will end up progressing in World Cup in 1995.
Freeman has worked A few years ago to take history of on large screen.
I did not have other purpose to play otherwise this role in order to approach it the most of the fact, has said Freeman.
The greatest challenge for me it was of course of speaking as it
The actor has declared that if it and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, of dinner with it, of being in behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important for it was of it to shake hands.
I have realized that while I shake hands you, I recover of your energy, it is passed on and I had the impression to know how you feel, it has said.
It is important for me of trying to become another person.
Matt Damon works in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national team of rugby in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor has declared that it had six months to get ready for a role in the hard middle of rugby.
For it, his first meeting with at his home has been a great surprise.
I remember while I have sounded the house at the door, it has opened me and the first thing that I have told to Francois Pienaar has been: 'I seem much bigger in the film'.
In spite of the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus under the crook of the filmmaker has received positive opinions and one talks even about ambitions for the Oscars.
The criticism of films Todd McCarthy of the daily newspaper has summarized his appreciation in these words: "It is a very good history, a very well realized film."
In the evaluations of films on the site rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 % of positive assessments.
The mystery of will to is resolved: the Russian ones tested a rocket
One has been able to observe a strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin above Norway.
Russian Ministry of defence has admitted only yesterday to have tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from the Norwegian border.
The launching still has been though a failure and the missile of type " Bulava " that originally had to be the pride of Russian army becomes progressively the nightmare of Russian generals and of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His presence repeated during the tests of the rocket has not had the effect discounted on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, is Bulava has not flown away, or it is damaged itself in full flight.
Russian newspapers talk about " Bulava " as of the "missile that does not fly"
A missile that does not fly but that sparkles
Trial took place early use took place initially in a normal way.
It is only at the end of the flight that further damage were again on the equipment.
It is obviously the motor of the third floor of the rocket that has exploded.
This time, " Bulava " has flown away from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij that sailed under the surface of the Sea Blanche.
Type of missile can be precisely put to fire a boat on the move and submerged
It is the reason why the mysterious light above the Norway caused by a subject wheel not identified precisely has likely been it by a defective " Bulava ".
Of the rest, the Norwegian ones have not doubted an instant that it is a matter of a Russian rocket.
The arguent generals that this time, one can absolutely not talk about failure.
The two first floors of the resisted rocket have resisted and the damage has affected only the third.
In the previous cases, the motors have experienced shortcomings on of the floor.
Even if any of the test launches has not happened without tears, the direction of the Ministry of defence considers that only six on thirteen have been chess.
Rate of success of nearly 50 % fills therefore the general with optimism and they maintain therefore always that a day " Bulava " will fly without problems and that she will take even ten hypersonic nuclear kernels of a total weight of 1.15 thunder.
The legendary Fetissov has signed at 51 years a contract of a year with the CSKA Moscow
The defender legendary Viatcheslav Fetissov will appear again in a professional match to 51 years.
The first-rate antiques of the world, Olympic champion and guardian of the are going to lend assistance to his team of Moscow in the need and will make its entry probablementdéjà during the match of Friday match against.
Fetissov, which has put thin to his career at forty years in 1998, is for the hour the president of the CSKA.
After the wound of we have of need urgency of another defender.
Fetissov takes itself regularly and is agreed to help equips it.
Still we must adjust a few details to the form, declares the coach of the club Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the agency AP.
It has not been clarified if the comeback of from the legendary hockey player will concern only one match.
I think that Fetissov is one of those that are capable of reinforcing the mental one of other players, has indicated Nyemtchinov.
According to AP, in the case of a return on the ice, Fetissov becomes thus a Russian professional player the oldest hockey the most aged.
In NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe has played a whole season for Hartford and has obtained 15 aims and 26 assistances.
The most aged of the first-rate quintet Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best players from hockey and among those having the biggest success.

In the second part of his career, it gathered the tributes also in NHL that by two times it has kept the Stanley Cup.
It is a member for 2001 of the Temple of the fame of the hockey.
Hyundai has listened to the trade unions and cancels every hour additional
The direction of the factory Hyundai of Nosovice has started agreed with the trade unions to cancel every hour additional.
It is precisely because of the extra hours frequent that the trade unions have declared a state of emergency on Monday.
The spokesperson Petr Vank of the factory Hyundai has confirmed it.
The direction wants still to start though agreed with the unions towards a Saturday worked this year still.
We can not renounce our plan of production, it is essential, it is for that voluntary additional hours have been proposed on Saturday, knowing December that two teams would be 19th, has declared Vank.
The site Sedmika.cz has indicated that the society has proposed a bonus Czech skr 400 Czech crowns to the wage earners who would be part of the team of Saturday.
It will be attributed also has postériori for the day worked on 28.
Society, according to, has decided to change the way of motivating its employees in return for additional hours.
Or they receive the addition to the hours besides, or they can put a replacement leave on 28 and to prolong thus their parties of end of year aindiqué Vank.
On top of that all employees present on Saturday will receive a compensation for the expenses of transport and for their lunch.
Considering the fact that the extra hours were the most urgent and the warmest in the comments and the claims of the unions as wage earners who have ceased spontaneously the production last week, the direction has made the immediate decision of canceling every hour additional for the month, has declared Vank.
Until last week the employees of the car factory were forced to work nearly daily two hours more and more of their eight hours.
The unions intend to cancel the state of strike after signature of the agreement.
The next negotiation between the direction of car factory and trade unions owes to take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader has declared Wednesday that they were ready to cease the state of strike in event agreed on their demands and of signing of a common.
Situation in the plant has towered last Wednesday when almost 400 employees have put themselves spontaneously in strike because of incessant additional hours.
They protested also against the bad conditions of pay and of alleged hazings.
The direction has defended itself with the fact that the wage earners had to work in supplement to fill the imperatives of car production with car.
During announcement of the strike on Monday, the trade unions also have asked to what the wage earners having ceased the production are not subjected to any penalties.
Trade unions ask to the society to reduce the time spent to additional hours at least.
Furthermore, they want this year a payment of approximately eur 5 000 (209 € about) for these.
The self-propelled factory Hyundai of Nosovice uses presently 2 000 people.
It has started up the production in series last year in.
It has produced 80.000 vehicles until of this year about, having a capacity of production of cars 200 000 per annum.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on the also " enduring " HIV viruses
Team of Czech and Germans scientific tests new combinations that can slow down the proliferation of the HIV virus in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it acts also on the virus that already have developed an immunity to the medicines.
This reality takes, in some cases the upper hand on the fact that the combination did not act so intensely on the current variants of the virus so well as certain medicines already available.
Curing AIDS at the present time is not possible.
One can nevertheless prolong radically the life of the patients via a mixture of medicines that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
Their consumption leads though to a number of side effects.
Furthermore The repression of this increase has the development of what one calls of the resistant viruses on which the medicines do not have effect anymore as effect.
The work of the experts of three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the, the VŠCHT of Prague and University of opens the way to a way of making in view of the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that from the called substances metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are an assembling of boron, of hydrogen, of carbon and of cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a way different from all the medicines used until now and it is why they could surmount the problem of resistance.
Work of researchers leads them to discover new substances " improved ", on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their links on the proteins of the virus.
The metalocarboranes have a single three-step structure: two multiple cages side are formed by the atoms of boron, of hydrogen and of carbon and connected by an atom, in this case the safe cobalt.
Virus deceptive and resistant.
The protease of the HIV is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the lifecycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by the protease of the HIV birth of mature infectious particles of the virus would not be.
If one stops the protease of the HIV, one will stop also the propagation of the virus in the body of the patient, explain the researchers in a press release published by the Institute of organic chemistry and of biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences in the.
In their works published in the scientific journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (cf. picture) are connected by a short organic link, which is systematically modified afterwards.
A bit weaker but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on the proteases of the HIV has been tested in test tubes as on his resistant variants, obtained next to contaminated patients by the HIV.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of the metalocarboranes is not so loudly as on the clinical medicines, though it does not weaken on the versions resistant against which the current medicines are often ineffective.
The metalocarboranes, with their single action mechanism and other assets as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications are therefore interesting combinations to examine more to head for the development of efficient medicines against the HIV, asserts Pavlína ezáová, manager of the laboratory of structural biology of the institute of organic chemistry and of biochemistry and of Institute in molecular genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
About the budget. The ODS blames Fischer, who defends itself
The president of the ODS (Left civic Democratic) , Mirek Topolánek has qualified of " alarming " the budget ratified for the next year and according to it, the government of the prime minister Jan Fischer should replace in question its existence.
Prime minister has described the intentions of the ODS as drastic verdict.
It says to take time to analyze.
The spokesperson of the ODS Petr Neas has declared that the idea of an administrative office supported by the SSD, the ODS and the Party of the greens did not work obviously anymore.
According to Neas the head of the government should decide him ilprend in Parliament support on the minority that sees about fighting against the growing deficit, or if it sees about remaining in his duties with help of the parliamentary left.
Neas has warns that the positions of the ODS and of the democratic social ones in relation to the issue of public deficits are diametrally opposite.
Parliament has ratified on Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, with though the suggestions of modifications to height of 12 billion crowns included by the left.
The Bedroom has increased the money destined for the salaries of the officials, to the working of social services and to the direct payments to farmers.
The grievance of the government to the suggestions of the democratic social ones was the fact that they increased in indirect way the deficit of the budget.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS has left the chamber before the vote, following thus the wish for the government as which a modified budget is a variant less bad than a budget.
Disappointment and uselessness
The minister of the finances Eduard Janota has spoken of disappointment and of a feeling of disappointment and unnecessary, the Prime Minister Jan Fischer has indicated that the government still is going to think about the current situation.
Neas is convinced of if Janota threatened to leave his duties in the event of ratification of the proposed changes, the situation being able to be different.
According to the Czech, Janota has made an appointment Monday with the Prime Minister after its passage to the government:
It has indicated at the same time as he wondered if it was going to remain in his duties.
His disappointment as for the negotiations on the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue fight against the budget deficit, Neas considers that the representatives of the, who have imposed the changes in the budget, do not have their place in the government.
Prime Minister should also say clearly that he will resign if the Bedroom ratifies the other laws increasing the deficit as for example those that affect health insurance, the retirements, or the reform of the law on the services.
Topolánek: the ministers named by the ODS are not in question.
It is the business of the leader of the government and of all the government.
The ministers named by the ODS anything have not made of prejudicial, has underlined Topolánek in a literal communiqué from the United States.
It has reminded that the deputy ministers of some ministries belong to BEEP 09, which has voted against the budget.
Neas has underlined that if Fischer decides to give his resignation face by the way of taking fight against the amount of public finance deficit, "it is totally logical and correct that it is based on the majority of left that is presently to the Bedroom.
This says, he must not expect the support and the tolerance of the democrats.
I have not thought about it and once that will be to the agenda then I will devote to it, has declared from the Bedroom to the journalists, the minister of the defense Martin Barták, elected representative to the government precisely by the democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer has flown away in the afternoon for a debate of in the European Council in.
The ODS has made back at the request of the prime minister.
Neas has underlined at the same time as the ODS would probably have voted for Wednesday against the budget modified if he had expressly not asked the democratic members to allow the vote of the budget.
We do not have the feeling of being orphans, one is not small children, it has reacted to the question of whether if the ODS had not undergone reproaches on behalf of the president of the Party to the Bedroom or in the country during the negotiation of the budget.
I have not noticed that my vote would have been lacking.
I knew already at the time where I have renounced my mandate that what would follow in the next months would be a bolchévisation of the Bedroom and a destruction of all what was of positive, reacted Topolánek in nobody.
According to the new working hours of the trains for the same charges will be.
The Czech Railroads are going to remove or limit from 13 December some less loaded express or regional trains and will reinforce on the contrary some others.
Full coverage of transport will lower at the day of application of new timetables of two per cent compared to.
Most of the charges will not change, including the standard rates and the reduced price.
It is for example the inhabitants of the region of Ostrava that will have connections to the capital, the railways are going to add a pendolino oar.
On the contrary, an express is going to stop serving Bratislava.
Also less fast trains on the Prague - Písek - eské Budjovice line, the Prague direct line - Letohrad will be radically reduced., will be
At regional level the greatest reduction in transport concerns the region of Hradec Králové of eight per cent altogether, on the other hand Prague and its surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
Two trains by night on the Prague line - Tábor - eské Budjovice also are canceled and the circulation of some express trains on the Prague - Písek - eské Budjovice line will amount only to some days in the week.
Among the greatest changes, one can see the introduction of a new direct line to Prague: for the time being the inhabitants of Milovice must change to Lysá nad Labem.
It is a matter of the fifteenth line of the system of suburbs Esko, whose opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
Lines distant towards the capital will have their final destination to the main station of Prague (Praha Hlavní nádraí).
The D will introduce more lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains bound for Šumperk/Jeseník will leave par intervalles from two hours.
The travellers will not be able to take the Pendolino up to Bratislava anymore from December 13th.
The bill this year for regional railways: 200 million additional crowns.
Express trains are commanded and are paid by the Ministry of transport and will pour to the railways next year in all four billion crowns to settle the visible losses, or the same amount as this year. The regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for their by a total eight billion next year, knowing that the State will participate in tune of almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railroads have recently signed a contract for ten years, until now the period was always of a year.
The Railroads appreciate the system, it that also explains that they have not resorted to a rise of price of the great majority of titles of transport.

The history of South Africa concerns everybody, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
The new hollywoodien film of Clint Eastwood happens to the American rooms in the next few days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus: Neporaený), and narrae a part of the life of the previous South African president Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighting against apartheid has fallen to Morgan Freeman, which had been chosen years ago by Mandela itself to incarnate it.
The second male role of the legendary South African champion of rugby has been attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in cinemas, the returns of the criticisms and of the public are made hear.
Nelson Mandela
Of Its full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, it has been born on June 18th, 1918 to in South.
In 1988 it has obtained the price Sakharov for his freedom from spirit, in 1993 it received afterwards the prize Nobel of the peace for the sides of Klerk.
He has been President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great expectations since it is presented to a moment where on the one hand South Africa is preparations in full for the cup of World Cup, and on the other hand because the media are shaken by worrying news as for the increase of racial conflict and of discriminations of the inhabitants of the part of the black majority in power.
According to the agency AP the reactions to the new film are for the time being rather positive in South Africa, in spite of the frequent reserves emitted to the principal roles where " strut " of stars ' of Hollywood.
Nevertheless Morgan Freeman is proud of the film, recovering its own words.
I have dreamed of this role of long years and I have well gotten ready.
I have also many times met personally Nelson Mandela to be able - as one says - to recover of his energy, it has indicated during the first official of the film in Los Angeles.
I think that it is a good if one has the possibility of remembering the personality and the message of via the film.
It is the history of Republic of South, but that concerns each individual has added.
Carrying the singlet of national team rugby
The film based on the history of the novel of the British writer John Carlin the title freely being translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the part that has given its creation to the people depicted the South African defender of the human rights during his mandate to the presidency.
Morgan Freeman tries therefore during the film to restick two racial groups of a population long divided and of same that Nelson Mandela in 1995 him between dressed in the national singlet of the South Africa team on the lawn of the cup of the world, which South Africa had taken away then.
To have shown itself on the lawn in singlet, which is considered in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela in a long way had been given an ovation fourteen years before principally of the white public and has been recognized by the people.
Hope that the championship of football will succeed in uniting the people again only in a single nation, has indicated the rugby player Chester Williams, who was in 1995 the only " black " of national team.
It remains to see if the South Africa tense situation is going to improve.
The South African whites are though sceptical as lately has entrusted it in an interview for Christopher Dawson, fan of rugby that has run away to Great Britain.
The championship begins on June 11th, 2010.

Janura is going to carry complain for slandering against three prefects of the SSD
Radim Janura, owner of Student Agency, is going to put down today complaint for libel against three prefects social democrats.
And concretely against Michal Hasek of the region of Moravia of the South, against Radko Martínka of the region of Pardubice and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesaík.
Janura has indicated it in Dvacet minut of Radiournál.
The complaint is related to the attempt of the society of exploiting regional railways in certain regions.
All the regions have ended up signing contracts of long-term contracts with the railways Czechs though.
Everyone three us have attacked and maintain that one makes fine lips, even though only one has made an offer for what they wished for themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railroads what is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railroads that have been signed last week.
Therefore he remains us only to defend us.
It is in return for the slanders on the society Student Agency, has declared Janura to the Radiournál.
Similarly, it has indicated to have evidence that no region has proceeded in conformity with the European right.
We prepare a complaint for that for the European Commission.
Hasek considers that the deposit of complaint of mister Janura represents the continuation of his media show that serves as free publicity for him for his society and for his person.
I am of course disposed to defend my name and on behalf of my region and I call the other prefects to follow suit.
I suppose that this will be the occasion of showing clearly that he is precisely a mister Janura that manipulates the public opinion and resorts to fake and false arguments about regional rail transport, declares Hasek
Janura has already informed the last week that it will invest some million crowns in an advertisement that will mention the steps unfavourable with the regions.
He has declared to Radiournál that it will interrupt the campaign after Noël and that he intends to recover it after the New Year.
It has clarified that the campaign will aim at the corruption in the broad sense.
Janura has started its campaign after the regions have started agreed to entrust the exploitation of the railroad links for an order to around 150 billion crowns to the Czech Railroads, without emitting of call of tender.
According to Janura, such a way of acting is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to it, his criticism of rail transport in the regions has even brought threats of a member of to Janura.
The only threat has been that if one did not stop, one could lose our bus licences.
It has appeared as a member of the, I do not know who it is a matter of but I will not say his name, has declared Janura today to Radiournál.
The vaccination against the pneumococci will be free and optional
The vaccination against the pneumococci will knock over the old habits from January.
It will be to be the first to be free and at the same time optional for the families.
Saying rise already, saying that the obligatory vaccination would be more efficient.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against the pneumococci tower.
Pharmaceutical Institute defines already for the vaccines the maximal prices that are going to pay the assurances disease.
The specialists see also clear in the process of vaccination.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for the children of August.
Since January, the children born last year from 2 can be vaccinated for free against the pneumococci.
The condition is that they do not have not still vaccinated.
If one has begun the vaccination last year or more early, one will have to pay himself the next vaccinations.
First measure of vaccine must be administered between the 3rd and the fifth months of the child.
Last year already a quarter of families has voluntarily vaccinated his children against the pneumococci.
Nevertheless the parents paid sek 1, 600 indeed more for a dose.
The vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
The specialists value that every year the assurances health insurance spend 300 to 450 000 crowns in doses of vaccine.
They save though on the medical cares that the not vaccinated children would need.
Until now the State spent sek around 500 000 about per annum for the whole vaccination of the children.
The reimbursed vaccination has been introduced with the "packet Janota".
The pneumococci are the cause of inflammations of the middle ear but also of infections but also serious of which the inflammations of the meninxes and the poisonings of the blood.
According to surveys in hospitals, there is up to 28 death of children of less than 10 years caused by infections of pneumococci.
Apart from the Czech Republic around 40 other countries have introduced the reimbursed vaccination.
Will the vaccination be compulsory?
There are opinions regarding a possible obligation of vaccination in future.
From January, it must be settled by the insurance and optional.
For example the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský has indicated that an obligatory vaccination would be more positive.
His association promotes the vaccination against the pneumococci for long.
During an international conference that our association has participated in, the specialists have not been really satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
It is not ideal.
From the other hand, we are happy to have been able to impose at least this.
I think that it is a direction which it is needed at present to follow has declared Kalovský.
But the Ministry of health does not want to modify the process of vaccination against the pneumococci.
We do not envisage it absolutely for the time being, has declared his spokesman.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, assert the doctors.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the specialized Society of paediatricians, recognizes that a vaccination based on the volontariata its shortcomings.
If all the children were vaccinated, one could envisage a fall of the renewals of vaccination reviews ' in the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision giving back voluntary vaccination" said though Cabrnochová.
The specialists foresee that from next year, more than 80 % of the new parents will make to vaccinate their infants.
The vaccination against the pneumococci marks a breaking off also of the fact that it is the first vaccination of children that is financed by the insurance and not the State.
Cabrnochová explains that the assurances should free funds for the prevention, they would save thus on any further and medical care.
The doctors will have to buy their products themselves
This is though related to the worries of the general practitioner pediatricians, who concern purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was of making to buy the vaccines by the assurances, the doctors receiving them in the same way as the other products of vaccine supplied by the State.
Some deputies feared though that this would allow to the assurances "deducing are them of health insurance ".
Thus, the doctors will have to buy the products and wait for the assurances to reimburse them to them.
According to the estimates, the pediatricians will individually have to surround almost sek 40 000 by month in vaccines, what is a significant sum.
That will be far from being easy, according to Cabrnochová.
Always them and us
Can The Islam be French?
The pluralism and Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the latest book of the author, "Why the French do not love the scarf" (2006), a study elegant and well documented on a problem that has divided and worried the country from 15 years and whose effects are made still feel today.
The last book of Mr. Bowen presents a web of broader and more ambitious.
Good anthropologist, he does not wish only to know what the politicians and the media say about the Islam in France, but what happens presently in the country.
He has spent many months in the mosques, the schools and the institutes that supply maintaining this queM in France. Bozen calls ' Muslim spaces Muslim" for the 5 m - 6 m of Muslims.
He knows to listen very well and to reproduce the debates between teachers and students on the questions that concern them the more.
Must a Muslim marry in a mosque or at the town hall (or the two of them)?
Must the evolution and the rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can Muslim women marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use a banked system based on the interests in obtaining a loan?
It is These are practical problems, it asserts, which are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that worry the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, of teachers and of intellectuals all unknown to the general public, excepted maybe Tariq Ramadan, an Arabic Muslim born in Switzerland.
New generation tries to open the debate on the way of being at the same time a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not move the debate to the end.
Lesconservateurs do not believe in idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and the activists who have been interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in conformity with their counterparts lawyers of a purist Islam Sunni associated with Saudi Arabia that nowadays, constitute a small part of Muslims.
M Bowen considers that the values of the Muslims and the secularity of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can be obtained only with the efforts from each side.
He wonders to what point the French politicians (and intellectual elite so virulent guard of the secularity) really are engaged to the pluralism.
According to it, the Muslims have not been spoiled, in relation to the Catholics, to the Protestants and to the Jews that also have had to make compromise historical with the historical secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, he detects a "narrowness of key values".
Can The Islam be French? After reading of this paper, one is tempted of saying "yes, but not yet."
The darkest sight of the world
The Arctic changes in a faster way and in a way more dramatic than everything other place on the world.
The ice that composes it is melting to an alarming rate, taking with it a life that can not survive elsewhere.
The oil, Oil, gas, the dispatches and the fishing sail to new waters opened, with the diplomats, the lawyers and maintaining writers in their wake.
In "On a thin ice", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the symbol of the far north polar bears.
Expert of the history and of the complicated policies of the whale fishing, it describes the long tradition of the explorers of the Arctic that made their evidence hunting the white bear.
The meeting of the Admiral Nelson, then brave candidate of 14 years that did not have to fight that points it of his musket, is probably a myth, but the rest is true.
The young cubs, captured even though they swam to alongside their mother, all fair killed, were caught and were sent in zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show gathered 75 bear at the same time.
Even today the dimensions of a zoo are always one millionth of the surface necessary for an adult generally at liberty. the climate is seldom advisable: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green because of the seaweeds that grew in its thick fur.

Ellis tells the histories of other writers and historians and comes back often on the threat that the hunters constitute on the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, in America and in Russia, the killings continue to in and to the Canada where hunters by helicopter and the Inuits Indians in motoski use fusilsd assault powerful to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the waters the more to the north of two nations of hunting that freezes it will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After the ice", Alun Anderson, a previous editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of the science of the Arctic and a gripping survey of what will be maybe the future over there.
Not that the scientists have all the answers.
Neither the atmosphéristes nor the oceanographers can relate the speed of change with exactly.
It is not for want of trying.
End XIX and early XX, the pioneer journeys of Fridtjof Nansen have given the first information on the melting of the ice sheet.
Submarines in the Cold War have made a map of the changes of relief under this afterwards.
Satellite surveillance and the probes put on the icebergs are of a great help, but the biggest of the work is made by men hardened, camping in the cold.
Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the dependent system of the Arctic ice, formed by the dribbles of brackish water squeezed freezing.
But of the bear evoked above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the ice of summer, foreseen between 2013 and 2050.
"In some months, it will be perhaps be our turn"
Sailors, among the 6 000 people who have deposed crowns on the graves in
The first class De'Angello Robinson, 19 years, has been a journey of seven hours in the bus to depose a simple crown on the grave of a soldier that it had never met.
For it and for the other Sailors who have made the journey of Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, in North Carolina to the Cemetery Arlington National Cemetery to decorate beat them, this day was devoted to greeting the men and women who one day, were to their place.
In whatever months, of where we will be sent, we risk to be to their place, has called Robinson about soldiers beaten.
If that happened to me, I would want somebody to make the same thing for me, it is why I try just to show respect.
It was one of the 6 000 volunteers to have gathered itself Saturday morning to depose crowns on the graves of the veterans, in different sections of the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company at Harrington, in the, has launched the commemoration and other people have decided to decorate several hundred graves in the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
Now, to continue a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife, make every year the journey, being stopped in various cities on their way, to organize the commemorations in honor of the military and of victims of terrorism.
The Worcester have also founded an association to not lucrative goal, Wreaths Across America (Of kroner in) , that aims to promote the event in all the other States.
This year, the volunteers have put more than 16 000 crowns on the graves of the cemetery of Arlington, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the cemetery Fayetteville National Cemetery enArkansas, in the Battery Park to New York City and on the site of the memorial for the victims of the flight 93 of United Airlines to Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year running, the foundation Walmart Foundation has given more de$150 000 to buy and to transport the kronor.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years, of Westminster, has declared that it had made the journey to Arlington in honor of his husband a career military died.
Although her husband is not shelved at Arlington, Hunt has said that for it this was a way of thanking those that had sacrificed themselves.
It is a small thing that can be the civilians to support our troops, it has said.
It is as visiting a family grave.
Wrapped up in several sections of winter clothes, the volunteers have walked between the lawns and the hills stretched of the cemetery.
The volunteers have chosen the graves old, dating back to the First and the Second world war, as the Vietnam War, because these are not so often visited as the new graves, have declared the organizers.
The mood was to the optimism, even though the children played and the couples were held by the hand, carrying the crowns of cool pine on the gray graves.
Round Crown had a round Crown green colour darkened, with a small red moth knot on the high.
Close at hand the silence hovered on the Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations has given 1 000 kroner to decorate the section but the dark mood of current wars filled the zone.
Hiding cried without hiding, others prayed and families and friends supported themselves in the cold air.
Some read to high voice the names engraved in the stone even though others bent to see the small cards of information black and white, pushed in the moist earth for those whose falls had not yet been finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the numerous mothers in tears, on the grave of her son.
She has left from Zanesfield, in Ohio and had driven eight hours to come to meditate at the grave of the Sergeant of Navy GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, death to in battle in July.
Anybody never should forget thanks to what we are free... my son has paid for that, it has said.
"Long after I have disappeared, I want somebody to remember it."
An American national stopped by the Cuban authorities
Cuban government has stopped an American national who distributed mobile phones and of the laptop computers in the country, have asserted the services of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based to Bethesda.
The society works on projects for the customers such as. S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana try of to have access to the prisoner that has been stopped on 5 December.
Precise accusations have not been made public, well that under the Cuban law, a Cuban citizens or a visitor can be stopped under the pretense of being " dangerous ".
All the revolutionary so-called activities, including moderate protests and critical written languages, lead to the risk of an arrest.
The graffiti anti-governmental and the speeches are considered as serious crimes.
Cuba has a community of more and more great bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, popular commentator who writes often on the way whose husband and it are followed and harassed by the government officials.
Sánchez has made several requests of leaving the country to go to receive rewards but the authorizations have always been refused him.
Detention of a US citizen maybe is going to increase the tensions between the communist government of brothers in and the administration Obama that pursues a approche"douce" in order to improve relations with the island.
Announcement of the arrest first has been reported by the New York Times, on Friday evening.
New American policy insists so that the Cuban government advances by concrete steps, such that to free the release of political prisoners and to create space for the opposition, so that the United States can give back the equal.
Mobile telephones and mobile computers are allowed to in Cuba, although they are consumer goods new and wanted in a country or the average salary of an official is of $15 by month.
This year the Cuban government has given the ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are principally used for the textos or for a conversation of 15 minutes that corresponds to a day ’ s pay.
On the island, the use of Internet extremely is limited.
It is available in the luxury hotels and for the foreign visitors in the country, as in some buildings of the government, such as the universities.
The Cubans who wish often to connect themselves must communicate them to the government.
The access to many websites Web is limited.
The possession of an American in is rare.
Most of the American rare ones incarcerated in Cuba are behind the bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, assert Gloria Berbena, press attaché next to the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena has said that it could not supply information on the arrest.
The arrest and the possession are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be authorized - to distribute providing free mobile phones for free - is a crime in Cuba, has declared Jose Miguel Vivanco, Manager of the program Americas of the group Human Rights Watch, that lately has published a severe relation on the strict freedoms in, appelé"Nouveau Castro, same Cuba," referring to the installation of Raul Castro as leader of the country to replace Fidel its older brother from ill.
According to Vivanco, a defendant is often stopped, passed en jugement and imprisoned on the same day.
It has said that any solution would be probably political and that the Cuban government causes often a negative response to the United States, at the moment where the two countries start beginning a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent a plot to send men in Afghanistan
Saturday, the Pakistani authorities have spotted an organization supposed to prepare a plot to send five men of Virginia of the North in Afghanistan with the aim of killing the American troops, saying that they expected from headhunters of terrorists who skim Internet in search of young that this business would allow taking apart a significant network radicalized men.
The investigators have maintained that they drove away a hidden insurgente personality, experienced under the name of Saifullah that has invited to these men in after having discovered them while one of them has made terrorists on the site of video comments approving of the waves YouTube on Internet.
Happened in these men have been guided by Saifullah that has tried to help them to join the region moved back from the tribal belt of Pakistan, home of al - Qaida and of its terrorist training camps.
But one representative of the secret services Pakistanis that the business has been informed has said on Saturday that Saifullah had not succeeded in convincing the commanders of al - Qaida that these men did not participate in the CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network terrorist.
De ce fait, they have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the mountains banned of in the North-East become a haven of terrorism.
They have been considered as agents.
It is why they have been thrown back, has declared a representative of the authorities who has expressed himself to the condition of keeping the anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
Representative of the authorities has maintained that the men were determined and that they tried always of obtaining the necessary authorizations to obtain entry into the camps from al - Qaida while they have been stopped by the Pakistani strengths of law.
Case of these five men - which remain in and who are questioned by the FBI - stress the crucial role of the headhunters in identification of potential terrorists and perhaps most important, in the determination of the people in whom to grant its faith.
From the attacks of 11 September 2001 the US secret services have had as priority to infiltrate men into the Al-Qaida network.
The headhunters of the organization play the role of level-crossing keepers, refusing the entry to those that do not show a serious commitment and those that can be proved to be spies.
According to the analysts the potential American recruits are studied close up by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive for the group because of their potential access to targets American and of their propagandaire value.
Though Evan Kohlmann, expert of the Foundation NEFA based in the, has declared that terrorist groups must also mind more and more, these last years in the choice of the people that they accept because the US secret services have become experts in what concerns their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate anybody into these groups, what best way only of following its model of recruitment that many people already have followed? has said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is more and more on Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in ask for an " action " for the climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants have walked in the streets, here, Saturday, asking for a more important action on the climate on behalf of the negotiators working in of the negotiators working in the conference Bella Convention Center of the city.
Number of the demonstrators was valued at 100 000 people, but 25 000 according to estimates by the police.
This event has taken place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists has lit a few explosives close to a unity of governmental buildings, in center- city.
In it day where little of little have passed itself in the course of the discussions on the climate sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists have walked throughout the city, deploying signs in saying English 'It does not exist not of planet B" and one in Spanish, declaring "The Earth said that it has in enough".
Several celebrities have joined with to the protests, including the top model and Danish photographer, Helena Christensen, that has declared what to travel to the native country of his mother, Peru, has opened the eyes to him on the heartrending problems to which must face the country because of the impact of the climatic changes that happen already."
It is one of the reasons for which I have decided to join with the great way - of making to pass the word and of launching an appeal to the leaders of the world so that they set the right decisions, ambitious and committed, it has said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be started, it is not no more possible to avoid it.
The police have prevented the demonstrators from coming too much close to the Centre and have said about pocket that it had stopped 19 people to the reason that they carried a mask or that they were in possession of knives.
The police have prevented the demonstrators from coming too much close to the Centre and have said about pocket that it had stopped 19 people to the reason that they carried a mask or that they were in possession of knives.
According to a passer-by who has asked to keep the anonymity because of his involvement in discussions on the climate, the activists who carried masks and black and clothing, have lit several explosives close to the main canal of Copenhagen that is surrounded with a few ministries.
They threw them close to the buildings, it has said, adding that these were first and foremost rockets, followed afterwards by "some big explosions".
Inside the Palace of the Conferences the people were rallied around television screens to follow the way, throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that wake up have not succeeded in wakening the conscience of the key authorities such as Su Wei, representative of China for the climate.
While one has asked him if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on the international deliberations, it has replied in English "Actually, it is something of which I did not have conscience.
It has continued afterwards in Mandarin, declaring "The being event important, I can not hear what he passes to itself at the outside".
He has observed that the walk could seem harmful or useful according to the prospects.
It shows the interest of the public and of the different sectors on subject of climate change, it has said.
From the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or that they harm the freedom of the others."
Results of the tests reveal persistent differences between the races
The federal relation of the last week on the results in mathematics has brought a good news for the state schools of Washington D.C.
Although the District stays still far behind the institutions in mind, the relation shows that the Rank 4 and Rank 5 (cm1-cm2) are in well greater progress in the course of the last two years that in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the last numbers of the National one Assessment of Educational Progress (National evaluation of progress of education) is the gap persisting between the results of the afro-américains ones and of whites, on the plans at the same time local and national.
The average results of the white children of Rank 4 (cm1) at WashingtonD.C. have increased, in the course of these two last years, of 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their classmates have increased only in three points, 209 212.
The gap of success has actually increased between 2007 and 2009, going by from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the Afro-Américains ones in 8 (4) remains generally constant, falling only from a point, of 245 at 244.
Result means of whites has not been included in the results of the tests because the sample was not sufficiently important.
The overall view towards a period of six years is not more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between the blacks and the whites in class of Rank 4 (cm1), while the first relation NAEP of the District was published, was from 60 points (262 at 202).
Although the results obtained by the children in the two groups have increased in the course of this period, the difference is itself only reduced to 58 points.
Last week in the district some defenders have expressed the anxiety that raises it celebrated by the Manager of group of educational establishments Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were propelled by the white students who were already good elements.
That would mean that we have raised the aggregate considering elements to the top ladder, it that is problematic and bothering, has said Jeff Smith, Manager of D.C. Voice, a not lucrative group to goal that defends the equality in education of the.
I do not jump joy for one or two won points, has declared Kwame R. Brown (related democrat), Member of the Council of. and of which the girl is in Rank 4, to Eaton Elementary (elementary school).
Often criticizes style of management of Rhee, Brown has declared that the message of the results of tests is that the MIDDL schools (colleges) of the city have desperately need attention.
Really, you want always to see the positive signs positive and I respect it.
But it that frightens, it is that we do not hallow sufficiently time and energy to our MIDDL schools (colleges) .
Rhee has declared that the District had to continue find of the students better ways of meeting to the needs in difficulty.
Autumn, for example, some teachers have been formed to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, aiming the pupils of the classes of end of the elementary cycle and beginning of college that have not integrated the foundations of the reading earlier in their school pathways and that are late enough in relation to their peers.
Every day the programme of mathematics, for the classes of Kindergarten (nursery school) at 6 (sixth) puts the accent on the games and the Games and the experiences of real life, such that they have been set up in the District by the previous person in charge Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress with the NAEP brought back last week.
I think quite simply that we need to continue work to offer better interventions to these students of level inferior to that of the class, has said Rhee.
Others consider that the results of the ask the question of knowing if Rhee can continue raise the overall results of the system all supplying the money and the resources for the schools with less good results in order to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, has said Bruce Fuller, a trainer of the education at the University of Berkeley in California that studies the results of tests of the cities.
Conventional political solution is of devoting your resources and your reforms of management to the schools situated in the poorest areas of Washington.
Also this aims can have political repercussions that bother this important programme.
But the problem, of course, is that as the others Superbursar of the schools, she tries to use the middle class of the white and of the blacks.
We concentrate to insure the development of a system of good schools.
We need to reinforce our schools of parts so that all the families, whatever is the place of where they originate, are insured persons that their children will be able to obtain a good education.
Janey, maintaining Superbursar of the schools of Newark, has declared in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the gap of lasted étaitla success of the traditional state school, today of 180 days in the district of, to be in competition with the Charter Plane schools.
Around 200 days must be obtained to have the strength of changing, he has said Janey, which has turned to an agreement with the Union of its teachers last year to obtain 185 days, which he considers a "starting point" to obtain an increase in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise of the future
The bus has stopped in Gettysburg College with a long hail.
Graciela Rodriguez 12 years ago, goes down in and blinks one point in full view of the columns, of facades of bricks and of the verdant lawns.
Parents of only had been able to finish the school, àEl El Salvador.
Up to lately, Graciela itself, which has been born to Silver Spring and saw to Riverdale, never had put the feet on a university campus.
As, even though it and other students of 8 (4) of the group have explored Gettysburg where the charges are of $38 690 per annum its attitude was less that of an impressed student news as enthusiastic.
High-octane gasoline This Is where I am going to study! study has exclaimed that would wish to study the medicine, even though the guide directed them towards the entry of property of science.
Youpi, really? it calls pensive, while one indicated the weak professor ratio of right - student to him.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children visited in the course of their journey of discovery of three days and now, they had completely integrated the message: The question is not whether if you go to the university:
The question is where.
Although this question lands still largely for the large number of American children born of Hispanic immigrated parents who have left the secondary school where have become related at the adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from the university education that will allow them to enter to the middle class.
Actually, "a Hispanic of" the "second generation" on cinqpoursuit his studies to the secondary school " - a notable success if one considers that so many of their immigrated parents, most of or of Central America, have entered to the without having finished the school.
Their success is important, suggest the researchers, they open the way to the next generations that will play an important role in the hand of the country.
The researchers who study Researchers who study fighters maintain that these have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need of succeeding.
Numerous are also those whose parents set their children high targets and that take on the means of compensating for their lack of familiarity with the American schools.
The programs of mentorat play also play a very important role to help Graciela and of the million children as it to arrive up to the university - in particular, if its efforts are regular and at length term.
While you look at the children of the families to weak income having parents who do not have the experience and the abilities to help them to sail to the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, has called Patricia Gándara, researcher to Davis, University of California, who has studied the latino-américains students.
We need to think of offering those children a network of support, from the nursery school to the secondary school.
The federal program that has financed the visit of the universities of is a good example.
Known under the name of GEAR UP (prepare you), it supplies more $300 millions per annum to of the systems of local schools to organize the programs of preparation to the university that begin while the students of families of low incomes are in school (Commission) and continue until at the end of the years of school.
For 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering at the university, according to the American Ministry of the Education.
Ministry of Iraqi oil obtains agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
In spite of the anxieties on the violence and the political instability, the Iraqi government has succeeded in attracting major oil companies in order to reconstruct its infrastructure in difficulty in the course of two bids that have ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements obtained by the Ministry of Iraqi oil with the foreign oil societies suggest that the oil companies of Chine,Russie and of Europe are to playing a major role in the delivery in a state of the oil industry of Iraq, invalidated by tens of years of war and of sanctions, about.
The American societies have left with a participation only in two from the 10 fields put to the bids.
American companies had paid to participate in the second bid that has begun on Friday.
The alone who had put an auction has lost.
American companies have obtained contracts for the fields put to the bids in June.
The weak representation of the American oil giants in the opening of the oil industry in has surprised the analysts.
Iraq finally has opened his doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, are itself Asian and European societies that open the way, has declared Ruba Husari, editor of the Forum, a site of information on Internet.
A lot of time will be needed before another offer is made in Iraq.
The anxieties on the safety, corroborated by bombardments coordinated massive, Tuesday, and the political instability even though the American military troops retire have slowed down the American oil societies, preventing them from going with more de force in Iraq who possesses the third greater one reserves brute oil of in the world, suggest the analysts.
The American societies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, in particular the Chinese and the other energetic societies controlled by a government, of which the costs of work force were notably inferior and that were more ready to take risks because they did not have to report to the shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. have been the only American societies to obtain from contracts with the.
The American societies most important, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, that have looked after strong connections to the Ministry of Iraqi oil and have brought him their technical advice, have gone again the empty hands.
The Russian societies Lukoil and Gazprom have been the two main shareholders in two of the contracts attributed this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., held by the State, more has bidden over contracts than of other companies and has gone again with important participations in contracts for two main fields.
We know everyone that China is becoming a major economic, as technological power, has declared Assam Jihad, spokesperson of the Ministry of oil.
We are confident that the Chinese society will be to equality with its competitors and will realize his commitments in Iraq.
The societies pre-selected to subject auctioning have made offers that have been compared with the price afterwards by barrel that the ministry was agreed of overturning to motivate the production above the current levels for each area.
One of the main organisers of would have been killed in
It seems that an American missile, having struck along the border with have killed one of the organizers of the operations of al - Qaida, this week, have declared on Friday of the American authorities of the counter espionage.
If the information is confirmed, that would be the second murderous attack on one of terrorist leaders this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two men Arabic suspected of having been killed by a pair of missiles thrown to their cars, Tuesday, close to the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to the latest American and of the Pakistani authorities Pakistani in the region.
Local authorities have maintained that the missiles had been pulled by an airplane without pilot of the type used by the CIA, inside the anarchic tribal border of.
They drove a white car, heading for the Afghan border, while the car has been struck, has declared a member of the Pakistani civil secret services, expressing themselves on the telephone of Miran Shah.
Representatives of the authority have declared that the suspicious local militants have thrown themselves on site and have rapidly confiscated what remained "bodies totally torn apart".
Verifying identity of the victims has been totally impossible to local authorities, but two representatives have proved US have given not specified proofs that Somali made part of the dead.
Somali was described as being one of the military organizing Persons in Charge of al - Qaida that directed terrorist operations of the group out of the Afghanistan - Pakistan region.
His role was of organizing plots in the world, has asserted one of the authorities that has wished to keep the anonymity, quoting the sensitive nature of the aerial touches inside the Pakistani territory.
Being given its central role, this included conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe probably.
It has followed the strategic orders of the leaders of al - Qaida and has translated them in plans of actions for any terrorist attacks.
Second representative of the American authority has declared that Somali had progressed rapidly in the rows of al - Qaida sec and had very good relationships with other extremist groups in the region.
It is not known maybe of the public, but that does not reduce the threat that it constitutes for us and our allies, has called the second official representative official.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second important character of al - Qaida or the second leader Taliban killed since September, when a similar attack has killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as three other operators.
The rhythm of the attacks carried out by the drones of the CIA has diminished for the summer, of about six operations a month at two, according to the numbers brought forward by the Long War Journal, a Web site moderated by a not lucrative group to goal.
This decline maybe is owed to improved tactics of the terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability all killing the suspected informers also mercilessly, asserts the site.
The special correspondent of the UN in Kabul retires
The special correspondent of the UN in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, has declared Friday that he was going to resign of his post in March, at the end of a sullied tumultuous mandate of allegations of corruption stretched in the course of the presidential elections supported by the UN.
The departure of Eide intervenes even though the administration Obama has decided to send further 30 000 soldiers in Afghanistan.
The messenger of the UN has said that it supported this increase but has expressed his anxiety regarding the calendar about the United States for a withdrawal of the troops that would begin in 18 months and that would oblige the other governments of the NATO to withdraw its forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our strengths of safety in Afghanistan, to send the right signal to the and to remind them that they can trust the international community, he has declared Eide in a telephone conversation of.
Our commitment must be in the long term.
The Norwegian diplomat has also pressed the United States and the other military powers to increase the number of international officials helping the political transition in Afghanistan.
Military increase must be copied by the civilians, it has said.
Eide has declared that he did not resign but that it would respect simply the commitment that it had taken to his family, in March, of spending only two years in Kabul.
He has said that he wanted to warn the United Nations.
The Round of Applause Secretary General Ki-moon knows maintaining that it has time to find a substitute.
Simply I have said that it was worth to start searching better for my replacing, has said Eide.
While I have come here, there had been a space of two months between the departure of my predecessor and I arrived.
According to the representatives of the UN, Round of Applause has already started looking for a replacement.
The representatives maintain that the name staffan Di has been quoted; it is a matter of a citizen Italo-Suisse who has lately presided over a mission of the UN at Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a French who has previously directed the operations of peacekeeping from the UN.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan has been put to the test after his adjoint antiques, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused it, in September, of favoring the President Hamid Karzai in the course of the presidential elections and of concealing the evidence of a mass electoral fraud.
Eide has denied these allegations but it has declared that the accusations of - which has been thanked - "have carried damaged the mission because there was already a good dose of skepticism in what concerns the international observation of the éléctions".
Eide has declared that it had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative in order to coordinate the helps of the American strengths in Afghanistan.
He has also insisted with the Persons in Charge of the UN so that they allow his successor to hire more staff coming of the United States and of other western countries than it is attributed to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that would allow giving to them more in trust on the way their money of which is spent.
Eide has expressed his frustration regarding the limits of his powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy rules of hiring of the UN bothered his possibilities of bringing new talent.
The rules of the UN are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, it has said.
It is catastrophic and that can not last.
Gates: Iran must undergo further sanctions
The Secretary to the Defense, Robert M. Gates has declared "Friday that the world major powers were soon going to impose "important additional sanctions" on Iran because of his inability to start in negotiations on the nuclear ambitions.
Gates, expressing itself in front of a bed of 300 American soldiers to the north of Iraq, in the course of a visit of a week in the zones of war in Afghanistan and in Iraq, has played down the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is not any good option in Iran, it has said, in response to the question of a soldier on the possibility of such a dénouement.¨
One of the things that weighs me the more, is that if I have learned a thing in Iraq in the course of the last six years, it is well the unpredictable inherent in the war.
The administration Obama considers military elite a unity of sanctions that would aim and talks about politics of Iran, but Gates has notified that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranian side of the street.
He has declared that a "unity of motives and of punishments" could be Iranian, necessary to persuade the Iranian government, that it would be actually good security in less "with nuclear weapons" because " the people would suffer enormously' of these sanctions.
Friday, in a declaration of the spokesperson of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the administration has joined the European leaders in a warning according to which Iran will make in view of the consequences ' probable if it does not bring back nuclear programme in total compliance with the Security Council of the UN and his organism of surveillance, the International Agency of the atomic power (AIEA).
Say persists to say that he wants to develop its nuclear experience uniquely in a peaceful purpose.
In the talks in, on 1 October, it has indicated that it would recover the dialog about the reduction of its nuclear programme and accepted to abandon an important part of his stocking of uranium enriched, in return for desperately necessary fuel for a reactor of medical research.
The administration has moved such an agreement, means of developing a trust on both sides and of gaining time for negotiations.
For lors, Iran appears to be itself far from the attempts agreed - in part, suggest the experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided on the fact of starting or not with the United States.
Frankly, according to me, the stiffening of Iran opposite some of the proposals from the international community for which actually they had given their agreement at the beginning of October, has moved the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join on what they had not envisaged, in important in terms of additional sanctions counter the Iranians, has declared Gates.
The President Obama has set on December 31st as deadline in Iran to reply to the proposals, before he turns to other options, including the pursuit of what the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has once called of the "increased sanctions".
In a declaration made on Thursday in, the mission of Iran to the has denounced what she calls "of the allegations without foundation" of some members of the Security Council on the nuclear activities and has maintained that it was agreed to continue the talks with the United States and five other great world powers, "in order to obtain a satisfactory solution in the long term".
Gates, which had to fit in Washington late on Friday, has met the morning the prime minister of Iraq, Nouri al-Maliki, before taking the airplane for the rich oil region of Kurdish afin derencontrer the Persons in Charge of the troops from Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tension persist between the Kurds and the Arabic majority in Iraq, particularly regarding the borders, property rights and the sharing of the incomes.
Gates has exhorted the two parts to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid all delays of the American plans of reduction of the number of American troops, of 115 000 to 50 000 before the end of the month of August.
Gates wishes to soothe also the anxiety of the Kurds regarding the withdrawal in suspens. The American authorities have quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, regional President of the Government of Kurdistan: "We will protect your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a Iraq unified".
We will not abandon you."
In the aging China a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband have grown surrounded with poster of propagandas sermonizing them, "The mother Earth too much is tired to receive more children" and "A baby in more, it is a grave besides".
They have so well learned the lesson that the authorities of the government of, alarmed by the insufficient rate of birth rate of their city and by the ageing of the population, have radically changed this summer from direction and have started encouraging to the young couples to have more than one child; their response has been instantaneous and closes: never.
We have already given a single child all our time and all our energy.
It no second is left to us, he has said Wang, 31 years, Manager of human resources and who has a son of eight months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the policy of the only child in China, creating two generations of unique children notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled, nicknamed the "small emperors", a crisis of the population threatens the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate has fallen of 1,8 children by couple with six when the policy has been made of use.
The distribution of the population, even though it is predicted that the number of residents of 60 years and more will explode, from 16,7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31,1 percent in 2050. This number is well of about 20 percent above the global average.
This imbalance is still worse in the coastal rich cities having a very educated population, such as Shanghai.
60 years, the people of Last year and more represented close to 22 percent of the population of the residents recorded in Shanghai, even though the birth rate was of less of a child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Manager of Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Commission of the Municipal Population of the and of the Family Planning) has declared that the fertile couples had to have babies in order to "of helping the proportion of the aging population to reduce and of preventing a lack of work force in future".
Shanghai is about to becoming "as old - but not also rich, however - that the developed countries such as Japan and Sweden" has said.
Gradual reduction
Written in the constitution of the country in 1978, the Chinese policy of the only child is at this day, unquestionably, the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government.
The couples that transgress this policy risk to have to pay huge fines - until three times their annual income - and of suffering a discrimination on the workplace.
Chinese authorities have attributed the duty of helping the country to avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, even though the lawyers of the human rights have denounced the abuses in implementation of this policy, to the police.
In rural areas some representatives of the authority have forced pregnant women to a second child to abort.
Furthermore many couples have had high resort to the selective abortions driving boys - girls to a ratio abnormally.
Recent years the responsible authorities of the population have gradually softened their position on the policy of the child.
In 2004, they have matched more exceptions to the rule - including for the resident ones of the cities, of cities, members of ethnic minorities and the cases in which the man and the woman are already only children - and in 2007, they have softened many of their slogans hard.
Qiao Xiaochun at the Institute of Population Research (Institute of research on the population), to the University of Beijing, has declared that the authorities of the central government have lately discussed still more radical, such changes than to allow the couples to have two children if one of the partners is an only child.
In July, Shanghai has become the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage the aggressive births.
In one nothing of time, the posters inciting the families to have only one child have been replaced with copies of rules detailing who has the right to have a single child and how to make the request for authorisation.
Government of the city has dispatched persons in charge of the family planning and volunteers to meet couples, at their homes, and to slip the prospectus under their door.
He has also promised to supply financial and psychological advice to those that would wish to have more than one child.
According to the person in charge of the family planning the answer has been disappointing.
Disappointing reply
Although the persons in charge in a rural city of the suburbs of Shanghai say about files of couples wishing for a second child after the launch of the campaign that they have seen an increase in the applications the more urban district has reported that there was not no change.
The town of Huinan, with a population of 115 000 inhabitants, for example, receives always four to five requests by months.
The persons in charge of Shanghai, disappointed, assert that in spite of the campaign, the number of the births in the city, in 2010, always is foreseen to be only of about 165 000 - lightly superior to 2009 but inferior to 2008.
Feng Juying, Person in Charge of the committee of the family planning in the town of Caolu of Shanghai, has declared that the financial considerations are probably the main reason for which numerous people do not want to have more children.
They want to provide for their first child, it has said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years and his woman, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years, have declared that they would adore to have two children and that legally they are authorized.
But as a lot of Chinese, they have uniquely minimum health insurance and the life assurance given by the government.
Without a social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
The western ones consider wrongly that the policy of the only child is a problem of rights, has declared Yang, an engineer in building whose woman is pregnant with seven months of the first child of the couple.
It is true, one steals the luck of having more than one child from us.
But the problem is not only the law.
It is the money.
Other couples quote psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Person in Charge of for human resources, has said that she wanted a single child because it was one itself. "We were the center of the family and had the habit that everybody takes care of us."
We are not used to taking care of somebody else and we do really not wish to take care of the others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years and owner of a society of translation says it more plainly.
For the couples working on two, of middle class, that make to lower the birth rate, it says, one must be selfish pourbien to succeed.
People of 20 or 30 years have grown seeing their parents fight in the first times of capitalist China and do not want to have themselves this way of life, it says.
Even only one child asks for a lot of time of his parents, it says.
A mother must abandon at least two years of social life.
Then there are the problems of space - "You need to modify your apartment" - and the planning - "While your child does not have that 9 months, you needs to write her CV to obtain a place in the best nursery school."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience a time, said Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, it says.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
The group of the has projects of plans as the reduction of the emissions
The conference on the climate, sponsored by the UN - characterized until now by disorganized allocations and mutual recriminations - has come back under the spotlight of crawls it Friday, because of the publication of a document underlining the ambitious reductions of the greenhouse gases in the course of the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations supporting most of the burden in the coming years.
The text that could supply the basis with a final political agreement to control greenhouse gases, has underlined the remaining obstacles, as far as it has clarified the path to set.
But it has been seen as being an important overhang in the negotiations that lack time, with more than 100 leaders of the whole world arriving the next week in Copenhagen.
Written by a group of special work of the UN the text does not say how much the rich countries would give to the poor ones to bear climate change, to course and at long term.
And it offers a broad scale of options for the key issues, including the way of which the developed new economics and emerging economics could reduce their production of carbon and what would be the superior limit of the increase of the world temperature that the persons in charge would be ready to tolerate.
It gives a great deal of flexibility to in the process, has said John Coequyt, Representing àWashington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has written six pages of the document, has studied a text of negotiations of 180 pages to concentrate on what the executive Secretary General has described on the UN climate change, Yvo of Boer, as being "the complete picture".
It shows the guiding lines of a possible agreement in which the industrial nations would reduce collectively their emissions to 2020, of 25 to 45 percent in relation to 1990 levels, even though the main developping countries, in the course of the same period, reduced theirs of 15 to 30 percent.
Together the countries would reduce the emissions between 50 and 95 percent for 2050.
The European Union also has relaunched the negotiations, Friday, promising to supply $3.6 billion per annum for the next three years to help the poorest countries to adapt themselves of climate change to the impact - to bear the floods and the drought or to avoid the deforestation.
However, Friday the same verbal clashes have happened, which have dominated the negotiations for the past week.
Todd Stern, Representative of the United States to the climate negotiations has thrown back every discussion obliging the reduction of the greenhouse gases by the countries industrialized, in comparison with the voluntary efforts realized by the main emerging economics, if these were not financed by the developed countries.
This change is the signal that the administration Obama becomes harder to China than the administration Bush was it, two years ago.
The United States are not going to sign an agreement without efforts and actions of the major developing countries, said Stern that regretted also the text not insisting enough to check that the reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern has made his comments an hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister for foreign affairs, He Yafei has declared that us that the principal negotiator, or lacked "common sense", or was "extremely irresponsible" to have said earlier in the week than the United States would not help financially China to fight against global warming.
With the future economic paths of major world powers at stake, shortcomings have appeared at the same time within the Third World and between the industrial world and the emerging economies.
Current battle concerns more the rescue of the individual economies that the rescue of the planet, with the and the United States quarreling themselves on their respective obligations even though the poorer nations stress the fact than the two dozen countries the most influential ignore the scientific imperatives of acting more bravely.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate of Costa Rica, has declared that it was not amazing that the major powers fight to know who should suffer the costs of the reduction of greenhouse gases, even if the vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the big emitters responsible for their actions.
It is really is a game in which is developed a new economic hegemony, has said Ulate, which is also an Adviser on the climate for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these more vulnerable countries to impact of climate change have indicated than they would continue put the pressure to obtain a treaty obliging legally, in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say that the negotiations will lead at least, to a political agreement.
The Alliance of the Small Insular States that gathers 43 members, has written a suggestion of treaty of 24 pages, early on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Leader of the climate unity of the European Commission, has said that action of the small island has "put political pressure on the full political process, in part by it that they are now unified and for which they ask to the emerging economics such as the and the India, of acting.
The debates have become a matter of urgency, even though the delegates concentrated on the fact that they had to solve most of the problems pending before the leaders of governments arrive to an agreement.
Persons in charge of high level such as the Minister of the Indian environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice-Ministre have gone down from their plane and have thrown themselves to the building of the to attend to meetings in hearing - orchard and to conferences of information, in order to be able to make complaints that will be studied in the course of the next week.
Real picture of the Assembly - in the course of which 13 000 people enter and take out conference of the every day - players activists of guitar present night shows laughing themselves of the countries that according to them, betray themselves and that suggestions are written and they are distributed on paper rather than by emails - constitute a true challenge.
The intensity makes only to increase: important: almost all the ministers are here and not more late that on Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We enter to the court of the great ones, has declared Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice-president for the global policy of International.
The heavy trucks happen.
In Great Britain the first package to 225 km / H is going to redefine the syndrome of the Monday
To 5h13, Monday morning, a signal will pierce the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a revolution of the transport in Great Britain.
The first train of suburbs to great speed of the country will reach 225 km / hr, even though it will thread of Ashford, in the Kent, in London St Pancras, covering the 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of the Transports, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first train of suburbs Javelin outside London.
He expects from fast and reliable trains that the new service will allow in Great Britain integrating an international network and will connect the great conurbations of the Midlands, of the North and of Scotland to London.
The small lost holes will become cities of commuter flourishing, the durations of business travel will be pretty less long and the transition of the air and from the car to in the process will reduce the national emissions of carbon dioxide all reducing the traffic jams on congestion on the roads.
In theory the three main political parties adherent to this project.
But the ten billion books necessary to build a new reinforced network, the battle of inevitable planning and the fears of dangers for the environment risk to slow down the lines to great speed British.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a society created in January to realize a feasibility report for the government, will give back Lord Adonis its document on 30 December.
That will allow him to obtain a detailed card from the route of the next stage foreseen for the high-speed network.
The new line connecting London to the West Midlands will be outlined in the five meters of the urban zone and of the sites where impact on the environment will be able to be debated.
In the campaign, the plan will be outlined up to 25 metres final journey.
Also it is foreseen that HS2 presents three options for a network to great speed greater, going to the north.
Lord Adonis will reply to in the spring.
Privileged options are put forward in a format, for which a high-speed line will go up to the West Midlands.
The line will separate itself in two to or close to Birmingham, with a branch going to the west of the Pennines àManchester and Scotland and another going to the north-east, to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
Single line will cross Scotland.
"It seems that it will be the best option has said a professional performance has suggested a professional performance of rail transport.
When it will be finished, the time of journey between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 p.m. 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open before 2025, will allow to all the passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, in relation to a trip to an hour presently.
The suggestions will allow at the train traveling at 400 km / hr, giving back the fastest British network of in the world.
Original route is conceived to allow trains of 400 m of length and being able to transport 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can work on a line London -.
A terminal being able to hold 20000 passengers by hour would be necessary.
Being given the constraints of space, it is predicted that a existing station will be enlarged to receive the high-speed network.
The experts of the industry of the rail declare that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this opportunity.
Lord Adonis will announce if he thinks or not that the project must set up, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it throws the machine, the network will have to be built one by one.
The trains will be first and foremost obliged to roll out of the lines to great speed on the existent rails to the north of Birmingham, preserving durations of journey between London and Scotland superior to three hours.
This solution seems to be the best to assure a passage from the airplanes to the trains, constituting a reference point for the revolution of the railways.

The lawyer of the director franco - Polish Roman Polanski has asked for a new time Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States), the abandonment of the proceedings against his client, presently assigned to residence in Switzerland for a business of customs of more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the director of the " pianist ", has denounced in front of three judges of the court of appeal of the second district of California of serious mistakes of procedure at the moment of the facts, in 1977.
I ask for abandonment of the burden here and maintaining, has declared Mr. Hummel, before adding that the behavior of judge of the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back".
According to it, judges it Rittenband - dead for - would have discussed, before giving back his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved the prison - what constitutes a serious for want of procedure.
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary "Romance Polanski: wanted and desired" (Novel Polanski, sought-after and wanted), of even of the public prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally had declared thin September "to have lain" to author of the programme.
If the court would refuse to abandon the prosecution, Mr. Hummel has asked for the dress of a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his arguments.
The accusation has of his side reiterated the blurb already developed in first instance, that is to say that any abandonment of the burden seriously could be studied as long as Roman Polanski did not appear in front of the court.
The director, aged of 76 years, had escaped from the United States in 1978, before the pronounced one of his sentence, for "illegal sexual relationships" with a minor of 13 years.
Never it has replaced their feet in the for.
The prosecutor attached from the county of Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayama, has thus declared that Roman Polanski "must be there to appear to the audience".
In this case, one wants to send the message, not only to (Novel Polanski) but also to other defendants, who it is possible to escape?, has asked for Mme Asayama.
For it, the director "asks for a favour to the Court while scorning its authority".
One of the three judges - which have now 90 days to give back their decision - has underlined it also "that there were other alternatives to the brain ".
Hummel was not the only one to require the abandonment of the Roman Polanski prosecuted.

It remains in the narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very weak and I think that is going to remain the case until at the end of the year.
The tendency has been supported by the publication of economic indicators better than predicted, that "have contributed to improve the opinion of the market as for the solidity of the economic resumption", have summarized the analysts of Charles Schwab.
In the United States, the sales of retail have increased in 1,3% in November for the second consecutive months of sharpened and well more that predicted.

The news of Johnny Hallyday "is very positive", has insured Friday his son David to his arrival to the airport of Los Angeles where he had to go to the bedhead of his father hospitalized since several days.
The news is very positive.
It is very loudly, that happens very well, has declared to the press David Hallyday to his exit of the airplane that took it of Paris little after local 13H00 (21H00 GMT).
The son of the air singer, relaxed, has assured that he was going to go "in a very fast way" to the hospital Cedars-Sinaï of Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday has been admitted Monday for an infection consecutive to the operation of a slipped disc on November 26th in Paris.
The singer has been "placed in artificial coma this night in Los Angeles for reasons of convenience, to prevent it from suffering and to be able to administer him his treatment", has indicated the press office.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in coma artificial by the doctors of the hospital Cedars-Sinaï of Los Angeles, where it had been admitted Monday for an infection consecutive to the operation of a slipped disc on 26 November in.
The singer has had to be operated again in the night of Wednesday at Thursday because of important lesions resulting from this speech.
His wife Laeticia has gone on Friday morning to the French secondary school of Los Angeles where their girl Jade is sent to school, to attend school a spectacle, has noticed a photographer of the AFP.
The leader of orthopedic and traumatological surgery of the hospital of the Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, has announced that he would surrender Monday in Los Angeles next to the singer.
The producer has violently questioned Dr Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who has operated on the singer on November 26th at the international Clinic of the park Monceau in Paris.
One has told us that it was a massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles have said that they were exaggerated, has declared Mr. Camus.
I have intended to talk about a possible judicial procedure to come, it has said.
Jean-Claude Camus has considered that Johnny Hallyday had "left much for Los Angeles in a too fast way, with authorisation of the Paris surgeon".
I have not had this doctor in anybody online who has assured me that there was not no problem for this journey and that had me dumbfounded, given that I have had myself two slipped discs, it has added.
Little beforehand on RTL, it had indicated that the singer had apparently "left without drain, without nothing," after the operation of Paris.
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is very well-known in the artistic environment.
It had made the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, some days before his death, in a clinic of Neuilly-sur-Seine where it worked at that time.
In 2007, it had also made the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma subsequent to a brain drain.
But he is also a doctor to the sulphurous reputation, condemned on several occasions by the Court of Justice, in files in medical responsibility, as for tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the order of the Doctors, has it marked of being "a man without unscrupulous " hounded " regularly " with the order in the face of the Advice, and who is "far from being commendable".
After several days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux has expressed himself Friday by the device of his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This has indicated "that the intervention" had perfectly "well taken" place and that the post-operating examinations were " normal ".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and did not require therefore the laying of a ", it has added.
In any case, the round of the singer, of whom the singer, whose health problems multiplies for this summer, seems among aside.
Of every obviousness, one resumption of the tour on January 8th (to Amiens, ndlr) as expected, that seems very short, has declared Mr. Camus.
The association UDF raises the tone and charges to the New one Center of not using anymore her initials
The association UDF, controlled by the MoDem of François Bayrou, has reacted on Friday to the attempt of OPA of the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, on the acronym of the one ex-left giscardien, putting it in residence of not using it anymore on any support, on pain of prosecution.
Hervé Morin has announced publicly his intention of recovering the acronym UDF, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend its political heritage after having tightened to the left.
Moreover the Defense Secretary, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy Saturday in the face of the national Advice of the NC.
To support this approach, it has received the support of Mr of Charette (ex UMP passed to the NC) that claims the property of the brand UDF to have been the first to put it down in 2004 to the national Institute of the industrial property.
But on Friday evening, the office of the association UDF, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not intend to let themselves dispossess, has gone out of its silence to launch to the minister and to the honourable member a formal notice, charging to them not to use it anymore the label and of passing on the property to them of the brand, on pain of judicial pursuits.
You have multiplied in recent days, the declarations indicating that you were going to propose political movement of to your political movement the acronyms UDF, written the association in a mail signed by 19 of the 24 members of the Bureau, of which François Bayrou and Marielle of Sarnez of the MoDem, as the centrist senator Jean Arthuis de l'Alliance.
Also you have thought good of making to follow on your militant equipment and on the fly leaf of your site, the name of this movement, the, of the slogan, notice the signatories to the letter.
As you do not ignore it, you do not have any right to the use of it symbol, explains the office of the UDF that puts the NC of withdrawing "immediately the mention of the name from the UDF of all support thus" in is "only of (her) site internet".
He asks also to Hervé of Charette "of transmitting the property of (the) brand to her legitimate having right".
If you did not make it the courts would be seized to make to respect the law and the legitimate rights of the adherent ones of the UDF, warn the signatories.
In their letter, they clarify that the UDF "is a political movement fully for 1978" and remind that Mr. Morin and his friends "had made the choice" of leaving it in 2007 to create a movement competitor, as others had made it in 2002, to create the UMP.
The New center does not have therefore, according to them, any right to use the acronyms UDF (for French democracy).
They remind also that the last Congress of has voted in 2007 his adhesion to the modem for three years and the creation of an office responsible to defend "the material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valéry Giscard of Estaing.
As for Hervé of Charette, pursues the office, "while he has put down the brand", it was not "no more adherent of for three years", but to the UMP.
It benefits scandalously and fraudulently of the abscence of deposit of the acronym UDF to carry it out for its consideration.
This tactlessness is transforming into crime, they denounce, before gibing on the strategy of the NC: "He seems us that in politics, as in the life, it is worthier of making a name to itself by himself than of trying to go out of the anonymity taking a name fraudulently to which one does not have right".
Business Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be judged for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre has decided Friday of judging the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine, if, as the girl of the multimillionaire Liliane Bettencourt accuses it of it, it has taken advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenarian to despoil it of a part of its wealth.
The photographer of 62 years, known for its pictures of stars, will be judged on April 15th and 16th, 2010 for abuse of weakness, an offense punished for a maximum penalty of three years of imprisonment and of 375.000 euros of fine.
This decision means that a trial will be well in this business worthy of a saga on one of the families richest in France, in which mother and girl tear apart all keeping the reins of empire of cosmetics L'Oréal.
But the 15th criminal bedroom also has organized that a medical expert evaluation of Liliane Bettencourt, aged of 87 years, should be led collégialement by three doctors.
The heir and main shareholder heir and of always has refused to subject itself to such an examination, in any case not in the conditions proposed by the parquet of during the investigation.
The doctors referred to on Friday will have to replace a report before 10 March 2010 saying notably if Liliane Bettencourt has been able to feel in a state of weakness and at what periods.
I think that it will subject itself to it.
I am going to talk about it to him, has declared to the exit of the audience the lawyer of Mme Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman.
For its part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, has congratulated of the decision of the court.
It is excellent news (...) The expert evaluation will demonstrate that him (Mr. Banier) has manipulated this grandmother that one must protect, it has asserted.
For two years, the unique girl of Liliane Bettencourt has started pursuits to the criminal one contrary to François-Marie Banier, photographer and artist meddler, who it accuses of having benefited for years of the weakness of his mother to obtain a billion euros of gifts, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or pictures of masters.
Of its part, Liliane Bettencourt always has refuted to have been manipulated by the photographer, who she considers as a friend of long date.
Even though the court had to examine the admissibility of the action engaged by Mme Bettencourt-Meyers ruling, the lawyers have sometimes turned to the great family display on Friday.
Thus, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt has stated three letters sent by his customer (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his lawyer, in which it said to mistrust the husband of.
In the dated mail of 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "you could explain to my daughter that I have written a time to Banier, two times day for fifteen years.
Françoise, never I have been able to talk to him for his marriage".
For its part the public prosecutor of again has considered that the complainant was not admissible to act, accordingly more that a judge of the guardianships has refused these last days of looking right to his request of opening a procedure of judicial protection for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity for acting in justice, it is not under protection and does not have sponsor.
Nobody else has to act to his place", has asserted the representative of the public prosecutor's office.
The court has finally decided that it would pronounce once the trial will have taken place on the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers.
Revolution managériale or end of the economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of the great French companies, our fighting for the development of the economic intelligence will have been empty...
For more than ten years, the attitude of the management of major companies in respect of its employees, reminds the position of the companies face to face of the consumers before the revolution marketing: it is a matter of making to adhere the colleagues to " values " determined of above as it was a matter in the past, of imposing products thought by the technicians of the plant to the consumer.
Putting the consumer to at the heart of the company the revolution has called the marketing has replaced the strategies of conquest from of markets to the place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected of the factors of preferences of the customers comes back regularly!
A demobilization of employees can lead on to a mortiferous demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the part emerged from a much more general phenomenon that touches in particular the frames.
This demobilization compromises seriously the development of all intellectual functions of the company, notably of the R&D and, more still, of the economic sense.
Indeed, l'IE "requires all setting parts (...) a proactive approach and a prospective vision"; it requires on behalf of employees a commitment that the proceeds of crime authoritarian management totally annoy.
It is why we call to a revolution managériale that would consist in putting the staff to at the heart of the concerns of the firm to in the same way as the customer.
The very relative usefulness of internal investigations of opinion
Are the internal inquiries of opinion -as the questionnaire subjected by Orange to his wage earners- going to incite to this revolution in the managériales practices?
Unfortunately, I fear that not.
First because I have been able to notice that, in view of a new situation, every structure happens finally, after many bends, to make prioritairement... what it has always made.
Afterwards, parce the authoritarianism -one of the conditions of the growing passed - grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
Finally, because most of the leaders have a simplistic of human behaviour.
Stemming from the great schools of engineers, they have a mechanistic interpretation to the psychology profession.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, reactivated lately by the American " neuroscience " and largely diffused, to their knowledge, by Institutes of education and the media.
Thus, suggesting that it is possible to handle the " levers " (sic) of the commitment of the frameworks, a recent inquiry of Ipsos seemed in The Figaro.fr reinforces the leaders in a posture of gouvernance mechanistic, unsuitable to in the world.
Identifying and measuring the factors of mobilisation
On the contrary, the managériale revolution necessary for the efficient working of the modern companies, supposes of adopting a final vision of human behaviour.
It consists in integrating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental report: for the wage earners the commitment to the company is possible only if this appears clearly as a means of realizing a part of their dreams, of their ambitions, of their projects.
Presently, only the studies stemming from the motifonctionnelle Analysis adopt this conception of the views of the employees.
These studies have demonstrated that they judge their company basing themselves what it offers them to realize projects of life on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived picture of the company, to evaluate.
Thanks to the identification and to the measure of these factors of mobilisation, the leaders of business can control, to foresee and to anticipate their "social performance" and to replace their management of human resources "in the place".
They create thus a ground favorable to the devised development of a solid and effective economic intelligence.
Speech of Oslo: the "fair war" is praises worth on the right at Obama
Right of the US has greeted on Friday the speech stays up it to Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the price Nobel of the peace 2009 has defended the concept of "fair war" against the enemies of the.
The conservatives, which had taunted the attribution of the prize to Mr. Obama on 9 October, have applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, previous candidate for the vice-presidency during the elections in 2008.
I have liked what he has said, has declared Mme Palin, oracle of right of the Republican Party, to the daily US Today, adding to have itself approached the issue of the war "sometimes essentials" in his dissertations that have just been published.
The war is of course the last thing in my opinion which the Americans want to have to make, but it is necessary.
These terrorists must be stopped very over there, it has valued.
Obama, which has inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and in Afghanistan, has applied Thursday in Oslo to justify the resort to the strength, a way of explaining his decision of sending further 30 000 soldiers in Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another adversary of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, has considered that the president had made in Oslo "of the very good job ".
I have thought that the speech was really very well, has congratulated former president of the House of Representatives, which particularly has appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential intention.
By some side, I have found this speech everything - to - made historical, has declared Mr. Gingrich, questioned during the radio emission "The Takeaway".
The elected antiques, considered by some as a possible candidate for the republican investiture for presidential election in 2012, have said itself delighted to have seen "a president of the left" remind the members of the "that they would not be free and could not replace a price of the peace if the use of force existed not".
For Michael Gerson, old feather of George W. Bush reconverted columnist handed over in the, Mr. Obama has pronounced "a very American speech".
On top of appearing in "citizen of the world" as "it is it always, it has spoken as an American president American", reminding to the Europeans "that they live in a bubble on safety that they have not created and that they do not make much to protect it", has valued Mr. Gerson.
Among the rare ones on the right to not to be not convinced, a falcon of the era Bush, the previous ambassador to the UN John Bolton, has described the speech as "lifeless, turgid and without inspiration" on the site National Review Online.
To the left of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich has worried of seeing Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When one wraps the war in the notion of justice, easily one can justify the killing of innocent, it has warned.
The press of center - left remained however laudatory at the place of the president.
The Los Angeles Times while continuing think that the Nobel has been attributed prematurely to Mr. Obama has qualified his speech of " blockbuster " even for a speaker known for his talent.
The speech of Oslo "should serve as travel warrant to guide the international decisions against the conflicts, the poverty and the oppression", has inflamed the californien daily.
Obama "has pronounced" the speech that was needed", has valued the New York Times, considering it "at the same time dark and building".

The stations front line, with ways that ended in the city, had the reputation at the time of being the relics of the technique of transport of the 19th century that made effect of clog of brake of modern railway traffic because a lot of time was needed formerly to make the locomotives of back at the pass to the front.
Ruling, short, allots is that which it is needed to make.
It is why the stations front line must disappear: at Frankfurt and at Munich.
And to Stuttgart also: a station of passage of the trains, which is halfway about on the trans-European Masterly one of the rail between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava of where the slogan "heart of Europe".
The realization of the project S21 is really going to begin, although the visions of the 1980s are not compatible anymore for long to the reality.
The most ambitious planners have admitted that the cost, to bury the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and of Bavaria, was exorbitant.
To tell the truth, park them front line do not put more truly of problems of entry and of exit since there are modern, reversible trains with railcars and transports - pilot to both ends.
Though one launches at present the achievement of stuttgart 21 beside the new layout of the inter city line to Ulm.
The regional and local political ones have taken it.
Company of the railways is of the part because, it is the taxpayer that makes the cost of the risks of the greatest project of infrastructure of Federal Republic and not the public.
Of point of view this project lets itself relatively well to justify.
One obtains an urban area that - if one thinks to the graphs of the planners generated by computer - will be very verdant.
For the system of rail transport the S21 is harmful.
Station of transition and the broadening of the section are conceived for a traffic of people to which one attributed - and it is typical of the 1980s - an enormous.
At That Time there was not the competition of from cheap flights yet good cheap.
The policy of modern traffic should concentrate first on the reinforcement of the traffic of goods because the transport by the rail is much more respectful with the environment than by truck on the road.
But the new layout, with his angles, does not suit the goods trains.
The S21, and that is much more serious concerns indirectly well other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros are going to be gulped in the project of the Souabe one.
It is the official number.
Experts think that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
A thing is safe, in the next decade the money will miss for other points of time and of congestion in the network.
The list of the Ministry of transport mentions in all sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the broadening of the section across the valley of Rhine Valley 180 good kilometres.
For 1987 this line is built au ralenti.
Leaning here thoroughly on the mushroom would be really urgent.
But the project makes the effect of a clog of brake.
The route of the valley of the Rhine is in the process of becoming the neck of strangulation of the traffic of freight traffic international, and it in the heart of Europe.
The government examines the sentence given back regarding the airport
At regional parliament in, the government of the Land has evoked the possibility of making call to the sentence of the Administrative Court of Hesse regarding prohibition of night air flights by night.
The Minister of the Economics Dieter Posch (FDP) has announced that the coalition had responsible for the experts of examining of legal point of view the sentence given back by the Administrative Court and who is a document including more than 400 pages.
The Court of Kassel had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the règlementation regarding prohibition of night flights by night in the case or the project of building of the northwest track d'aterrissage of to Frankfurt airport would be fulfilled.
The authorization of attérir for 17 airplanes between 11 p.m. and 5.00 p.m. in the morning, as the government of in the envisages it, is not compatible with the legal protection of the citizens against the night-time air pollution.
The coalition must have decided for on 4 January if she wishes to make an appeal in appeals process against the ruling.
The opposition criticizes this delay and tries to make pressure on the government representative so that celui-cirenonce to the appeal next to the Federal Administrative Court of Leipzig.
The leader of the Socialist Group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to bring back to their promise made before the elections and who consisted in forbidding the flights by night. Otherwise, that will be condidéré as a total breach to a given word.
It is damned difficult to be allowed to keep its word, has said the leader of the Tarek Al-Wazir referring to the éléctoral slogan of the FDP "We hold our promises".
The Minister Dieter Posch refutes the accusations of that claims that the government of the Land tries nevertheless to authorize the night flights by night using "chicanery and craftiness".
Takes time is needed to carry out a precise legal examination.
The coalition does not want to set of decision on the basis of a "first fast impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition regarding the declarations of his fraction on prohibition of night flights by night is completely érronée.
The American banks reimburse the allocated help
The big American banks, very touched by the crisis, do away with their links face to face from the State.
The Bank of America has announced Wednesday that it had reimbursed in full to the 45 billion dollars (more than 30 billion Euros), corresponding to the help granted within the framework of the plan of rescue Tarp.
The chaine of American television CNBC has made knowledge during a report that Citigroup planned also to reimburse the received help.
The banked institutions try thus to dispose of the taxable restrictions, which accompanied the acceptance with of sums, as for example the limitation of the attributed bonuses to the leader thus that the regulation of higher charges.
The Bank of Americaa thrown a capital increase by the sale of titles next to the investors that has brought back 19 billion dollars of fresh money to him.
Rest of the sum comes from the crates of the bank that are well filled thanks to the sale with many branches of other sectors.
Wednesday last night, Kenneth Lewis the Chief Executive Officer of the Bank of America has held expressly to thank the American taxpayers: injections of capital has considerably helped a difficult period to surmount.
The banked institution had overestimated its capacities purchasing the bank of investment Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup plans also to obtain money on the financial markets in order to free itself from the guardianship of the State.

Spokesman of did not wish to comment on this information.
In June the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had reimbursed the government stocks that they had benefited from.
Accelerated election
Finally everything has nevertheless happened in a faster way than be predicted.
Hardly two weeks after the dismissal of the present advocate of the post of redacteur in head Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the azf German process ZDF, the successor already is named.
The commission wished to vote yesterday night to carry out the nomination.
Peter Frey who leads the azf Berlin was the great man.
The chaine has not wished however to confirm - officially - the vote in order to not anticipate the procedure.
Though, it seems that it has had also the desire as it not to harm more to the bursar of the ZDF Markus Schächter if the suggestion would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is the candidate of Schächter, needed the vote of 9 members of the Commission on 14.
Result of the vote was not yet known at the fence of the drafting of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had offered to the Board of Directors to prolong of five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender but that had been thrown back.
Alone 7 members of the had declared themselves favorable to the renewal of Brender and 7 others had voted against. The dismissal by vote of represented a failure cooking well that predictable for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU that is predominant to the Board of Directors already had let hear several weeks before the vote, not to want to take back Brender to his post.
She is Roland Koch, the Minister - President of the Land of Hesse that had organized a league against the editor.
It had refused that the contract of the very valued redacteur in leader is prolonged invoking the fact that the rate of listening of the emissions of information of the ZDF had lowered under Brender.
It is the reason why protests had still taking place, practically up to the vote, flaying the increasing political influence trained on the ZDF.
In the end there were even 35 experts in public law that had interfered in the debate and who considered that the way of acting of Koch was unconstitutional.
But that will not have served for anything.
Peter Frey: who is it?
Peter Frey has been born on 4 August 1957 to.
He has studied the sciences - policies, the etles pedagogy languages Romance (Spain) .
Afterwards he has worked on the (body radio of Rhénanie - Palatinate) and in the Frankfurter Rundschau (German daily national scope) .
In 1983 he becomes editor within the ZDF first and foremost at the magazine of topicality " heute-journal " (newspaper of today).
Its journey continues: of 1988 to 1990 he was the assistant of the editor - in - leader of the time; then corresponding to Washington in 1991/1992, afterwards and up to in 1998 it was head and presenter of the " Morgenmagazins " (emission of bimonthly information presented the morning); up to in 2001 it was responsible for the service of foreign policy of the ZDF then leader of the Berlin wording.
After the disgrace of, even though this had just been elected journalist of the year by the review specialized Medium Magazin, the Greens have announced that they would put down a constitutional complaint
The adversary of Koch to the Board of Directors, the Minister - President of Rhénanie - Palatinate Kurt Beck, has declared the Intergovernmental ZDF Treaty the last week that the Länder should transform so that the suggestions of staff of the bursar can not be blocked by a political majority biased.
Though, Beck does not plan to ask for the withdrawal of political personalities members of the commissions of surveillance of the ZDF.
Peter Frey, the likely successor of skillfully had manoeuvred next to the Board of Directors criticizing the commission with vehemence in his decision of dismissing Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schächter was in a position to proposing it for the post of editor - in - leader without to lose the face, as the Board of Directors could take up it without one the soupconne of placing political support to the post.
In the representations arithmethic of the parties, Frey is classified liberal of left.
Clean-up in university studies
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike the Ministers of the education and of the cultural businesses of the Länder decide to appear more conciliatory: during a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the conference of vice-chancellors, an agreement has been designed stipulating that the conditions of work of the students Bachelor or Master had to be improved.
In Future, the students should be able to be in a position to coming to end of their studies.
In particular they have started of accordpour to reduce the burden of single screening tests: single screening must allow clore the selected module of study.
Furthermore, the workload will have to be reconsidée to guarantee "realistic and satisfactory proportions".
Political authorities and the educational establishments higher wish to facilitate the gratitude of examinations between the universities and abroad.
Besides the Länder have committed to organizing common structural conditions more flexible for the paths of Bachelor and of Master.
At regional level, there must not be règlementation different from a Land at the other one.
Less examinations
From the beginning of the student protests in last June, the Minister of education of the and the university rectors have constantly to the mouth expression to the way: " étudiabilité ".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take one practical significance.
Council of accreditation has decided to reduce the number of certain tests considerably: "Every module in a normal way must be able to be concluded by a single review ", one can read in a document of thirty pages on the future conditions of admission to the university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, President of accreditation, President of the Council declares that reducing clearly the burden of examinations one should be able to stop the skids, which harmed the étudiabilité considerably.
Moreover the " étudiabilité " should be, in future, the decisive criterion of the organization of studies.
The modules all as the bottom owe to be examined tidily to see if one can not avoid this sensation of suffocation that one feels sometimes of course in the choice.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the last knowledge in RAID on Kunduz, opposition believes that the Defense Secretary Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deceit.
The students should have the opportunity and the maneuvering space necessary to allow and to favor personal initiative.
New regulation will concern access to new university cycles but it will also be adapted to the existing cycles.
These cycles must "be re-accredited" every 5 years, it that means though, which it is only in 2015 that all the cycles will have been examined.
There are 10 competent agencies of accreditation on whole of the federal territory that depend of the Council of accreditation created by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of the education had exerted a certain amount of pressure on so that they weigh on the agencies so that the programs are not responsible too much and the system of examinations not too strict.
In some Länder, the universities and the schools specialized superiors are themselves already heard with their regional ministries to take the appropriate measures.
The Rhénanie - palatinate is until now the only to have given his agreement to grant more means to the development of the bologna process.
With these funds, the universities must organize tutorielset programs to reinforce the offices of pedagogic direction as the offices of the examinations and of examinations and the service of international relations
The Länder and the universities foresee a budget of eur 10 million for that.
Beginning 2010, the government wishes to put down an amendment to the Parliament to the law on higher education institutions superior.
With reference to that it will not be needed to go by more than only one examination to clore their studies.
Organisation of studies will have to be more flexible, furthermore it is needed to be able to guarantee the gratitude of the summaries of bills of other institutions superior and access to the must be simplified.
Of here the end of next year, the, l"étudiabilité" of all the academic cycles will have of the to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition have again discussed the question of the conditions of studies in the country.
The décisionsont appreciated but of some criticisms he are made to hear.
The federal President of Union of students Socialists has made of the Ministers and of rectors ' of ministers and universities knowledge which he would hope that Organisation of education policy does not pass to itself no more in future "behind the closed doors".
To the more late after the educational strike, the students as concerned people should be able to express a bit.
The future diplomés of higher education one receipt the support of the President of the delegates of the conference of the priests (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: " experience of students is us very useful" it has said Thursday during a meeting with the Ministers of the education of the Länder with which the HRK works on a common project of reform.
For the union of the education and of the sciences (GEW) the decisions made in Bonn do not go enough far. It asks for the right and the possibility for every graduated Bachelor of registering itself at a round of.
Andreas Keller member of the steering committee of asks besides that the Länder assure the students Bachelor of today, which will be tomorrow sufficiently of places for studies in Master and the conditions of studies as good as possible.
The Länder therefore must hire more of responsible for lesson.
On the other hand, the Ministers of the education have not evoked the possibility of reducing access to the.
More that a bill at the bottom of footnote on
It is by these words «Arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, nearly more of control... that a work of the poet begins, in which he thématise in scraps of disturbing sentences, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who has won the freedom but has lost at the same time its territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 to Banat in Romania, has been first and foremost a teacher of German and of English to and, thereafter, manager of collection in a publishing house for young people before settling in Frankfurt on the Hand.
Söllner has received several literary prize; in 1993 it kept the pulpit very lusted after of poetry of the university Goethe of Frankfurt and for 2002 it is guiding of the forum of literature of Hesse at home of artist of Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
It has made a lot talk about it in circles literary not last Tuesday, during a conference in Munich, whose theme was "The German literature in Romania in the mirror and the mirror distorting Securitate from your files".
Visibly destabilized and bothered, Söllner made Securitate a declaration in which it recognized in front of his germano-roumains writers colleagues as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that it had collaborated as informer by the political police.
Söllner has received in 1989 the price of the German language jointly with some of the participants.
Testing of recruitment had begun insidiously in 1971.
I am, ends up Söllner «therefore somebody that sufficiently has not known to resist auxessais of intimidation of the ».
The poet Werner Söllner is the informer Walter (IM Walter).
Nearly simultaneously with the honoration of the price Nobel for Herta Müller and his exemplary literary disputes with the mechanisms of the power of the dictatorship, the literary stage is shaken and in particular the community of the originating German authors of Romania, by a case that shows clearly the abyss and the meanness of a political system, based on the police surveillance and the espionage.
Werner Söllner is not only guilty but also a victim, as far as one can say current knowledge of after.
In his own dossier, IM Walter has played a role, insure the specialist in the literature Michael Markel after the confession of and it refers to positive influence of IM Walter that had interceded in his favor.
« it had been able to get it out of all the difficult situations at that time», according to Markel.
Markel has felt the moralde need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made its statement and in front of public before it was unexpected, though the confession of some dissident antiques of its cooperation with the secret services in Romania is not in fact, not so much surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the spies of the Securitate already had written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper «Die Zeit», after having read the 914 pages of its own dossier.
One can suppose that the victims will have made of speculation and will sometimes have guessed what real names were hidden last the names of borrowings Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Contrary to the Germany where between time the consultation of the files of the Stasi is a reliable, the attitude encounter of the inheritance of the files of the is still very confused.
Systematic clarification has constantly been thwarted and slowed down in the past.
It is not that in 1999 that a national advice corresponding to the institution Birthler has been created to work on the assimilation of the archives of the Securitate (CNSAS) but the return of cases rather has dragged for.
There is for 2005 a law that defines the management of archives.
That the influence of previous members of the Securitate in is still very big, is confirmed by the interview of some antiques responsible for the Securitate of Temesvar that, after the announcement of the delivery of the prize Nobel for Herta Müller, expressed itself in disdainful trés way towards the winner.
It had a psychosis, and after all one had questioned it only one time.
Shame of power thought to be able to express here, without none gene, under the place setting of freedom of expression.
Indeed of the essential issues are associated with in the case as that happens so often in a context of hidden guilt.
Why maintaining? Who has been despoiled? The levelheaded reaction listeners, to the admission of, let hope that the continuation of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst of knowing that by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who has received the price Nobel yesterday, it is more than a bill at the bottom of page is.
Uproars in the Champions League
One had the impression that a representative arrived there, gotten out to four pins coming straight ahead of a Christmas party Nice, on which the manufacturer of articles of sport had spread its goods when the new trainer VFB Christian Gross went up at past midnight less quarter past midnight in a class C, which it had just called, an orange plastic bag of the purveyor by hand.
The man, whose bald skull attracted the attention, let itself drive to the city that was it still foreign country.
Otherwise our quinquagénaire would have been able to take himself not stealing it - he had not drunk alcohol and neither it was not wild with happiness.
He had passed a pleasant but tomorrow evening but tomorrow the work must be recovered.
Because it is now that was going to begin.
The words of the Switzerland that one had just engaged three days earlier were clear: « well we have affected the eighth of final », in other words in the league of the champions thanks to our 3: 1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania» but we must not leave us to blind by the success. It will be a brutal fight not to fall".
The «big work» waits for us on Sunday.
There, it is a matter of repeating champions to Mainz the results of the league at the daily.
And the weaknesses will have to be surmounted that have redone surface after the three expeditious goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Drawing of lots
The eighth of finale of the Champions League (game to go 16./17. + 23./24 February/ match return 9./10. March) will be pulled to the fate on the 18. December in.
Joy of the in office livid of the successor of was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not moderated uniquely among the one that had carried luck, which had passed on to the professionals of Stuttgart destabilized, a motivation without motivated and the pleasure of working.
I have been to see the players and I have told to them that they had to concentrate on their assets, I have recommended to them to be braver, explained the "plumber of the souls" - Big - the recipe of the success that rang if bienmais that did not make more effects with the trainer Babbel.
It has started a certain magic, confessed to Jens Lehmann - in favour of -, "in the foot when there is a new impulse he manages sometimes without the things that never one would have thought possible".
And Sami Khedira that, after weeks of break for wound, advanced to the row of the best player thanks to its dynamism, tried to describe the « phenomenon » noticed by a proverbial« wind expenses» and the method of work of the new head: «It is» somebody «that passes to the action and requires discipline.
It is what we need in the current situation».
But apparently Babbel had lacked it.
The VfB Stuttgart yet has not passed the cape, warned the threshold, warned the manager
For the time being, VfB Stuttgart has in need of tenacity.
All as Big, the players and the manager avoid well overvaluing the victory against a totally exceeded and weakened defense of the Romanian guests.
Also they had won in Glasgow before having had four days more late a bad waking to Leverkusen with the 0:4, put forward to Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, signaled that well they had reached one of the objectives of the season but that they had as it of other that were still well far.
We have not yet passed the difficult cape.
That Heldt on the day of its 40th anniversary does not have not the heart to make the party, even after the first victory to domicile since three months, is of the to the events of the weekend that a televised interview of the guardian of made just bounce before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others set and not Jens, thwarted Heldt, in response to the criticism of.
It had accused the direction of weakness of style and says about pubertal fans that she had decided to change trainer under the pressure.
Lehmann had judged also as a sign of lack of sovereignty and of made jalousiele that its matches free day of free after the matches has been removed it.
Statements of «were marked by a pure selfishness» pushed in Heldt and announced consequences for the guardian of purpose.
They did not risk anymore to become friendly for the lives these two quadragénaires.
In every cast, they were agreed for everything else, that is to say without the preliminary work of the group by the replaced trainer, strong sporting representation and combative would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants have been «for a large part of the success» retorted Heldt and Lehmann in unison - and even the man to the plastic bag acquiesced.

Worlds of Dreams
Some see, very bright, of the pictures and hear voices that nobody else sees nor hears.
It is not only by the mental ill, or under the effect of the drug, which the limits between the imagination and the reality merge.
As long as these phenomena appear during the sleep, everything is very fine.
When we are lengthened in our darkened bedrooms, we can devote ourselves to Dreams and to the maddest fantasies without obstacles.
Though that, bright, is the experience of state to dream, hears and sees things that the others do not perceive, has in a fast way the reputation in our western world of being insane or drug addict, or at least of being an original.
Such images and votes do not appear only by the mental ill or under the effect of the drug.
It is our imagination that is in question: it is the same neuronic activity that allows us to conceive houses, to paint pictures or to write books, but that incites sometimes the limits between the dream, madness and reality and the reality to dissolve.
A state of conscious awakening, taking the form of a dream, can appear under the most diverse forms, in the best of the cases one calls that of the visions, at the worst of the madness.
But even if the release mechanism and the effect distinguish themselves, the visions of the mysticism Hildegard von Bingen, the experiences of drug of the prophet of the New Age Carlos Castaneda, the states second of the chamanes, the psychoses and the hallucinations are imputable to the process very similar.
There are hallucinations or excesses while balances it, of the neurotransmettrices substances of the brain - in every first place the dopamine, the noradrénaline, the serotonin and the achétylcholine - breaks and that the interaction between the various parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delirious thoughts appear very often during a schizophrenic scare.
Force of attraction on earth does not have influence anymore on the person.
From ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always studied the relationship between the madness and the dream.
For Aristotle, the hallucinations were a form of rêve-éveillé; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry," noticed in 1861 "a great resemblance between the madness and the dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even" one psychosis with all the irregularities, imagination, excesses and sensory illusions that composes it".
We are in autumn of 2001 when Henning T transforms in person of a comic strip.
His body is in two dimensions to the yelling colors.
The land attraction does not have power anymore on it, it planes at the flood of the ceiling.
It feels a blow.
Behind it creatures of Earth winged, grimacing, the mouth covered with blood, showing the teeth.
They pursue it, give blows of feet to him with heavy blazing boots, throw it against the wall, it feels pains in the whole body.
Of the thundering, spiteful voices, shriek, going out of the walls and of the radio.
No more he can bear them these voices that insult it and humiliate it.
Henning T. extracts two cables from his stereo chain, in fact a circle and the string to a hook set at the ceiling.
It goes up baffle on one and passes the buckle to itself around the neck.
It jumps.
The buckle frees itself.
That serves as lesson for you, cry the voices in a choir to extract from it the eardrum. " go to a clinic and make you cure"!
Today Henning T. has 40 years, he has lived six shrill psychoses, the last date of two years, the first of soon 20 years.
Her has started by the LSD.
The diagnosis: psychosis schizo-affective, paranoid, moreover it is maniaco-dépressif, he takes medicines against depression, the mania, the schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, it is married for three years.
During the hype I have lived on terrible fears and on deep despair.
The illusions are a cruel reality.
Per cent about of the population suffers at least one time in her life schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common illness after depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, the concerned people no more can make the difference between the world affairs and the outside world, they find in a state of wildly excitement, that make that they can suffer from hallucinations, from like megalomaniacs, from madness interpersonal reasons or from persecution.
It is very current of hearing voices - of the voices that command, that comment or that dialog.
The optical hallucinations are not rare either.
The concerned person no more can make the distinction between the important one and the insignificant one, the brain no more can filter disruptive signals, the conscious one is drowned under the country.
All as the dream the hype opens the locks to a tide of ideas and of fantasies stemming from of deeper strata of the conscience.
The perception of reality in the hype is centered on the subject, according to the Teacher Thomas Fuchs, leader of the department of psychiatry of the one FALLEN of Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic finds itself center of the situation, all to a meaning centered on it, in the.
At the same time he finds in a role passive, it is as in a dream, surmounted by the events and can not act on them in an active way.
It is the reason for which the schizophrenic feel often threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the possibility of adjusting the reality, the illusions are a harsh reality, to wake up is excluded.
Making the experience a time in her life of a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, the sensorial and spatial structure of the reality that is perceived during the psychosis, is fundamentally preserved.
The thoughts and the delirious hallucinations are based on the reality, the alienation of the lived takes place in a real framework.
Why our brains makes this kind of caperings, is always an enigma for the researchers.
Exceptional situations can lead everyman to lose momentanément the perception of reality, according to.
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis.
It seems to have a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia as it, but studies on the twins have shown that the genes are not the only determining factors.
The researchers suppose that the concerned people present petty brain damage.
One supposes that the neuronic ripening of the brain is disrupted at a precocious stadium of the development for example by a viral infection of mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what remains still unexplained, it is not the way of which the anomaly of the neuronic system happens and moreover makes it that it does not appear for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role - the stress or a traumatic experience can be a catalyst for psychosis, if though there is predisposition.
Similarly the hallucinogenic drugs can start psychoses because they act on the neurotransmitters.
When our brains warms up.
What is mad, calls us the teacher of psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck, it is that the psychotic ones suffer from their hallucinations and take medicines expensive to do away with it even though others buy drugs loudly expensive to obtain it.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of the illusions is just often a matter of point of view.
Kasten gathers for ten years of the reports on the hallucinations and the phenomena of false images: ten years it has published its results in a work titled "The unreal world in our head".
The hallucinations are well part of the typical concomitant phenomena of the psychoses but also of a huge number of well of other diseases.
One counts psychological problems among them as the borderline or the depression but also a headache, the epilepsy, multiple sclerosis,'s disease or the cranial trauma.
Noticing that in certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations is amazing.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of sections of memory that in a normal way are inhibited.
They take shape when the zones of the brain that treat sensory perceptions, are hyperactive or not sufficiently held back; when our brains warms up but also when there is lack of incentive.
The drugs can start this state everything as a lésion cérébrale or a psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, the stress, the sorrows of love or of exceptional mental or other states.
In recent studies one third of the participants admits to have made at least one time in her life experience of a hallucination.
In been 2005 Sarah K. has 16 years ago, it dwells on a small town in mecklenburg-west and it goes to school.
A young girl everything to look normal to tell the truth.
If there were not the pictures and the voices.
During the recreation, it arrives that a young boy, thin, to the long hair brown-haired, speaks to him.
When it replies to it his friends look at it, not surprised - nobody else sees nor hears this boy.
They think that this young shy girl is a moody dreamer but Sarah K does not dream, it is certain.
It is awakened, hears and sees this boy everything as it sees and hears the girl that is sat beside it on the bench.
She can even perceive its presence momentanément.
It is a good feeling, she finds this young nice.
I am mad?, wonders you it sometimes.
But she knows well that this young and the other models are not real and that they are going to disappear again.
The night the appearances are, in general, frightening.
Often the visions are heavy.
When it is in order, it happens that it can not follow the course because the teacher is fair at presenting a new student in its eyes and his ears even though it is invisible for the others and that the teacher is explaining visibly equation at the picture.
The night the appearances are, in general, frightening.
When, in the darkness of the house, she waits for the sleep that happens too much seldom and well too late, it can not make often the distinction if it is awakened or dreams already, if the pictures that she sees, the grimacing faces or the young girl with sanguinolentes cuts on the arms and the legs are in the face of his open or closed eyes.
Leave me quiet, cries you it to these creatures.
She does not talk to either his parents or his friends about it, they would take it for a mad one.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. has 20 years today.
It has had its box last year and it lives with his friend.
A year ago the hallucinations have stopped.
Since it has gotten in contact by internet with the Internet psychologist she knows very well that it is not mad.
The madness is also a work of art of despair.
When anybody is socially isolated or does not have incentives sufficiently, the probability is big that it has hallucinations at the end of some time.
I suppose that the brain enough not being occupied, sees to it only it is of the animation.
Sarah K., unique girl, was afraid of the other children when it was small and played often all alone.
His hallucinations began when it taught 13 years, which the man that she called daddy, since it was in age of thinking, was not its true father.
It is the same brain areas that are active for the visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for the actual noise impressions and actual noise, it is therefore very difficult for the people as Sarah K of making the difference between the illusion and the reality. "Every experience", according to Kasten "has in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are also pictures that form in the brain, it is why they seem so real."
For Kasten night, the dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not distinguish fundamentally of those in psychoses shrill.
Contrary to of schizophrenic, the mentally healthy person is capable of admitting that the fantasies are not real images.
It is why Kasten recommends to his patients to cherish the hallucinations as a particular talent.
There is only a step between the dream and the hallucination.
In our world too much centered on the conscience one has unfortunately in a fast way tendency to take the imaginary experiences as pathologies, according to, teacher to Heidelberg and doctor leader of the mental health clinic and psychotherapy of the hospital Florence Nightingale to Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful illness but who also contains something of positive, of creator - the madness is a work of art of the despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has studied the form of experience said oniroïde, a particular form of the modification of the conscience awakened by the dream.
The oniroïdes experiences are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as realities by the one that saw them and that it can not differ from the dream even while it is in a state of awakening.
The oniroïde state of consciousness appears during a trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for the affected patients of polyradiculopathie that fully conscious, are the experience of a paralysis engine.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of itself and of the world, owed to a total and lasting inability to move, it replaces this real situation that undermines to their lives, by his own imaginary world that is dissociated of the reality.
It is a state of mental limit between the dream and the hallucination.
As surmounting the situation in the reality is not possible a change in the world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is a matter in fact, of an intense form of resources and of interpretation, in a situation in itself intolerable, a capacity of organization that is given to us, of ours the men, not to sink in the emptiness of the loss of conscience.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurichois Peter Cornelius Classen, historian of art describes also his oniroïdes experiences in his book "Change of heart" as action of maintenance of the soul.
It has 49 years, at a time where her conscious part for a journey of several days after the operation of a corneas followed by of a transplant; for this time her body is condemned to remain still in regeneration.
Claussen dives into a world that it has created from all parts, visit of the foreign places journey in time. He sees itself in old man confined to bed in a railroad sanatorium, a robot to his bedhead watching over his health.
It lives to in the Middle Ages among nobles who produce of drugs at base of blood.
It is taken by a Greek at motorbike that carries it to his country, he surfs with his Korean Mafia bed of hospital in the névé of the and meeting a.
He completely applies itself in this dream world, everything is real even later in its memory.
According to Claussen domestic voyages these distinguish themselves fundamentally of any dream.
The dream is a state quite different, it writes of it describing it that it has lived.
Contrary to of Dreams, the memories coming from mental journeys are of an extreme light and very detailed even of the years later.
One can even say that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the real experienced.
Intensity of this had makes burst the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, the oniroïdes deliriums, the psychoses, the hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how much our internal representations of the external reality are fragile even in eve.
Change to the state of conscience, summarizes the psychologist Kasten "can provoke a distortion of what we call the reality."
An experience that can be as totally enriching.
The first snows can fall
Burda
At 27 years ago, the children will take the continuation of the publishing houses.
The nomination of Kallen at the post of PDG of editions is an intermediate solution: to the longer term, Hubert Burda hopes that its two children recover the press group, he has said to in the newspaper Spiegel.
Holding company must remain a family firm at 100%.
Hamburg - In the long term, the publisher Hubert Burda sees his society between the hands of its children
Two children will inherit at 27 years and are firmly determined to integrate the society, has told Hubert Burda, 69 years, to the Spiegel.
The details have been settled in advance.
The question of knowing if they will be active in the firm will land thereafter.
One will have to see also if they are capable.
One can not impose his children to 7500 colleagues without whether if they have the capacity for taking care of it.
That would demolish the children as well as the firm.
Burda had made to know last Thursday that it withdrew from the President - Manager - General post from in January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
52 years ago, is a member of the Board of Directors for 1999.
It was first and foremost responsible for technological sector.
Thereafter he took care of in the that is to say it was responsible for the capital of the company and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he took also the head of marketing, of the foreign sector, of the impression and of the finances.
Thus for the first time he is not a member of the family that is Burda at the head of the editions.
Children of have respectively 19 and 17 years, his son Felix who would have 42 years today, had died a few years ago.
The nommination of Kallen is used also to make the link of the 10 or 15 years"
Burda clarifies that the holding company must stay at 100% between the hands of the family.
The ruins always have taken place in the families that have let themselves entrainer by a compulsive desire for capital, which have made huge speculation unfortunate thinking that they could climb always more top.
That has never been my strategy.
Never I have had rêvede universal power, has said Burda.
I do not see myself absolutely in the role of tutor of the country as Springer could be it and I do not have the intention of being part of these international leagues as the Time, these companies have taken much too much importance.
Promise of
Peek extremely is limited, it is a matter of a mechanism that allows only concerning its only electronic mail, without offering the possibility would not be that of seeing some type of joined parts or of sailing on Internet.
It took advantage of his five minutes of glory in the, while the magazine referred to it as one of the products of the year.
In truth, seeing it in the street is more difficult, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Contrary to the, Peek offers a very weak price and a monthly subscription, or less than the half of what, for example, the subscription costs dated of the iPhone.
Considering its success the company has thrown new instruments: the one conceived exclusively for Twitter, the other one with a free service of data for life, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday during the event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is tout aussi limited that his American grand-frère, but comprises a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes the roaming in throughout Europe.
Those that travel with a Smartphone know already what the fact of renouncing the data while one crosses a border or of looking desperately for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a connection to) to be able to consult its letter represents.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is unbelievably seductive and that makes long that it should work.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and options journey, but in it that concerns me, I would need to have made a thesis in physical to include them and of good glasses to read the small print.
The repeated recalls to the order of the European Commission to propose prices of roaming fees affordable throughout Europe have had barely acceptable.
Outside his country of origin, one hesitates to use the data, and one has not wrong.
That a small device as the FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon even though it does not have the Wifi) offers this type of tariffs, means that the operators start thinking differently and study different suggestions allowing them to make their network of data profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes the downloading of books and of other research on.
Without subscription and without boat.
It is a matter of a connected mechanism and one pays during its purchase and not every month.
And it is what I hope for to see a day for the FonPeek: an option of purchase with access for life as Peek proposes it already in the.
Not that I want to buy it.
I look at my letter on my telephone, thank you.
I simply wish for it because I believe that it is a fairer formula for the consumer.
Seeing a computer presenting this same system would be interesting.
The preferred color of Michelle
Yellow is, no doubt, the preferred color of the first lady of the.
If she has gone to the capture of duty of Barack Obama to the presidency of the United States with a dress and a mantle of this colour, indeed, she has chosen the same one to accompany it in the second time, undoubtedly, the most important of his life: the delivery in Oslo of the price Nobel of the Peace.
Michelle Obama carried a very similar model in these two occasions: beside their similar color, a yellow pulling to the green with shiny reflections, the two times, the dress consisted of three parts: the holding, the jacket and the coat, in the same one tissues, and a great embroidery or a push was decorated.
If although of the first glance, it would seem that the first lady of the United States follows the trail of the Princess of the and has chosen of replacing the same held.
But the tissue in which both sets is cut makes them very different.
If for the capture of office it was a matter of a thick lace, on the other hand, it carried in Oslo a printed velvet.
Accessories too are different: green shoes at average heel for the first opportunity, and a model similar, but gilded, this time.
The hairstyle it also has changed: the hair is now raised even though it carried them released last time.
75 % of the mothers who work have had professional problems because of their professional maternity
The discrimination to the work has increased in the course of these last years, especially for the women of the young generations that want to be mothers.
It is what the study reveals «Fecundity and career of women in », realized by the CSIC in collaboration with the instituto of the.
The inquiry, realized on 9 737 women from 15 to 75 years ago, does not leave room for doubt: 75 % of the mothers who work have seen their career limited because of the maternity.
The study indicates that there are numerous differences regarding the beginning of life in a partnership and he numbers it of children, if the woman works or not and of the type of employment occupied.
Those that do not have work outside the home, work part-time or have a stable, will not work, put themselves in couples earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, the women having a stable job, principally in the public sector, reject the entry in the life in couple and the first pregnancy, and have less children.
The women between 35 and 49 years having a fixed work have their first child, on average, 3,7 years after him to be installed in partnership. This number passes at 4,1 by those that work in the public sector. These data show that the women having a stable employment have needed time in their lives to obtain it, what has led them to reject Union and the and arrival of the children.
Furthermore, the type of trained job influences largely the maternity, but less dates it of starting date of common life town », explains the researcher of the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
Level of studies is another factor that digs the gap of the age of the marriage of women and of their first child.
According to the inquiry, more the level of training is raised, more they marry and have their first child late.
The difference persists also among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group having years between 35 and 49, those that have made elementary studies and higher have respectively been mothers for the first time to 25,1 and at 32,1 years on average.
«Another disctinction appears also between the women, according to their level of studies.
Even though those who have carried out the basic studies marry and have their first child before finding a job stable, those having made studies of level means or higher invert this programme and give the priority to the obtainment of a stable work as preliminary condition to the marriage and at the arrival of one child », clarifies Mrs Delgado.
Reveille Kruger also is it worth well
The Oréal Paris has just added a new name to his list been jealous of ambassadors: Reveille Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will incarnate the picture of several products of the brand, starting to sing the universal currency «because I am it worth well».
The originator of, one of the most elegant actresses of the international scene, comes thus to join other celebrities noted down at L'Oréal Paris, as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish one Penélope Cruz.
Before it, the latter to penetrate in this club if select have been the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
By the men the hallmark of cosmetics counts also ambassadors of luxury: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, lessons of anatomy) and Matthew Fox (the companion of Evangeline in Lost).
Price of the British way
The British ones have a lot to say the way in the world.
Greatest representatives, creators and man-made moons, yesterday and, have met for the annual delivery of their price, which has taken place in London, to the Royal Short of Justice.
Nobody has missed the mark.
The ex model Jerry Hall and his girl, Georgia May Jagger, elected Better model of the year.
Poker game of have of Manual Vincent
Manual Vincent offers us in Poquer of ases (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) thirty " radiography " of writers that have crossed its literary life (and sometimes his past life).
It is not it according to the kinds predictable and apprehended (biographical summary, life and work), but looking for something of fellow man to the kernel of ignition of the created character.
The journey is exciting and Vincent does not save either the scares or the illuminations.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation at the readings and rereadings.
I leave you a few snapshot here.
On Albert Camus: «In its pages, I have discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, nearly physical, that same that I felt without naming it: the pleasure against the sad fate, morality without guilt and innocence, no God.
On Samuel Beckett: «Nihilist, allegorical Christian, it wrote what it had dazzling poetics in blood, not in the head, between the impotence and the ignorance, with a splendid poetic humour, devoid of sense, as the blade of the knife that has nearly killed it.
On Graham Greene: «Our man has been inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted thirteen years ago, in the flesh of which it conjugated the emotion of adultery the pleasure of the bites, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching the sky by the road to destruction.
On James Joyce: «Ulysses has been published in Paris by Sylvia Beach in 1922. It is a matter of one of the summits of eight thousand meters of the universal literature, which it is needed to climb by the north face, on which the best climbers leave still and always busy.
On William Faulkner: «He was a type strange.
Of itself, he said sometimes that it was the heir of a landowner of the county and of other times that he was the son about a black and about a black crocodile tears.
Two dreams were of size.
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: «This writer gathered the insane shout moved from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry his echo up to the bottom of the night of the 20th century, in its literary form, and it was it in the escape of itself and invoking the posteriority with a speech violate to the maggots.
On Dorothy Parker: «A day it put itself on bended knees and prayed: «God dear, I implore to you to make that I stop writing as a woman.
On Joseph Conrad: «On his grave the towards were engraved: «The sleep after l'effort,/ after the storm the port,/ the rest after the war, / after the, tired the death delights.
On Virginia Wolf: «In her luggage it also transported its depression.
His husband accepted in a very normal way that she tells him that Édouard VII spied on it between the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
One has never seen a man as patient and passionate of a neurotic literary whose talent exceeded the madness.
On Pío Baroja: « that was Martín-Santos if it is not to try to conceal Joyce at Baroja?
That tried Benet if it is not to make Baroja shoot by Faulkner?
That was That if it is not to aspirate the glory of this man so that it serves as pedestal for him?
An aggression coward
Last week, my mother, who has 70 years about, went for a walk to our area of the city of Fuenlabrada, while a group of young people between 15 and 18 years passed beside it and of our dog, a blood - mislé, rescued from the SPA and not weighing more than six kilos, and without saying word, they hurled him two blows of feet that left the dog seriously hurt.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see what is of amusing to attack for free a small animal without defense that, moreover, was in lead.
The indignation of a lady who went for a walk quietly must be added thereto and that, while that she insulted these individuals, got to fearing physical for his physical integrity, since a firebrand who attacks an animal is capable of making a woman, a child, an old man or, finally, every person weaker than it the same thing.
The episode took place around 5 p.m. on Tuesday as another, in an area usually quiet.
The dog has moaned all day.
We have of course put down complaint at to the police station in the neighbourhood even if we doubt that serves for much and not to touch the sensitivities, we want just to clarify that the killing cowards were Spanish.
The indignation has brought to us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what happens by young people so that they find amusing of manhandling for free an animal without defense that gives us affection, of the friendship and keeps us company.
We do not know where has passed the good education and the respect of for animals and of the people.
Michelin and Fesvial, unity for the port to wear a helmet
Producing it of tires Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for the road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the port of headphones, mainly in the young motorcyclists, as have indicated it today the two structures.
This initiative has as objective to make to realize the importance of the port of headphones, since it is a matter of the only element of protection allowing avoiding the injuries ahead, or even the death, in the event of an accident by two wheels.
Michelin has indicated that this campaign was in line with his commitment for the road safety, which «goes beyond the design and manufacture of products always safer » and has maintained that it contributed to this objective by other actions to pedagogic and informative character.
This new campaign of encouragement of the port of wear a helmet in two wheels, under the motto «To be well to be well not to, will comprise a first stage in the course of which of the posters will be distributed in more than 500 garages to motorcycles, in order to guarantee the widest audience.
Finally, Michelin has underlined that the road safety «is a constant concern for the company, because as manufacturer of tires for the vehicles to two wheels, one of its main objectives is of developing always safer products.
Sale of light commercial vehicles progresses
After almost two years ago the market for light commercial vehicles starts seeing a little light to at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in represent an increase of 12,6 % in relation to 2008 and, what is more important, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of reduction, according to the numbers of the employer union of the manufacturers Anfac and of Ganvam, that of the dealers.
He admits however to shading the good news, since the reference being used to the comparison the month of November 2008, has been particularly bad, with a reduction of 60 % in relation to the previous year.
As a result, in spite of the development of last month, the registrations amassed during these 11 months are located 40 % below those of the previous year.
Since January, if one adds all the vehicles that enter to the category of the light commercial vehicles (derivatives of cars from tourism, pick-up, vans, light vans and trucks to light windows) 95 853 have been sold.
The big clouds that affect the most their request for all that have not dissipated itself. Indeed, although they are also bought by individuals, most of purchases are realized by small or average firms, which pay of cases nearly in 100 % thanks to external funding.
Thus, on top of the restrictions implied by the limitation of the banked credits other factors must be added as the increase in unemployment or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In view of this situation and unlike the vehicles of cars, the aids to the purchase of the have little served.
Beside the individuals, the independent ones and the SME that wishes to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3,5 tons with a level of emissions of Co2 that does not overtake the 160 grams at the kilometer, can also benefit from it, but the number of operations talks about itself.
Yesterday, by Ganvam, one reminded again the necessity for the administration of attaching particular attention to these vehicles and also to the industrial vehicles (trucks and bus).
Association of dealers foresees a year 2010 similar to that ends, for which she calculates a fall of the sales (of the vehicles of cars and of the 4x4) of 19 %.
The help to emergency braking is now compulsory
As that has taken place with the anti-lock system of the ABS brakes and as that will take place with the control of stability ESP, the systems of help to emergency braking will constitute a compulsory element on the European cars.
They are moreover already compulsory on the passenger cars and the light commercial vehicles recently registered, even though for the rest of the vehicles a period of deficiency has been set until end February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, has as objective to reinforce the protection of pedestrians, even if, throughout its action, it can also contribute to avoid many rear shocks.
The assistant to emergency braking acts increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of urgency detected by the system thanks to the kick given by the driver.
But the latter does not maintain always the pressure until the end.
According to a study led by the manufacturer of components for car Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to lean on the brake before the crash, and half of them had not pulled advantage of all its strength.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, revancha, requires the maximum of the system of brake, reducing the distance of which transports it to needs to stop.
According to a study of the, if all the cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1 100 fatal accidents that pedestrians are involved in could be avoided every year.
This reduction would be still more important with the popularization of the ones said intelligent systems of emergency braking: one calculates that an accident on four with injuries would be avoided.
In that case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to a radar or to a camera, detects the obstacles and warns the driver, on top of acting lightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps it increasing the pressure on the peddle, if that is necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is unavoidable the system exercises the maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimize the damage.
General Motors rejects until in January the plan for
Even though the workers of the factory Opel of Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new would be thrown in the course of the first week of April - probably on the 8 -, according to Javier Ortega the American manufacturer has warned of his needing more time to conclude the rescue plan from help of Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, expects that each of the plan has been approved of beforehand by the concerned part.
And that can imply that the definitive document, which will first be subjected to the workers then to the governments of the countries that the factories are, is taken back until beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, by GM, one assures that a decision on the sale of should be made in the next few days.
It is not therefore amazing that the Swedish government has tightened the pressure on the American manufacturer so that he makes a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to be in contact with possible new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who aspires also to acquiring Volvo, but the candidacy of the Dutch manufacturer of sports cars, supported by Russian, supported by the group, becomes more important.
In the case where it would not be agreed with none of them, GM could sell part of at the Chinese firm Baic.
The decision of closing Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the steering wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To conceive their final and valuable jewel, the engineers of Porsche have left from the Boxster S and have succeeded in making it thinner that is all right that less that 80 kilos, what leaves the balance to only 1 275 kilograms.
That has led them to manage, in first place, without the automatic roof that has been replaced with a manual covered roof, allowing reducing of 21 kilos, to use doors in aluminum as those of the GT3 15 other kilos of less, for taking off the climatiseur, 13 kilos, to reduce to 54 litres the tank of gasoline of 64 7 kilos of won, to go up bacquets of sport even 12 kilos, and with light tires of 19 thumbs, five kilos.
Finally, they have renounced the audio system CDR-30, earning thus six other kilogrammes and have replaced the portal poignéesdes with handfuls in tissues, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model exists also with the box PDK at dual kdp clutch, the test has been realized on a model to manual box of six speeds, principally on roads of the secondary network of, in mountain, with particularly tortuous bends.
His behavior can be described only as irreproachable.
Reduction of the weight does not prevent the car of rolling on the ground with its feet.
On the contrary: that made long that we had not tested a so small and light model that, at the same time, guarantees as much safety in the bends, including to great speed.
He is a small athlete, capable of warming up his musclesà small speed for the necessary time, until we ask him to sprint, to brake, to recover and to move the engine again...
It is out what we want. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as precise, the car will make what our hands will indicate on the wheel.

The inverted president will have to abandon the diplomatic legation to the more late on January 27th 2010, date of the official at the end of its mandate.
Francisco Catunda, responsible for businesses of the embassy of Brazil in the capital of, has confirmed to TV Globo that « Mel » knows that he must leave the embassy, where it is réfugié since 21 September, before that date.

Thank you very much
After pink days for the last spring, in the course of which the inflation of the active ones has constituted the dominant note on the markets, the uncertainty arises again, what is not surprising since it is a matter of their natural state, in an environment where the agents make decisions towards an uncertain future by nature.
The remedy used by the central banks to stabilize the markets has been of monetizing the debt by the direct purchase of active and indirectly giving providing abundant liquidity to close to zero rates from scratch, so that the financial institutions buy active to mobilize.
Central banks already have confirmed that the direct purchases of active virtually have been finalized and, without questioning their nonconformist policy of liquidity, start putting a bit of sand in the gearwheels, as the BCE has made it, with their tender to a year of next week.
Consequently, the investors doubt the capacity of the world economics to maintain a heterodox economic recovery measures and we are attending one in an opposite way of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of grants and the gaps of the obligations of the firms increase again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels that they have reached at the beginning of the year.
The States have seen themselves obliged to socialize the risk private and the public debt is again affected.
There is a fresh start again to the quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the refuges chosen by the investors, provocative an increase of the differences between the countries of the euro zone and Germany.
The Spain hardly has been touched by this episode of instability, but afterwards Switchboard & Poor'sa threatened with a new review to the fall of the qualification of the Kingdom of.
Of the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to make the defenders of moral hazard shut up, which tried again to cause a case of conscience by lesresponsables of the economic world policy that had slowed down the derived destructive effects of the limitation of the credit on the destruction of jobs, then only what would be needed to make it is to decree a new day of graces.
However, the situation of Dubai looks like a tribal fight between the emirs to return his place to in power in the United Arab Emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that conceals A government which conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the container to the roses.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after.
It would be perfectly irrational that the Ecofin rescues Hungary from one not respect of its external payments at the beginning of the year and allows to a member country of the euro zone of not respecting its commitments.
It that on the other hand is logical, it is that the Ecofin has incited the Greek government to the transparency and gives back his citizens coresponsible for the need for special measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope for it, we find us in view of an episode of normalization of the bonuses of transitory risk, after some excesses in high positions, that would be predictable.
In the case of Spain, as long as our differences in the public debt increase to the measure of obligations to European companies, nousn have not to worry.
If the European differences diminished and that ours continued increase, it would be then a matter of a Spanish idiosyncrasique risk.
The business Switchboard & Poor's is an anecdote. while our projected indicators oblige most of the services of studies to anticipate their recovery models and to review their forecasts to the rise for 2011, with besides the OECD and the European Commission, which bring back to the load with a Japanese model pourl economy Spanish, it does not augur a lot of hope for to their warning.
Again, that it has the whole air of constituting an excellent opportunity to buy active Spanish, even so for the moment «caution is mother of security ».
Connected sectors

His bet concentrates as well on the central ones to gas as to coal, with mechanisms of recovery of carbon dioxide and, renewable surtout,sur renewable energy.
In this area, he considers that 18 000 MW of more are necessary, with other «energies of support».
Galán, who considers that the bill of lasting economics that the government has just approved of is in the descendants of what his business asks for, has not wished to attack the royal decree aiming at encouraging the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policies of fight against global warming.
According to it, there is «a clear bet in the long term» in this direction, in spite of the occasional ' measures« punctual »as the president of Iberdrola has qualified them.
Which that it is, Galán values that the decisions of investing, although they are located on the long begin to be taken, because they take some time before reaching their maturity and that a stable profitable framework is necessary to approach them.

New tools for the expert evaluation of the cars
In these days of bad weather and of accidents car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of automobiles that have undergone a sinister are brought back up to a garage, where an expert must evaluate the undergone damages and the cost of compensation.
Every accident is different, and the calculation of the cost of the coins and of the time of workforce can constitute a long and complex process.
To calculate by hand the cost of a repairing included between 20 000 and eur 30 000, including the coins and the work force can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the most recent information tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
It is for this reason that nearly 100 % of the experts use such systems.
The purveyors of service and of solutions for the evaluation of the accidents and the maintenance devote themselves to the collection of the information supplied by the manufacturers, to treat afterwards them and to offer them to their customers under the form of a useful tool.

While a new car goes out on the market these enterprises start the work.
It is a matter of a very difficult work, because it is needed to catalog each of thousand pieces of the vehicle and to note down its price.
Moreover, one establishes an « intelligent » graphic picture of every model on which one can click on the different parts of a car of tourism.
If it is a matter of a model sold massively, the work can be ready in a week if the process advances very rapidly.
If it is a matter of a little sold automobile, that can take three or four months. Presently, Audatex has comprehensive information on 99,2 % of the cars marketed in Spain.
Among the exclusive ", they have for example information on the Porsche, but not the Ferrari or the Lamborghini.
Regarding the vehicles in circulation the figure exceeds the 99 % of them.
To carry out the work of documentation and of processing of data bases carry out has eight centers distributed across the world (in Spain, in France, in Germany, to the United States, to Brazil, to Mexico, in China and to Japan), and each of them is specialized in some brands.
The national seat is situated at Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (in general of mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex surrounds every year 90 million to elaborate these data bases.
Every month, 2,5 million data are recorded, and the customers receive updating every two days.
The elaboration of the enormous flow of information allows to these enterprises giving them various uses and proposing varied products.
The most frequent application concerns the repair and the maintenance, but according to different countries, there are also tools for the management of the parts of scrap or to calculate the current market value or residual of a car.
The only firm that has a guide that informs cars of occasion in Spain about the value is Eurotax.
Audatex does not propose it in our country, but it makes it in the.
