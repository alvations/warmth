Food at a European inflation
The food prices increasing rapidly are main reason for the increase measured in the euro zone in the inflation.
The price increase was in the 13 countries of the euro zone more highly than expected in November -- after the 2.6 per cent in October an annual rate of inflation of 3.1 per cent was registered as the statistical office of the EU reports in Luxembourg.
Bloomberg reported official forecasts have started out from only 3 per cent.
Unlike the American, British and Canadian central bank the European Central Bank (ECB) hasn't lowered the Leitzsins. In your estimation the cut in interest rates would become the increasing commodity prices of and the slight fall in unemployment favor the emergence of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB endeavors to keep the rate of inflation pressed for the two per cent brand less than two per cent or at least.
The ECB is according to an analyst in the doublemill: One must "arrange" the inflation to exclude later need for action.
With 3.3 per cent the rate of inflation achieved a twelve annual record high in Germany in November; the rate of 3.6 to 4.1 per cent climbed in Spain.
The increased food and prices of energy are responsible for the increase in the inflation in the euro zone.
The MATIF wheat listings increased by 88 per cent and the course for soybeans also achieved a record high since 1973.
There was a considerable price increase in 2007. also at edible oil and dairy products
The world market price for crude oil increased by 52 per cent this year -- last month the price per barrel of the black gold reached almost 100 U.S. dollars.
According to the ECB the inflation will increase 2008 from 2.1 to 2.5 per cent in the year, one expects a fall on 1.9 per cent in 2009, though.
For the next 3-4 months analysts start out from a 3 per cent rate of inflation, however, estimate the annual average rate with 2.1 per cent.
For 2008 experts expect that the ECB will lower the interest twice.
Gallup locates to governmental crisis
After stagnating for a long time the number of the Fidesz sympathizers has grown considerably by the beginning of December. The party has the biggest base camp, lasting the consent first time since 2002 dagewesenen low of 13 per cent has one never reached for the socialists according to the Gallup.
With the party faithful voters the difference turns out clear thanks to the high determination of the opposition supporters: More than two thirds (71 per cent) contrast with a fifth (20 per cent) consent for the MSZP.
MDF and SZDSZ lie according to the survey under the parliamentary entry hurdle: You come up to two per cent in the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by a per cent in the two stores.
In comparison with the last low the general economic atmosphere has further deteriorated, the share of the ones who judge the economic situation of the country when "really bad", so high (41 per cent), was never before while another 46 per cent regards it as "rather bad".
After more hopeful prospects in the spring and summer the families see the change of their financial situation more pessimistically once more.
For the next year the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only a tenth starts out from a recovery.
A Gallup survey carried out in December yielded, that the work of the prime minister as " rather bad when right " 71% of the people asked, a historical high, judged.
Thirteen per cent of the people asked have great confidence generally in Ferenc Gyurcsány during which share of the supporters makes up 38 per cent for Viktor Orbán.
About 54% don't trust the head of the government at all, compared with 27% distrust against the party leader of the Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the political atmosphere is the number of the ones who think one could get a grip on the dissatisfaction with the governor also without changes of government.
Today, if 35% still had voiced in favor of the whereabouts of the government and the head of the government after the disturbances in last October, this share amounts on only still 20%, while the relative majority (33 per cent) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked after her interest in the plebiscite 60 per cent answered that it participates "certainly" and another 20% "probably" would hand in their vote.
For comparison purposes: if the parliamentary elections would take place on this Sunday, only 55 per cent would go "certainly" to the urns, another 15% regard their participation as "probable". In view of these trends the result of the plebiscite would be foreseeable.
74% would vote against the hospital day money against the studies charges, 79% against the practice charges, and 84%.
At the plebiscite "certainly" this one compassionate would become the shares of the opponents of the studies, practice and hospital charges even 81, 84 or 89 per cent amounts put on on the group.
Auchan at the most expensive one, Tesco increased around almost a fifth
The Hypermarkets in the Budaörser trade area also have this year keeps the average price increase of 16% of the last year with the difference that no rise of the value added tax gave it this year.
Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser trade triangle the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" of also this year by 16 per cent has increased, price increases were registered by over 1,000 hooves into all Hypermärkten, though.
After the prices have "galloped from it" in the food markets in last December, the price increase prozentuell hasn't turned out drastic, compared with the anyway high, earlier baseline.
It seems certainly deterrent to the consumers, though, that hoof isn't even this year for what they had paid hoof last year still far under 9,000 available for 10,000.
The price of the "Napi" shopping basket exceeded the magical 10,000 hoof limit hoof in the examined markets by at least 91.
The highest price amounted hoof to 10,573.
The price at 6,800 was (hoof) in 6800.
The prices remained almost on last year's level for Unicum and live fish, the prices for turkey breast pieces of tenderloin, nut and poppy, have increased strongly, however.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded, the head offices of statistical office of Hungary to the data there was 1 kg of bread morning call for 139 Forint at Auchan, however.
There wasn't any competition conditional sudden fall in price at the product on under 200 Forint.
The price of a two liters Coca-Cola returnable bottle of under 200 Forint was here, also surprising the drink therefore cost inclusive pledge only 257 hoof.
This year in the "Napi" shopping basket comparison Auchan at the most expensive one and Cora at the most favorable one nevertheless came off.
Our calculations have arisen that have Cora, increased by 18 per cent during Tesco and Auchan respectively the prices in the "Napi" shopping basket opposite the Christmas prices last year at 15.
The difference between the cheapest shopping basket of the previous year and the most expensive of the this year's year was 12% the rise between the cheapest shopping basket of the last year, lasting and expensive the current year 21% turned off.
The average rise in prices was 1,480.00 hoof.
The average price increase was at 1,206.00 Forint in the previous year still, the added value tax increase manifested itself at the prices at last Christmas, though.
Exactly this process has affected the trade terribly: The department stores apparently couldn't decide so properly which price margin they shall use at the individual articles since the effects of the price increase on the consumerism were unforeseeable.
(If the dealer plans the circulation speed of a product badly, he can fall around essential profits in the price margin which goes by the traffic intensity.)
The price increase of the "Napi" shopping basket turned out Mehwertsteuer conditional so radically last year that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint whereas the price difference was merely 844 Forint at the cheapest basket.
Such extremes weren't watched since the most expensive basket cost around 1,630.00 Forint more than in the previous year and this year there was a rise in prices of 1,284.00 Forint even at the cheapest one.
Showed itself a disastrous price increase in the comparison of the two last Christmas seasons, the price of the daily consumption articles into the Hypermärkten has increased into less than 20 months around more as 30 per cent.
(In turn this doesn't confirm this one the head offices of statistical office of Hungary absolutely to data: The statistical office stated one more than a 30 per cent price increase at some basic foodstuffs in the period of 12 months.
Next to flour also at eggs so approximately).
If one takes, however, a look into the "Napi" shopping basket, this almost seems at the latter by no means, there the price level the has risen even in the worst case around hardly more than 10 per cent already in the previous year of expensive product.
Obviously flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the Eilieferanten -- after all, they could pass the drastic price increase on to the multinationals.
The Hypermärkte don't complain in the golden trade triangle; It is reported constantly of good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of the customers doesn't look on the prices in the three department stores any more.
Large quantities are bought from everything, durable food goes in pallets over the shop counters.
There were endless snakes in all three department stores at the Kassa Wednesday morning when the number of the customers suddenly exploded.
Is of, though, a lower customer frequency reports to the country so that many multinationals complain to the pollsters they couldn't reach once the planned sales volume and to be more precise not only at food but also at lasting consumer goods.
Disinfectants in many places are saved up for
This year more than one thousand infections were registered in hospitals which could be explained by improper dealing with antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds, the over-load of the staff, aren't good at all everything for checking the infections -- factors, these, so the leading woman doctor of the national epidemiology center.
In many places you economize also at the disinfectants.
A MRSA infection was diagnosed in the Traumatologie department of the János hospital recently.
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient who was admitted to the hospital after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there already was a similar infection.
The injured of a serious car accident was the man had dismissed, little to return with a MRSA infection out of the hospital later, though. Since then, an important operation couldn't be carried out yet because of the bacterium which still is in the body of the patient.
Until December 10th this year infections triggered out of hospitals 1094 by multi-resistant pathogenes were reported to the national Nosocomialis Surveillance system, so the leading woman doctor of the national epidemiology center, Karolina Böröcz.
So so many infections triggered by multi-resistant pathogenes were registered certainly in the hospitals, however, the number of unrecorded cases might be higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were triggered by the MRSA, the Staphylococcus aureus resistant to Methicillin-Oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carry approximately a third of the people in its nose without it wanting to cause an illness.
SA conditional infections (such as sore throat, tonsillitis, inflammations of the skin or wounds) usually react to antibiotics well, they are curable well.
If the means are measured out too highly or used improperly, though, arises from the good respondierenden bacteria antibiotics resistant, which spreads fast under corresponding conditions in the hospitals.
Immune system which is particularly with patients weakened or working badly durably, or these bacteria can patients with a low weight cause serious infections, such as wound infection or blood-poisoning, that is sepsis, but also into old.
According to the medical head of the János hospital the MRSA infection is nothing special, such occurrences are part of sick person house everyday life.
One mustn't mistake the infection for the epidemic, manhte Tibor Nyulasi -- there is not MRSA only there where it isn't looked for.
Resistant to antibiotics
Such patients are ", isolated this nursing staff wears rubber gloves and masks at the supply and we dispose of the antibiotics necessary for the treatment " -- so Tibor Nyulasi.
At their admission to the hospital the patients are examined for MRSA, an infection cannot nevertheless always be avoided.
Samplings too rare
The majority of the infections in hospitals triggered by MRSA would be avoidable, the conditions ruling at present and circumstances are unfavorable for the checking of the origin or the spreading of the multi-resistant pathogene, though, Karolina Böröcz says.
After this infection happens predominant in hospitals and old people's homes the Spitäler should examine the delivered patients and MRSA immediately infected isolate.
The microbiological sampling is not so frequently practiced, however, in the Hungarian hospitals.
Not least because there aren't any subsidies for this examination on the part of the state health insurance company.
Most cases would come only then to the daylight, if the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, so the medical leader of the epidemiology center.
On the part of the European Union there are strict recommendations for the corresponding application of antibiotics in the humane medicine, there, however, are guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and syndromes also in Hungary.
Antibiotic therapies shall be purposefully, this means microbiological examinations are necessary so that no resistance to the means can form, this directive isn't always observed by hospitals either, though.
Microbiological samplings are even still more seldom the basic support of situated patient, so Karolina Böröcz, under the itinerant ones, or himself in.
You economize at the disinfectants
A scientific proof proves that MRSA from a patient is most frequently assigned to the other ones by the nursing staff.
The Händewaschen or wearing gloves and masks just therefore are of a great importance, there also are considerable defects in the hospitals in this field, though.
MRSA is transferred by droplet infection or contact, however, there isn't always the possibility in the local hospitals of isolating the infected patient.
The rooms are even often overcrowded although meter should a distance of at least 1.5 it give between them from the epidemiological view, the beds strung pressedly for each other.
Unfortunately, as Karolina Böröcz further says it even happens there are few male nurses, many patients, in the hospitals supplied financially less well that everything is economized at disinfectants -- factors which virtually favor the emergence of infections.
Such infections are provably far less frequent there or the further distribution of the pathogene can be held back where these protective measures are adhered to, so Karolina Böröcz.
Government program against MRSA
Health insurances cause this one enormous costs, to get a grip on MRSA infections they are therefore fought everywhere.
The prevention of MRSA or its checking was held tight in the government program in England for example.
According to first symptoms is the program successfully -- as published data verifies, is declining in England the trend of the MRSA infections.
The European center for illness prevention (ECDC) has the prevention of the origin of multi-resistant pathogenes also MRSA (under this), as well as the prevention declared one of its priorities by infections in hospitals.
Death handlebar chief constable wasn't drunk
In the case the of the chief constable of the XXII. The official report is available district of caused car accident with a fatal exit now.
The chief constable of the XXII stepped down meanwhile. On Tuesday this one has killed a pedestrian at a car accident, was inebriated, still under drug influence, said Attila Morvai, the press agent of the Budapest upper prosecuting attorney's office on Friday, district after the official report was presented for the case.
The report confirmed the results of the first examination according to which the chief constable hadn't consumed alcohol before he sat down to the steering wheel.
The former chief constable turned with his own car in the XXII. District to Kossuth Lajos street and one has run over a 55-year-old man who crossed the street in a not labeled place.
(These aren't extenuating circumstances according to the StVO, though -- the handlebar has after-rank even if pedestrians don't cross the street at the crosswalk.)
The pedestrian has succumbed to his injuries after his admission to the hospital.
According to the police reports the handlebar suffered from a shock, put its functions back after that and requested retirement.
The Budapest prosecuting attorney's office has started its inquiries for the occurrence.
Moreover, Attila Morvai mentioned that the former chief constable has cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
Another 400 m. EUR for infrastructure
Minister of Finance János Veres and Marta Gajecka signs, deputy chairwoman this one have European investment bank (EIB) on Friday in Budapest three credit agreements in the total value of 400 m. EUR. The money shall flow in education, traffic and environmental protection infrastructure and energy industry.
In the year 2006, the European investment bank (EIB) has allowed 300 m.

The loan contract more than 100 m. was already earlier signed, in the current agreement it is all about the use of the verliebenen 200 m. EUR.
The sum of 150 m. EUR agreed on in the loan contract also shall be spent on the budgetary financing of education projects.
The EIB has allowed altogether 300 m. EUR for this purpose for Hungary; the use of the remaining 150 m. EUR is decided on in the context of the expansion of the loan contract later.

At the meeting the U railroad line 4 also came to the language.
It was agreed on, that as soon as Hungary has clarified the details of the U train financing with the EU, the original contract and possible modifications are discussed once more.
According to the János Veres this would be possible in the first quarter 2008.
Since 1990 the EIB has financed altogether 113 projects in the total value of 8.4 bn EUR in Hungary.
The credit interest is EURIBOR-bound , the loan gets of the EIB with a delay of 8 years, provided freely of commission.
Bulgaria, the property paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian property market is splendid -- all of Europe looks awarely of the Balkan State seldom mentioned earlier.
What does and who buys on the still cheapest market the EU which rapidly, however, gets more expensive, where?
An analysis of the Bulgarian redouble/Max Division.
At present, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most popular plaster in the East European room for purchases of property with favorable ski suites and houses by the sea.
Between the mountains the winners the regions count Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa as one of the most popular ones, by the sea Albena, the "Gold Coast", are, real estate is always asked around Kavarna and Balcik more, though, too, the "sun coast" and the historical small towns Sozopol and Nessebar.
Russian draws more buyers wrong in the opinions of redouble/Max Analysten in Bulgaria wid the inland region sooner or later attract investors, so for example Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena and Triavna and also the really favorable area, of, too.
The capital Sofia also offers enticing offers -- trade and office space offer highest returns.
It is Bulgaria to become way of one of the most attractive European golfer paradises and therefore to attract tourists besides the summer and winter also in the two other seasons on the best one.
Foresighted investors therefore buy already now in the great style one, for example about Bansko.
According to analysts people who purchase real estate in Bulgaria also strive for a change of their way of life.
Most buyers are Englishmen, however, interested parties from France, Belgium, Spain and always more from Romania also come.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus it is presently, lasting also sea with the black and in the skiing areas mainly Russian buyers gives.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, Georgij Jankov, regional director of redouble/Max Bulgaria, says.
Those which want to sit down buy revitalisierte real estate by either 50-100,000 euros or shabby houses by 5-15,000 euros which then renovate it themselves.
Good connection and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are written with a capital letter but are also the proximity to a city, business and doctors decisively for the buyers.
Those, these are part on the search for a vacation domicile are (of the second category Bulgaria was in December under the top Ten vacation aims of the Germans listed).
Business people who invest with the aim of a middle to long-term increase in value agree on the third group.
Meanwhile constantly, real estate in the capital gets more expensive, caused by the demand always growing.
The real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria within the EU, within the last five years, however, there was a price increase by every year 21 per cent.
The price increase at the real estate prices exceeds by far the increase in the salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian per cent
As minister of the environment Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings come to an end on Tuesday and the debate about the international climate regime after 2012 is continued by the secretaries after the official opening on Wednesday.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries discuss the schedule of Bali in which the issue reducing measures are fixed after 2012 expiry therefore after expiry of the Kyoto protocol for the time.
At present, an intense debate is under way between industry and developing countries.
They already have the USA signaled that they don't want to negotiate about concrete numbers, would be ready to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions in comparison with 1990 by 25-40 per cent to 2020, though.
Whether the industrial nations are ready to support the developing countries besides the diminution of the issues both financially and technologically is the other great question of the meeting.
An agreement on the support of developing countries was also obtained.
This put the Kyoto protocol customization fund shall be managed by a 16-headed piece of advice most likely at the global Umweltfazilität (GEF) of UNO as has to be looked up "in the Piac és profit".
Hungary six per cent
Minister of the environment Gábor Fodor supports the endeavor in the name of Hungary keep the EU, its pioneering role at global climate protection measures and obtain a new international agreement to 2009.
The secretary declared the EU will reduce the greenhouse gas emissions by 20% to 2020 (measured against the values of 1990) independently of whether the "agreement after 2012" is obtained successfully or not. The union would be even ready to support a 30 per cent diminution other great industrial nations of the world or developing countries are also ready to meet their liabilities after strengths and responsible, soferne.
Gábor Fodor emphasized that the target of the states which had joined the Kyoto protocol in 1997, a diminution from merely 5.2 per cent, was whereas, at that time, the EU had already itself committed 15 member states to doing a minus of 8% with hers.
Diminution of the greenhouse gas emissions by 6% in comparison with the years 1985-87, a specification which will absolutely fulfill the country as the specification has to be looked up in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment, is for Hungary.
Use is high in Bali -- after all, the long-dated international climate political agreement must be ready within two years, it would otherwise become effective certainly first after 2012. In this case no renewed, international emission reduction system would follow the diminution plans fixed in the Kyoto protocol, the meaning also has stressed the IPCC, the scientific climate change committee which is international and awarded the Nobel peace prize for UNO in its latest report.
Through what would have extremely serious and irreparable consequences the consequence according to the Wissen's anuses the emission reduction would be delayed and the rise of the average temperature of the earth around more than 2° degrees Celsius would be inevitable.
A British army advertises on YouTube
Units of the British army have published photos about operations in Iraq and in Afghanistan for the purpose of popularity increase on the video portal.
At first the British air force (RAFs) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special squads stationed in Afghanistan have loaded videos via operations led against the Taliban into the net since March 2006, the BBC reports.

Originally the air force has to recruit the videos published with the aim, soldier and how the Ministry of Defense says the contributions also help the purpose, the population about the real aims of foreign uses of informing.
A certain degree of a political message always is almost free of charge in comparison with conventional television advertizings in such kind of published propagandas in itself, so defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, since they confirm the right to exist of the military measures decided on by the government in a way of their own, though carry these videos.
Americans advertise with game
However, the army also must fight against amateur photos which carefully worked on it next to this one, also take zensurierten photos into the net, these show the death of the soldiers such as such: The a little hypocritical, "official" propaganda films are talked about the losses at the most, the bloody sides of the war aren't shown, however, into.
Of the theaters of war in Iraq and in Afghanistan numerous videos shot in use were already loaded with oneself on the platform by the way, the brits, however, have only recently discovered this "genre" for themselves.
The Americans attract "America's Army" in the a little different way namely with the free of charge down loading up cash shooting game meanwhile, in that one of the players lebenstreuen simulation can slip into the skin of the soldier in the context of a more or some.

Political Capital: A Hungarian guard increases state risk
In opinion of the department of risk analysis (Risk Analysing division) of Political Capital the activities of the Hungarian guard founded in this August with support "of the movement for a better Hungary" have the risk of Hungary and raised the region in more regard.
Among other things it is called in the "Risikowarnungs report" of the institute: In connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard the highest political risk puts this one increase the ethnic tensions between the gypsy and not gypsy population already existing in Hungary ", which could lead to violent ethnic discussions even at short notice ".
Main reason for it is the strategy of the Hungarian guard which presumably aims at the provocation of such a discussion, so the research institute.
As reported this as an omission is on the part of this one seen in persons responsible politically: "Persons of the public life have left the discussion of the Romany question to representatives of radical political groupings, on the Romany Hungary contrast these have built up their political strategy now".
One suspects that this would intensify the problem, make the sensible dialog impossible, favor extremities as well as increase the probability of violent discussions.
The Forschungsinsitut means ausserdem not least thanks to the enormous attention on the part of the local and foreign media which would have activities of the Hungarian guard, " the picture of Hungary damaged abroad considerably, what particularly concerns the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity ".
We remember: Since fall 2006 the reorganization of radical and extremely right groups has been continuous in Hungary in the upswing so that calling organizations were founded several, himself "national self-defense organization" since summer 2007.
They have these groupings in common ", that himself their members respectively define as a civilian organization open while they are boasting openly -- armed from time to time -- defense tasks under reference to the unfitness of the police of preparing (disaster controling, national defense, Ordnungshütung), the army or the state itself, ", they was said.
And: All this happens in accordance with that method which tries to disguise endeavors as a civil initiative which are been different and being based on the politics and party unwillingness of the population, political.
So the emphasis of the civilian character and the organization form don't merely serve the avoidance of legal hurdles which could appear in the course of the entry for court, it is a political strategy at the same time.
As has to be taken from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian guard represent a risk increasing factor also for the relations with the neighboring states.
"Within the last months the Hungarian guard was quoted in several neighboring states as a potential source of danger, many an extremist nationalistic politician of certain neighboring countries sees the confirmation of his own anti Hungary policy so in the emergence of the Hungarian guard.
All this has effects on the political stability of the region " -- it was said.
From the view of the research institute the foundation of the Hungarian guard isn't an individual phenomenon in central east Europe, the political risk therefore has grown for the complete region.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian guard are comparable with those of the Bulgarian National Guard whose foundation you announced in August 2007 of the radically right-wing Bulgarian national union (BNU).
The Romany mass riots which have taken place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana) were in the background of the emergence of the Bulgarian guard.
At once, the BNU has taken the occurrences for the foundation of the National Guard as an opportunity with the argument that the aim of the organization is the "national protection".
In your opinion a real "gypsy terror" was namely noticeable in Bulgaria within the last 17 years, Political Capital remained the state, however, idly and indifferent -- so.
And: The initiative would have lot kicked an intense debate in the Bulgarian public.
As said the increased risk for ethnic discussions is also proved by the fact that some Bulgarian Romany organizations have announced to found their own guard for resistance purposes.
The Hungarian Romany shows the Bulgarian National Guard the Hungarian guard's till now many similarities to these, the activities doesn't have to be excluded since that also, reacts with organizing their own protection to the threats, is called in the risk warning report of Political Capital it.
Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital said on enquiry from the message office: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Risk analysis reports would be published, and should it be recognizable for risk changing trends, is informed the public opinion every year like in the case by the publication of the risk warning report.
Special days aren't holidays everywhere
In Hungary holidays are regulated legally exactly so that the practice of changing on the working days has established itself around the holidays by now, the next year grants us less such days, though.
One understands something else also in the EU and in America by "holiday".
The Hungarian right handed system distinguishes between national holidays and days work off.
Days work open are church holidays mostly or are with important historical events in connection.
We also celebrate for example New Year: Both the last day the old and, the first day of the new year, are days work off already -- the latter be able to the New Year's Eve revelers rest alone with that.
In the whole year we have altogether fourteen holidays.
The national holidays are March 15th which reminds of the revolution of 1848 and October 23rd, the commemoration day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20th the state foundation is us our dead bodies on May 1st the work celebratedly, on November 1st and 2nd remember.
Furthermore there are two holidays each at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since our state, National or religious holidays seldom fall for a weekend, the practice of the "working day moving" has proved itself in the cases in which we would work before or after the holiday only a day.
It is the price of the extended weekends, though, that we must work very well or go to school on the Saturdays in front of that.
When this day this one fells the holiday, you shall work off at long last, the Labor Secretary is fixing for long years in an ordinance of his own, in front of or after.
The legal provision applies to all employers and recipients, for public employees and officials of the public service similarly.
Only companies and facilities in which the business is continued without interruption that is also on the holidays are excepted.
This year the statement of conditions of employment is only mixed up a little by the holidays at the end of the year: As of December 24th stops in this country really stand since most take vacation lifted especially for it for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve time compensation or this one.
Next year more holidays fall to the week middle or until the end of the week so that will give at the working days less Umdisponierungen as this year.
The calendar will around the day of the work "on the head provided", with that be able to stay at home the people at once first for four days of the piece.
April 26th becomes a working day Saturday, this one so that the Friday, May 2nd can be a rest-day.
The second Umdisponierung is connected with the holiday on October 23rd: One will have to work off the Friday, Octobers 24th first of all on Saturday, October 18th.
The end of the year will completely be dominated by the holidays after everything is left and stops as of December 24th even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday, though.
Six deterrent small things, annoy around teammates
E-mails which we forget to send, language news which we never receive -- harmless lies which we don't notice any more: You take "color" at work to the weekday.
The question is, whether one himself to mere one used, or what puts this small trouble for himself consciously of the challenge and temptedly this misunderstandable, aggravating for other situations to vermweiden better.
Tips.
"Sorry, I have forgotten to pass on to you that somebody of the marketing department has called" -- a colleague says.
That one has missed a meeting through this?
At best one is sorry for and tries to line it up to make up by perhaps calling with the marketing department and confessing remorsefully one would have forgotten for the message (this is the less usual method).
The thing is dismissed with an excuse mostly.
With what can and try to avoid these situations consciously one prepare moments really unpleasant his colleagues before one becomes entangled in embarrassing excuses, if one should think it over?
What doesn't to one belong himself, lent something?
There is hardly something more sinewy as if one reaches for a document, office accessories or the telephone but it isn't here.
The stapler lay on the desk still yesterday -- is it gone this morning?
Or is approximately the ballpoint pen believed lost discovered on the desk of a colleague?
One should borrow nothing from the colleagues without wonder because annoys they are if they notice that something has got away.
So not putting any envelope or mail its from the office into the bag because they could meet one: no-one more there, if one needs it urgently anyway.
Gossip about the private life of the colleagues?
There is not to hold back any effective means, a gossip which was already put into the world.
Who with whom, what done?
Where and why?
The information (or assumptions) shouldn't one everybody about the private life of the colleagues if possible tie to the nose!
And if somebody opens anyway and his innermost secret betrays us, we shouldn't abuse this confidence!
One is silent like a grave instead of, at all, not passing on this one to persons present even if others know also about the problems of the colleague at the best.
Reported without reason illy?
If one calls in the office to report under reference to tormenting headaches illy because one just feels unwell or simply only would like to rest, one should himself about one be in the clear one: The colleagues must finish the work of their own, nondeferrable handlings, projects with firm appointments instead of one now themselves.
Join in in the colleagues therefore not bad!
One knows already on the day before that one won't make it to the office the next day or that something could come between, why one must have left at home, if one should report it on time, so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are confronted with the absence unexpectedly if.
Gesumme, giggling, make a telephone call
One is just deepened in his work, however, is suddenly disturbed by the loud giggling of the colleagues?
Listened in unintentionally on a telephone call which one wouldn't have been supposed to hear better?
One shouldn't irritate the colleagues with buzzing, singing, loud conversations (which one holds away over their heads), trampling, getting angry constantly or grumbling.
All this can be very disturbing even if are not just in a task (write she plan, organize) recessed.
Are the others always to blame?
If a project isn't ready in due time, one has an important letter or important Nachrichte forget to send off, one shouldn't look for the fault of the forgetfulness of one's own at other!
If possible one shouldn't finish himself speaking on the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
One admits his faults to himself and apologizes best if others also were concerned by it!
Can make up the question like one mistakes make up for it or this, you attach only too missed!
In the office, a feeling like at home?
Track-suit trousers and Schlapfen: Has lost nothing in the office comfortable for at home, however!
Once, one shouldn't then dress so casually if the job would allow it actually!
Get -- alone on the whole one should respect both his colleagues and himself that one dresses in the office correspondingly -- merely not too sloppy if desired, also pretty and elegant!
It one wants or how will everyone fix uninterestingly for other
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the regular morning jam.
A strange melody resounds from the radio: The sound of a violin mated with electronic stock exchange securities.
I turn the volume more highly.
The speed changes, a female choir the bass comes to the previous sounds and as a real sound jewel.
It is the song "Wings of Love" of Zagar which resounds on mr2.
The local music scene hasn't spoiled us with qualitative Electropop long time at all.
One sees even the jam but now differently if one hears the new album of Zagar.
The garage skirt with its Gitarrengequitsche contributes a new and exciting production from the local digital Underground scene slowly the seem, and even if again "into" is, which proves local Electropop of Yonderboi, so some to a change of the overall picture: There is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer it has begun in Pécs, played instruments even in the band Yonderboi before perhaps because a pub doesn't stand two pipers -- started with its own way to follow.
He made the breakthrough with its project (Zagar) and its music which merges elements from jazz, electronic and pop but had approached only as one with the request to compose the soundtrack for a film to him (e.g.
"Szezon" of Ferenc Török).
The formation which at first had appeared in smaller clubs became under only known to the wider audience, as the magazine "wan2" the its first album from the year 2002 top strung 50 local albs and Zagar chose a marketable trendsetter together with Yonderboi to the almost only one also in the west.
Zagar and his band undoubtedly were "trendy", however, no-one was interested in knowing whether they also like to bear this brand.
The band has reacted as it should: With a new, even better album.
The new album with the title having been published now tumble Fly Instead " Cannot " could open up ways new to them, the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years, though.
The expression originates namely from the time when Balázs Zságer was still away with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would be also all right louder guitar, the influences, these fall besides the ethereal character of the music, though the rock 'n' roll open, corresponding to the Zeitgeist and the trends.
With these songs the singer living in England and working with the band "The jigsaw puzzle", György Ligeti, has introduced himself to the premiere in the Millenáris.
A song of the album has created it even for the radio pop song -- since latest of early till late pop music sending to it mr2 Petofi has gradually set the listeners the earwig with the number "Wings of Love" which was taken by six local singers ("Underground stars") under cooperation.
Everything OK so?
The hvg.hu has enquired at Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: How far is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The concept "layer music" doesn't mean much to me at all.
In my opinion gives two castes in the pop music and to be more precise not Mainstream and Underground or alternative and pop but commercial and honest.
Alone the so-called alternative or Underground music can be shallow and meaningless, be able to do her but be produced also only for the sale which makes her to commercial music just the same.
A good pop number also can arise from an honest motive.
The receptiveness of the listener works independently of languages and national boundaries also according to this principle.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and the foreign audience opposite your music?
B. Zs. The pop music has particularly a greater tradition west of us abroad.
Only teenagers or persons in the twenties don't go to concerts but also the older audience there.
You follow up the trends in the pop music much more attentively which happen around it because they also regard it as a part of the contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: Which role befits the audience at your work?
Is it, important whom, where, how many listen to your music?
B. Zs. Of course it is a good feeling to see that more always come to our concerts.
However, we have never composed for the market.
With us the music doesn't arise to serve a purpose but for a certain reason.
The role of the audience is noticeable at the concerts mostly where there already is a mutual interaction but in turn there is this one only in the ungreifbaren changes of the moment.
I have nevertheless noticed one: If you want to make it to everyone right, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi?
It is away as a soloist and its career rather has built up in the west.
B. Zs. We don't really go its way that one again and again tempted, this in our music hineinzuinterpretieren, completely except for it.
We see each other sooner than team player, which on the musical presence of the different one let trust and it develop.
At first comparisons of our work with it of Yonderboi were unavoidable of course since several get from us from its band and have taken another way.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petofi suits "Wings of Love" in first place.
Many have belonged to the names Zagar only in connection with this number.
Was the opening staged with an a little more popular style in the direction of conscious of a wider audience?
B. Zs. We didn't have any plans to write a hit which then shall suffer for the album as a carthorse.
In this song it is all about more.
It was thought as a final of the album with which we wanted to resolve the sound orgy and the a little more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How have you selected the six singers?
What was the conducting principle why exactly her?
B. Zs. It was the basic idea to make a gospel song like choir.
The idea of arranging the choir from talented soloists of the local music scene then came.
So Edina Kutzora is Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Eniko Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh the choir of six come into being, therefore Sena, , which then we have christened apäter "Underground stars".
hvg.hu: Did you want to have the song just the same or has it co-formed the girls?
B. Zs. There already was the number in the instrumental version longer but when the material was ready for the album, we imagined that this number still "needs something."
The Akkordenabfolge has really asked for a song voice.
I still have one sung the melody in the same night, she has learned the girls later.
Everything came practically onto straight off and alarming spontaneously.
I can remember, I was electrified quite at that time but it also has already required the "stars".
The song would alone with my voice never have got so firm.
hvg.hu: However, one had the impression both on the plate and at the concert the girls would be in the background.
There isn't any solo share (except for the short solo of Judy Jay), they don't have a role of their own, their song sings completely together and isn't louder than the music therefore isn't only accompanied by the music.
They stood behind also on the stage.
Is it intention?
B.Zs. It was that way because of purely technical problems that they have stood behind.
We didn't want to send them solo roles consciously, though.
In the number it also is all about that these determined grand pianos, the grand pianos of the love emporheben, us that where who shall from forget his ego a little come, forgotten, and where is away, we simply allow one.
I would like that others also feel this euphoric condition which we have felt when the song has arisen.
hvg.hu: Which one was the most effortful song?
B. Zs. Actually the musical Schaffensarbeit rather has none at all, it at given more difficult tasks when mixing.
Longer, where the groove didn't want " rock 'n' roll Goes To, The girls, " to work for example at "Dorian Gray's dilemma" in which I play on a concert piano or at, but after and after everything has joined himself together as in the case of a jigsaw puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which one is your favorite number of the new album?
B. Zs. This changes with the concerts constantly and also now where I have the album "losgelasssen".
At present, it is "prophet Is A Fool" escape From Never, " The Earth "and the number" The seed ".
A deceitful broker risked billions because of feelings of inferiority
Bottomless swindler
So Jerome Kerviel describes his former employee the French bank giant Société Générale owner the local Komercní banka.
She came namely because of him around almost five billion euros.
However, it seems sooner that way, furthermore it for certain wasn't incompetent that Kerviel was only a big player which wanted to do it to its colleagues at once.
To the difference compared with all big bank houses he recognized the crisis by the amerikanischenn mortgage market on time.
It "is" emotionally rather weak, could be heard from the mouth of its supervisors who reported it to the police.
How these result, from the statements Kerviels Le moons, however, the French media, for example the daily published, he was a man who had made profits in the amount of 1.6 billion euros with his business at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"Everything I wanted had to be earned for my bank money", he claims in his statement.
He had managed to earn half a billion euro just at the American crisis in summer.
He had already espied the opportunity of it namely at the beginning of the year.
In February there already was first news about it that which already used, or such as it, installment problems had, are given, would be guessed into difficulties so-called Sub-Prime mortgages low-income customer.
However, influence on the whole economy shouldn't have this crisis.
Kerviel didn't believe this and was still right.
He had very screwed his profit except for 1.6 billion euros at the end of the year.
Already when I had earned the first half billion I "didn't" know how I should declare this Kerviel admits and passes on, that it has kept nothing definitely for itself.
During the whole interrogation he admits that he has falsified documents so that he would the on not come one would creep.
He even succeeded in leading his bosses behind the light even if the Eurex stock exchange was gradually interested in his business.
Risk profit
Feared he to be exposed?
Welfare hardly.
"I thought that she satisfies the simple fact that I have earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he take the courage to risk so much from?
He had to work out his position gradually.
In the year 2000, immediate, he entered the Société Générale after it had completed its studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary amounted to about 51000 dollars.
After two years he was already an assistant of a broker and in the year 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of 90000 dollars.
He nevertheless knew that he will never earn much just like other.
"Already during my first conversation in the year 2005 I knew that one watched me.
Kerviel explained the examination official because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development, ".
But according to its admission already soon the first great success came.
With the shares of the alliance he earned much by setting euros half a billion at the London bomb attacks on losses on exchange of this title.
And this was the trigger -- he wanted more now.
As long as you make profit, we let you
"This is like a snowball", he told the policemen.
But the bosses knew about everything allegedly or suspected it.
"As long as I earned money, one closed the eyes."
But then the great blow came at the beginning of this year.
On one single day he lost a billion euro.
He wanted to compensate for it at a weekend middle of January.
When he came to work on Monday he was already no more employee of the bank.
And the bank announced a couple of days later that it has because of him lost five billion euros.
On and how they came for him the crept?
He made himself suspicious through a vacation.
"I have taken only four days of the previous year.
One which doesn't want that one looks it into the cards is " a broker who doesn't take any vacation Kerviel said in conclusion.
Czechia has the chance to come to 365 billion
Czech secretaries and representatives of the European Commission signed altogether nine development programs yesterday by which the Czech Republic can come in the next years to 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns).
It is approximately all about half of the sum which can get Czechia at all from Brussels within the years 2007 to 2013 here.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programs.
Czech companies will be able to get about 100 billion crowns from the program "enterprise and innovation" allocated.
At most money, approximately 150 billion, will flow in the traffic development.
The traffic program is the greatest development program and this one contains means up to 22 per cent which Czechia can get from the fund.
According to money increased will this dispose the household of the state traffic infrastructure fund, the next year over 90.8 billions.
The program "enterprise and innovation" shall serve businessmen and companies to win funds to innovative businesses.
However, the companies also shall win finances for the introduction of more effective organization methods through this for the introduction of new technologies for operations research.
Czechia belongs to the till now least successful ones at the previous money Aquisition from EU funds under the new joining countries.
A Nicaraguan court confirms a twenty-year prison sentence for Expräsidenten
On Thursday, a court of appeal in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year prison sentence for the former president to Arnold Alemán to whom he had been condemned because of finance deceit in the amount of 100 million dollars (almost 1.8 billion crowns) in 2003.
Later he had been discharged from prison and lived under detention on his Hazienda at the nicaruanischen metropolis, however.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state comes behind bars again is currently unclear to AP according to the news agency.
Whether one lets Alemán serve its sentence at home or whether it must to prison will depend on the custody officials according to the chairwoman of the court of appeal, Ileana Pérez, now.
Four years ago, a court proved, that Alemán had regularly moved money of the government on accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and in reality the accounts belonged to his relatives and narrowest supporters.
Some of this money finally landed in a fund which Alemán had established for the financing of its election campaign 2001.
Budget is through
Yes, it is done.
The national budget is approved.
What is special at this household?
It is the first household which this government has designed and which was accepted by the coalition majority without support of the opposition.
This one for the current year still was approved with support of the CSSD (social democrats) because secretary Sobotka had him presented (of this party) and the CSSD couldn't permit itself therefore to decline him.
As opposed to the lively debate before the coordination on the motion of 'no confidence' against the government nothing dramatic happened this time.
The parliament approved this traditionally little observed, nevertheless most meaningful law at due leisure.
This is so to speak paradoxical.
Rules over everything starts and ends with the individual chapters and positions of the household whether one likes this or not.
The household is an essential component of the politics, however, is concealed by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media and therefore they pay more attention to him.
A quarrel under politicians is much more interesting than bare numbers for the public.
The national budgets suffered at the former social-democratic governments from three weak points which the household cannot remove suddenly for the year 2008:
The first is, of the high share of expenditure this one is obliging because of law in which it the pensions isn't only but also around social expenditure which the "silent" coalition has concluded of CSSD and KSCM (Communists) last year before the elections.
The second is the budgetary policy in deficit as a result of the first weak point.
The third restriction consists in the deficits of the public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
The greatest risk, however, isn't the state budget deficit.
This household is public and one javelin measures under control.
However, a true time bomb is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors often distributed rashly to develop further sources apart from takings from taxes, taxes and bank loans for investments debentures by which they were responsible for their city halls in excess.
Within the last few years they managed to pay these debts off by sale of shares of the energy and different one supply grids which had got them in the train of the privatization from the state on a massive scale.
This source has already dried up now.
As far as we only hold on to official and verifiable facts, we notice that:
our economy already for some years, like the rest of the world, a growth phase passes,  without the CSSD this one refrain himself boasts.
This represented a single opportunity for her governments, to fix the public finances.
These governments were, however, still more responsible for the state instead.
Other countries, except for a couple of exceptions like Hungary Albania, Pakistan or Egypt have economized much more sensibly than our republic.
This is a giant disgrace which has to be ascribed to the former governments mainly.
We belong to the countries which are threatened by poverty least, seen in the global scale.
Therefore no nassiven social programs which unfortunately were inflated quite superfluously in a gigantic extent just within the last few years are necessary.
Even if it has turned out well to cut a part of the nonsensical populistic expenditure which was adopted this year before the elections is clear that if it doesn't come to a moving of the pension admission age and to a reform of pensions in the near future, any politics then ends practically in this country and, who is identically on the power, will it have nothing as managing purely.
It is exaggerated only easily if one says that ruling politicians then turn into officials who mechanically divide the largest portion of the tax revenue up on pensions and social expenditure.
Therefore this year's household cannot be a revolution but can put a stop to only the superseding of normal expenditure by duty expenditure.
The deficit provided for 2008 of 70 billion crowns definitely wouldn't be governments superfluously, if earlier would have distributed, what went only within the last ten years.
If we don't want that it really comes to that, that ruling politicians turn into pure civil servants, then we must be patient and wish this not too strong coalition government, however, which is conscious of this one that the state can spend much only in such a way as it is able to take to taxes and charges quiet at the preparations for broader reform laws.
Only these make a gradual putting through of a balanced national budget possible.
Jirí Krejcí
Banks want to cope with crisis
The American Federal reserve and the European central bank of Great Britain, the Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight against the crisis together on the finance markets.
So more than 100 billion dollars will reach the currency markets with the help of auctions.
On these auctions the banks auction interest rates at which they are ready to lend each other money.
The American Fed for example sends 40 billion dollars on auction, it forks further 24 out for the European and the Swiss Central Bank.
It is after the stops of September 11th the first time that the central banks of the individual states have agreed on such a coordinate procedure for the defense or Abmilderung of the results of a financial crisis.
This step shall remove the greatest difficulties of the economy "therefore" the increasing lack of freely available capital which the banks can award Bernard Baumohl of the consultancy firm Economic Outlook Group wrote in a report for his customers.
"The coordinate action of the central banks" has, Baumohl added in its report to do the probability of a recession in the USA from 65% to about 50% reduced.
The banks have already lost by 60 billion dollars because of not used loans primarily in the United States.
Analysts expect even further billion losses.
"The central banks really must have been afraid of it ", what still everything can follow when procedures decided on it " the chief economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies, said.
"It looks so that the situation is really bad", he further said.
The central banks have the fears, that if the banks have access to loans themselves, loans also get more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and throw the American economy into a recession possibly with effects on the economic growth in the whole world.
The central banks have decided after they hadn't succeeded, the so-called LIBOR abzusenken, the Londoner interbank interest rate which is used between banks at the financial rental company.
This means that the banks were permanently afraid to lend each other money and this although their interest rates had abgesenkt for the central banks of the USA, Canada and Great Britain during the fall repeatedly.
"This will have the same effect as another lowering of the interest rates", told Greg Salvaggio of tense to Consulting of the agency of Reuter.
Some analysts are the opinion that this step of the central banks towards the on-heating of the crisis contributes because it doesn't solve the fundamental problem and to be more precise the case of the property market in the USA.
Klaus: Debates of the ecologists are incredible
Global climate changes harm allegedly developing countries most.
President Václav Klaus spoke again about the difficulties of the global warming.
The criticism was referring to the international meeting of UNO coming to an end for the climate change in Bali now.
He executed, that in Vienna where he presented his book "a blue, no green planet" the debates of the ecologists are incredible.
Not only the structure of the meeting which of government delegates and such forms a strange mixture of not government organizations is unacceptable according to Klaus but difference between the rhetoric which accompanies it and the reality also the basic.
The debate there is unstructured, this it is a word firework " only a substitute is, for an actual solution of present problems " Klaus said.
The Czech president emphasized at the presentation of his book that the topic is very important for him and that therefore he commits himself to it so.
His satisfaction expressed also about this that his book is published in German translation because "I often meet" caricatures of my views him.
So interested parties could look up his attitude undistortedly now.
Klaus reminded that he no-one is climatic box but he has sufficient prerequisites in his opinion to write such a book.
He is finally a graduate to understand and to judge technical treatises capably, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
He described the thesis as main statement of the book, that the climate permanently changes and that so its changes are normal that the effort is superfluously ineffectively and unacceptably influence the development of the climate, and that effortful no corresponding opinion admits for the global warming under the scientists that the results of the present changes are great and serious and therefore didn't represent no threat too.
Furthermore he regards to force unproved opinions upon others for unacceptable as somebody who has experiences with totalitarian Sytemen he considers this a dangerous restriction of the liberty.
On questions of persons present he explained repeated, he is not up against ", but against militant environmental activists, a sensible environmental protection which doesn't consider the relationship between effort and yield ".
Klaus had already talked about the same topic in Vienna in the Hayek institute two months ago.
600000 people didn't manage to exchange their driver's license
600000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driver's license whose validity goes off at the end of the year.
The last day is today where one can apply for the exchange so that the authorities manage to issue a new driver's license until end of the year.
However, the department doesn't fear that hundreds of thousands drivers go onto the streets without a valid driving right after New Year.
According to the authorities those which don't want to drive any more haven't exchanged their driver's license mainly.
While little places are reporting a declining of the interest in the Füherscheinumtausch strongly, still the offices of the capital are showered with applications and the interest in the exchange grew this week.
The municipal authority attends to about 2000 customers daily.
One must line up approximately one half hour.
Approx. 140000 drivers haven't exchanged their driver's license in Prague yet.
The exhibition lasts for 20 days one new driver's license.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with an abbreviated period of five days.
In this case the driver but 500 crowns for this purpose numbers must.
A fine threatens drivers as of January who don't create the specified exchange until end of the year and drive off without a valid driver's license.
The wrongdoer pays at most 2000 crowns.
However, the police also can have it left at an admonition at the violation.
In the case of a violation the punishment can climb 2500 crowns.
According to earlier information can the one of the municipality who doesn't drive at all also imposes a punishment got.
He he can, was so called threaten, a punishment of even 30000 crowns.
The department already called upon the offices to let mildness prevail and to impose a punishment of 1000 on crowns at the most.
However, one thousand crown punishment threatens nobody unite according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The driver's license is a document at which everybody can decide whether he wants to have it or not.
It isn't an identity card, that one of everybody, and to be more precise one valid, must have.
People who don't want to drive any more should hand in their driver's license.
It suffices to take him to the responsible local authority or to send him by certified mail there.
Driver's licenses which were issued between 1964 and 1993 get invalid at the end of the year.
However, the drivers must exchange gradually also further kinds of driver's license.
People with driver's licenses from the years 1994 to 2000 have three years time for the exchange.
The validity of driver's licenses which were issued in 2001 to 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka it is all about about 2.6 million of additional driver's licenses.
Court lowers punishments for private investigators who were allied with Berdych
The former policemen Josef Opava and Petr Konarík which are accused to have made cause common with the gang of David Berdych got 13 or 10 years custody.
This decided the Prague Higher Regional Court in a final judgement, around one this or her punishment reduced by two years.
Originally 14 or 12 years threatened the private investigators of the "office for the fight against the organized crime."
Against today's verdict there isn't any possibility to appeal, only revision is possibly court with the colonel.
Although Berdych itself also is accused of in this thing but the of the court of first instance verdict lies ahead next to it.
At other processes he had already got punishments of altogether 16 years, however.
He too more cannot be sentenced.
A District Court talked to persons primarily guiltily because of participation in robberies in January 19, the Higher Regional Court negotiated the vocation of 16 of them today.
Disputed the charges from the beginning with the grounds, it is a designed case accused most.
According to the medium-Bohemian District Court among other things members submitted information to the police in arrangement with Berdych criminals from sources of the police, different robberies covered and helped members of the gang to escape the criminal prosecution.
The gang left 30 per cent of the spoils to Opava and Konarík for this.
At the charges it is all about criminal offenses of the bonds from the years 1999 to 2001.
Particularly around robberies whose victims heavy injuries often suffered but also around unauthorized assumption of authority and forbidden possession of firearms.
At house searches the police discovered namely illegal pistols, ammunition with steel core, a laser telescopic sight and a submachine gun.
The gang has made money according to the charges by its robberies around many millions of crowns.
Unless beihnahe 20 men in this method recognized courts Berdych and a number of others finally because of further robberies than guilty.
Further men from Berdychs surroundings must justify in another process, broader cases haven't reached the court yet.
The main hearing has escaped Tomás Puta and till now Maros Sulej which are in an Irish custody and wait for the definite decision on their delivery for the purpose of criminal prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children mixed up, invoice: 12 million
Of children in a maternity hospital the advocate of the hurt parents, Igor Veleba, wants  the exchange  to ask compensation of the hospital in Trebíc 12 million crowns plus court costs for.
For each of the mothers per three million, for the fathers per two million and for the children per a million.
The hospital offers at most 200000 for every parent couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondrej Dostál, doesn't approve of the suggestion Velebas therefore at all.
We turn down such a suggestion, it lies too high around a multiple, said Dostál after today's negotiation.
"To, however, be able an opinion on this counterproposal to form us, we need the report which had the opposite side made.
We will find out whether it has statement value at all.
However, we insist " on the opinion that this should lie in the one hundred thousand area for everyone together Dostál emphasized.
The amount should move according to him between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
At the beginning the family wanted from Jablonov, this one for every month it hadn't raised its biological daughter, a million crowns.
For Veleba a report which had worked out the university hospital for it in Prague Motol served as a basis for compensation negotiations.
Emotional damages and stress symptoms suffered from strength and depth the parents of the children in opinion of experts from the area of psychology and psychiatry in different.
The men stood the stress situation, better, they would even if they saw themselves compared with reproaches have been able to prevent the mistake of the newborn childs.
Veleba summarized the content in turn the women cope with the aftereffects of the experienced trauma worse as well as what is just going off also with this now together.
Veronika and Nikola mixed up nurses of the maternity hospital in Trebíc on December 9th last year.
The children swept to their biological parents back Nikola to the Cermáks in Pribyslavice and Veronika to Libor Broz and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jablonov last week.
The district chieftain the Vysocina (Bohemian Moravian height) submitted 100000 crowns as a replacement for expenditure which had resulted for them from the fault of the hospital in Trebíc which is subordinate to the district to every family at the end of October.
All hospitals in Czechia are of because of law custody compulsorily insured.
In the case of doubt they must reach for a reserve fund, they can only for once apply to the strap for help.
For once the courts have awarded comparatively low compensation sums to persons affected till now, the amounts were determined by tables and moved in the area of hundreds of thousands of millions.
Polívka came around its kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the quarrel about the brand of "kingdom Walachei."
According to the judge at the District Court in Ostrava actor he has used the name "Walachischer king" as the first but the project had a team around Tomás Harabis in interaction with this in long-standing work built up.
Today, Polívka didn't take part in the negotiation.
According to his advocate the thing probably isn't completed with that, however, and his client will well lodge an appeal.
The quarrel goes therefore that Mr Harabis and his team want to participate in the popularity Bolek Polívkas parasitically, said advocate after the negotiation Polívkas.
Everyone just introduced himself to the words "Walachisches kingdom" these actor and comedian.
Harabis also is of the same opinion.
"We have an almost ten years' work behind ourselves.
He said financial obtaining and concepts of the activities, ".
According to him the cause is quarrel about money.
"After years they have noticed that the project is successful and that they also could have something of this.
You want to win at our work parasitically, " he passed on.
Lucrative business
According to the court Polívka used the name "Walachischer king" in one of its television programs for the first time.
The actor Radoslav Brzobohat ý crowned him in 1993.
At that time, however, this wasn't connected with the intention to justify a fictitious kingdom.
For some years, later, Harabis came onto the thought of distributing walachische passports.
From an originally droll action a business and an entrepreneurial activity crystallized, then attached the foundation of the company "Walachisches kingdom" to the Harabis.
In 1997 Polívka agreed to the use of its name and its signature in the passports and offered her owners even reductions at the visit of its farm and its performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge led today, too, that Harabis used only the bare idea which has made Polívka publicly in the shipment of "ring" for its entrepreneurial intentions.
"The popularity Polívkas has helped the project for certain of the walachischen kingdom", said the judge.
However, she added that the soul of the project Harabis and its team which would have devoted themselves to it intensively are.
This one lasted for the cooperation for estranged parties up to the year 2000 today when Harabis organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
The disputes started to occur increasingly between Polívka and Harabis, " saint " King Boleslavs I. voted for until this with themselves never flax day since then, however, these in the withdrawal culminated.
The leading role then took up on suggestion Harabiss Jarmila Suláková as Königinmutter.
2002 then reached Polívka legal action, to Harabis and its company one which rejected the court today.
The competition prepared by Harabis could deprive clarity in the quarrel of the throne and half a princess.
A new king should result from it.
He didn't want to betray details and an appointment yet.
"We want to rush nothing.
Something like that should be like the king move in the Walachei.
The king should be elected for a particular time.
Mr Polívka also can apply at it safely, " Harabis added.
VTi test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6: Voruteile fade
To say the truth I was never a special fan the Peugeot 206.
Many weren't worth his handling characteristics, one could describe the quality of the gearshift, the steering and also the processing as rather below average.
Now but his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market and this one is better around much.
Opinion to revise thinks the station wagon with the name SW is still a piece further and I only have left.
When I had tested the classic Hatchback of 207, I had to complain about the too low head liberty on the backseats for example.
These troubles exist the bodywork no more, then now the station wagon is so arranged that two meter men won't even suffer.
Fast further
I only go through the interior décor briefly to not repeat myself too much.
It is a quite excellent design where I have objections only because of the wretched middle tunnel.
I would welcome a little more designerische design there where otherwise the car makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable and are the times past where perhaps we complained about too short seats or head-rests.
The side hold also has itself opposite this 206 fundamentally improves.
What the room supply concerns, one can feel the extended measurements of the bodywork also here.
The lack of head liberty already mentioned is also removed in the station wagon.
Suitcase into the trunk
However, the main thing at this car is the cargo hold.
I must describe this one as very good (also because of the folding rear window) loading in cash and space-savingly.
The cavities are equipped with safety harnesses which represent an ideal compromise.
You don't disturb apart ache and hold also heavier objects tight be able to.
But we talk about the loading up volume.
Table is 428 liters loudly in the basic equipment, what is a rather average value in comparison with the competition.
Vehicle of this class, the Skoda Fabia Combi, most not sold in comparison with this in Czechia though.
The 207 compares SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we we establish if stays behind that the Peugeot around clear noticeable 52 liters.
For a foreign vacation or loading a baby carriage this value is already critical.
But to stress the Positiva I still must this one after folding the pillions down mention very flat cargo hold or also the very low loading up edge.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder gasoline engine with cubic capacity 1.6 liters and a performance of 88 kW.
And a 1600-Kubik engine which drives a family Hatchback should look so, said honestly.
He is quiet, has a low consumption and moves away well.
If I compare him with his counterpart at Skoda which sometimes works as if his exhaust were stopped up with a rag, then I only can be filled with enthusiasm by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car isn't traditional at all.
However, we must remember that we have tested a car equipped well with a spacious Innneren and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400s gasoline engine in the amount of 329900 crowns still comes on.
With our engine it costs as of 410900 crowns what is already quite a lot.
The equipment quality of the test car beats with 80000 crowns in addition to beech once again.
We had head airbags, automatic air conditioner, automatic windshield wiper triggering, electrical window controls and and ... behind, though
So the car costs simple 531900 crowns, altogether.
One this is a crowd but you calculate once the additional equipment Fabia together and you want to arrive at a quite similar sum.
Therefore only remains the decision which brand one wants to choose.
Integration of Slovakian pupils to britschen schools is not successful
The number of children gains from countries of Eastern Europe in British schools which arouses worries about the further development of the local school system in the natives.
The integration of the east Europeans meets with a number of obstacles till now.
British schools establish even cases where disputes gain in violence between the immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants.
The case of North Kent illustrates the problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe to britschen schools aptly where the discussions increase gradually between the natives and Slovakian immigrants.
Quarrellings, harassments and scraps under pupils have transferred themselves to the relations between the parents.
The situation has already developed so far that the police arrested a Slovakian woman in Chatham who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron bar.
The accused defended himself, that with that the boy has offended her by racialist insults.
Two of juvenile girls had the police to step in on a Slovakian immigrant also after an attack.
The girls had made allegedly racialist remarks and thrown stones at him opposite the man.
"When we went home, a boy climbed a bus cottage and spat on us.
When I told him he should stop another unpleasant occurrence he threw apples and pears at us and laid bare then his buttocks, " a nut of Slovakian pupils described the newspaper The Timeses.
Troubles come from the two sides.
One of the natives even described the quarrel with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as an over-life fight.
The specified cases attest the fact that the atmosphere gets tenser and tenser between natives and immigrants at British schools.
70000 Slovaks who came onto looking for work here are reported in Great Britain.
About 30000 Slovakian pupils therefore attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island of the caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of the liberty.
Whatever you expect from your vacation this will be realized if you select only the right thing.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea which is quiet like a pond.
Palms and space including with waiters who offer pizza, ice and beguiling cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
You find this in ample measure on the islands of the caribbean.
Only on one the large Antilles you, however, find island still much more and Cuba is this island the great and beautiful.
In the time of the Spaniards Cuba was the bastion for the conquest of America.
It called Columbus the most beautiful place which has seen per a human eye.
Havana cigar turned a store or transit camp of treasures once which the Spaniards had stolen in America and then transported to Europe.
And then the American epoch came.
The hotel Nacional completely came into being at the end of the 20th century.
One of the bosses of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, had it because everything which was regarded as a crime in the USA (particularly during the Prohibition) was seen and supported with pleasure in Cuba build, drugs, game of chance, prostitution.
Under his guests were and others
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
Skyscrapers grew into Havana cigar, cars which belonged to the ritual symbols of the fifties of the former Jahrhundets drove over the broad boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought an estate for himself in San Francisco de Paula nearby Havana cigars and he had his yacht in Cojímar lie.
Stars of the show business and politicians from all of America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita Del Medio.
And today?
You also can leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana cigar.
One mixes cocktails quite as required for you at the bar in the hotel Nacional.
And the cult cars of the fifties go around to Havana cigar to this day because the Schigulis imported once and Fiats have fallen apart already long ago in the salty and damp air.
One may have come down Havana cigar, particularly his oldest part, strongly, finds as many wonderful colonial sights as straight nowhere in the surroundings here.
Other places are just decorated, for example Trinidad.
The tourism brings money required urgently, there was green light for this development into regard on this, that.
Within the last fifteen years new hotels haven't come into being only into Havana cigar but also in Varadero at the coast of the province Holguín and also on little islands like Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a quirk which is unique and attracts primarily railroad enthusiasts in the world.
Steam and diesel operated narrow-gauge railroads took the sugar cane of remote plantations to the sugar factories.
Your fleet of vehicles wasn't replaced over decades and one sees there funny and fully operating engines so whose contemporaries are in the museum somewhere else already.
Destinations of the outing
The majority of the visitors of Cuba doesn't leave the bedeutendendsten places out.
So one must write no longer in detail about Varadero or Havana cigar.
It only remains to mention that a museum is located in the estate of Hemingway already mentioned whose visit the one who likes this writer shouldn't miss.
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque angles of Cuba.
The luxuriant vegetation grows on chalky soil.
The Mogotas, lime hill and rock, rise steeply of the valley ground, the fertile ground by which also weathered rock areas of a thick vegetation are covered accumulated in their cavities.
It is this valley where the perhaps best Cuban tobacco is cultivated.
In his final form you can meet him if you go to one of the cigar factories of Havana cigar.
It possibly seems also interesting to some, that the Chilean result of the television series "major Zeman" was turned there.
Trinidad
An ancient town which was founded briefly after the Spaniards had colonized the island.
The trade brought her glory and wealth with slaves and sugar.
The wealth embodied itself in the neat beauty of the little town.
Influences Spanish colonial architecture, strong of the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, is such a remote place that there wasn't any street yet in the fifties of the last century there which would have put the area through to the other country, lain between the sea and the Escambray mountains.
This insulation contributed that it remained unnoticed.
Nothing was built there but everybody was glad that he had a roof over the head, torn off from nothing also therefore.
One it more than an afternoon time has, is then worthwhile to look at interesting places in the surroundings for Trinidad if such as the beach playa Ancón or the "valley of the sugar factories".
In the evening one then should go La Música into the Casa de which revives after the darkness and the music isn't where silent up to the morning.
Baracoa
Some completely describe this small towns as the most beautiful of the island in the east of Cuba.
This view also is surely influenced through the way there.
Both streets which lead of Guantánamo there had to and zerküftete mountains overcome and go by a landscape which is hardly touched by human interventions high.
UNESCO included this eastern outpost of Cuba in its world heir list thanks to the untouched nature there.
The best chocolate is produced there, in the church one shows the cross of Columbus (in reality it has arisen after the journeys of Columbus) about one hundred years and of the hill where the former castle, the present hotel tbsp Castillo, stands several table mountains can be seen which El Yunque is the best known.
One could write many pages over the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra-Maestra mountains, the pig bay and the island of Isla de Pinos over the Tropicana cabaret, the shrine of the Cuban patron Caridad Del Cobre about the Santeria, an African religion which the descendants of slaves confess, over all this.
But as one says so: Looking with eyes of one's own better.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
To few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment influences the course of the mission according to the United States in Afghanistan.
The NATO should draw up a concrete plan according to the words of Minister of Defense Robert Gates for the next years.
The mission in Afghanistan doesn't get lost after their ideas, the representatives of the countries which have stationed units in the south of the country agreed in the Scottish Edinburgh.
The Taliban discuss the eight participating states besides the growing resistance on the part of also over further coordination plans under the allies.
While the United States were calling upon the NATO units for more activity by their Verteigungsminister Robert of Gate, Great Britain sees the priority in the strengthening of the authority of the Afghan government and in the intensification of the foreign aid.
"A forward development is noticeable in Afghanistan but armed forces power can be only a part of the solution.
Larger part consists " in making it possible for the inhabitants to start with even a development of the economy and safety the British Verteigungsminister of the Browne says to the BBC.
Ninety per cent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest stand according to information from the American army for five years.
The number of force actions has increased by 27 per cent in the southern province Helmand even by sixty per cent in comparison with the previous year.
About 40000 soldiers stationed, of this approximately a quarter in the southern territory, have the NATO countries in Afghanistan.
According to the United States the allies, however, have reached an absolute border, what concerns organization and equipment of the units.
They concrete demand further helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of the Afghan units.
We will have to think about the concrete aims seriously as we can accomplish them for the next time and about the way, said Gates.
The Secretary General of the NATO, Jaap de Hoop, similarly spoke today.
"I am not pleased with what we have in Afghanistan to country and in the air at the disposal.
We have about ninety per cent of the soldier and equipment need which we would and this is too little, " De Hoop said to the agency of Reuter at the completion of three-day conversations with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive?
Within the last months, quarrel over it also is, whether under the countries involved all allies give her best in Afghanistan.
Because of passiveness Germany was for example criticized.
"The Germans are relatively represented numerously in Afghanistan.
However, you are stationed in areas, where there is only a minimum to force and the fight requirements are not so high for them like for us in the southern and eastern part of the country, " Gates said.
The British tabloid "Sun" described the German soldiers as lazybones this week.
"Afghan idlers exposed: The Germans make games while our Jungs are fighting " the "Sun" wrote in a contribution which was completed by photos of German soldiers which play table tennis.
The German picture newspaper went over to the counterattack and printed a picture of a British unity at a rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
National debts become very fast on a trillion in the year 2009
A national debt of 84000 crowns is allotted to every Czech.
The complete fault increased on 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
The government had planned to get into debt this year with 159.2 billion Konen.
The department reduced the plan, however, thanks to the more positive development of the state Hauhaltspolitik to 152.8 billion at the beginning of December.
The national debts of the Czech Republic climbed 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
Within the first nine months of this year they therefore increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June they sank by 13.4 billion, though.
The Treasury confirmed its details on the national debts of the beginning of October with that.
A fault of 84000 crowns is allotted to every Czech.
Over the complete last year the state got into debt around more than 111 Miliarden crowns.
"Up till now seem that we will exceed the limit of a trillion crowns possibly only in the year 2009 thanks to the lower deficit for the next year.
Next year should move the debts between 900 billion and a trillion crowns, " David Marek, analyst the Patria Finance, said to the server iHNed.cz.
It looks like Vladimír spade ossa, analyst the Next Finance: "We could come to the transgression of a trillion in the course of the year 2009.
When exact it depends on the next household we don't know this one yet.
If it should turn out that the situation on the political stage changes and the politicians should be ready to save more, this could last up to the year 2010.
But I don't start out from such a change he noticed, ".
Debts grow
The national debt is due to the debts of the state government and comes from the accumulation of deficits of the national budget primarily.
The national debt is financed by treasury bonds, state debentures, direct loans or for example by loans of the European investment bank.
The home national debt increased on 719.4 billion crowns this year meanwhile.
The foreign debts of the state increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion meanwhile.
The so-called marketable national debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and diminished by 13.7 billion since June.
The average due date of the national debts increased to 6.5 years.
"The complete fault increased by 13 per cent from the first one over the year up to the third quarter, what is really much in view of this one as the economy is well.
It is interesting that growing can be recorded at the debentures primarily where the increase amounts to 20 per cent.
The data it is bad that the debts increase but on the other hand this shows that one can do something already before the reform of pensions comes " commented on spade ossa.
Better than expected
Dealing with the national debts for 2007 results that the government had planned for this year to take 159.2 billion crowns from the financing strategy and this.
The department reduced the plan, however, thanks to the more positive development of the state Hauhaltspolitik on 152.8 billion crowns at the beginning of December.
This amount is primarily due to the state budget deficit which obviously will reach 76 billion crowns instead of the estimated 91.3 billion this year.
The European investment bank in the amount of 1.8 billion further is remedies for the consolidation agency in the amount of 13.3 billion crowns, a ten billion reserve for the payment of the pensions, the financing of state debentures included in one's plans at most for 43 billion and around rates for the loans.
It became she today that it has given a teddy bear a name for a court in Khartum for this demonstrated.
According to detail of her advocate became the British teacher who had been accused of insult of the Islam in Sudan, sentences evening of a court to 15 days imprisonment and following expulsion in Khartum on Thursday.
The brit was accused to have permitted six to seven-year-old pupils to give a teddy bear the name Mahomet although any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She would have deserved to be whipped.
After parents of pupils had complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Education and the Arts repeatedly, the 54-year-old elementary school teacher who was active at the Unity High School of Khartum was picked up at home at herself on Sunday and accused of the Islam after article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code of the insult.
This matter actually takes its beginning in September when the teacher asks her six to seven-year-old pupils to choose a name for the class teddy bear.
The children suggest eight names Abdullah and Mohammed, under this Hassan??, principal Robert reports bowlses.
Finally when the class takes a vote, 20 of 23 children vote for Mohammed as the kindest first name.
The name of the Islamic prophet but primarily also one in Sudan is surely very more frequently Mohammed first name.
Is then my name Mohammed have the children prepared a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on this and the caption??
The bear itself didn't carry any signpost with this name but the problem is very simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult of the Islam.
Innocent fault would never have I am sorry only for a name that it has asked the children this only is one its opinion something done one of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons who teaches in Sudan, explained at the same school it knows it well and it had with what it could get a religious faith too near?to vote?,??
An opinion which numerous pupils of the teacher share the this as?very attentive opposite their pupils? ? and as person who never talks about religion in the class? describing.
One considers that the first name Mohammed is also the second name given the second most frequent on in Great Britain for which 14 different notations exist in English.
This first name often selected by Muslim families is (given a family) regarded as a kind of respect to the prophet he frequently gets the firstborn.
But what are the rules quoted in the reference to the use of this first name?
May one give him to for example a toy?
This is of course a question of the interpretation.
On Wednesday it didn't come to any agreement about the future status of the province during the last negotiation meeting in Vienna.
At the end the failure
The Serbians and Albanians from Kosovo have overcome to be able to on Wednesday mornings in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last discussion meeting ended, without their controversies about the future status of the separatist province.
It is?, that the parties couldn't come to any agreement about the status?, regrettable the European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger declared during a press conference in Vienna.
Their obligations to follow for the receipt of the peace and to continue the conversations also until after the end of the negotiations the peace is in the region on stake, the American counterpart invited Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina with emphasis on it, that.
It no acts of violence in immediate future expected but we will be??, it added and indicated that there are thoroughly clear tensions at the beginning of very difficult times.
At the end of the arrangements on December 10th
The mediators of the troika which unites the European Union, the USA and Russia into themselves will meet in Serbia and in Kosovo on Monday a last time.
The future of the province lived in to 90% Albanian speaking could get clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane Khartchenko submit their report to the UN security council until December 10th.
The conversations of Baden near Vienna formed the sixth and last negotiation meeting since the troika of last August of UNO had received the order for a new arrangement.
Americans and Europeans expect that their arrangement order on December 10th will end.
The Russians who had already blocked the permission of the independence of Kosovo at the security council insist on a continuation of the negotiations about this end date.
Russia was and remains??, an advocate of a negotiated solution, a conjoint solution Botsane-Khartchenko said.
One-page declaration of independence?
After Kosovo has been under administration of UNO for eight years, the western countries regard the independence as the only solution under supervision by the EU with future.
Pristina shows itself ready to announce these one-sided if the security council shouldn't decide in the favor.
Belgrade insists on a stronger autonomy
No agreement could regrettably be made??, the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced, confessed in the hotel in Baden, where since Monday this?negotiations of the last chance? you led.
Hashim Thaci, leader of the kosovarischen rebellion and future prime minister of the province more formerly shared the regret.
Added it, however, that the plan to the autonomy suggested by Belgrade is a thing?of a past which has led to murders and deportations?
Domino effect??
The Serbian president Boris Tradic thought for his part that a compromise has to be striven always and the Albanian majority warned of the consequences of a one-page declaration of independence of the province from Kosovo.
Belgrade thinks that it particularly a "domino effect" in a region fürchet which is still so very weakened by the wars of independence of the nineties.
For Serbia this doesn't mean he said?, that a compromise would be impossible?,.
On Tuesday the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision is taken only and alone only and alone in the security council where the Russian ally holds a power of veto.
Will the parliament of Kosovo have the last word??
Only a decision from the rows of the security council is acceptable for Serbia??, the Serbian prime minister Vojislav Kostunica declared.

The choice of the status Quo
On Sunday it won't get thrilling at the counting of the urns: The mass of the Russians will decide party, united Russia, in favor of president Putins.
After an election campaign bolted very much she confirms her striving for stability, yes even for authoritarianism.
For three days with the parliamentary elections the Russian president directs Vladimir Putin a news radiated on the public transmitters to the voters which was already recorded, whose contents are kept secret, however.
He does this in his quality as a favorite candidate of the united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party for which an overwhelming victory is heralded.
Has the president let nothing be getting it yesterday when he greeted the foreign ambassadors and was content to provide a new target against the western powers which is accused of the interference be favorite subject during the election campaign.
We know the price of a truthful democracy and hope for honest elections extremely transparent and open, elections, without cheatings??, it added.
They have slipped up from the view of the opposition there.
By oppression prangert stained one you election campaign.
The communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov doesn't say it would have, ? given never such dirty elections, once at the time of Eltsin?
Is valid after the oppression of the demonstrations at the last weekend sentenced to five days custody for former chess world's champion Garry Kasparovder for demonstrating forbiddenly had been according to his advocate furthermore visit ban.
Have the Russians kept the mentality of the homo Sovieticus??
After these parliamentary elections without tension two questions leading on much raise themselves:
? Who will succeed Putins as a president?
The office newspaper has the date of the first ballot of the presidential elections announced, March 2nd, 2008, yesterday; the candidates have time until December 23rd to announce himself.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot begin for a third mandate in consequence.
And no successor is found now.
Which role will Putin play after March?
Prime minister?
Chairman of the parliament majority and will select party united Russia, the government and president the all-powerful?
Whatever will the parliament be it, at or at the presidential elections the previous becomes power triumph?
This is tradition.
The Russians have kept the mentality of the homo Sovieticus?, they aren't master of their destiny?, the sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada, thinks.
Saint Petersburg even still goes on the historians' Nikolai Kopossov back from the state university: The civil society has itself in this country, this became to Europe christianisiert for five centuries, developed further only very slowly; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the nineties Putin has Maria Lipman of the Carnegie foundation thinks tied to the model of a paternalistischen state all the more again which was accepted by the population completely more economically since prosperity no terror followed on this new paternalism but a more certain.
Do without today?? the Russians?from liberal pieces on the personal responsibility?, have they put which after the disintegration of the USSR for a short time to the day.
Still think over for what?for a long time ??
This phenomenon concerns all social strata including the business community.
And the administration elite knows how to keep the status Quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian region chairmen) cite the local choice lists of united Russia.
The liberties which are new and coming from the west are often equivalent to chaos, as in the nineties.
The general public prefers stability.
In this meaning the Russians won't vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old lady professor: Still think it over for what?for a long time?
Those which are at the power aren't so bad, why take them off ??

Is a final annual Rally for the stock exchange still to come? Disagreement with the experts due to the U.S. mortgage crisis
With almost five weeks up to the annual accounts of the stock exchange the investors already rub their hands with regard to the coming final annual Rally.
The experts regarding this nevertheless cannot make any sure forecasts.
Banif thinks that?looks purely statistically, the month is usually accompanied by a positive market trend at the stock exchange Decembers
It nevertheless isn't advisable to make forecasts of statistics at short notice and only on the basis. Tensions to be taken if serious don't determine the current market event primarily then
Although other experts don't approve of a such firm rise in prices within the last weeks of the year these say nevertheless that the stock exchange quotation is certainly liquidity of the market and the market participant given the of?. These invest mainly in fixed-interest funds due to the lack of safe share funds, which is concerned by the aufwertsverlaufenden trend towards productive assets strongly.
The stock exchange will therefore rather show a course trend in opinion of these experts which is rather lateral and influenced by market fluctuations, ? primarily because we cannot assess the extents of the possible fall in the interest rate of the U.S. central bank yet, an uncertainty these primarily on the increased crude oil price and to lead the danger of the increase in the rate of inflation back is.
Javier Barrio, chairman of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees, that with that it is a daring time to announce a forthcoming market Rally.
The chances don't stand the expert insures??, very well.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its maximum brand on November 8th from 15,945.7 points.
But all experts don't share the same negative opinion.
In opinion of Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could, the year successfully with almost 16,000 points complete because of the restructuring of the investment funds and the subsidizing of the pension register which is traditional and carried out around this time every year.
The expert nevertheless stresses that the things could develop this year a little differently; primarily due to the final annual Rally taking place already in the second December week and therefore directly after the bridge day to the day of the constitution.
In opinion of the analyst the price fluctuations wouldn't influence the market trends.
The previous judgements are to the market situation on an almost technical standard, in the opinion of Federico Olucha, analyst at the bench Inversis, what could lead, that a deviation of the index values could stand out soon, the extents depended on the results of the U.S. mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts, that on this these turn out positive.
At the choice of the values which shall advance the Ibex to new maximum amounts the analysts agree.
Solana of Intermoney declares that it is?this year the great values' turn.
The expert would count the two big banks and some property companies as one of the value winners, ? the current sector will be too expensive at the given time there.
Assure Federico Olucha of the bench Inversis meanwhile that the increases in connection with the bank and industry sector will walk along.
If the Rally actually happens, the property companies will profit from it.
The ACS was on on fetching course within the last months and we hope that other property companies like Ferrovial and FCC take the same way?, so the expert.
Periodical consumption will determine the market event with regard to the increased consumerism during the Christmas Days in the last half year.
On the other hand the expert thinks that the technologies also will achieve positive sales results even if they are represented on the Spanish market only in a low number.
Five times within seven years
Within the last seven years December showed sinking developments of course only in two cases.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock exchange out of its crisis and this one initiated a last real final annual rally simultaneously till now.
December showed a rise in prices of 6.68% this year in which the Ibex 35 made up time by 28.17 percentage points.
2008 in consequence becomes the fifth profitable year the Ibex (has) increased by 8.36% since January and can produce an Endjahresrally also, will let itself be seen whether.
Popular will have opened its 200 credit institutions from on Mondays until on Fridays 12 hours on the day.

Altogether 200 of this are established in the economy strongest regions of Spain.
For the institute which operates under the brand name Popular Max these branch offices mean a big milestone.
Popular as the first bank group represents the jump but also for the remaining Spanish institutes since the opening hours of its branch offices prolong H to 20.30 on weekdays and H to 20.30 set H of 10 on Saturdays dares.
The bank group of BBVA also read the prolongation of its opening hours in the branch offices repeated be reported, this one hasn't taken a definite decision till now yet.
The negotiations of the bank going on at present with the labor unions seeming to aim at an agreement, which be closed 75% of all branch offices on Saturdays and open for this on a weekday in the afternoon if also not for the customers.
Whether further banks of the new initiative which adapts to the business opening hours follow will depend on the empirical values of the Popular Bank.
And this is just the intention which pursues Popular with its project, too.
It is aim to extend the opening hours of those branch offices which can include the customers of independent, small and perigynous enterprises inclined to buy but also these of large department stores due to their situation.
The bank would like to open the new 200 branch offices in the course of the next 18 months since it isn't new but changed opening hours.
The bank will alter the premises of those branch offices which already are in business zones and bring them into line with the individual customer image of the different zones simultaneously for this.
So the expansion of the opening hours gets connected to a new interior design of the branch offices which stands out due to a more current, more colorful design.
The responsible bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring doesn't require any larger investments but it would be accompanied by an increased staff attitude since a branch office needed no more six but eight or nine employees now.
The branch offices which even will be equipped with additional premises for the SMEs won't sell any financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Its concept has already tested Popular to nine branch offices in Madrid.
And the empirical values turned out positive, so Ángel Rivero.
Vía have been selected for this, the branch offices of the streets bravo Murillo, and O'Donell what seems to have been a clever decision the grain.
Popular is conducting approx. 2500 branch offices at the moment.
And further 60 operate on which under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized in immigrants and also show extended opening hours even on Sundays and bank holidays.
The model of the BBVA isn't used in these branch offices of PopularMax since most of them will offer a broad choice of not financial services for the sale instead.
We wouldn't like Rivero declares to represent competition for our customers??.
With Telefonica they have come to the agreement, to sell mobile telephones with the help of external bank staff for the time being.
The Spanish independent radio Telecinco doubles its stock exchange value for the first time and therefore overtakes its rival Antena 3.
We have made it?.
With this sentence the managing director of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, made his satisfaction known at the stock market close. The transmitter escorted by him had his value around the double one his increases rivals Antena 3.
An aspect, however, dampened his joy: This is exactly?what me this is injured; it didn't state a higher growth, that we, but that we had lower losses?,.
It emphasized that she hasn't sunk too deeply?despite the weak market.
Telecinco ended the day with a positive balance of 2.54% yesterday.
This profit decreases its previous this year's losses on 15.66%.
According to information from Bloomberg the goodwill reaches the 4,488.88 million euros now in which Mediaset checks the main share of the capital (52%) and Vocento is involved only with 13%.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has to register a loss of altogether 40.5% since January so that his market value amounts to the half with 2,193.46 million.
The market value of other listed communication enterprises, however, increases; in the case of Sogecable on 3,571 million at Prisa (publisher of the magazine Cinco Días) on 2,518.53 million and at Vocento on 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be deduced from the fact that himself?it is two similar enterprises?, so Vasile.
The question on which scale we can actually stock exchange technically proceed uncertainly still turns up for which price and how we can design it lucrative on customer level.
Telecinco explained its plan a week ago to climb to the first TV station with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenue this year. This assured the advertising enterprise of the group of Guiseppe Tringali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publiespaña.
If the plan should be realized, the transmitter would increase its advertising earnings in comparison with the 965.4 million by 3.6% from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3 the net sales increased (up to 734.4 million) by 1.6% within the first nine stock exchange months while the net earnings could show only an increase in 0.7% (630.4 million) out of the watching TV business.
The analysts see the main factor for the stock exchange course better in the comparison of Telecinco which the company could show until present time Payout reason at the high one: The enterprise escorted by Alejandro Echevarría arranged for a 100 per cent dividend payout in 2006.
Vasile assures, however, that still could vary the reason after the purchase of 33% of the shares of Endemol with Mediaset as a parent company even if it is still too early for an official announcement.
We are obliged to the official compromise to pay at least 50% of the shares out even if we have shown off always considerably more till now?.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year whose share values we could already increase by the purchase of 33% of the Endemol shares.
According to statement of the analysts the market is showing certain loss trends at present.
Lehmann Brothers only recently reduced his profit calculation by 7% at Telecinco for this year by 4% and for 2009.
This is the result of the cut in the expected rate of increase which will decline in 2008 from 10.5% to 8.4% and in 2009 from 5.5% to 5.1%.
This also has reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 by 4.5% and for 2009 by 7.5%.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: the purchase of both shares puts dividend yield and its lasting potential on his high ones and therefore recommends.
2.
Caja Madrid: measures Telecinco (buy) because of the?multiple incentive? at and the prospering market a more advantageous position as Antena 3 (hold).
3.

In addition, became the advocate of Juan Morales accused, the head suspicious case of urban development corruption discovered in this to the beginning of this week.
According to information of the Cadena SER the advocate was the?popular?, and consequently privileged representative Juan Morales in leaving the place of residence of his client due to documents charging more importantly arrested which shall stand with the conspiracy in connection.
Other information sources of the putative order payments Morales report building contractors to a galizisches there which provided the conclusion of an urban development contract in this the buildings of a 200 hectares area were decided on.
Eight persons are sitting in detention while awaiting trial at present.
Agreeable, the candidacy of the PSOE agree Bono trap an electoral victory in Toledo and, to take care in the convention.
The former Minister of Defense José Bono has accepted the offer of the district president and Secretary General of the socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Demgemäß will he cite the list of the PSOE candidates in the coming general elections in Toledo and the office of the convention president take in the case of an electoral victory of the socialists.
So it has announced José Blanco, organization secretary of the PSOE, and Bono in the press conference after a meeting took place in the headquarters of the party with Zapatero today.
In opinion of the head of the government the supply is justified, there in politics?is important to the former secretary to be able count best on which? and Bono is under the best ones?.
In addition, the politician being from the Mancha would become?by all appearance in the case of a victory for the socialists in the coming elections? running for the party as a chairman of the convention.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as convention presidents. This had announced on November last 15th to not begin in the next general elections any more, to end its career in public politics and to use himself for the climate protection in the universitären area instead.
The former secretary had to admit that the district president would have pressed for its return to the political event continuously since its resignation two years ago.
Moreover, he pointed out that who would take over the position of the convention president in the case of an electoral victory doesn't want to withhold the party, as in the case of the appointment of the vice-president for economy, from the citizens and this described as one?act of the transparency?
If he should actually assume the office, he hopes for the chamber?house the respect and not the insult or the screaming into one so? change, around it so this one?seem still more similar to citizens to have.
One regrettably gains the impression?from time to time as if which is convention the only place in which one cannot talk smoothly and calmly in Madrid; so the district president was interrupted once in the senate up to 26 times.
He praised the current president Manuel Martín his good work and?at the same time? his political opponents and indicated, he doesn't want to wake the appearance to have assumed the office already since otherwise this as?arrogance? describes became.
Climate propaganda
Since the climate debate subjects the sceptics of the climate change like also those which put a social and political debate regarding this to the foreground to a merciless criticism both, the movement as whole must put a strong cohesion to the day.
This one, as in the case of the district president Zapatero whom fight against the climate change for more important keeps as the fighting the Islamic terrorism and even suggests, unites primarily if it is a leader of the movement?new contract with the planet? completing.
This suggestion takes him to explanation need, however, regarding the behavior or not behavior of his government which has decisively contributed that Spain is within the EU at the head of the countries which the specifications of the Kioto protocol at only few have fulfilled.
These who the persons responsible for the non-payment of the specifications are, this one this has to be led back and why his government has on which sectors?contract with the planet? had, not stopped this development suggested.
In addition, he is forced to now, this one intended to explain measures against the climate change without beating about the bush for the Spanish citizens by him.
Which companies will be affected by it, which individual and collective economy measures which behavior of the citizens shall be changed have to be carried out and which economic consequences arise from it.
More exactly said who must sacrifice himself and will pay for the rescue of the planet.
Has it and won't there be such explanations in future, though.
Just because it is itself about sacrificing and paying.
Because the measures which can be used really against the climate change are unpopular.
You are cost rich, uncomfortable and dangerous for the accounts of the companies and citizen.
Even the gasoline cent suggested by the PSOE seemed choice strategically seen to Zapatero to take the suggestion back so dangerously again that it felt forced.
It is correspondingly necessary to save the planets with nothing therefore with a pure propaganda and empty sayings real consequences without everybody now.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
This one must speak, neither still accuse nor demand politicians otherwise so suitable for election campaigns with his contracts with the planet instead but the demanding version follow, embroider the meetings and fill others with enthusiasm with his gentle courage and quality.
However, this can happen only if the contract doesn't deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore doesn't pretend either that the bicycle gets future to the only means of locomotion or we may refresh each other only with a fan.

My family doctor presents me one of his long, strange research articles with the title: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas primarily if the other get more of this?.
Therefore the feelings arising from the monthly salary payment are dependent on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was prepared with the help of a tomographisch magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn and the results were published in the last issue of the science magazine Science.
The activation was the strongest then if the participant gave correct answers and his con-player, however, failed according to statement Bernd of Weber, author of the study and director of the Bonn brain research center Life & Brain?.
The researchers could recognize that the brain activities always turned out very moderate when both participants were with their answer right and therefore also got the same salary; but if one got the double from them, it also added to a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it requires actually so much scientific effort to reach such a result.

Which insurance is suited for me best?
The motor vehicle insurance which covers a possible claim caused by the driver contains a high expense of age, sex, time of the preparation of the driver's license, marital status, type of the car to be insured and its use, among others whose height of re-rum of different factors takes off etc..
It is only the beginning to have a car.
Because it is even more difficult to find the fitting motor vehicle insurance than the right vehicle model.
At first once must be clear for one with which we have to do it here.
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholder.
This agreement is in writing held tight by means of an insurance contract which fixes that the society gets the arranged insurance premium and is engaged in return to present the corresponding compensation sum at a claim.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance among others age, sex, time of the preparation of the driver's license, marital status, type of the vehicle to be insured or its use which gets together by several factors.
The insurance enterprises fix their prices according to the statistics so that in case of a higher accident danger also larger payments of contribution get due.
Having to for this reason both about 25-year and make women less payments of contribution because statistics prove that these groups show a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same also applies to married persons according to statement of the statistical values and therefore also after conviction the enterprise, too less accidents incline these, since as singles.
The use which is attached to the vehicle impairs the frequency of the driving and thus also the probability of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more probable the damage.
At the list of the bonus the insurances must take into account a whole number of points.
For this reason the driver also must study the situation thoroughly to select exactly the car insurance which most likely approaches his personal needs.
We list the most important points now in this place which one should draw at the choice of an insurance into respect to be not able to make only performance, but also a price oriented choice.
Meet the less than 25-year-old numerous obstacles, such as the low driving experience and this one?young in the choice of a reasonably priced insurance? Driver's license.
Even if it would be the best for an ideal insurance cover to effect a fully comprehensive insurance, there are nevertheless cheaper alternatives.
The careful drivers can select a fully comprehensive insurance with percentage excess so that the services of a fully comprehensive insurance are covered but offered at a low price.
This kind of contract contains that the customer must pay a part of the amount arisen from the damage himself.
The amount is?fixed before conclusion of the contract and using the amount of the insurance premium. This is more highly?, the lower the sum to be paid Luis Noguera, main representative of Spain at roof ridge Europe, explains to an arrangement enterprise for online insurances.
Another option isn't, however, the extended insurance against the damages arisen at the car of one's own which insures the customer against external accident damages.
In addition, this type of the insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here one piece of advice.
If you are under 25 years old, it is in your hand to lower the insurance costs; so your credit note increases by trying to drive carefully and to avoid accidents.
A credit note is a reduction in the base rate at the appropriate insurance company.
A punishing payment on the contrary contains an increase in a said rate to this.
Yields take off the height of credit notes and punishing payments?of the society and this one.
If the enterprise has a yield rich year behind itself, can permit himself to increase the bonus payments?, Noguera explains.
As soon as the 25 annual brand is exceeded, it is easier for the drivers to conclude a contract. Reason for it is the fact that with an increasing driving experience the accident rate drops.
It therefore makes most sense to decide in favor of a fully comprehensive insurance with percentage excess.
The teenagers usually cannot not profit from their previous experience, both in the case of an accident and at the time of the driving??, this one explains abbots of the European enterprise Spanish and adds that the majority of the accidents happens in the second practice year after these?fear of the beginner? you put down.
It nevertheless is more advisable with a married customer who doesn't have any children to effect a fully comprehensive insurance; natural only then, if it also allows the financial situation of the corresponding person.
Married couple is regarded as the customers on the part of the insurers with children with the lowest accident rate and its payments of contribution correspondingly also turn out low.
In this case a fully comprehensive insurance would be the best option with percentage excess (at an amount by the 300 euros). One a high credit note has received, an extended insurance recommends this one only to the third vehicle year to itself in the case that shows commitment.
Altogether, you drive?eased and have a greater spending power which permits it to them to attach a larger payment of contribution?, Luis Noguera states.
Offers one's services for pensioners whom employs only at a sufficiently high credit note to effect a fully comprehensive insurance with percentage excess (at an amount by the 150 euros) or an extended insurance.
One must hold tight at long last that it is the car insurance a little very important that a thorough choice is made which corresponds to our personal situation not only because it protects the driver against possible accident damages but also because it holds high costs which require it.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes for the point for the round before the quarter final in Milan
The FC Milan and the Celtic Glasgow will the Championsleague-first part of the season fight for the point which they lack around her respective aims still reach in San Siro next Tuesday in front of degree. The Italians need the point to reach the top of their group while this is deciding on their participation with the Scots.
The Italian team has already five points and hers have already confirmed participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal while the Celtic Glasgow still needs a further one with nine points to go for certain that the FC Shakhtar doesn't catch up with the Befica Lisbon with six points with four points.
The two games of the group of D will which takes place at the 16 ten take place a week before the end of the sixth round since the FC Milan must begin at the FIFA club World Cup in Japan where it will fight for the admission in the final at the 13 ten in the semi-final for the first time.
So this group will be completed in front of all other ones and this draws expected result in the Guiseppe Meazza stadium to this everywhere even if both teams will to win try. The Italians won't want to speculate at home namely the Keltik Glasgow knows, this they would get group the former in the case of a victory and would have a better starting point in the round before the quarter final with that.
A defeat could be enough for the team of Gordon Strachan even at a setback of the FC Shakhtar to qualify. It nevertheless shouldn't trust on such circumstances too much because the participation is entitled to the Ukrainians at nine points equal stand; (2-1) had lost this one in Glasgow last week but at the second game (2-0) could win.
So the Milanese will therefore try to spoil the evening for the Scots. These hoping for re-rum to reach the round before the quarter final of the altered Championsleague for the second time in consequence after they were defeated by Kaka by a gate in the after-season (1-0) and by one zero to zero draws on the first leg in exactly the same round in the vorrangehenden game season.
During the FC Shakhtar on the victory this one?Rossoneri? wait the team will have to concentrate on the game of its own since both reaching the round before the quarter final and his take off membership at the UEFA of his victory and a defeat of the Celtic Glasgow.
The Benfica Lisbon could gain the third place and therefore join in at the UEFA despite its lower table position and without the view by a victory furthermore to be allowed to take part in the greatest European championship.

New fears about natural gas quarrel between Russia and the Ukraine
A new price quarrel burns off slowly what the danger increases between the Ukraine and Russia that Russian exports of fuel are impaired to Western Europe.
The largest portion of the Russian natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) is conducted by the Ukraine and every quarrel between the two nations is watched very exactly.
Kiew has warned, that if Moscow increases the price which it must pay for the natural gas, it will bill for higher transit charges of Russia.
An earlier conflict between the two states last year reduced deliveries to the EU states.
The latest quarrel between Kiew and Moscow happens at a time at which the Ukrainian government and the Russian, state gas monopoly Gazprom try to achieve an agreement about it how much the Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in the year 2008.
More must be charged to the Ukraine according to the Gazprom since the group has agreed to pay for natural gas up to 50% in addition from the neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean, that 40% more must pay the Ukraine for the imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during conversations", told the Minister of Trade and Commerce to the Ukraine Anatoli Kinakh of the news agency Reuters.
"The natural gas prices changing should undoubtedly be connected with our arguments regarding the amount of the transit charges [to Western Europe] over the Ukraine."
In the last great natural gas quarrel between Moscow and Kiew in January 2006 cut Gazprom deliveries to the Ukraine.
This led into consequence to Western Europe what drastically pushed the prices in the height to a case of the exports.
Russian gas agrees on a quarter of the supply for the European Union.
Russia has the worldwide biggest gas deposits but much of this remains underdeveloped.
It is the consequence that Gazprom completes its own stocks with gas from Turkmenistan and other central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must check foreign employees"
The Scottish state public health service must improve controls of the criminal records for employees from outside of Europe, a member of the controlling organization said. outside
The recommendation of the main finance inspector Robert Black came after a foreign doctor was brought about to the airport in Scotland in Zusammmenhang with the stop of Glasgow in June.
Doubt also spoke Black, that the Scottish state public health service doesn't have any exact ideas with regard to the number of its ausländischischen employees.
But his report pointed out that other important controls were carried out correctly at a sample of five health authorities.
The main finance inspector examined staff which was recruited outside the countries of the European working area in result of the attack on the airport of Glasgow.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at Royal Alexandra Krankenhaus in Paisley was arrested at the airport after a cross-country vehicle was driven by the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one from three doctors who appeared in the Old Bailey in a video transmission in October and was charged in Great Britain in connection with the presumed car bomb attack.
It is expected the state public health service to carry out controls prior to the employment of foreign employees to ensure that these have the required qualifications, experiences and authorizations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland for the check of criminal records, the agency doesn't dispose this information of the responsibility outside Great Britain too receivedly.
The report of the main inspector means besides other recommendations now that the executive board shall take up guidelines of the criminal records statement which helps employers at controls in different countries.
"Although we have found references to these controls in some staff documents, these weren't carried out routinely." the report stated.
Black said the Scottish health authorities would follow their examination guidelines with high measure before the employment but added: "Our report shows areas in which the system can be improved to ensure that exact information about the number of foreign public health service employees is available."
BMA Scotland chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it is "extremely improbable" that examinations would identify people prior to the employment of potential NHS employees who could make future terrorist attacks.
It is ", that short-term pre-employment tests of the NHS Scotland work well and it isn't clear the recommendations will which added value provide ", said in the report he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they have 1,161 foreign employees at the moment the vast majority of it doctors and nurses.
The finance inspector, however, warned that it is more highly probably the number to identify those employees also therefore who are given leave until uncertain time because the executive boards would have problems.
Furthermore the examination stated that have established control methods been adhered to by NHS authorities predominantly in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian.
Passport, green card, and qualification controls are included.
at present, the Scottish government is checking its policy and guidelines for controls for foreign staff in the NHS before the employment beginning.
The secretary for health Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was a concern to me to execute this work in view of the terrorist attack on Glasgow airport."
The Scottish government in connection with the health authorities which would take into account and ensure recommendations of the report completed you that the publication is -- under this also the ones from foreign countries -- that planned next month himself the best practices would be in updated guidelines regarding the control examinations prior to the employment of all employees re-mirrors.

It has uncovered Saudi Arabia yesterday that 208 has arrested militant because of its membership in cells which had planned a forthcoming attack on a Ölanlage as well as on clergymen and safety strengths.
The state television of the world's biggest mineral oil exporter said that one of the cells would have planned to smuggle in rockets.
Sympathizers of Al-Qaeda have started a campaign against the monarchy which is an ally of the United States in result of the invasion to Iraq since 2003.
A cell of eight militant specified by a foreign citizen planned a stop on a Ölanlage in the eastern province according to the TV report.
Saudi Arabia has one 35,000 protects man one's strong fast Eingreifstruppe Al Quaida stop turned out a failure around Anlagennach formedly toward the world's biggest mineral oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report with reference to an innenministerliche explanation says that 18 was part the arrested of a cell which was conducted by a "rocket expert" who illegally immigrated to the country.
He reports that the militant ones would have planned to smuggle in eight projectiles into the kingdom.
Further 22 intended according to the report to kill clergymen and safety strengths the taken into custody.
The government has warned clergymen more to do these to stop Saudis who strive for Iraq to combine forces with Al-Qaeda militias which want to fight the allied forces and the Shiite Muslim government U.S. supported of the hardliner is considered heretical under the Sunni Saudis.

The climate on Venus could have a view of the future of the earth recognized
Perhaps Venus was once a pleasant place for the life, scientists said yesterday.
Data of one on an orbit of a situated European spaceship show it was when till now conscious that the planet is like a twin of the earth turned away still more.
Venus is the sewing Estonian planetary neighbor of the earth.
The two worlds have approximately the same size and have similar planetary orbits, is a little closer to Venus of the sun, though.
In front of billions of years had there been conditions on Venus, which would have been very similar on these on the earth and would have been able to even be habitable, think today scientists.
But because of the without breaking carbon dioxide greenhouse effect the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rotation speed smashed development course Venus unite completely others.
The planet is robbed by water today and a surface temperature which is heiss enough has to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane violent winds and lightning storms.
The knowledge of the space probe Venus express of the European space agency planned this one, for a year this one has examined, offer a look sobering up at it as the earth could develop in view of the disastrous climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor from the department physics of the University of Oxford, one of the heads the Venus express mission, said: "It gets clear why the climate is so different to that one of the earth on Venus while the planets otherwise are rather similar."
"Our new data make it possible possibly with a habitable environment to design a scenario in which Venus has started ahead of billions of years like the earth."
"Enriched uranium" of the police confiscates
A kilo of a radioactive material, uranium enriched according to reports, was confiscated by the Slovakian and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police speaker said that three persons were arrested and that the material is checked.
He didn't confirm whether it traded but said itself around enriched uranium that it is sold for 1 million dollar (480.000 pounds) had been able to do.
Everything still open
Mitt Romey said it doesn't regard one as candidates for the presidency worthily to be, questioned by a snowman.
The republican candidate nevertheless declared himself the presidency in the end ready to face a debate on YouTube in which normal voters on video take and submit questions to send it to the candidate.
Nones of the questions which were raised on the Wednesday evening, November 28th, were as ridiculous as the snowman which questioned democrats about the global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions and the answers reflected exactly the condition of the republican party this time which bursts in the elections next year.
It isn't known, exact like the producers of CNNs which selected the debate YouTube supported co-to be shown these to the prospective candidates clips.
This one was dedicated to a single topic, Immigration was in the center however in the first half hour of the debate, the longest.
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for republicans.
The CNNs asked a group of undecided voters to use a dial if they heard things which they liked: The television organization noticed tops of the consent as the candidates strictly spoke about the limits.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was in Iowa between Rudy Giuliani, the national forerunner and Romney, the surveys making up their mind in this one, and has shoved New Hampshire forwards.
Giuliani tries to shake the reputation off, it has been soft with regard to illegal Immigration when it was a mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney to have it hired the former governor immigrants who are accused by Massachusetts and illegal in this for work on its house.
The two sat down particularly intensely from each other as questioners wondered whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (which would give illegal a regular status and the possibility on the citizenship).
More insignificant candidates like Duncan Hunter, a Californian convention representative, and Tom Tancredo, a convention representative from Colorado, it turned out well for this nachzuhaken topic.
Neither of the two men has grave chances at the nomination but both remain in the running perhaps because they have hit on the Immigrationspauke earlier and harder than other.
The candidates share the same views at least in the area of the immigration in the great and whole: sharper limits, intolerance opposite illegal Migranten.
This topic helping the republicans together with fears over poisonous toy from China or other worries about the rest of the world to forget or to minimize the differences between liberal and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was were brought up obviously problematically as other topics.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he has supported weapon restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed it whether you should regard as a torture drown feigned.
One of the questioners asked whether the candidates believe the Bible every word.
This was the reason that Giuliani supported the point of view that although the Bible is its preferential book, it perhaps literally doesn't believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, Christian conservatism existing for a long time contrary to all expectations on the first place in a survey in Iowa recently carried out thanks to his now, said that the death penalty is painful but necessary.
You pressed he laughed about it as him Jesus had too intelligently to be advertised around himself around a political office, whether Jesus would approve her, and said.
The running remains extremely wide open.
Huckabees advancement in Iowa falls together with Ron Paul's latest donation successes and its approval storms in the debate of Wednesday.
These two have very shot from the trifle because, till now, the both wings of the party couldn't agree on one of the more well-known and more traditional candidates yet.
In the year 1980 and 2000 a candidate has reconciled the party from the beginning and convincing with a victorious message about the size of America and a blinking to both wings of the party.
The party is split this time and the result by far isn't clear.
Pains of the Labour party
Gordon Brown still has discovered another pit to the Hineinfallen; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals this isn't particularly slippery.
No titles seem sold, paid no politician's Parisians hotel bills, no extramarital toes been sucked to be.
But the uncovering has that this would got by good the without, report, missed that and, a rich businessman covered people donations up for the British ruling Labour party about more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) over four years under the name of others have the party has this is something disputed Gordon Brown.
Offending the intelligence of the brits in a stupid way when the governor had escaped the demand for a choice two months ago by claiming that opinion polls wouldn't have influenced this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
This one liberally expressed democrats, it like Vince Cable, the increasingly astute representation chairman instead, the once dreaded Brown has developed from Stalin into Mr. Bean.
The clumsy rescue of Northern skirt, a shattered bank, showed regulatorische weakness and bad discernment under fire.
Badly thought-out suggestions for the change of the revenue laws have set enterprise associations against the government.
The tax official loss of person-related data of 25 million people showed inconceivable administrative bunglings.
A trio of generals in the retirement started a rebellion in the upper house as a protest against abridgements of armed forces expenditure: They claimed so, it is a part-time job to be a secretary of the forces.
There are the various donations of David Abrahams now; Peter Watt, Labours Secretary General (and its former fulfillment leader) already are stepped down.
Irrevocably direction hands over nothing meant by it to Brown that bursts.
Governments can nevertheless reach a turning point after which they feel it to rule by no means.
Still being allowed to trust people politicians but they usually hold their scepticism back if a new troop seizes the office.
If it is clear once that it is improbable that a prime minister improves the situation and he doesn't need even to be long yet, this delay is past: the public service starts to get leaky; the cabinet secretaries start to talk; the press is looking for bad news; and the government gets defensive and aimless.
In a way the position of Brown is particularly difficult because he cannot claim unlike other political leaders to be a new broom.
So like to deny Tony Blair it would, it was his first lieutenant.
The problems with Northern skirt and the tax responsibility documents for example hangs together with decisions which Brown as a chancellor of the Treasury took.
In Blair's mishap, as in the case of the long "financial for title" examination of a political party financing, the voters possibly assume and even if the notly direct involviert was that it was it.
Browns situation is nevertheless not quite as bad as it looks
The transgressions aren't as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
Mr. is Bean, nobody died or became completely beschwindelt as in the case of.
And the antidote, painful may be like it, are handed in, had what promised Browns of course Stalinist trends always: A reliable, solid and easy brutal government.
The new to-do around political donations is a good example.
He says to the garboeske Abrahams which compares its donations with its charitable gifts no public recognition wishes for his goodwill.
This may be perhaps so but the decision on it wasn't entitled to it.
The laws against anonymity for tall political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know closed whom himself, entrance to the can buy, which rules over the land.
This one says, he would have of Abraham's agreement known about but not that it is illegal watt gets himself natural some questions must arise; exact like Jon Mendlesohn, Labours main finance recoverer whom the strange donations were told about in October.
But, till now, Brown isn't involved: There is nothing that indicates that he knew about these confusions although the largest portion of the payments was made after his assumption of office post in June.
The prime minister has taken care of the half of the work till now.
He has the violation of the laws by his party sentenced in the retirement and a judge fast he diluted this determination to fill measure up around which by reaching for a known instrument, a commission of inquiry to the topic, led, however, of a bishop.
In this case the "teachings to be drawn from it" aren't very complicated.
If the law was broken, it is a thing for the police.
There are except for it other things the Mr Brown must, in the public life, to find a permanent chairman how a little for the independent committee for standards which has been unoccupied for six months and to make progress with a radical reform of a political party financing make.
It would require this of the hardliners of the Labour to cooperate with the conservatives and perhaps to give up the special financial relation with the labor unions, bitter pills for a party member like Mr Brown.
But he should be conscious of some biassed facts.
The conservatives have a clear leadership in the opinion polls now; he has two years to win voters back; and the only way how it can reach a victory is competence by incontestable honesty and solid.
Card sharks
Does the credit crisis infect America's credit card market?
If blood is in the water, it is is only natural that dorsal fins irritated around whirls.
Now where America's property market is ailing, the beasts of prey have the credit card market of the country in the visor.
Analysts of Goldman Sachs expect that the credit card losses could reach 99 billion dollars if the risk of infection of underfunded loans spreads on other forms of consumption loans.
Symptoms of the strain are considerably visible.
There are increases both at the end bookings and at the default rates which measure the share of the loans which respectively aren't retractable or more when 30 days too late.
The HSBC has because of the weak side of credit card recipients partly announced last month that it has taken a 1.4 billion dollars charges elevation from its American consumer financings.
It is nevertheless too early to sink into panic.
Losses and defaults are still low.
A full percentage point below the historical average was almost the third party quarter Säumnissrate of 3.89% according to the Ratingagentur Moody.
The deterioration at the rates can partly be explained by technical factors.
A change in the American led private insolvency on the right laws to an abrupt case of bankruptcy registrations which in turn agree on a large portion of the Keditkartenverluste for one into 2005; registrations (and with that default fines) would this one rise again whether the number the general conditions for borrowers deteriorate or not.
The industry also reports of solid payment rates which show how much the consumers pay every month off of their debts
and the confidence in credit card based securities is rather strong despite the interruption in other corners of the structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of the control tower Group, a research enterprise, expects that the amounts of version for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year in the end.
There surely are direct infection channels between the property credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more probable that consumers raise credit card debts, now that own home loans dry out.
The card exhibitors look but therefore dropping house prices don't redeem a bill of exchange necessarily in the credit rating of the borrower on the money river instead of on capital values.
You even can be for the card exhibitors of advantage.
The incentives for consumers furthermore to pay the mortgage rates diminish if the real estate is worth some as the value of the loan; as a result the card debts get more important under the repayment priorities.
Card exhibitors also can much faster and more flexibly react as a lender to the stormier conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a fast reassessment of the assets.
"We won't wake up one day and the loans completely newly judge", says Gary Perlin, Capital Ones main finance speaker.
Even if a sudden cover shortage crisis is improbable in the credit card market, the risks of a lasting downturn are substantially more real.
If lower house prices and a credit reduction press America in the recession, the industry will stand undoubtedly before a more furious future.
They hold the far lookout for these shark fins.
British Bänker declare themselves guilty in the case Enron
Three British bankers who should be confronted for their role in the deceitful system with the former main finance leader of Enron, Andrew Fastow, with court changed their petitions into guilty on Wednesday.
Originally David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had pleaded open innocently in the year 2000 to make at the expense of its employer money for the alleged Konspirieren in seven cases of deceit below use of tele-means of communication with Fastow in a secret finance deceit.
The method had been set for January.
But during a hearing in front of court in front of U.S. district judge Ewing Werlein junior everybody pleaded for a case of deceit guiltily below use of tele-means of communication.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unity of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc, were confessed in Great Britain within delivery methods which lasted for two years.
Their case is a loose end of an examination which was started to Enrons collapse in 2001 in the United States.
The accusations submitted against it originally in the year 2002 drew Fastow attention to the fact that it was the aim of an examination of the government in connection with the Enron decline.
Conspiracy cooks up a former top adviser Michael Kopper the charges against the bankers around a deceitful one with Fastow and his -- been called the "NatWest three", they are come in the year 2000 to Houston, claimed.
Greenwich Natwest had invested to a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron which was checked by Fastow which was the architect of innumerable deceitful Enron wheelings and dealings which have contributed to tear the company in the bankruptcy whirlpool.
The bank had the value at the beginning of 2002 its participation in the subsidiary on zero appreciated but the three British men knew that it had in reality considerable value.
An enterprise under Koppers control purchased the shares of the bank in the subsidiary for 1 million dollar.
The bankers paid Kopper 250,000 dollars for a participation in this enterprise.
According to the charges Fastow represented wrongly, that opposite Enron the energy enterprise would pay 20 million dollars to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
The 20 million dollars but actually went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
Did 7.3 million dollars get the bankers during Fastow, Kopper, and cashed in other about 12.3 million dollars according to the charges.
Fastow declared itself for its role in two counts of an indictment on conspiracy in the Enrons flop guiltily in January 2004.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow serves a 6-year prison sentence in federal prison of Louisiana.
Kopper serves a sentence of three years and a month in facilities in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was on free foot due to a 1 million dollar bail which required it that they lived in expectation of the legal proceedings in the United States.
Enron, once the siebtgrößte enterprise of the nation crumbled in the bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of book-keeping tricks could cover the billion debts up or make weak businesses seem profitable no more.
The collapse destroyed thousands from jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars Pensionspläne.
The Enron founder Kenneth Lay and the former chairman of the executive board Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse.
Skilling serves a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's condemnations for conspiracy, deceit and other counts of an indictment got trivial after it died because of heart disease last year.
In Moscow not quite below
The price of an airplane of the brand Gulfstream G550 equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough reach to fly from Moscow to Los Angeles non-stop is at least 54 million dollars.
But this is small change for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers place for up to 18 passengers", said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you asks for so many seats because it is for a private family or an enterprise president."
Last Friday, Firer was at the Gulfstreamstand at the millionaire exhibition, a four day orgy of consumption exhibited which was organized in a nested exhibition center at the outskirts of the capital.
More than 200 other luxury suppliers had built up exhibition stands in addition to Gulfstream, hoping for it, of mahogany paneled yachts up to diamond covered car crickets which would be adequate to 50 cents to interest Russians come to money newly at everything.
Firer took carefully a shiny orangenen Porsche at the next booth into the visor.
"This is a beautiful car but it is small change in the comparison with us", he said.
"Russia is the second largest market for private airplanes to the United States."
Lit by a Ölboom the Russian capital seems so flooded with money like Dallas to its heydays.
We have gone into the 1890s ", as if American reconciles a too gigantic wealth came and in crowds to Europe went where they were considered materialistic ", Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis center for Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard University, said.
The Russians as these emerge visible bounteous money out giver out like the Saudi-Arabian high-flyers of 1970s and the Japanese into the 1990s in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands seek their share in the gold fever.
A meeting has elsewhere put the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, on in Moscow this week to exchange ideas about this as one can sell high-priced goods on markets like Russia.
(The meeting is organized by The International Herald Tribune which belongs to the New York Times company.)
Russia has 53 multi-millionaires who have altogether 282 billion dollars according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
Furthermore 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class which 670 billion dollars are worth together, you wrote according to a study of the development of private fortunes here in the former Soviet Union, the one of economy experts of the center for economy and finance researches, an expert committee.
(The World Bank says that 15.8 per cent of the Russians lived below the subsistence level in the year 2005.)
There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow " -- all of us therefore are here ", Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, said to a London jeweller.
You had for the first time together with the Russian dealer of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group which goes to fair.
"All the women are cared exemplarily and all the men are worth a fortune."
While they are drawing Sunday night in evening clothes by the halls, two realtors, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, describe themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I have looked after the cars and I try to make up my mind between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche", Mrs Yumatova who handed in the designer clothes which carried her told Rivers like a red carpet veteran with Joan.
The fair seemed on the nouveau riches Gund in and besides each other primarily to aim, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be ready to be several hours in the jam to go to a drafty store, the geschmachloserweise Cadillac Escalades, pocket-knife made of platinum, Mövenpick ice cream, custom-made Billiardtische, Appartments teddy bears Dubai provided.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand the expensive and good is", said Mr Gijrath who patriotically sat at a booth of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft from hand-painted, blue tesserae in front of a wall great Imitat of a Rembrandt picture.
"Of course Russians are more on tinkle tinkle interestedly."
With restricted quantities which wouldn't commercialize themselves at a trade show brands have moved indeed say the dealers here that the Russians with old money himself (is old according to Russian standards) for 10 to 15 years already of flashy logos to the way of rational.
Several thousand people nevertheless pressed, whether millionaires, tourists sent by millionaires or simple every day by the halls.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday novel Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds said here it would have two 70,000 dollars mattress sets of silk, cashmere and cotton, manufactured, sold with one sewn gold threads.
Also told Mikhail Lyubiumov, one sales manager motorcycle for A1 in the first night, the high-end cars equips with high-end alarm systems for a company that his company the shrill orangenen has sold Porsche to a Russian millionaire for 170,000 dollars.
Until Sunday afternoon Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, told to an enterprise which adapts luxury cars on customer requests it would have three car radiator grilles for a Rolls-Royce phantom, the chain armlets connected with each other are, sold for 55,000 dollars each.
He showed a reporter a car tire, which was developed for a Russian casino owner it had this one covered with colored Swarovski crystals with spokes so that it looked like a roulette wheel.
The costs: 22,000 dollars for a four substitute.
"The Russian millionaire who would like to have ostrich leather wheels or a picture of the face of his wife from a cubic zirconium won't certainly drive on these wheels", said Mr Karapetian.
"He will keep it in his 30 or 40 cars' garage."
Even if many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr Karapetian said in view of the increase in the local real estate prices, at the moment, exclusiveness wouldn't express the phrase "Russiche millionaires" much.
If you have bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are presumably already millionaire at least on the paper " if already not in cash ", he said.
"There is more of these think as you."
Which wasn't, millionaires those could pretend at least to be rich at a stand which was operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian portfolio management enterprise.
The enterprise had built four red telephone booths after British example which were crammed full with mountains of false million dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the Vermarktungdirektor of the enterprise, said its employees would have printed 500,000 wrong bills for the millionaire fair.
Passers-by stopped to throw the money heaps around, while they are leaning back in the midst of the substitute wealth have mobile telephone photos by friends taken or simply plug in around a couple of million.
"You see, each like a millionaire can feel in Moscow", said Mr Karryev.
A messed up operation suspects Jersey at death in New
It was the day considered a Ronald Livingston through the big glass window of the precisely are Little Healthier restaurant here and noticed cape Cod two doors in the white one like an ambulance below at before the harvest festival the west Scott stopped Avenue.
There was a police car on this soon.
And then a further one was there.

"She said 'you must pay attention to this or that one'", he said.
"She always was here, as me, always arrived here and was she here when I went.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes will this lead to the increase in the world stock markets the central bank lower the interest
The shares jumped on the two sides of the Atlantic yesterday after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm the credit markets by further cuts in interest rates were confirmed by appeasing comments of the vice-chairman of the U.S. central bank.
The stock markets climbed in London, New York and in all of Europe after small boat, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the central bank, said Donald that the politics must react to the continuous pressure "flexibly and pragmatically" on the finance markets.
Of sign of credit tensions striving for progress, Kohn said, the latest turbulences would have "partly turned over some of the improvements in the market functions of the late part of the September and October" to calm morose markets in a clear effort, in view of.
If the increased turbulence should last, would it increase the possibility of another increase of the financial conditions for consumers and enterprises, he said.
The comments were taken up by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to intervene and to stabilize the terms of credit with new injections of capital to the U.S. markets and possible further cuts in interest rates.
The explanations also helped to calm Wall Street, in view of of further bad news from the U.S. economy, the sales of U.S. real estate achieved a new record low now in October there.
The results of the financial turbulences became that of the announcement of Bear Stearns, the investment bank, it will remove 650 jobs or 4 per cent of its worldwide employees in a measure for the cost reduction to make good serious losses from its lost bets in the US-Hypothekenkreditesektor, underlined.
It is expected only 20 of these places in London to want to disappear where the bank employs 1,500 employees.
In New York the Dow Jones industry index jumped by 331 points or 2.55 per cent to close at 13,289.40 the broad s laid out & P 500 index increased by 2.65 per cent, lasting.

England confronts with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemma, each of this almost just as difficult as this other.
Who shall beat as a number 6 for England in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara, at this weekend?
Not less relevant and, in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka who shall take the decision?
The second question is important in part-time because it is here David Graveney, the choice chairman, on call at least under this special title to decide to help Michael Vaughan around the boss coach Peter Moores and the captain and because the table of High Morries, the English managing director, fills with applications gradually for national voter offices even for which ones if not.
Who doesn't get the sixth thug position always either will be sad but the life is often unjust and it is the sports undoubtedly.
It is never simple branch of profession to nail exactly the top makes a man possible for his to reach while what somebody never gets beyond the lowest rank differently, sometimes from lack of luck instead of ability.
It isn't only in the cricket where the choice is difficult, where verdicts which are always subjective at the end are necessary.
Is it the right time for Bopara to climb?
Is if he does it it fair to Shah?
Executives the same can be asked perhaps also in another one area whether for example John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent has young with good degrees which know the business well, should be transported.
Who can say what is the right class for a cricket player unless the possibility is given to him swimming or going down?
Numbers have of course a great influence on decisions but chances also have this.
Within a team a cricket player must catch the eye of the captain in the right time if he can take a Wicket and a thug must get regular chances on the order if he wants to make impression as a one-day cricket player.
It is more complicated to catch the eyes of the end voters.
There was much this one will play in the last season better in the first test apparently when, for example when James Anderson were even if Stephen Harmison pronounces himself healthy and as the wind plays ninepins into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class Wickets with 33 rushes each to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average but both had their highlights and hope for still more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays in the Asgiriya stage can be only a view question.
The choice could decide the careers of both men or it perhaps really makes little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka and this one played Gareth Batty in every test and was successfully rushes in the first, with five Wickets and useful to 40, it was, however, Paul Collingwood to consolidate, which passed the breakthrough to an important test cricket player although it perhaps still is, a double one one hundred against Australia in Australia punk head of a column underestimated, at that time, still fighting for himself.
Probable is that youthful enthusiasm will their conservative instincts and belly sense of Shah's greater experience follow, Vaughan and Moores, Graveney, after another discussion in the course of today's net meeting in the Asgiriya stage about Boparas.
There are arguments for both.
His scintillating and valuable 88 test debut Innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, which is seven years younger with 22 years and an excellent balance speak against switched on roll for Shah.
But Shah made May to only ten rushes into his two Innings in this against the west Indies in the test into Lord, his native country arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection, from the end voters as Vaughan was well the swing take back around for the next, his position seems from his beat taken, still in Bombay obvious have this one game was.
Unlike this the all-rounder has in shovelfuls zest for life from Essex.
Recently one vehicle with four-wheel drive in an exhibition it is impressed by nothing on a cricket place and its attitude away from this was taken to the point, as it England's sponsor Volkswagen had estimated.
It suffered from smaller injuries and presumably a shock but it was the first which it did to get its Vodafone (of course also gesponsort) out and to call Alastair Cook which had watched this from the distance and to say with enthusiasm for its team colleagues: "Have you seen this?".
Bopara is a much better player on the field, it its middle speed plays ninepins with some effect here on the fields which seems to match it and beats with confidence and dexterity.
A different one is to choose a thing, the right time to vote for the right man.
Perhaps this is the real art of the choice.
I tend to give Bopara its chance now, what doesn't mean that perhaps dastehen isn't for Shah anyway well if it is the one as suggests the tea sentence from Ceylon who will play this weekend here.
Getting busses to fight refugees back for work and around Al-Quaida
The first bus cargo loads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, have run out with a current from exiles, the funds or VISA and other which hoped that the town returns to normality.
Some even had come back to fight the rebels who had expelled them from their houses.
Was busily the terminal with refugees from Syria and Jordan which had returned in private transports at the bus station Mansour, still before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen busses.
"I decided to go after they had killed many doctors in Baghdad to Syria", said Sabah Al Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"Today, I came back because of this which I have seen on television and which I have read in the newspaper, would be sure over now what has happened in Baghdad and like it."
You say that the Mahdi army has killing people stopped " this one has ordered with respect to the Shiite militias of the militant cleric Moqtada Al Sadr, he said, to put back his strengths for the present time.
Qassim Al Atwani swept his two children a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominant one back, because he couldn't replace his Syrian visa Sunni part of Amariyah and because the regime not permissible Iraqi work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a militia which is local and supported by the USA has to expel Al-Qaeda from their bastion in the west of the capital contributed he and insisted for the return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe which had been expelled from his house by an attack in Sleikh in the north of Baghdad with hand grenades after it had asked its fellow citizens for the fighting Al-Qaeda.
He was come back to fight.
"Two days ago some of my friends called me they and one said to me, that in Sleikh started with the anti Al-Qaeda militia and that they need my support and those of my boys.
This is why I have returned today ", Sabaah aluminium said to Obeidi, 62.
Many said that they had been lured by the increasing quiet in the capital since the U.S. troop rise and the growth of local "citizens concerned for groups" which one arms and in cooperation with the American armed forces their districts defend.
But more spoke, home by Visumsprobleme and drying up to have where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in the last few years funds been forced in Damascus.
Salaam Al Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-times repeated father, expressed the general suspicion under the exiles that Nouri Al Maliki, the Shiite governor, had requested of the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions for the refugees to force people to the return.
More than two and a half millions people have fled presumably of the sectarian death squadrons in the country.
Us turned out all right " to Al-Maliki Syria went to it well and the government pressed to give the Iraqis no more VISA to force it to the return to Iraq ", this one said Sunni pensioner.
"I cannot this one my house trust a government which supports the criminals burned down, after I went away."
It is a part of the reason for the fall in the force that Sunnites were expelled from Shiite residential areas and reversed which led to the creation of many places where tensions have eased.
It admits fears that a sudden inflow of refugees will stir sectarian tensions up again and it will come to conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is leading at the vocational training and shines even with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in an education field the same pushes the inhabitants of Saar deficit like the rest of the country.
"I have explained for the 50th time to a not inhabitant of Saar yesterday that we aren't Frenchmen" -- the smallest federal state placards this slogan self ironically for its 50th birthday.
In this France and Luxembourg play a large role in the educational system of the Saarland which lies on place five in the education monitor of the institute of the German economy Cologne (IW).
So the universities already cooperate narrowly with the neighboring countries from tradition.
The university in Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 of the Frenchmen.
To this day can studying here with a double or even triple diploma complete her studies.
The share is correspondingly high foreign studying with 15.6 per cent.
But the Saarland also brings the natives of a country in number above average to the universities, much of them without a degree at the high school.
"One uses the professional educational system in the Saarland", says Axel Plünnecke, education expert at the IW.
More than every fifth teenager purchases his studies right at a vocational school so that the Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combination possibilities of a professional and academic education are also comparatively expanded strongly.
Measured in terms of the total population the equipment is the second best one in Germany with dual courses of studies.
Despite the practical education and increasing demand the number of the engineer graduates has dropped by a third, however, within the last years.
The Saarland education department has committed the universities to doing a marketing campaign for engineer scientific subjects therefore now.
"We have initiated quite a number of reforms after the first Pisa study" at the schools with general educational value, says a spokeswoman of the education department.
So the government introduced nationwide comparison tests.
It is free of charge to learn to use to begin the children the last Kita year, a model which meanwhile also other federal states copy.
The performances of the pupils improve lastingly, will show themselves only future comparison studies whether.
The share of the Risikoschüler shrank from 29 to 20 per cent at Pisa 2003.
Altogether, the Saarland, however, didn't increase as strongly as other federal states.
The Bavarians calculate better.
Points -- and to the frustration of the inhabitants of Saar Fremdsprachenkenntnise aren't measured at Pisa otherwise one could in this area.
Because the language of the neighbors is duty to high schools -- even if the inhabitants of Saar aren't Frenchmen.
Chávez switches the watches over
In Venezuela, the watches tick soon differently than in the rest of the world.
President Hugo Chávez has the timekeepers reversed in the South American country by half an hour on December 9th.
Chávez becomes in the meantime a joke figure in Spain.
As the Official Bulletin of Venezuela informed, the watches are adjusted to the universal time minus four and a half hours according to a new law.
The südamerikansiche state gets a time zone with that which there is not in any other country of the world.
Among other things the USA hostile Chávez justified his decision, that with that the United States of the world would have imposed the division into time zones at full hours.
Moreover, Chávez terminated Colombia the breaking off of the relations to the neighboring country announced because of a hostage affair on Wednesday (local time).
The on the left nationalist said as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe president of Colombia stays would he maintain relationships neither to the leader nor to the Colombian government.
"I cannot do this already alone because of my dignity", said Chávez which advances a constitutional reform the citizens of the Öllandes must vote in a referendum on on Sunday.
With the reform he would improve his power considerably in the country.
Trigger of the quarrel was the decision Uribes to withdraw the mandate from Chávez in Colombia for negotiations with Marxist rebels during which it was about the release of hostages.
Uribe "has spat Venezuela with his decision into the face", Chávez had criticized on Sunday.
Chávez is the talk of the town also in Spain.
A new mobile telephone bell tone provides furore in the country: You don't think your mouth "Por qué no te callas" the sentence which people have already downloaded from the Internet more than half a million reads (why).
Spain's King Juan Carlos has it spoken, which was irritated by the permanent interruptions of the on the left populist at the latest Iberoamerika peak and this had driven over the mouth.
Pay minus threatens Germans in 2007
Despite the strong economic situation a real wages loss threatens German employees according to a forecast this year.
Experts mentioned a whole bundle of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation of the Hans Böckler foundation the employees could expect some on the checking account 2007 really than in the previous year.
"The modest development of the pay, the added value tax increase and the price pushes are to blame at food and energy", Gustav Horn of the institute for macro-economics and economic research told the "picture" newspaper.
New loads could come toward employees also at the social insurance.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück told this one "new Osnabrück newspaper", although the planned lowering of the social insurance on 3.3 per cent for the turn of the year is right and sensible in the present situation.
The federal agency mustn't for work come into embarrassment to have to ask for loans or subsidies at the federation again, though, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday it had acquaintance become that the price explosion drove the rate of inflation at food and mineral oil products on the highest stand for 13 years.
Altogether, the prices increased by 3.0 per cent year on year.
Venus is the infernal Gemini of the earth
Venus is more similar than thought till now despite her anti-life atmosphere of the earth: The European space probe "Venus express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind whirl to the Pole as it appears also on the earth in winter.
For almost three decades scientists have suspected that there is lightning on Venus.
The European probe "Venus express" has furnished the proof now, it tracked down electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: The lightning on Venus shoots to cloud in a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud, Christopher Russel of the University of California reports in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
Having let lightning according to the famous "Ursuppen theory" arise the life on the earth: Thunderstorms shall have activated reactions in the ocean which led to the formation of amino acids, the constituents of the life.
On Venus not so: Sean Solomon of the Carnegie institution in Washington "must, if there ever were lives there, have been it in the very early history", explains.
Might give Venus hardly something live on the surface today: The atmosphere is around one hundred times thick than on the earth, there are temperatures of 500 degrees from time to time.
"Perhaps Venus is the devil Gemini of the earth but she is a Gemini", said Russel.
Why Venus who is so similar to the earth in mass and size has smashed a so completely other development is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The start of "Venus express" in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus research since since the beginning of the nineties no more probe was away specifically for the investigation of this planet.
The latest research results which are introduced now in several "Nature" articles underline not only the uniqueness of Venus in opinion of the researchers within the solar system.
"You also show that, with the earth, the things in common of our neighbor planet are greater than at first assumed", informs the Esa.
So found cloud whirlpools also unite the researchers besides the already known whirlwind at the North Pole at the South Pole which turns still considerably faster.
A researcher team writes around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica the phenomenon reminds of streams of air on the earthly winter hemisphere.
The second innermost planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is almost just as big with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet also described as a morning or evening star revolves around the sun within almost 225 days.
However, he concerns much more slowly himself: A Venustag lasts for 243 earth days.
Although Venus hardly reminds of the earth with surface temperatures of 460 degrees centigrade and a pressure of 92 bar, scientists assume that both planets have arisen under quite similar prerequisites.
Water which remained in oceans on the earth on which Venus was, however, lost to the space accumulated on both.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed in carbonate rocks on the earth, it agrees on Venus on the large part of the atmosphere.
Charcoal burner defends Merkel's meetings with the Dalai llama
Federal President Köhler demands an end of the party quarrel about the reception of the Dalai llama in the chancellery.
He indirectly criticized SPD because of its attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.

Schäuble warns of riots like in France
Street battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of riots like in France.
It everything must be done so that social discontent doesn't unload itself in control in Germany in the street the Federal Minister of the Interior demanded.
Barricades burned, roughnecks shot at the police with shotguns: After the serious youth riots in France Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is afraid of a similar development in Germany.
"We must take care that itself with us either a social explosive doesn't build up and unload in control.
We must take this seriously ", he said to the "new press" seeming in Hanover.
Not every young person copes with the fast change of the social reality.
Federation, countries and communes already worked with stress to dismantle problems, Schäuble said.
This concerns not only the integration of Migranten.
"From the integration peak until the Islam conference this already shows first successes."
For all clear it is, however, too early.
Schäuble pointed out at the same time that there aren't urban development and sociological problems like in France in German suburbs.
Teenagers had delivered heavy street battles to themselves with the police in northern suburbs of Paris within the last nights.
Cars and public buildings burned also in Toulouse.
The chairman of the Turkish municipality demanded greater integration efforts of the Federal Government in Germany, Kenan Kolat, meanwhile.
In view of the riots in France Kolat warned of "imitation stock exchange securities".
Although the situation in Germany isn't as explosive as in France.
However, there is nevertheless need for action.
Kolat referred that the rate of unemployment is "outstandingly high" with teenagers with migration background less than 25 years.
More training vacancies must be provided primarily.
Kolat emphasized: "We must give the teenagers a perspective."
The chairman of the Turkish municipality social control in the families, however, added, in Germany, finds more than in France " ".
Moreover, many young people with migration background didn't want to destroy what their parents here have built up.
Kolat reminded: "We must but nevertheless pay attention."
One must "give" the teenagers the possibility fast of participating in work and education.
Villiers-Le Bel had it left largely quietly in the Parisian suburb in the night in the meantime.
Centuries of the police were in use, a helicopter overflew the area with headlights.
The responsible authorities notified three of arrests as well as a couple of burning garbage can and cars.
A contingent of about 1000 safety strengths has tried to establish peace since the day before.
Secretary of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit in the suburb the police will take vigorous action as long as it is necessary.
In the night to Tuesday about 80 policemen had been injured at riots in Villiers-Le Bel.
In the subsequent night the disturbances spread to Toulouse.
The riots ignited at a road accident at which two teenagers had been killed on Sunday.
After first findings of the prosecuting attorney's office the police don't bear any blame for the death of the teenagers.
In the empire of Angela Wolke
The unrealistic appearance of the chancellor documented, that the coalition is as regards content at the end and that nothing more has to be expected by it itself.
In which country does this Federal Chancellor live actually?
After her hopeless appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag which was wurschtig and meaningless one must say: not here -- not in the country which must finally be ruled over by it.
Angela Merkel has rejected the reproach that she concentrates on the foreign policy too much with a terribly arrogant sentence.
This is provincial, she said and showed with that first that she doesn't want to understand about what it is for the critics.
She has become evident in the Bundestag recognizably for everyone as the reproach is very correct.
Concrete interest still even to feel a feeling was in the country for the problems there.
Angela Wolke presented itself instead: a lifted politician who flees in the foreign policy and stays there in the approximate one herself.
Example climate protection: She praises herself without breaking for the decisions of saint dam, however, doesn't say how the climate goals shall be accomplished in this country there.
The self praise still would so much have the CDU boss denied herself to Unbescheidenheit two years ago at all.
She clings to the set phrase, that now the upswing arrives with the people.
It damages its image as a pragmatist instead of the world schönzureden with that who solves problems.
But domestic problems are a side issue in the empire of Angela Wolke.
Child poverty and the worries of the low wage-earners?
She has a couple of subordinate clauses for it.
Is characteristic how often she makes a mistake as it around the child surcharge goes.
Merkel needs three attempts there to bring out a partly even sentence.
She stumbles like on a strange land if it gets concrete.
Department attack
A hard exchange of blows -- and must be afraid of an outsider candidate now in the Youtube debate of the republican candidates for the presidency deliver the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney to themselves.
The strain of the candidates already unloads itself for the first topic.
It has made New York a "refuge for illegal immigrants", Mitt Romney reproaches its opponents for Rudy Giuliani.
This counters for his part with difficult reproaches: This "I would say its own house was a port for illegal", Giuliani replies and throws former governor of Massachusetts in front of, to have privately employed immigrants without papers.
The candidates blow for the attack: Because furthermore the republican base doesn't have any clear favorite, the eight presidency candidates use the debate on CNNs primarily to discredit their adversaries.
30 second videos, the Internet users this one have roll-ups sent in via Youtube, are hardly more than keyword giver.
John McCain reproaches his opponent Ron Paul who demands an immediate discount as the only one in the round from Iraq "we have let Hitler come to the power" with this kind of isolationism.
Also Romney gets strongly the read of the Vietnam veteran, as it an interrogation method refuses, the so-called "Waterboarding", drown which you feign but to condemn torture.
The reactions of the hall audience show Petersburg in piece in Floridas that the important topics of the campaign lie, however, on the other side of Iraq war and torture debates meanwhile.
When conservative values are always praised and future tax increases declined approval surges in the lecture-hall.
More lets himself be seen once where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I have been mistaken at that time", it Romney explains remorsefully and makes in front of base and viewers its apology for this that was still proper in 1994 to the abortion supporters.
Giuliani, however, starts lurching from side to side, you ask for its opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible as it.

The fathers of the cabbage skirt return
Germany's super group of the seventies plays instruments again: The three ribbon members of Harmonia got to work on their consoles at a concert in Berlin once more.
For the revival one seems recorded from her great time "live 1974".
Even then they were fundamentally more famous abroad.
The arranged sensation then happens at the evening panel in the form of three of sedate sirs.
Everybody has his small box in front of himself, his cables and primarily his buttons.
Dieter Moebius sits enthroned in the flower white shirt in the middle with 63 years.
Links flanked of Michael Rother 57 years young and in the possession of laptop computer and guitar.
Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, bends himself concentratedly at the console, looked from the lecture-hall on the right.
From time to time, everybody even contributes noises beat, unite.
And sometimes it makes inadvertently a conventional piece of music.
This then doesn't seem to disturb the sirs greatly either itself.
That the band Harmonia plays instruments again has under cabbage skirt enthusiasts for some excitement worried.
In which one may reveal here: However, specific demands showed so lastingly not at all that although the name buzzed by the collective pop memory to miss this band for 32 years painfully.
But why shall not the German be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the seventies either?
Particularly since what is misleadingly called cabbage skirt was always than in the country of one's own more valid in England and America.
Group of Can 2003 awarded the echo prize for the life's work to the survivors of the inhabitants of Cologne, one saw in the hall into questioning German pop faces as the music economy.
Himself talk Hot chilli pepper of Pepper as this one in the eulogy also with the bands La Düsseldorf and new! the astonishment didn't know any limits thanked you.
At concerts Michael Rother squated at the talk Hot chilli pepper of Pepper on the stage like an old buddy later.
Transfiguration is the one the problem of the ignorance in the foreign parts at home and this one.
The memory is already therefore overtaxed with Harmonia because the trio existed for only two years and a far lower effect power than they were assigned to afterwards of other also developed at this time.
Moebius and Roedelius had played instruments already before under the promising name cluster with the artist Conrad Schnitzler.
At first one played in the cellar under the Berlin theater.
After this in Düsseldorf for economic reasons for a record label maintained of the church.
Rother had the at that time perhaps most radical German group, a reputation erspielt, helped out and following as a guitarist at new!, at power station briefly.
Rother followed the cluster musicians at 1973 into the exile to forest in the Weser hilly scenery, though.
They lived as town brief communards there in the old Weser court, a ruin from the 16th century.
Less ideological than in the commune I, where Roedelius still was allowed to be troubled as a nanny.
Rather in spitzweghaftem artist existence.
Allegedly a pennant of the singing club also found itself Harmonia Ottenstein in the bulky refuse and for the art a name.
Some held Harmonia of this tight.
The first album was called "music of Harmonia" and the following "de luxe".
Because the music so calmly and modestly also sounded, the band suffered a material need.
The Reisigsammeln didn't serve alone the self finding.
In front of an only just 50-headed record scenery, the CD "live 1974" appeared now was recorded for somebody thinks at a concert in Griessem like itself to remember.
The desire to push Harmonia and to practice occasionally came from Rother at that time.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band explained its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the esoteric spherical one and secured its existence for itself with albs like "fiery hearts".
Cluster was revived in the eighties and is more successful than it was ever Harmonia since then.
The Griessemer live album is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
It has aimed at the record firm Greenland, the cabbage skirt as a very own German contribution to cultivate music to the live one.
New! did you already dig up like Roedelius solo plant?
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin house of the cultures of the world.
Subsidized publicly in the context of the festival Woldtronics.
Julian Cope is there, the brit, old punk and author of the manual "cabbage skirt sampler".
The Loveparade inventor is also Dr. Motte there.
With what the complete frequency range of the influences of the cabbage skirt on the following pop music would be outlined.
The blank of the super group is filled out by Harmonia.
The sentence of Brian Eno floats with the most peculiar Sounds in the hall: "Music only keeps, these the future belongs to her."
There are pictures which show the producer with Harmonia in the farmhouse parlor.
Projections of additional black-and-white photos of confusedly cabled equipment serve the putting formation.
In front of that the three veterans are occupied with the improvisation again.
Not eliciting outrageous tones from instruments around which over effect equipment built any more by sticking microphones to the organ and to the drums.
The electronic music looks like electronic music today.
Tinkerer deepened three into the technical one.
To this the choir of the house also changes nothing.
The line Barbara Morgensterns is coughed and whispered under Soundwolken and sung in a beautiful place with emphasis under.
Cabbage skirt was always a very English concept.
It never was skirt.
The roots were looked for less than in colleges of music (Can), technologies (power station) or on the flight with artistic and social conventions (clusters) in the blues.
Who here 68 calls, not quite is wrong and Harmonia cannot be brought by it now either from the quiet.
The most natural is reconsidered thoroughly on the stage.
Where does music begin and when does she stop?
This can rob one of the nerves or grant brief moments of great happiness.
Simply isn't Richard Gere cynically enough
"The Hunting party" and "dreadful peace" deal with two films with the Balkankrieg again.
But both don't convince.
The concepts put too much on action and Geballer or else they are too touching either.
Richard Gere cannot help in "The Hunting party" there either.
The good news first: The war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still hide in the mountains of the Balkans but the actors' Richard Gere has been found again now there in the gloomy hinterland of the Bosnia war of all things.
We had lost the most beautiful man of the eighties from the eyes last because too many nice inconsequential roles cured one of the inclination for looking in well feeling films for women and too many press conferences to the Buddhism topic.
Richard is suddenly javelins the most important argument, himself, The Hunting party " -- if the hunter becomes the chased " now why look?) perhaps anyway, today, film titles must always be so long and confused actually like train driver wage agreements.
He delivers a wonderfully winking representation: His war reporter Simon Hunt is, taken in the reason this what would have been able to be from javelin if destiny and the film industry were not so merciful: Decline has still a man his who has his very best times behind himself for a long time kept considerable remains of the former charm this one but himself as a monument identical in ruin.
But despite this trump "The Hunting party" together with the German production, "dreadful peace", which also starts this week continues only the endless row of failed Balkankriegs films.
"Dreadful peace" can with one put on a short trial: The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serbian from kosovarischen snipers, on whom the one promptly also falls in love with them.
Although it is welcome that, once, the Serbians aren't represented as an only root of all evil here, the television flat film loses itself fast too in Geballer and action.
However, it remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without freeway for this with war.
On the other hand, can be investigated virtually exemplarily to "The Hunting party" why there has never been a really good Balkan war movie actually.
Perhaps a new "Apocalypse Now" could have become the story of three U.S. war reporters who set out to "the fox" track down the Serbian top war criminal with another director and a different one scriptwriter (both into personal union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the Storys are alike frappierend: Small teams don't go what the armed forces both times to the woods it becomes a journey into the insanity be able to to accomplish something and both times.
One is one of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting party" that Simon Hunt doesn't simply let the shabby cynic as whom he is introduced to us at the beginning be with heart.
A romantic affair with a Muslim Bosnian andichten murdered later must still no the script for it on top of everything.
Definitely, "The Hunting party" goes the creek down then if the reporters succeed in the time-lapse photography method within the last five minutes which Nato, CIA and all headhunters of the world haven't made within five years: Catching the war criminal and leaving to the Muslim Bosnians for the just revenge.
This is so bad that one would like to call the international court of justice in The Hague against the cinema logic because of crimes.
The film has a deeply human request.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic still run around freely and he doesn't suspect the Americans and the Frenchmen (here shall they agree for once) to do the following due to secret political arrangements too intensively.
But are so similarly the thought well and the bad one sometimes that a famous Brecht poem comes one into the meaning.
It is called in it over the wood mask of an Asian demon on the work-table of the poet: "I sympathetically see the swollen veins in the temple, indicating: how exhausting it is to be bad ".
Films like "The Hunting party" have exactly such swelling heads which, however, indicate how exhausting, well to be, it is.
The problem isn't limited on the genre of the Balkankriegsfilms.
Recently is in this newspaper reports got, that all Iraq films of Hollywood were large flops.
One can add: There has never been a good South Africa film, too.
Be almost always valid: If a starling knocks around on the flash points or minefields of the world, then something like that comes out like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "hereafter of all limits", with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
All the conflicts are possibly from the point of view of time simply still too near.
After all, decades had to pass before Hollywood with "Schindler's list" could shoot a good film about the holocaust.
Many a film still will well mature, the Vietnam plants "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" being regarded as a classic now or "Full Metal jacket" has unanimously at that time yes not at all been celebrated as masterpieces.
But perhaps we know, where on the same two screens today every mass murder in real time amounts at home, also simple too much about the conflicts of the world.
And this robs the film script authors of the Bedenkenlosigkeit which needs to tell good stories.
Yes, his or nonexistence has therefore got so good, after all, because Lubitsch and Chaplin didn't know yet how badly there was really the Nazi regime " " or "the great dictator", too.
Perhaps one mustn't want to be good if one wants to make good films.
Perhaps one must have the sarcastically distant artist look of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When this one was questioned to parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières dictionary" and the Balkankrieg, he answered: "This only lies that some things never change.
Cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way and war always will be in Yugoslavia."
Of Beust reaps criticism for Olympia refusal
Moving the mayor of the application of Hamburg for Olympic summer Games away has met with intense criticism in politics and economy.
Many want to fight for the games further at the water.
But of Beust realism sends a reminder to the assessment of the chances.
The general executive manager of the Board of Trade Hamburg, Hans Jörg Schmidt Trenz, didn't describe a renunciation as " good for the industrial location " on Wednesday.
No other project has developed such big motivation strengths in the town as the Olympiaidee quite recently.
"Without this aim the sports political swing wouldn't be in the position to be maintained in the same measure."
Schmidt-Trenz asked the senate not to bury the project but to find a new long-term approach for this "which starts out from a changed time beam."
Mayor Ole of Beust kept to earlier statements on Wednesday, after what the Olympiaambitionen Hamburgss are unrealistic at least up to the year 2028.
Olympiabewerbung but the German Olympic sports federation decides, on one " not Hamburg " world online said of Beust.
He referred to the decision of the sports federation expected for the beginning of December over an application of Munich for the Winter Games 2018.
"This preference means for us that in this no realistic chances will angedachten time period us have from us to 2028 till now."
The dream nevertheless wasn't from dreamt for all time said of Beust.
The Hamburg sports federation (HSB) was sorry for the statements of Beusts.
By the fact that Hamburg doesn't want to apply any more for Olympic Games within the next 25 years the impression is given.
"It is too early to obstruct itself a chance by one burying the plans already at this time", said HSB president Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
Moreover, a renunciation of the application contradicts the statement of the senate boss on the occasion of a reception concerning the general meeting of the general German high school sport association.
There 2015 has described the application of Hamburg "not as a substitute" of Beust for the Universiade for Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The high school sport association had nominated Hamburg as an applicant town only last week.
The SPD citizens parliamentary group reproached the senate for having not used valuable time for the house building in Hamburg.
The little boy's Grasbrooks has been delayed by the senate for years because it has put Olympia and left the house building aside on the card, " the development " the SPD representatives Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While SPD for the little boy Grasbrook has always demanded an integrated planning for Olympia and a later living use has put CDU on the "event factor" one-sided.
The application for the Olympic summer Games 2012 had aroused a great enthusiasm in Hamburg at that time.
Hamburg had failed because of Leipzig, though.
These aren't Warhols boxes
Thinks to Ikea who connects the concepts Sweden and wooden box but not to Andy Warhol.
Or anyway?
At present, wooden boxes produced in Sweden are throwing dark shade on Warhols work list.
Fakes are a large part of the ninety-four Brillo boxings of the "type Stockholm" listed there.
After the Swedish newspaper "expresses" has stirred doubt about the genuineness of Andy Warhols Brillo boxings of the year 1968 up some months ago, internal investigations are arriving at a conclusion sobering up in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now: The six "Brillo-Boxes" which former museum director Pontus Hultén has bequeathed to the Moderna Museet 1995 as a gift, copies and well are also the large part of the another about one hundred Brillo boxings of the "type Stockholm", these on the international art market into circulation are.
The past history is more artistically chaining confusing nested, one and kuratorischer productions.
Warhol created its first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes which are based on the red blue white design of the cardboard boxes of the soap powder "Brillo", in New York in 1964.
An exhibition of his work in the Moderna Museet 1968 exhibited hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard with Warhols consent: These weren't (from reasons of cost) of Warhol but were delivered directly from the Brillo-Kartonagenfabrik.
It wasn't works of art but around the examples around bare exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol 1968 has given the permission well to let some few Brillo wooden boxes which weren't exhibited in the Moderna Museet, though produce in Sweden.
Contemporary witnesses are talking now about about fifteen boxes which have rightly gone down in art and auction history as authorized original Andy-Warhol Brillo-Boxes with the name "type Stockholm" at that time.
More than 100 000 dollars have obtained some of them on auctions.
It is the problem now about one hundred wooden boxes which Warhol then has left to it have been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968 that legendary museum director Pontus Hultén has claimed wrongly later.
Hulténs 105 boxes were only 1990 actually produced in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
Warhol was already three years dead at this time.
Lars Byström, chief curator at the Moderna Museet, also has examined three next to Brillo-Boxes museum characteristic of six from a Swedish private property, which two 1968 were made in Stockholm: Your pressing chipboards were undercoated first and, abgeschmirgelt, white oil-based paint was applied with a brush after that.
The structure of the copies from the year 1990 however tells that the color was served with a painter role without flat coat directly on the pressing chipboard -- it in addition isn't around oil, pick out around acrylic paint.
These boxes "weren't authorized by the artist and should be removed by the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo Boxes", indicates the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "'Andy Warhol kind of Authentication board' doesn't come to another end in New York, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material if this."
These spare, in July, the Authentication board has admittedly announced to follow the "heavy accusations" in the area of the soap powder boxes are raised.
But one remains silent there since then.
Revolting soldiers in Manila give up
Having given up revolting soldiers in the Philippines who had entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the fall from president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He couldn't accept the responsibility for any bloodshed, the leader Antonio Trillanes who reproached for the president Korruption and ballot-rigging told reporters in the hotel.
Soldiers loyal to the government had stormed the hotel before below tear gas use.
The about two dozen soldiers had entrenched themselves in the building for hours.
Trillanes rounds the half of them was because of a failed attempted putsch on Thursday in the year 2003 in front of court -- under them.
He used the negotiation to stand out suddenly with about 30 sympathizers.
The armed forces policemen who should guard him actually had overflowed to him apparently and followed his mutiny.
You penetrated into the Peninsula hotel and demanded the fall from president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops turned the district off around the distinguished hotel.
The president called an urgent meeting of the safety cabinet.
The national safety adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the procedure of the soldiers.
"People have enough", said Trillanes.
"We call upon the people to follow themselves."
The scout general Danilo Lim commanded Rangers, said other army units wanted to follow the march soon, the early the crack unit.
Government critics had called for great demonstrations against the president for Friday.
Your government is overshadowed by corruption reproaches for months.
Manilas finance district was already main scene of the tempted mutiny of about 200 armed forces members against Arroyo in 2003.
After almost 24 hours, the rebellion failed because of the refusal of the army to attach himself.
Since 1986 there were already at least seven attempted putsches against governments chosen democratically in the Philippines.
