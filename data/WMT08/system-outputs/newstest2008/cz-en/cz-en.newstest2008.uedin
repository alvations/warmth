Zrádný demonstrated his billion of inferiority
Proradný defraudant.
So calls his bávalého staff Jerome kerviela French banking giant of Société Générale, the owner domestic commercial banks.
Came for him nearly five billion euros.
Rather, that kerviel was a big player who wanted to match colleagues, and certainly not inept.
Unlike any large bank could make out time crisis on the American market.
"is mentally weaker, 'came from his mouth, his superiors, who sent to the police.
But, as it results from the kervielovy notice in French media, for example, the Le Monde, was, at the end of the last year was their business of profits of 1.6 billion euros.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank, '' says in the notification.
In the summer of, he managed to America ’ s crisis make a half - billion euros.
Sensed opportunity, already at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports that so - called sub-prime mortgages, granted nízkopříjmovým clients or those who had problems with the beneficiary, will have problems.
Impact on the economy this crisis have but had not.
Kerviel paralyzing feeling and staked correctly.
At the end of the year, then his profit climbed to 1.6 billion euros.
"When I made the first půlmiliardu, I didn 't know how it,' 'says kerviel, for herself certainly nothing up.
In its examination admits that falšoval records so that it does not come.
He even bosses fooled, even if she began to his business in the stock market eurex.
Risk was profit
He feared that it coming?
More not.
'' I thought that only simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for bank is applied for.% quot%
Where he will so much risk?
His position he had gradually established.
In Société Générale came in 2000, just after graduating from college University in Lyon.
Its annual salary was around 51 of thousands of dollars.
Two years later he was already assistant broker and in 2005 became an individual makléřem with an annual & amp; dollar; 90 thousand dollars.
Yet he knew it would never to earn as much as the other.
"In my first interview in 2005, I knew that zahlížejí at me.
Because of my education and professional and personal development, "described kerviel investigators.
But shortly after he came first great success.
Thanks to shares alllianz, bombings in London planted the decline of this Title half a billion euros.
And this was the trigger mechanism - wanted more.
Until vyděláváš, 'you
"It 's like a clean sphere," said the police.
But bosses had known, or rather realized.
"Until I earned money, beginning eyes. ''
But then came morning at the beginning of this year.
In a single day lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid - January wanted that zahladit.
When on Monday he came to work at the bank already.
And the Bank, a few days later, that the five billion euros.
And how came to him?
Suspected became due to their vacation.
'' I chose only four days for the preceding year.
0407, which is not leave, is demonstrated, which does not want to someone peep in his records, "said kerviel.
The Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
The Ministers of the Czech government yesterday with representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine operational programmes, from which the Czech Republic may obtain in coming years 14 billion (approximately 365 dollar).
It is roughly half of the total amount which may the Czech Republic from Brussels in 2007 to 2013.
Some 125 dollar will be of seven operational programmes to regions.
The Czech companies will be able to get around 100 billion dollar from the business, and innovation.
Most of the money to 150 billion, will go to transport.
The right is the operational programme and a to 22 percent of the work which may obtain from the Funds.
These funds will increase the budget of the national fund transport infrastructure, which will be next year to run the amount 90,8 billion dollar.
Programme of business and innovation shall serve entrepreneurs and firms to raising funds for the innovative business.
Firms should receive funding for the introduction of new technologies for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
In they take money out from EU funds are not work in the framework of the newly admitted countries among the least successful.
20 - year - old punishment for exprezidenta Nicaragua confirmed the court
The court in Nicaragua Thursday confirmed only punishment for the former President of the country Arnold alemána, which was convicted of the 2003 for financial fraud reaching 100 million (nearly 1.8 billion dollar).
Later, however, was released from prison, living in the domestic prison on their haciendě near Nicaragua 's cities.
If the former head of the Central American state of 1997 to 2002 back behind bars, is not, in the Agency ap at that moment clear.
In accordance with the President of the Court ileany pérezové will now want to prison agents, whether they alemána dosloužit his punishment at home or be in prison.
The Court four years ago alemánovi prove that regularly; government money to foreign firms in Panama.
The companies were notional and accounts were in fact, his family and the nearest supporters.
Some of these money then ended in the fund which alemán founded in the financing of his electoral campaign in 2001.
US, the budget
It is.
The national budget was accepted.
What is this the budget exceptional?
Is the first budget drawn up by the government and adopted coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
The last on this year he even with the support of čssd, because he prepared sobotka minister and čssd could not afford to his - acceptance.
Unlike the busy debate before by a vote of no confidence government this nothing dramatic happening.
The House of Commons this traditionally ignored, although the dominant, law in peace.
It is a paradox.
Each governance begins and ends for each chapter and the budget appropriations, whether someone like it or them.
The budget is an essential part of the policies, but behind the forces of a contest government with the opposition.
This is the media been more grateful and therefore him in the media shall pay more attention.
Hádaní politicians them to the public much more interesting than austere numbers.
National budgets in the past the social democratic governments suffered three ailments, which he 2008 is unable to suddenly solved:
The first is a high proportion of legally compulsory, tzv. mandatorních spending, which are not only pensions, but also the social benefits, which in the past year before the election, silent "coalition" čssd and ksčm.
The second is deficit management neduhu as a result of the first.
The third limit are deficits public finance, tj. budget deficit local and municipal authorities.
The biggest risk, however, is not government budget deficit.
Is the public and relatively under control.
A ticking bomb, however, is deficit budgets local and municipal authorities.
Many mayors, in addition to the money from taxes, charges and loans from the Bank, to gain more resources to investment, often bezhlavě issued bonds which unreasonably zadlužovali their hall.
In recent years, they meet those debts mass sales of shares of energy and other distribution networks from the State from in privatization.
Now this source.
If we only official and verifiable facts, one finds that:
Our economy through several years, as well as the rest of the world, growth stages, always boasting čssd.
It was a unique opportunity to its governments public finances in order.
Instead, the State still more zadlužovaly.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, hospodařili much well than our Republic.
This is a great shame, which falls primarily on the previous government.
We between countries that are, on a global scale, at least threatened by poverty.
Therefore, there is no need for the massive social programs, in recent years, no nabobtnaly in gigantic size.
Even if the repeal of senseless populist expenditure, approved this year before the election, and near the shifting the retirement and pension reform, then in fact end any policy in that country and Whoever governs then it will be just úřadování.
With a small exaggeration to say that the ruling politicians become officials, mechanically dividing the most zdaněných money to pensions and social benefits.
Therefore cannot be this year ’ s budget revolutionary, but can only suspend displacing normal expenditure mandatorními expenditure.
Planned deficit of 70 billion per year 2008 would be unnecessary if the previous government neprohospodařily in the last ten years, what could.
Nechceme-li, indeed, that the ruling politicians become pouzí officials, then we must be patient, on this not strong coalition government that recognizes that State may grant only what can get on taxes and charges, for the preparation of other reform law.
Only the gradual achievement to balance of the national budget.

Bank want to resolve a crisis of
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in financial markets.
On the currency markets to get more than 100 billion by sales.
In those auction bank auctioning off the interest rate at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, America 's Fed so sends to the auction 40 billion, next twenty - four then available and the Swiss of the European Central Bank.
It is after the attacks of September first national central bank domluvily in coordinated action to prevent or reduce the effects of financial crisis.
% quot% this step is to address the economy, the growing shortage of free capital which would banks could borrow, "wrote in its report clients Bernard baumohl from consulting firm economic outlook group.
"coordinated action of central banks reduce the likelihood of recession in the United States from 65% to 50%," added baumohl in its report.
The Bank had 60 billion to nespláceným loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect another billions of losses.
'central banks must have really fear of what it may follow when opted for this procedure, "said Chief Economist ABN AMRO kieran Davies.
"It looks like that the situation is really bad," he said.
Central Bank fear that if the bank themselves difficult access to borrow, dráže borrow and their customers.
This would reduce consumption and sending the American economy into recession with possible impact on economic growth around the world.
Central banks so decided after the failed to reduce tzv. rate Libor, London - based interbank rate, which is used for lending money to mezibankovním market.
This meant that banks should still fear of mutual lending money, and despite the fact that the central banks of the US, Canada, and Britain during fall lowered their interest rates.
"It will have the same effect as the next interest rates," said the agency Reuters Greg salvaggio the Tempus consulting.
Some analysts see, "that, step of Central Banks shall contribute to stave off crisis do not address the fundamental problem, and that is the fall of the property market in the US.
Klaus: debate ecologists are amazing
The global climate change are most harm developing countries.
The President Vaclav Klaus, expressed on global warming.
Criticism is now to withstand the Ending International Conference on the change of climate on.
In Vienna, where the exporter presented his book blue, green planet, he stated that debate ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus neakceptovatelná is not only the structure of the Conference, consisting of representatives of the Governments of the strange mixture and non - governmental organizations, but the fundamental difference between rhetoric, which it is accompanied by, and reality.
'' debate there is completely nestrukturovaná, for it is only fireworks words which are substitute for solutions to existing problems, "said Klaus.
Czech President presented in his book stressed that the topic is his very important, and therefore for them so involved.
Also has to be a book in German translation, because, as he said, "it is I 'm only with karikaturami their views."
Now may therefore be read the nezkreslené position.
Klaus said that, though not klimatolog, but in their opinion sufficient assumptions the publication of such a book.
Is an academic to monitor and assess the professional treatise, experience of statistics, and it is also political economist.
For the main findings book called the notion that climate is constantly changing and its amendments are, therefore, to the warming of the planet is identical view all scientists, that the consequences of ongoing changes are not too large and does not constitute a serious threat, and so that affect the development efforts are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably expensive.
Moreover, then as one experience of totalitarianism deemed unacceptable there neprokázaných views, which has as dangerous curtailing freedom.
To questions present repeatedly explained that is not against 'environmental protection, but against militantnímu environmentalismu which does not take account of the relationship between the cost and their benefit.
On the same theme spoke Klaus in Vienna already two months ago in hayekově Institute.

Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 vti: the disappearing prejudice
In truth, I never power Peugeot 206 nefandil.
His driving properties were not much, quality of sorting, management and also of the mark often for podprůměrnou.
But on the market is now successor Peugeot 207, and it is enough better.
Station wagon, and called SW go farther and me, the better.
When I testing classical hatchback Peugeot 207, so I said he, for example, to the area on his head on the rear seats.
This is already complaints, because the bodywork station wagon means that in this respect will not suffer or dvoumetroví dlouháni.
Overbooked flight World
The interior of the přejdu very quickly to power neopakoval.
This is the total good design, where the only výtku I have a poor středovému tunnel.
I appreciate slightly more designerské talent and total ignorance of the intricacises, when the car she looks so sleek.
Seats are comfortable and there are times when we could complain about short sedáky or the seat - back.
Also the side management significantly against model 206.
In space, and here you feel an increase in the size of the bodywork.
In the station wagon, and then already referred to not enough space above his head.
The trunk trunks
The main on this car is his zavazadelník.
That I have evaluated as very well accessible (even vyklápěcímu through the back window) and as well skladný.
The gaps are equipped with zádržnými gumami which are ideal compromise.
Nepřekáží, stretch and hold and heavier objects.
But pozastavme together over the volume.
He is specified in the tables in the Arrangement 428 L, which is against competition more mean value.
But not against in the Czech nejprodávanějšímu car this class - damage fabia combi.
Porovnáme-li 207 SW with a new generations mladoboleslavského product, then we discover that Peugeot is lagging behind the noticeable 52 litres.
On holiday abroad or loading trap is this value to critical.
But if I had hoist her benefits and still I must mention the floor completely right after the lowering of the second or very low threshold.
120 horses in the four rows
Our test car was equipped with a positive - ignition čtyřválcem of 1.6 L with 88 kW.
And in truth, should look šestnáctistovka that drives the family hatchback.
Is silent, has little consumption and in particular.
If she 'll knock' škodováckou the controls, which often, as should - off in the exhaust pipe, so it can only be pleased.
Grocery catalogue he
The price is not people 's.
But we must remember that we tested, fitted with a car with a spacious mill and very good engine.
The basic price the zážehovou čtrnáctistovkou for 329 900 CZK still extended.
Our four is from 410 900 CZK, which he was close enough.
The test equipment premium then just equipment for other 80 000 the upper hand.
But we had the top airbagy, automatic air conditioning, autorun wipers, electric command rear windows...
Is simply the town has 531 900 CZK.
It is a lot, but napočítejte, additional equipment for fabie and you assume a similar number.
So, decide to the mark.

The insurance is appropriate for me?
Insurance car that protect the driver in the case of nehody. represents a considerable expenditure which depends on the various factors such as age, sex, length of a driving licence, the nature of the vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
A car is just the beginning.
Select the appropriate insurance car is even more difficult, a model of the car.
In the first instance it is necessary to clarify what we talk.
The insurance is agreement between the insurance undertaking and by the policyholder.
This undertaking takes the form of insurance of the Treaty which provides that an undertaking is agreed in the premium for that, taken on payment of injury in the event of a claim.
The insurance premiums price insurance is determined with regard to the various factors such as age, sex, length possession of the licence, of a type of vehicle of which underwrites or its use, etc.
Insurance companies set its prices on the basis of statistics, so that the greater the likelihood of the accident, the higher the premium.
For this reason, as people over 25 years, women have to pay lower premiums, for statistics show that they have less the volatility due to their.
In the same way, on the basis of the checks of insurance companies to the conclusion that persons living in marriage have less than the free accidents to the driver.
The manner in which the vehicle is used, will have an impact on the frequency of journeys, and the likelihood that will have an accident.
Increase the frequency of journeys increases the likelihood.
There are many variables which undertakings are when a price premiums.
Therefore, the driver must well to study the situation to choose such insurance which corresponds best to its profile insurance policy holders.
We there the most important variables for the selection of this or that type of insurance, in addition, meeting the type of insurance policy holders, also will at a reasonable price.
Twenty - five years younger people meet with different handicaps such as little experience with management and short possession of a driving licence, when they want to negotiate premiums at affordable prices.
Although ideal for good cover is insurance against all risks, there are cheaper variants.
Nejopatrnější drivers may choose to insurance against all risks, the premium discounts, to cover all risks, but for better price.
This type of the Treaty, the expected client to pay contingency.
'part payment of events which shall provide the client will be stated beforehand in the determination of prices of premiums to be the, what would be the lower, "explains Luis noguera, the head of the company' s first Europe in Spain, the intermediary insurance over the Internet.
Another insurance is extended to other participants in the service, so that the client insure against damage to other persons, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, if he were insured against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
The recommendation.
If you are less than twenty - five years, try to be considerate and to prevent accidents, as far as possible, for it will affect your bonus and lower premiums in the future.
Bonus is to reduce the standard rate, which is an insurance company.
By contrast, Malus is an increase in the standard rate.
"bonus and Malus will depend on the insurance undertaking and its profits.
Měla-li undertaking a good year will be able to afford to increase bonus, "explains noguera.
After the twenty - five years are drivers easier when they go to negotiate insurance, because the volatility of client with them, the experience acquired.
For this reason, it is recommended to negotiate the insurance against all risks, at their discount windows.
"The young people usually cannot use in advance of experience at the time of the accident and, even in proceedings% quot%, assures the Director of the European companies in Spain and that the majority of accidents occur in the second year, which has already been gave" fear a newcomer. "
However, je-li client married, but does not have children, it is better to negotiate insurance against all risks, provided that its economic situation permit.
Family with children are insurance companies considered the first with the lowest index volatility and thus their price increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance was insurance against all risks at the premiums (which could be EUR 300) or the extras, insurance extended to other participants in the operation, from the third year of the purchase of the vehicle.
'' their proceedings are calmer and their koupěschopnost higher, so that they can afford luxury get the highest discount, "says Luis noguera.
Pensioners, it is recommended that insurance against all risks, the premium discounts (which shall be EUR 150) or insurance extended to other Participants service, if a high increase.
It should be noted that the car something important, not only because the driver in the event of an accident, but also because represents a considerable expenditure, which is a good reason for patřičnému study possible insurance which would most suit to our personal situation.
(2) to obtain on AC Milan point, which means osmifinále
AC Milan and (2) weighting forces this Tuesday to the stadium San siro in order to gain that they lack to achieve the objectives in the League "champions", because for Italy this would be the first and for Scots would of location.

So the group will be concluded before other and undecided result to the stadium Giuseppe meazzy appears to be the most likely, even if the two men try to this of victory, because they may not want Italians taktizovat at home and (2), after they 'd won would be the first and would be a better place in osmifinále.
The team Gordon strachana could be enough to the procedure even, if šachťor nevyhraje, but cannot rely on the same number of nine points to Ukrainians, who last week lost in Glasgow (2: 1), but won in the first direct match (2: 0).
And so the players AC Milan to zkazit evening skotům who believe that, for the second time in semi - final in reorganizované champions league just as is defeated in the same match in the last competition gólem Kaka in extension (1: 0) after the state of 0: 0 in basic board.
Hope that became "rossoneri" will be šachťor, for which it is worth victory, if only (2), both for the osmifinále and staying in the uefa.
Benfica, although it is the last and does not have the option to continue the European competition, could one Victory achieved third place, so that would play in uefa.

These two worlds is roughly as large and duties are moved after similar routes, but Venus is a little closer to the sun.
Researchers now believe that billions of years before the Venus conditions similar to those on Earth, and could be obyvatelná.
But splašený greenhouse effect, due to carbon dioxide in solution, atmospheric erosion of the solar radiation and lower speed of sent Venus after a different path of development.
Today, it is the planet without water temperature on the surface is hot to lead smelting and ravages her storms and winds of hurricane.
The findings of the probe the European Space Agency Venus express, who was studying the planet one year, offers temperate view of how the country might evolve in the case of climate change.
Fred Taylor, a professor of physics Oxford University and one of the mission Venus express said, "is increasingly clear why is climate on Venus and other than on the ground, even if they are the planet otherwise enough similar.
'' Our new data to build scenario in which Venus, as well as the country, possibly obyvatelným environment, billions of years. "
Police% quot% enriched uranium '
Pounds of radioactive material, allegedly enriched uranium, was yesterday arrested the Slovak and Hungarian police.
The police claimed that three people were picked up and material is examined.
Declared that it is enriched uranium, but he said that the substance can be disposed of under 1 & amp; dollar; 1 million (300, 000).
Still wide open
Mitt Romney he said that presidential candidates is not a to respond to questions from '.
Despite Republican presidential candidates then agreed with the debate over to "YouTube in which ordinary voters they recorded their questions on video and forward for odvysíláni candidates.
None of the questions of broadcast on Wednesday 28. November was not so comic as sněhulák, who asked Democrats on global warming in the debate on YouTube.
But the questions and answers this time reflect the many on the state of the Republican Party to vote for the following year.
It is not clear how accurately producers CNN, one of the sponsors of debates about the clips, which then ukazovány aspirujícím candidates.
But the first half - hour debate, the longest period given to a single theme was focused on immigration.
This is one of the most powerful Republican themes.
CNN asked panel undecided voters to turn a disc when they heard something potěšujícího: announcer peaks of the consent when candidates talked the access to the borders.
The hardest and longest an exchange of views occurred between rudym giulianim, the main national candidate, and Mr. Romneym, prošťouchnul forward in key early recorded in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr Giuliani is trying to shake reputation as someone who was as mayor said New York soft on illegal immigrants.
Attacked Mr romneyho, obviňujíc former governor Massachusetts that he hired illegal immigrants to work on his home.
These two struggling especially as tazatelé when asked if one of the candidates supported "amnesty" (give the illegal immigrants normal position and the possibility of citizenship).
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter, California Congressman, and Tom tancredo, Congressman from Colorado, could happen his little in on this topic.
None of the two does not have a chance to nomination, they remain in the game perhaps that began the alarm for immigration earlier and more than others.
At least to immigration candidates possess roughly the same view: greater severity of the border, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This, together with fear of toxic toys from China and other worries with the rest of the world, helping the Republicans forget or minimize the conflict between libertiny and the Christian conservatives.
But the debate began to be very painful when it came to other topics.
Mr Giuliani he was asked why in the past supported the possession of the firearms.
John McCain and Mr Romney discuss whether would technique simulovaného heating should be considered a torture.
One the inquirer asked whether candidates believe every word of the Bible.
Mr Giuliani stumbled through it to the view that, even if the Bible his favorite book, I don 't literally story jonášovi and but.
Other the inquirer asked if Jesus supported the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - which is now against all assumptions first in a recent survey, Iowa, owing to his long - term the Christian konzervatizmu - said that the death penalty is disagreeable but necessary.
Under pressure, decide whether this Jesus agreed, he said, that Jesus was too smart that ran, his laughter.
A duel remains an open.
The increase in Mr. Huckabeeho Iowa overlaps with the recent successes in obtaining money and loud with Ron Paul in středeční debate.
These two pushed off from the DNA, because both parties are still cannot agree on the better - known and more candidate.
In 1980 and 2000 one of the candidates United party very early and powerful with winning report on the American size on my lips, pomrkávaje to both parties.
This time is split and the outcome of the verifying authenticity far.
The pain labour
Gordon Brown again he found the trap in which might fall; his way out remains the same.
Even if it is the British political scandals, this is not particularly pikantní.
He doesn 't seem to have been sold some decorations, no accounts in Paris hotel have not been deeply paid, no mimomanželské prstíčky were ocucávány.
But zabarikádovaný Gordon Brown, he without was discovered, a Moscow after four years mask contributions ruling Labor Party of 650, 000 (1, 3 million dollars) under the names of other people, and that this party neohlásila.
Two months ago, when Prime Minister sidestepped the induction of elections and insulted British intelligence, claiming that this decision was affected surveys, a chance that ensure odolnou and effective government.
Instead, as it is increasingly vtipnější representing the President liberal democrats, Mr. Brown feared had changed from Stalin to Mr. Beana.
Clumsy saving wound bank Northern Rock showed weaknesses in the management and poor judgment under siege.
Wrong elaborate proposals for the amendment of the tax code joined firms together against the government.
The loss of personal data at 25 million people revealed administrative břídilství inconceivable.
The generals in income launched a rebellion in the House of Lords; against the cuts in military spending, because it was claimed that the master of the armed forces is the part - time.
Now there are mnohosečné donations from David abrahamse; Peter watt, the Secretary - General of the labour (and their former the internal discipline), resigned.
None of this is to suggest that Mr. Brown inevitably aimed to an end.
Despite governments can reach a point of flip, consider governance heavy.
People do politicians and is, but a majority of weights their distrust when it takes over new crew.
It seems clear that a Prime Minister probably nothing does not improve, however, and need not be long in the office, this is odsunutí away: administration becomes děravou, ministers will do briefings, the press is bad news, and the government becomes nesoustředěnou and defensive.
In one direction, Mr. Brown particularly complex, as compared to other political leaders cannot take a position of the new koštěte.
It would like to - Tony Blair, was its first officer.
For example, problems with the Northern Rock and records of the financial office are associated with the decisions which, Mr. Brown did as finance minister.
And even if not directly involved in blairovských malérech, such as long investigation financing political parties caused by "ranking for money" voters may quietly decide that was.
Yet they are not trouble Mr. Brown so bad as look.
Those we are not so terrible, such as conservatives do.
As regards Mr beana, nobody did not die not downright deceived.
And treatment, however may be painful, is to provide what Stalinist tendencies, Mr. Brown always slibovaly: a reliable, firm and brutal government.
The latest uproar around political gifts is a good example.
Garboidní Mr abrahams which compares with their gifts charitou, says that he did not want for his charity any publicity.
This may be true, but decision it was not for him.
Laws against the anonymity major donors are clear and there are for the simple reason: the public shall have the right to know who could buy access to those who rule in the country.
Mr watt, who said that he was on the Mr abrahamse, but did not know that it is illegal, would thoroughly tried; Jon mendlesohn, the main labouristický sháněč money, which he learned of tricky food gifts in October.
But Mr. Brown is not involved;, nothing is that he knew about these pletichách, even if the major part of payments made after his attack in June.
Prime Minister has done half of the work.
Very quickly, such breach laws own party, but zředil his mind by sáhnul after osvědčeném instruments, to the Commission for examination this matter - - led additionally Bishop, a judge.
In this case, are not lesson complex.
If there has been an infringement of the law, this is a matter of police.
In addition, the other things which, Mr. Brown to find a permanent Chairman independent committee on standards in public life, which was six months of any, and to a reform of the financing of political parties.
This would require from labour, who are in, to kooperovali with conservatives and perhaps even given up a financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for devout straníka, Mr. Brown.
But should face a few simple facts.
Conservatives now have a in the polls ahead; he has two years in order to gain back, and the only way vydřít victory is unassailable integrity and high competence.
The card Sharks
Affects the sub - prime crisis the American market credit cards?
If the blood in the water, of course, míhat excitedly about the dorsal fin.
Now the American market in real estate languishes, predátoři focused on the market credit cards.
Analysts firms Goldman Sachs is loss of credit cards, if from sub - prime mortgages nakazily further variants of consumer credit to 99 billion.
Mark strains are clear.
Is the number of cases of (at more than 30-denním delay payment) and insolvency accounts (accounts, the supplier shall be deemed to be beyond recovery).
The Bank hsbc last month announced that the consumer lost 1.4 mld. & amp; dollar; also nesolventním loans on credit card.
The panic, it is far too early.
Depreciated accounts and failure to pay is still low.
According to ohodnocovací agency Moody 's was 3,89% rate of insolvency in the third quarter almost a full percentage point below the average.
Deteriorating extent be explained in part the technical reasons.
Change in the laws of personal bankruptcy of 2005 led to a sharp drop in reported bankruptcy which make much of the credit cards; the number of messages (and hence the number of depreciation), therefore, ascended regardless of whether the general conditions for the borrower worse.
Sector also has a degree of maturity, which shows how many consumers a month of its debts.
And confidence in securities secured credit cards is fixed, despite the paralysis in other parts of the structured finance.
Mr Dennis moroney from research firms towergroup predict that the volumes of their emissions for 2007 will be 25% larger than the last.
Direct for infection between the sub - prime crisis and the market credit cards certainly exist: when vysychají loans on the assets in real estate, consumers are zadluží through credit card.
Credit card issuers but rather than to see the cash flow value ručících objects, so falling home prices does not necessarily mean change integrity borrowers.
They may even be for suppliers loans convenient.
Motivation of consumers pay mortgages, when the value of their assets fall below the amount of the loan; as a result, the debt on cards stick up the list of priorities for repayment.
Card issuers also can faster and flexibilněji to respond to more conditions than mortgages, change interest rates or limits debt.
It could, in theory, should reduce the risk of rapid change in prices ručících objects.
"It is that we one morning just rethink all loans, '' says Gary Perlin, financial leading firms capital one.
If there is a risk of explosion in the style of the sub - prime mortgages low risk for the progressive weakening is far more real.
If home prices lower and reduction of debt press America into recession, the credit cards will be confronted darker future.
To those the dorsal fin.
British bankers not guilty in the case of Enron

England must decide: owais Shah, or ravi bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as difficult as the other.
Who will number six in pálce for England this weekend in Canada, owais Shah, or ravi bopara?
And, in a wider context of no less relevant than the first test against Sri Lanka, who is this decision to do?
The second question is relevant because David graveney, President of the facilities at the Commission, this position held at best in the hired up - river time, has peteru mooresovi, the principal trenérovi, and Michael vaughanovi, Captain, with choices assistance and the table Hugh morrise, the manager of the team, begins to applications for national výběrčího, although not necessarily on a full - time basis.
The who, at the sixth pálce built, will be unhappy, but life is not fair and sport was not at all.
Is not easy to find what one gets to the top of his profession, while someone else will never get over lower level, sometimes, owing to the lack of happiness rather than.
Not only in cricket selection onerous and requires opinion, who always eventually must be subjective.
It is the right time to bopara pushing up?
It is fair to shahovi, if so?
On the same we ask in other areas, say that here: John Edwards or "tubby" banerjee, both smart young managers with a good education and a statement of the occupation, should be within the Commission povýšeni - place is only for one.
Who is to say that level is for kriketaře correct, when he can fall or just chance to another?
Naturally to the numbers on the decision - making a great influence, but such are opportunities.
The team must kriketař the right moment the eye of a captain, whether the wicket take, and batter needs regular chances of starting positions if the sometimes airs as overnight kriketař.
The eye výběrčího is more complicated.
For example, in the last season was much better, James Anderson, whose in the first test, seems certain, even if the Stephen harmison said as healthy and nadhazoval as dělostřelec.
Anderson took 32 wicketů in the first class in 33 přebězích for each.
Chris tremlett took in skrovném as an average of only 29, but both had their time at the highest level and hope in another.
Whether to play the stadium asgiriya Shah, or bopara may be only a matter of opinion.
The option may decide on or career both, or may not be influential.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka played gareth batty in each test and the first class to good performance, five wicketů and 40 permissible přeběhů, but it was Paul collingwood which at the same time he fought to their place, finally became a stable testovým kriketářem, moreover, although in Australia against Australia had twice 100 points, may still podceňován.
It is more likely that graveney, Vaughan moores and, after a further discussion in relation to today 's training sides in asirgiya, will follow its conservative instincts and priority shahově greater experience before boparovou mladickou vigour.
For both there are arguments.
For shaha speak his hypnotic, and valuable debut testové shift 88 points in Bombay and 32 hundreds of the first class over six boparovým which is, in 22 years, seven years younger and to statistics against spin nadhozům.
But the Shah did in two shifts in may against the Caribbean in test for Lord 's, their home course in middlesexu, just ten přeběhů, together with immediate rejection of collectors, when he Vaughan again to occupy the struggle, his old it seems ubralo something of the momentum, who was in Bombay so obvious.
By contrast essexský univerzál has joie de vivre in bones.
On kriketovém course nothing nevyleká him and his behavior outside the course symbolizes the recently inverted car with low - speed turns in four wheels on the date of the sponsor exhibičním automobile English team Volkswagen.
He with slight injuries and probably shock, but as the first thing raising his Vodafone (of course, also sponzorovaný) and called alastairu the cooks, his spoluhráči, who from beyond, to excited, he asked, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, their medium internet Shear nadhozy on the playground equipment which seems to meet, begins effectively and launches confidently and.
Select the correct man is one thing, select the right time is different.
Perhaps it is that real art selection.
Personally, kloním to bopara his chance was now, but I don 't want to say that the Shah not excelovat if, as cejlonské tea leaves suggest that he was the next weekend to play.
Buses pulling refugees back to work - - - and to fight against al-kajdě
The first busloads Iraqi refugees from Syria began yesterday arrive in Baghdad and vysypávat utečence, money or the expiration of the period of validity of visas, and another, who had hoped that the city returns to the normal life.

Now the probe Venus express brought evidence - caught electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. To Venus fly lightning from a cloud to a cloud at about 56, wrote in scientific journal Nature Christopher Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles.
According to the known theories of initial mass on the country because of bleskům arise. Storm supposedly precipitated in the oceans reaction, which led to the emergence of amino acids, basic building blocks of life.
The Venus that were: "If there sometimes life, it had to be already very long," explains Sean Solomon of Carnegie Institute in Washington, D. C.
Today, on the surface of the Venus something alive as a. The atmosphere is about 100 times thicker than on the ground and sometimes here a temperature about 500 ° c.
"Venus might be diabolical twin country, but it 's twin," said Russell.
Why Venus, which is the country matter and size so similar to completely otherwise, the question of the ESA.
Whereas, since the beginning of the 90. years has not been length no probe solely for the purpose of studying Venus, start probe Venus express in November 2005 was in research in the world.
According to the scientists of the latest research results which approaching a few articles of nature, nezdůrazňovaly only uniqueness Venus in solar system.
"has shown that our planet is a neighbouring country similar more than it had not yet," she ESA.
In addition to the already known windmills vortices the North Pole and scientists found mračný spiral at the South Pole, which revolve significantly faster.
This phenomenon of air currents in the earth 's Northern Hemisphere, a research team led by guiseppe piccioniho from the Italian Institute Istituto di astrofisica spaziale e fisica cosmica.
The second very planet our solar system up almost the same matter as a country and with an average of 12 100 km is almost as large.
The planet referred to as Aurora or večernice round the sun for nearly 225 days.
Around their own axis, however, turns much more slowly. One day on Venus, 243 days on earth.
Although Venus surface temperature 460 ° C and pressure 92 bar (shortcut to bar?) country unlikely, scientists that both the planet are very similar conditions.

The band vzpomínáním harmonia unnecessarily přetěžujeme memory, this trio, there were just two years, and at that time should not far from a what they later used to put others.

Richard gere is simply not enough cynical
With the films the hunting parts and mörderischer frieden appeared two movies about the war in the Balkans.
But neither of them is not convincing.
A films either put too much emphasis on akčnost and fire, or are too wonderful.
In the hunting parts not or such actor, Richard gere.
Good news as the first: war criminals karadzić and Mladic, although they hiding in the Balkans, but there, in a sombre background Bosnian war, actor Richard gere it.
In the last period of one of the most beautiful man 1980s lost from his eyes, not only because he played in many líbivých, nevážných roles in pohodových women 's films, but in connection with their print conferences forever in Buddhism, take a taste for further film with this actor.
And yet, Richard gere suddenly the strongest Argument for seeing the hunting - - where hunter becoming prey (why must be names in today ’ s so long and zamotané?).
Gere shall magic. His war a reporter Simon hunt is essentially who would gere could State if the fate and film industry were not so mercy: a man who have the best years it has, but its wreckage as a monument retains a remarkable charm.
But despite this chip is the hunting parts together with the German film mörderischer frieden, who also shall enter in cinemas this week, just as the endless a series of failures of war in the Balkans.
With the film mörderischer frieden we can do short process: this movie is about two German soldiers were in Kosovo (Adrian poplar, Max riemelt) who will save the Serbian girl before a Kosovar odstřelovačem, when one of them with a.
Although laudable, that there are not Serbs představováni as the cause of evil, amended this televizně plytký film too early in the fire and action.
From the movie remains something of the series shook 11, without the highway, but for war.
In the movie The hunting parts can be one of the story, why not yet on the Balkan war could rotate really good film.
The story of the three US war reporters, who shall be issued under the% quot% liškou% quot%, by the chief a war criminal, in another time, under the authority of a director and writers (here is both Richard Shepard) could perhaps State new "Apocalypse."
After all, the stories, resemble: small groups of the forest to cycle was something is not force capable of, their path will happen to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of the film the hunting parts is that Simon hunt is not that zhýralým and sentimentálním cynikem chief at the beginning.
On the contrary, the receiver, he prescribe romantickou 's later zavražděnou Bosnian muslimkou.
The hunting parts can be definitively authorities to make ad hoc cancellations after the reporters accelerated in the last five minutes film will what NATO, CIA and all lovcům criminals the world in the last five years': catch criminals and leave him fair revenge Bosnian Muslims.
It against the logic of film production, that would be a good idea to apply to the International Tribunal in The Hague.
Should this movie profoundly human message.
Condemns that karadzić and Mladic are still at large, and podezírá Americans and French (here are exceptionally United) on the basis of the secret political agreements underlying persecution intenzívně enough.
But good and evil, sometimes as similar, women us then famous brechtova a poem.
In the case of a wooden mask Asian daemon on the desk writer: 'sympathy look at swollen vein on the forehead, poznamenav: as hard be bad.'.
In movies like the hunting party acting just puffed the head, but, suggests how hard it be good.
The problem is not limited to the war in the Balkans.
Recently, in these newspaper he that all Hollywood movies about Iraq were large failures.
This may be the only: never been a powerful no good film on South Africa.
He nearly always: when the star 's larking about after crisis area or through after killing field, a film as Rangoon with patricií arquette, a fault with Angelina Jolie or blutdiamanten with Leonard dicapriem.
It may be all the conflicts simply time too near.
After all, had to run dozens of years before he could make good Hollywood film about the Holocaust - Schindler 's list.
Many film must to ripen - films, which are now considered classical Vietnamese works - - - "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now% quot% or% quot% olověná waistcoat% quot% - have not in any case oslavovány as mistrovská work.
But perhaps it now, when any mass murder at home immediately on two screens, we know too many of conflicts of the world.
Writers — then do not have the capacity that is needed to bezchybnému vypravování good stories.
"be or not% quot% or% quot% large dictator '' became so good, because lubitsch and Chaplin still didn 't know, Nazi regime really.
Perhaps you may not want to be good if he wants to do good movies.
Perhaps must sarkasticky forming a measured art view as novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was asked to parallels between its historic románem "lemprièrův dictionary% quot% and% quot% balkánskou war," he said: "form is only, that some things never unchanged.
Cities will always very dangerous, people will always dreadful vražděni manner, and always will the war in Yugoslavia. "

Is not warholovy boxes
The who collect expressions Sweden and wooden box, he thinks of Andy warhola, but on ikeu.
Or Yes?
Wooden crates produced currently in Sweden on the list of warholova works dark shadows.
Most of his on the list referred to 90 four "brillo boxes% quot% type Stockholm are it.
After the Swedish paper "expressen" a few months before uttered the doubts as to the authenticity of the warholových "brillo boxes" in 1968, internal research museum modern museet in Stockholm with the result that brought the disillusion; six "brillo boxes% quot%, which in 1995 museum modern museet devoted to his former director pontus hultén are - as most of the other" brillo boxes' type Stockholm, which are in the international artistic market in circulation.
The previous events are zamotaným, puzzling string artistic and kurátorských actions.
Warhol his first brillo boxes made in New York City in 1964, pomaloval wooden box, which have been based on červenomodrobílém design paper boxes mýdlového brillo powder.
The exhibition of his works in modern museet in 1968 has shown - warholovým consent - hundreds of brillo bedýnek from paperboard. Those nepocházely (for financial reasons) from warhola, but they were supplied directly from brillo factories.
It wasn ’ t the works of art, but their, just exhibition pieces.
Warhol has probably in 1968 also permit wooden brillo boxes made in Sweden, but they in modern museet issued.
The witnesses now talks about 15 boxes, which then right fit in the artistic and the auction history as the originals of non - 'Andy warholovy brillo boxes "with the type of Stockholm.
