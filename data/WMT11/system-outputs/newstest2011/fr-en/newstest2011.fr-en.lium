What is it going to happen? CSSD known nor Voldemort or pastry in Prague.
The new Democrats elected to the mayor of the capital will apparently overcome a real language barrier to understand the level of the municipal council with their old and new colleagues from the ODS.
The daily Actualne.cz has "tested" the new city council members belonging to CSSD, whether they are aware of the argôt who was born during the last years to the town hall, when it was the current coalition partners who ran in Prague.
The coded political cream-coloured that the vocabulary of Prague launched during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem described some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is with surprise that it was discovered that the newly elected officials do not understand very well the terms known.
At least the they say.
"Who is Valdemort.".
"I really don't know.".
"I am a jeunôt policy in the Prague reacted Lukas Kaucky, the elected to culture the test of the vocabulary of the" godfather ".
And for the veteran politician, elected Karel Brezina reacted the same way.
For example, the meaning of "hole of golf.".
"This is the only expression among those that you are proposing that I use"
Otherwise, I don't use the argôt.
From vocabulary, including the daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June this year before the end pré-éĺectoral of the Civic, the drafting chose 6 examples, primarily those associated with the city of Prague.
The Socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest hole of golf in Prague," go to the bakery nerve, "" beef-based, "" betrayal of the capital "and" entôler. ".
Three of the elected officials have been agreed for the quiz show, the quatrieme- Antonin Weinert, which must lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then did not win the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek has flatly refused the test.
"I am not at all of these things and how fun the representatives of the citizens' democracy: I am not going to give my opinion."
"I'm currently involved with how we understand in the context of our programs," he responded.
As has already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky does not recognize apparently in the caption above, it is the influential Janousek on contractors and friends of the former mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucky and the only words it has guessed in the test is "the biggest hole of golf in Prague.".
"It is the tunnel Blanka" said Kaucky and added immediately: "But I know the newspapers.".
"I'm going to have to pay me a language course," he jokes.
Not only is the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, elected to the environment, know that the hole in golf is the Blanko tunnel.
The two Democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks the meaning of "go to the pastry".
"It is, I think, to go into a business," Plachy is willing to guess that it is the seat of a company of Janousek.
On the same tone Brezina recalls that derives its knowledge rather newspapers and not to any language that he would use.
According to the candidates to tests there is no glossary of argôt in social democracy.
"I got on board with colleagues and it appears that we really did not something of this kind.".
"It is rather the names sometimes use of abbreviations and symbols," said Peter Hlinsky, President of the Social Democrat Party, that Party members Hulda call.
"I called Briza at school but I don't know if my colleagues call me like this," said Karel Brezina about nicknames.
The daily Actuel.cz has tested the name and it works.
The congressman Weinert Papy is for members of the Party or the least friendly Petit 77-year-old, the Representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention on him before the election by fraud during the sponsorship of the party, is nicknamed "the small joujou.".
The nicknames are also the only ones that admit use inside the party the Social Democrats.
It seems that Hulinsky does not like much hear Hulda daily, but the Akutel.cz has recorded another nickname for Prague this president.
"Doctor entitled to stun apparently" recalls that Petr Hulinsky received his doctorate in law JUDr.à the police academy of bratislava.
The government wants to reduce the torture of witches, has published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women reported witches have common traits.
They are part of the old generation, may not work for example for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The "witch" who becomes isolated is not to threaten the rest of the village.
"The man has very rarely this fate."
"We do not judge the young women in good health because they are at work and birth of children," said a sister who is in the capital of this West African nation, Burkina Faso, in a special institution of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to take action against this "social measure" unusual.
He edited a brochure that should help limit the witch hunt.
The case involves a "catch".
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," warned the daily Die Standard about the downside of education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, Burkina Faso's neighbour, Ammy Hemma, a woman of 72 years died after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with oil that they had doused.
This is the server of the BBC which has forwarded this information.
The criminals say it was the evil eye.
According to their version oil that serves the escaping ceremonial emflammée was in contact with the woman.
The oil has soared, 'intention, when the team wanted to "hunt the bad spirit" of the woman.
The insulation of witches is approved by the people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year 42 years of Burkina Faso: "The eaters of human minds have always represented a danger," he said.
While Burkina Faso tries to reduce the witch hunt, Gambia no later than last year even saw the President himself participate.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, has launched a wide witch hunt which, 'intention, would have contributed to his death and would be tried by black magic to kill President."
"Some shamans of Guinea close to come to the rescue, led to the presidential farm at Kanilai, under the protection of police and the President's personal guard, men and women randomly selected villages in Gambia," yonhap said in a message the organization "Amnesty International.
At the farm prisoners had to drink a herbal potion hallucinogenic effects that induced in most other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners have not survived.
On the international pressure is about a thousand people who were released.
The tenant of Bakal: The poels heat, he signed a higher rent.
An elderly man imposing came out through the door of the centre of the company's Byty RPG "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments to rent in the Czech Republic.
He wore under his arm a record with three new leases for three apartments: hers, his daughter and his son who is in the process of serving a sentence.
The deregulation has increased the rent in these three people.
Instead of paying 3,500 the son will from next year for a flat 2 + 1 second class 4,100 kroons.
"And there was no hot water and heating works on solid fuel," pointing the finger on the new contract of his son, the man who has signing authority.
"But I signed when even" he explains to -year-old angry and half resigned.
The civic association four-bedroom BytyOKD.cz who has described the nouelles rental terms as "immoral and indecent," advises tenants not to sign and wait until 7 December, the date on which will be published a notice to explain the methodology to claim.
But the man reacts to it by a hand gesture.
"One said it, the other says something else" in wielding eyebrows.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, which is expected most of the apartment in the Czech Republic whose rents do not correspond to the market price.
Aktualne.cz has therefore decided to visit the "laboratory".
The waiting room of rocket-propelled grenades in the street Havirovska is one of four of the Ostrava region and it is already full on Tuesday at 09: 00 in the morning.
Just beside the door is a guard for a security company with a device to call customers.
A special button, "rent 2011," is lit on the touch screen.
A single pressure and a paper with a number of the device.
You don't have the time to read your number "157" that your number is already beginning to illuminate on the big screen in the www.ottawahospital.on.ca waiting-room.
In a split second it's your turn.
After a brief moment, an old couple comes to learn about the rent, but the new rent do not appear to relate to people in the waiting room.
The majority of people came to address common problems as everywhere - application of repairs, insurance and other events.
In the Ostrava region, people from more than 44,000 portfolio four-bedroom RPGs receive the e-mails with the new lease agreements in their box to the letters for about mid-November.
RPG Byty their proposed rent increases of 15 to 38 percent.
Special window to the new rent is open to the public since November 18.
"he works for nearly a week, it is still in the trial" responds, after a moment's hesitation, the woman behind the wicket when the client is presented as a journalist.
The déragulation and former four-bedroom Bakal miners are a very sensitive local issue.
The Vice-President of parliament and from the Ostrava region Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats in reported fairly supported before the elections, and it is now the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor.".
"They didn't even changed a could... No plate in wc, relieves in introducing the man mentioned.
However, it is, according to employees, pensioners who come to be sure that they will receive a rebate on the new price of rent if they sign now as promised rocket-propelled grenades in a special offer.
It is a rebate half the amount of rent that will receive the other loctaires who have signed their new contract by December 15.
But the wicket "deregulation" of the street Havirovaska really isn't overwhelmed by the questions.
"Of the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came to rent," said an employee at the box office.
And yet RPG rate both on its website that in the windows of individual talks on rents when it is necessary.
If the two sides cannot agree on the rent is an independent tribunal, which will make the decision.
"It is not threats but only to inform on the unique way to act legally and legitimate," said RPG on its Web site.
"Here nobody will go to court" think one of the employees Byty RPG and the man in the street in the centre of customer gives him reason.
"I have 13,000 kronor retirement and I have 5,000 kroner to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he said.
The employee feels suddenly uncomfortable.
"We will see.".
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and therefore the people expect," she said.
The regulation of rents ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, well, the current rents do not always reach the level necessary for the maintenance of the funds for housing," said Pavel Klimes, director of the company's residential portfolio RPG Byty, that it is precisely the negligence of the funds for housing that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was with rents invest in apartments 4 billion in four years to 2011 has 2014 it should be 5.2 billion.
The big screen hung from the ceiling in front of upholstered chairs in the waiting room of the Havirosvka street, repeat some information in red.
"The rent increase in 2011 is 15 percent and no less than 31200 apartments or more than 90 percent of the apartments RPGs.".
"And this will always more when CZK the m ² per month," said the screen.
The increase of 38 percent is that 400 apartments of the portfolio of RPG.
"In such cases, it is an increase of a very low 19.66 m ² Czech crowns," said RPG.
The next year the rent will remain the same for 2,600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a gradual but radical increase on 4 to 8 years.
She added other commitments: all the money from the increase in rents (see graph) went to the apartments in the form of heating economies - new windows and heating.
Those who signed the agreement on the rent increase have priority.
The nursery school is part, too, offices have understood the architects.
Avriopoint the administrative building of Brno is the new headquarters Arch. Design.
No one would have expected that it is also home to a mini-tennis nursery school with all it takes - coloured walls, furniture, toys, imaginative and finally a miniature games on the terrace.
Since October last year, can make children of employees of Arch. design.
The company's projets-architectonique Arch. Design. whose workshops have produced a large number of construction in Brno, has fathered her mini nursery school of business since the early drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially the age to have children and it was important that women architects and project leaders can quickly return to work.
At the same time that labor agreements in time declined, the nursery school is a bonus offered to its employees by Arch. Design. in the context of his social program.
The builders and architects have the opportunity to combine a job taking care for children.
These are the employees of Arch.Design.eux-mêmes who have imagined this nursery school and with the support of the direction they were able to obtain an allocation of the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-tennis nursery school is funded by the European Social Fund through the operational programme of human resources and budget of the state of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the allocation of funding ($2.8 mil.de Czech crowns). They were able to buy equipment and appliances and after two years to ensure a skilled workforce and road.
After the use of the allocation of funding (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini-tennis nursery school on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and it's Economy rating that helped to make the staffing request.
The care for children is provided by qualified staff, all day a nurse and a schoolteacher mother of caring for infants. children can go to nursery school without age limit but they have more than three anspour most.
As it is a "mini nursery school" there can be no more than 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there is more to replace.
The operation of the school is responsive to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use this school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although it is agise of a caring individual and education, the program of the mini-tennis nursery school is comparable to that for pre-school education.
The children are no play but a quality education is also assured - from the beginning to prepare the test-beds school that teaches English.
The class is equipped not only of toys and games imaginative but also a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates an environment friendly and positive.
Parents can at any time control their child and don't have the stress of a delay to pick up children in a school away from the workplace for parents.
The parents use their time in the most productive.
It is not surprising that creates a natural relationship of loyalty between employee and employer.
Arch.Design.s' is listed among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees who are friendly to the family and through this program reinforces the marketing of HRNO.
The house still fascinates bone after 100 years. Take a look in the interiors of Gaudi.
The roof looks like the back of a sauria pre-historic, the stairs to a dinosaur spine and balconies to fish workers open.
And so is the home Casa Battlo in Barcelona architect Antoni Gaudi.
Because of its organic forms, the house has received from the local nickname House in bone.
Forms organic, wild colors, unusual use of stone, tile fragments and mosaîque facade, reminiscent of scales and all these curves, everything ypique is for Art Nouveau of Antoni Gaudi.
The front facade of the house held its lines of dream, its colours and textures pleasant reminiscent of nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation we see the geometry, the pace and sequencing thought with precision.
On the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit so that the impression of brilliance of colour is strengthened.
The roll tarp assemblies and twisting forms also appears in the domestic with the same measure.
The copy in waves the wood window frames, decorative railing, doors, the oeilleton and the lamellae.
The Battlo house that stands in the neighborhood of Eixample in the market street Passeig de Gratia at number. 43, is born out of the construction of a house in 1877 the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction is made for two years and the house completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, initially insisted on the demolition of the 54-year-old building and the construction of another new but quickly accepted the idea of Gaudi reconstruction unusual and better market.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multiple-residence house was not thought by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol was working with him.
It is precisely on its project that are born decorations for an apartment of representation of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaîque to the facade.
For the facade also worked other artists and creators.
The joint work plans for the house Casa Battlo began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol has been involved in the construction of the house Gaudi's Casa Mila and the Park Guell in which there are other works of Gaudi.
The premises have dubbed the house just after his hot-dipped finish because of its organic forms "meat-and-bone-meal in the House.".
Others, having regard to the specific mechanism of opening windows called it "the house that decaying.".
It said that at the top of the building there is a sword similar to that of Saint George, the patron saint of Catalonia.
Other elements of sculpture construction contain hidden religious grounds.
Gaudi was thought to house a single system in his time central heating, ventilation with vents and chimneys characteristic.
Their incline of 45 degrees seems bizarre.
During the creation Gaudi has not complied with the directives of construction of then and has not left hinder by them.
At the start of construction he got from the city the building permit, knowing, of course that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that during the two years after finishing the city council was horrified and requested changes.
It does not liked, for example, the City Council members that the pillars of the empiettent building on the sidewalk public.
There was never change, but, instead, just 15 days after the appeal of the city Josep Battlo asked (and obtained satisfaction) approval to rent the top two floors.
The owner moved to lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common show and the third a room and a private party at the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The full house of six-story is shared by a staircase by which you can access to a roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi worked the modern concept of liaison spaces.
The common area can be traced completely by opening the doors of the shows and the high society can communicate comfortably or well be limited private space for talks more intimate.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi facades also received new toîture not a traditional and two floors.
The game of Gaudi with light is also impressive, white and blue glass tiles with which the courtyard is decorated with lights and wells.
The game in two colors gives a maximum of light on all floors of the house.
It was enough simply to bet on the principle that the white reflecting more than the dark instead absorbs the sun's rays.
The house Casa Battlo which has been recorded in 2005 in the Unesco World Heritage perhaps visited by each.
On the first floor of the house is the apartment the more spacious and jewel-like more accessible to the public.
The owners have decided to take this step in 2002 to mark the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued visits because they found that it is a lucrative business and they have expanded the scope of the common spaces and visits to the attic including roof terraces.
The ticket of entry to the monument is not really expensive and costs 16.50 euros; students, pensioners, groups and tourist card holders have a 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the price of entry into the other buildings in the city of Gaudi.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of home with turrets its fantastic, you have to quickly find a comrade among residents of the building and visit the house.
How to choose a mattress and a sommier: the women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatious framework, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for the lie-in, so the mattress and the sommier provides a real basis for a good read.
They must of course be complete smoothly to appeal to a specific user.
During the choices are critical, several things: the weight, size, age, health status and sex of the owner.
The type of procedure which will put the mattress and the sommier is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where you can't sleep continuously-published latex mattresses are not suitable because they are "hot" softly.
They have, moreover, a weight above the standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they do not have enough ventilation channels in the heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid plate, they retain moisture. In the mould can also be formed.
The habit is also crucial in the election.
Anyone who passes the clear time abroad, where it uses frequently mattresses very thick with a rammollissante layer, gets hardly well on a surface low and hard.
"This is as well as all hokeyistes returning from NHL complain that they can't sleep there.".
"For their shoulders tired, feet and coasts, they need mattresses with a rammollisante layer of foam lazy.".
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a disorder of the nervous system that therefore assume" wrong information "joints and skin," said Sylva Adamczikova who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That is why it was a few years the mattress with foam lazy won the hokeyistes as well as other customers.
"Today everything works well, Tempur Magnifex Italian, Czech but also the Tropico have appropriate mattresses.
You don't need to be a guy NHL to assess a foam lazy.
This "miracle" works simply.
It maximizes its rigidity and his form in the heat absorbed or adjusts to the warmth of your body.
There is pressure on you and you don't you return at night and after a difficult game.
You're sleeping just better.
The foam lazy also functions as a protection against the esquarres.
For the choice of the mattress depending on your size, add the length of the feet, or about 21 / 34 cm.
A man and a woman of a size of 180cm are therefore in need of a bed of 210 / 220 3cm.
The minimum width for each for a bed to two places should be 90 cm in just 180 cm.
For the beds in a single place, singles by example, it is recommended that you take at least 120 / 140 cm.
It is convenient in case of a visit.
"However, it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you're lying on the back you should ask the hands comfortably with elbows slightly folded. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Bourreliers-matelassiers designers and dedicated for several years to the problem of a healthy sleep and ergonomics furniture and taught in special schools.
For a bed with two places each needs its own sommier and mattress, so attention, however, for the achât to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will continue to climb the sommier at different heights and it is not feasible on all executives in bed.
The mattress foam should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the mattress springs at least 15 cm, it will be for the layer of form and ventilation at least three inches.
"In touch or sitting on the mattress you do not feel the springs," warns Héléna Prokopova.
Every mattress calls for a kind of determined sommier.
The lit-sommier, when the mattress and mattress are united like Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattress aèrent is very badly; we must not wash, which is commonly auhourd'.
And as for the night you perspire normally 0.2 to 0.75 the sweat it is clear that after 5 / 7 years, the mattress starts to recall a great (and clogged) screens.
For this, specialists refuse to advertise on a life of 25 years for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
But just to her but.
And for that a board of experience on the part of sellers: for a mattress of 120 / 140cm, to give up the surface of the mattress, hygiene or washing but add rather a cushion of protection as may easily remove and wash.
And even if these days it is common to produce coatings with zipping across the whole, that is to say that after the opening was both sides (for washing and the size of the washing machine is very important!) or manipulation for large models (and for a single person) becomes when cut a fight between a light and a heavy weight on a ring.
You have a plate in your bed rigid-hull instead of a sommier?
Never!
At the maximum for a bed for the visitors for a single night.
However the do (if there is no ventilation holes) and use the mattress springs with a minimum height of centimeters with springs in packets of Germany (Taschenfederken) and a layer of ventilation.
A mattress in polyurethane should not be part of a bed of this type.
For the box slats to unique position with 14 / 18 slats, latex mattresses pre-IPO or sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut), are the ideal, but it will be better for you to have a mattress with more slats, 28 and above, where the slats are doubled in the bottom part of the kidneys and that it is possible to regulate the rigidity.
For the mattress at several positions don't take mattress springs because it does not respond to changes in position.
Alongside the slats of power-saving rigidities--the can also install what's known as a cradle of shoulder.
It is a special liaison lamellae to push even tilt the lamella Dungeness shoulder to "fit in" well.
For men who have "the shoulders as wide as the back," it is really an important thing.
This thing is already being considered by the manufacturers of mattresses to the "male" began to use a rammollissante zone in the shoulders.
But they also believe women - they offer a more soft-serve surface at the hips.
For the client more difficult there are box wings or platelets with what we call a multiforce suspension.
The pressure is disseminates in more points and diinue tension.
But of course, attention, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and inflated air mattresses and T-bill) on sommier, the "more" is involved is removed.
The basic rule is a pillow quite simple: the pillow must support the head and park-and-ride must deliver only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulder to rest.
The size recommended is 50X60 3cm that the Norse by example prefer.
When is lying on the side, the pillow to upgrade (with the cradle of sommier the shoulder or rammollie area in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
The modern mattresses still have something in common with the first to basis of straw and herbs.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also the organic mattresses.
The raw materials from pétrôle, from which manufactures polyurethane, are replaced by natural oils such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use the soybeans.
"The qualifier Bio for mattresses means that the heart is made based on natural products," said Petr vasicek of society Tropico More.
The natural materials are also used for coating mattresses; one of the first was the aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules fragrance-free who develop the forest or lavender.
There are differences between the man and woman.
While the plant extract birch for the mattress surface absorbs heat and gets cold the body, "cools" the man, coatings "heat" women.
The extract of red pepper accelerates the blood circulation and is therefore hotter for the weaker sex.
The current favourite?
The mattress made from cold foam (she has more pores with a cell structure disturbed more sleep-related than the standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities gives cold foam mattresses polyzones who know precisely where the head, the lower back and feet.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7,000 kroner and more.
Those who are characterized by their parameters for health have less of VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, it is Gumotex who has reached the first place.
Economiser for the mattress and the sommier is not simple.
We may from time to time in the framework of special actions on the part of manufacturers or producers two mattresses for the price of one.
As such the company Magniflex mattresses Duofreeze which offers with foam to memory Memory stitched the coating to 11990 kronor.
We can obviously take the second free of charge.
The era of viscoelastic foam lazy or with a cell structure open and a large thickness was launched with the cosmic "Tempur at a pace.".
It started as a because for NASA astronauts suffered at the start of the huge load factors.
The Tempur rammollit is in the heat and hardens, instead, to the cold.
It fits perfectly in human body warm and distributes an optimum pressure.
It is to this ideal against evil slept and for an increase of comfort during sleep.
The viscoelastic foam is used not only for the mattress but also for the health products, such as special air-bag for feet that relieve the legs and the venous system.
The Czech manufacturers use for example the foam EucathermC or Twinsaver or the same type.
The devices to track people are increasingly demanded by parents who want to monitor their children.
The fear for their child gets more and more people to think about the monitor through a GPS.
The system, set up early to search cars can also be used to trace the movement of people and help in some cases as example by the small Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is now as big as a box of matches but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of the small Anicka has moved a large number of people and they have begun to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to confuse their privacy.
"We are trying to say to all that he is not spying but just another way to reduce the likelihood that there is another tragedy," said Petr Pilin of society MAcro Weil which is one of the providers of tracing devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of a person who is not aware of, but I have not yet met with such cases.".
"The majority of people are really customers who buy the product for security reasons, Pilin added.
According to him children should always know for what purpose is used "the box" and how to use in case of emergency.
The psychologist for children, Dana Bockova, attracts the attention that if the child did not want to wear on him something of this type, he mon4cl.
"And even the smallest can show great creativity when it comes to express get rid of something when they don't want to be under control.".
"The phones, which can be cut as these devices tracing, have already prompted parents to long expectations," says Bockova.
According to it, the fact that this type of device can help in case of aggression is very questionable.
"If it is a kidnapping prepared, the author will do everything so that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate him.".
"Currently, it is the phone.".
"From that will develop the tracing equipment, they (criminals) are going to look for them too because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign.".
"In such cases the criminals will always be ahead of the police," said the psychologist.
She admits that such devices can help during an assault not prepared by a paedophile.
According to Robert Cech of society KIs Monitoring, which proposes tracing services both for cars and people, says that to have this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of a assault.
"The device can be parameterized source area in such a way that it is in regular trading after a specified period.".
"In the case where the device is destroyed, there remains the last position of the person concerned.".
"The more expensive devices also have a inclinometers which immediately indicates the position of the person who slipped and found himself in an extended position without moving," said Cech.
According to him the so-called smart phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after formatted with a pro special.
The problem of current tracing systems is that it was either a device similar to those deals in pendant the size of a box of matches to smaller telephone.
You can always lose.
According to the Pilina company Macro Weil, which is why the tests are being conducted to make devices that resemble common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the would-be attacker will not recognize the tracing device.".
"Either he will report after a certain time, which has given the police a little more time," he said.
What the tracing device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, he utilisiera always the same technology to make cars.
It is a combination of acquisition systems a position via GPS (which is commonly used in autonavigation) and a mobile phone service which alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The military has so many in-box assortment it could make the turn of the Czech Republic with. But it can take two years.
The army bought for 445 km of in-box used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defence had purchased 224 km.
The military has therefore reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the in-box is two to four years.
The army has bought in-box assortment to the public limited company STV Group for 40 million kronor.
The General Staff was given as the reason for the achât a huge amount of in-box assortment at MF DNES that the soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the multi-licenced reserve calculations made by the choreographed of the army, that MF DNES contacted, it is clear that even the generals, officers with a command, secretaries or household staff should have an annual exercise to explosives.
Alexander Vondra, Minister for Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of in-box assortment.
At this distance corresponds 25 000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the army reserves could provide for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it is true that for training base of each new professionals it is sufficient for the more than 2 m in-box assortment, as the experts say, this means that the military with his new purchase said - with the use of special units and engineering - reservations for 225 years mentioned.
Yet the soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade have recently complained to the Minister Vondra they have almost no ammunition for their guns and shooting sessions are limited because of money.
On the lack of underwear do not talk.
"And I don't take myself if they buy in such a large quantity of in-box assortment.".
"And it's their decision and they really know what they are doing.".
"to the military is a good customer that we are working as traders to settle," said the commercial director of STV Group Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, argued the achât hundreds of miles of in-box assortment by the fact that the military will have these "ammunition" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group reported, however, only four years of life of the in-box assortment and choreographed of the police and the army just two years.
"If they are stored in the depots, it can go up to four years," said one who doesn't want his name to be published in the criticism of the military.
The period of life past, each ammunition must be tested to see if it is clean and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
These tests are not free and cost money.
The other argument is a discount due to the amount to 445 km of cordeux assortment.
"They cost 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km," said the spokesman Pejsek who is the performer of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of in-box assortment choreographed of the police to neutralize the ammunition of the second world war or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed the 1,500 meters.
And the police order always only the quantity of ammunition to be used before the end of their life.
This has been established for reasons of safety of choreographed and to be able to obtain more flexible types of in-box assortment more modern and more reliable.
the Ministry of Defence now has big problems for the circumvention of dozens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, focus on the Rhine.
What expected in a few years the Czech army that MF DNES contacted: neutralize hundreds of miles of old in-box assortment that it buys today "on the cheap.".
Until today I takes advantage of contacts that I obtained through the competition.
The sale under franchise his hotel has helped Lukas Pytloun to the winner of the competition for best individual Entrepreneur.
The winner of the competition for best individual Contractor for the past year has been Lukas Pytloun, 42-year 28 years.
His adventure toward the success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun loved to travel.
And abroad, he realized that he was missing a Libérec web-hosting site quality at a reasonable price.
In his savings on what he had earned when he was working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building 5 four-bedroom half demolished.
Knowing he was still a student in third year of higher education, it was a brave action.
"The relationship between quality and price of accommodation in our region made me want to do something," said Lucas Pytloun.
He began has rented the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
He reinvests earnings in the building it transformed in pension with 54 beds.
Since that time, his action of contractor allowed it to open at Libérec 4, Greek-style two restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable to them was until recently the Pytloun four-star design hotel.
This year he got another of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other candidates to the franchise Pytloun hotels have shown," the No. 1 entrepreneurs of the past year.
"And for the sale of the licence for the operation of a hotel on a large scale the victory in the competition of the entrepreneur of the year has served," said Pytloun with recognition.
The victory brought him more popularity and be known to Libérec and its surroundings.
"The people I recognized in the streets, often welcomed me and, I must say, that it was very nice," he said.
It recommends the participation in the competition to all those who strive to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He said he uses up to now his contacts and knowledge that he would not have been able to obtain another way.
"With those I met with the competition I've started to trade relations on a regular basis.
According to him, the notoriety linked to success has also had an impact on employees.
And it has about 70.
"I observed among them especially loyalty and pride to be engaged in something that has been generally acknowledged.".
"This is not, by far, the only outcome of my work, but the result of a good job of all of us together.
"Only my name is being pushed forward," said Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory rpidement was replaced by the effects of the crisis.
With the goal of earning Farmet has the worst moments behind.
Anyone who came to seek the price to Slovansky dum for first place in the competition for the Firme of the year organised by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury has rewarded the efforts with which he has transformed a tool-making workshop in Ceska Skalice in a firm to the turnover of 100 million kroner.
"I can say that the reward has encouraged not only me and my staff also has increased our self-confidence to combat competition," said today the winner of the competition last year.
At the beginning of the history of the company Farmet there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state has proposed to the father of Karel Zdrasky to rent a little shop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the Communists, he did not hesitate long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and has created a company with a few comrades in the entourage of his father for the manufacture of plastic tubs.
Not very long after they have begun to specialize in the presses for vegetable oil.
It is now after 18 years the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company has been known even in the lay audience after the success achieved in the competition through the media.
"Not only are our customers have started to really understand the mark Farmet but also foreign partners who have begun to realize that they were collaborating with a company that has received the most success in its country of origin," said Karel Zdarsky.
But the last year and has not gone to Farmet ldans only the euphoria of victory.
The evaluation of the company had been made from the economic results of 2008 in part of 2009.
And in 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machinery.
During the height of the crisis, which has not really hit the citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and starting to limit their achâts new materials and technologies.
"We don't have escaped to this situation.".
"The turnover figures fell 40 percent were, and we limit our production and even dismiss," said Karel Zdarsky.
A sustainable society should know that from time to time to take unpopular measures.
But they have handled the situation correctly and have kept the results clients even if they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However at Farmet, they have continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
"We built with endowments a training center and research, have strengthened the presentation of the company salons-expositions in international and won major awards in the national exhibitions," said Zdarsky.
All we suggests that the crisis is behind them.
The figures of 2007,3 back and with them the number of employees.
"In the new winner I hope this good feeling of winning, but in a calm atmosphere," said Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation, which abolishes mindless regulations.
The investigation into the Absurdité of the year is for the fourth time a khaki-clad part of the business.
Some absurd regulations have been removed.
The little glorious winner of this year of the survey on the Absurdité of the year has been the obligation to bring in the offices of the documents that officials can get on-line.
More than one-third of 4,000 voters voted for it.
For example, the administrations of Social Affairs asked an extract of the Register of Commerce while the official can get in two mouse clicks.
that change with the investigation.
"The Czech administration of social insurance not request more the extract from a register of commerce for the insurance payments," said Jana Buranova, spokeswoman for the Administration of the Czech Social Insurance (CSSZ).
To describe all regulations and decrees that companies and contractors must fill in the Czech Republic and to remove those who are absurd is the meaning of this contest of the Absurdité of the year.
This investigation is still this year for the fourth time a part of the khaki-clad organized by Hospodarske noviny affairs and has an even greater popularity.
If last year 3000 voters occurred, it is at least 4,000 this year who have made their voices heard.
And not surprisingly, there are the most diverse country in our legal obligations that do that curb the company, and, thus, more and more.
"We are perhaps the number of documents for tax returns to the first places in the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and medium-sized businesses and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic.
The simplification of the entrepreneurial activity becomes a goal proclaimed of all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the world the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank the Czech Republic is in the 74 th place as regards the conditions for the company, or eight seats compared to last year.
The competition of the Absurdité of the year has been put in place for the first time in 2006, and continues each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can make each year of administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to late September, the last time before the close of the competition.
To account he ya the website www.firmaroku.cz. Second, the organiser of the competition chooses seven candidates for the "antiprix" and let the public vote during the month of October on the site www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdité who received the largest number of votes is declared the winner.
Up to the last survey last year, it is a 100, or more exactly euro105 regulations and order who have lost their sense of existence.
The remarks are sent by entrepreneurs but also the professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, therefore among the nominees is for example the requirement that the maintenance vehicle highways and expressways pay tolls, or that contractors with 20 employees, repeignent two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of the seven proposals is published on the website of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition, which begins in early November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a stunt involving regular figures from political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for small and medium-sized businesses in the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the culmination of the competition.
"The economic prosperity cannot function when the state puts âtons in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this my goal is to remove every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the company," said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove the absurd order is not a complete waste of time.
In 2007, which is not the people liked was the obligation of entrepreneurs to declare three days before the office for the individual enterprise to the location of the company, plans to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a booth.
This requirement was abolished with the ammendement of the Act on the individual enterprise.
The second requirement ctk the most in 2007, which was to report to the Bureau of a trip to a foreign employee on 30 days, has been removed with the text of the so-called green card.
And everything is ok until the third session of the competition.
The Absurdité of the year 2009 was the order for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two machine scales.
That has been changed by order of the Ministry of Health the year dernière-l' obligation to have a refrigerator has been removed.
A new category reward firms socially responsible.
Have assessed ecological projects, humanitarian, training or sports.
The novelty of this year's competition of Hospodarske Noviny, which already exists for 5 years, is the category known as the Firme Head of the year 2010.
The onjectif of this competition is to support the company reasonable and fair.
"We want to support companies that monitor the impact of their business on the environment and lead a socially responsible activity," said Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, Vodafone, which is the guarantor and proponent of this competition, as in the case of the competition for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this subcategory of the competition for the firm of the year 2010, organized by the firm Vodafone, have registered companies that do not have success with a single long-term goal for the company.
The adventure of each is full of inspirations and an independent section would be to edit.
While the focus of their business is different from one another we can consider their supporting activity and anticipation as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, it concerns people with disabilities and personal problems or health of their employees.
Among the 14 finalists for the Czech Republic is not the pro company of Prague And Netera who supports the creation of informal sports teams of employees who then participate in number of tournaments in various sporting disciplines.
Another example of firm responsible for the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo which is for 17 years the main contributor to the fund, which sponsors the children with disabilities.
In caring employees with health problems are still 138-year-old The paper manufacturing plant of Podebrad which employs more than 70 percent, and for that, won the title of the firm responsible for the region of central Bohemia and which has placed third in the region in the competition of the Firme of the year organised by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, which won for introducing more flexible work schedules and even dropped up to 35 hours per week on average, and this, without, hemodilution, a reduction in wages.
The Board déverné the title because it achête in the Czech manufacturers, supports a citizen activity in the close and is concerned about the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible for our business and our administration have the least impact on the environment," said Miluse Ryznarova, the executive director of the company.
Enlogit IT company responsible for the region of Usti also think the health of its employees and has put in place for each laptop a chair and an ergonomic keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the services of catering to local protected plant for its actions.
"We support the foundation The man in the shadows that helps the local Roma community," said Ondrej Suchy the representative of the company.
At the very last row, also for its activities, a corporation of Lavage and cleaning the region of Karlovy Vary, who participates in the pensions of its employees in the form of bonuses above the standards.
"In our society we are contributing to food, transportation, the increase of qualifications and leisure," said Joseph Strapac of the construction company bruntal Czasch, who Moravia-Silesia for the region.
were automatically enrolled in the class society Head, all regional finalists for the competition of the Firme of the year of Vodaphone, who had responded to the questionnaires attached document for registration and had returned to the organizer before the August 15.
The answers wrong or incomplete in the questionnaire were pulled out of the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the firms vying did not respond to questions, they could not participate in the competition for the firm responsible but were not disqualified from the competition" primary "Firme of the year of Vodaphone.".
"The independent registrations are not possible because it is a sub-category of the main competition of the Firme of the year," said Karel Goldman of the agency organising Bison & Rose.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, police have made arrests during a public competition
In the building of the Fund for the Lands in Plzen, anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The detectives have handcuffed to the local contractor and real estate dealer Lubos. G.
He was trying to manipulate precisely a public tender for the settlement of a claim of restitution in such a way that the land be secured by a candidate determined.
He had to pay to Lubos G. half a million kronor.
"For the moment I can only confirm that police continue a person for insider trading in a bidding process and a public zhoukan.". said to the newspaper Pravo the head of the prosecution of Plzen Antonie Zelena, knowing that it is illegal to provide more explanation because the investigation is ongoing.
The officers released after 24 hours this 42-year 46 years in freedom.
To find out how it could affect a public competition, we can only speculate with regard to the little official information.
In a matter of Pravo, the spokesman of the Land Fund Lubomira Cerna said that the police had actually made an arrest in Plzen on a separate place of work, and this, in the open competition.
"It was a client and in any case of an employee, she said.
The public competition according to Cerna was as true name "Call to propose rights for the transfer of land under the Act on the land" and is put in place when occur several candidates beneficiaries of law.
"These people propose, as part of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to reframe that must be resolved before being announced the value of the land.".
"According to the rights proposed a buy-side classification is put in place and the Fund of the Land then transferred the land to the person who suggested the rights the highest," said the spokesman of the Fund.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information on people who had registered to the appeal and as he himself is, also, a clients person as having bought a large number of rights to refunds, he had proposed to candidates in the field not to participate in the competition.
And it redeemable perhaps by the pull out.
That would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts far above the standards of the Land Fund (FdT).
It appeared in the case of the former head of FdT Vaclav Sankot criminal who was prosecuted for having edit land to which they had already edited the decision to implement a construction.
Precisely Lubos G. had obtained by example of land for the construction of public communications, specifically in place which would be built the artery of access to the industrial zone of Borske Pole.
Later he disarmament-for-aid with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far higher.
The town hall was forced to accept because otherwise it risked putting the construction at risk by a Lock-in land.
Households will pay an extra 100 kroner monthly for housing.
Households will from January pay extra not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, supplies of heating and some areas rents will also increase.
Families must therefore from January take their wallets up to 100 crowns monthly more than now.
The electricity increases of 4.6 percent, gas by almost 2 percent more expensive, in certain localities, you will have to pay up to a tenth of the supply of water and in many places the central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase of electricity for households is expected to approach 100 kronor in flat annual more than at present.
However all suppliers have reduced the price of electricity because of the sensitive development to encourage the production of renewable energy sources, including photovoltaÏques cells.
The gas is increasing moderately but of course at a time when people most need to heat and therefore have greater consumption.
You can therefore count also 100 kronor.
While electricity and gas increase throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the biggest Commons who plan the price increase.
For example households in Pardubice, Hradec Kraloce will pay from January to central heating almost 50 kronor per month, the families of Libérec will pay more than 1,000 kroner annually.
For the people of Prague prepares an increase of 9 percent for water and sanitation for the case where the city is rising rents infrastructure.
If rents do not change the Prague will pay an extra 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still among the lowest in comparison with the entire country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already higher, water and sanitation increase of 7.4 percent.
The rents will rise significantly for example in the 450 thousand rental apartments from January that is to say at the end of regulation.
For example, the company that owns Byty ICC in Usti nad Labem almost 2,500 apartments, decided an increase up to 100 percent.
Those who will not agree with the new increase in rents will be brought before the courts by the company.
Rents regulated that pay people in almost 300 thousand apartments could increase next year of 10 percent.
The Czech children saoûlent rum and in. The beer and fashion is no longer is slowly.
The in, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whisky are stolen to parents.
The watch-type beverages that are most often those who are saoûlent, which have not yet 15 years, in the hands of the doctor.
Children who are cared for at the hospital for repeat offenders are not the exception.
This is the experience of the physicians who face similar cases to admissions departments children hospitals.
"The beers or wines are no longer way because it takes time to be kalbskopf.".
"The trend is really the liquor," said for Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of the Department of Horovice children's hospital in central Bohemia.
"When they manage to steal a bottle to Dad in the cupboard, it is sometimes wisky but it is the in and vodka prevailing '.
"Vodka has the advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and not feel," said the Head of the Department.
Eva Jurinova, spokeswoman for the hospital Motol, also gave him reason.
"In general, it is a rum or the in.".
"It is now fashionable alcohol, particularly in elementary schools.".
"In some cases, it came to slivovice they have brought down the house," said Jurinova.
According to the Head of Pélikan Department, see children drunk aged 13 to 14 years in the hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Prior to working at Horovice since last year, he was at Motol where he held 10 years precisely in pediatrics where ambulances were bringing schoolchildren of the broad area completely drunk.
"A girl was hospitalized and four times
"She acommencé his career at 12 years old when she was taken with 3.5 per thousand of blood alcohol into with a mixture with the gush," described the doctor this case particularly important.
"She was at the Parc des Expositions of Holesovice to a party.".
"What is interesting is that it was not peculiar to the mother that her daughter is absent 48 hours" said surprised the Director of the Department.
It is precisely the lack of parents or their tolerance out of the ordinary about the fact that their offspring in the beverage that are the main cause of the development of the child abuse.
According to experts, it is not addictive, in the strict sense, for the children.
"Under the word alcoholic is chronic alcohol dependence of several years with all the phenomena that result but not found in children.".
"For those who use the alcohol to repeat, rather it is a back-ground socio-familial significantly unfavourable," said the Head of Pélikan Department.
According to the spokesman Jurinova, approximately 40 drunken children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the clinic of pediatrics at Motol.
Don are integrated into the stastistiques that the case with a serious illness requiring hospitalization.
The children who are drunk after emergency care brought home by parents or the police, are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, he exsite Pélikan according to three seasonal waves with which you can count: the day witches, Saint Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink out of spite after poor results is to the contrary they are celebrating the start of the holiday.".
"Of course I lived in the day witches an admission of 7 children drunk one shot," said Pélikan.
The child drunk who spent the night at the hospital in désintoxciation under medical supervision is paradoxically in a better position than the one who returned home and are suffering the aftermath of the "hangover".
The morning headaches caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients the body needs.
"They are better off for it because they spend a great evening and a gentle wake-up call, and nothing hurts.".
"They are just amazed at where they are," adds Pélikan knowing that from time to time it to spoil the mood of the patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
The transport by ambulance and hospitalized in intensive care bed can go up to tens of thousands of kronor.
"From time to time, I applied it as a means of education with these children driving their cost and how they could spend all summer in seasonal work to pay off a single evening," added Pélikan.
However, according to him, the health insurance companies in their management in decline, which should recover from parents charges related to care, do not treat children drunk.
Two planes L-159 are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two planes L-159 five in all, against which the Ministry of Defence has exchanged C-295M Casa transport aircraft, took off Tuesday for Seville in Spain where the Casa-EADS aircraft manufacturer.
It is the first time of the machines become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
They have been abroad in exercises or demonstration flights.
It is two-seaters versions of L-159T1 that were until now in service in the Czech army and were flying.
Lestrois remaining fixtures are versions of the L-159 cars.
They currently stationed in Aéro Vodochody and trade through - the Omnipol - the firm took into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defence, the departure of Vodochody aircraft is currently unknown.
"The planes L-159 cars for the exchange have been taken on planes stored for a long time without cause or additional investments to the Ministry of Defence.".
"The two-seaters T1 L-159 were traded in the state," Pravo Pejsek said.
He added that the army will not remain without two-seater because the department was signed in May 2009 with Aéro Vodochody an agreement worth $200 million kroner for the conversion of four cars L-159 unspent in two two-seaters.
The army has taken delivery of the first aircraft in July, the second scheduled for delivery to the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS is committed to introduce the aircraft in the equipment in some countries in the Alliance.
"In the contract it is clear that whoever takes the L-159 aircraft is EADS and they will be used for training pilots of NATO member countries.".
"It is therefore the case of the one that takes into account to determine how to achieve it," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a plane Casa and the purchase of three other planes to 3.5 billion kronor was endorsed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Defense Department has not launched tender and contacted directly EADS.
argumentait defence management while the exchange provides a L-159 future export abroad.
The Czech army bought to Aéro Vodochody 72 devices and uses only 24, to sell the rest.
The purchase of aircraft Casa will likely legal implications.
the European Commission has filed a complaint against the Czech defense ministry to the European Court of Justice because the planes should have been selected in a bidding process at European level and in any case by directly contacting a manufacturer.
The army has already taken delivery of three planes Casa, the latter should arrive at the airport in Prague Kbely in two weeks.
An index longer than the ring is a sign of low risk of cancer
The men who have the index longer than the ring are exposed to a lower risk of having prostate cancer.
That is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the journal Cancer.
That may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that the relative length of fingers serves simple test for prostate cancer risk, particularly for men before 60 years," said the co-author of the study Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Research on Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine what men should undergo testing for prostate cancer, particularly in combining with the genetic risk or other factors aggrâvants such as the undertake family of health, Eeles said.
During the period of 1994-2009 she has followed with his colleagues in Britain more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the index finger of his right hand, shorter than the ring.
For them and for the 19 percent of those who had the fingers of the same length, it was found the same probability of prostate cancer.
In the case of those who had the index longer than the ring the risk is, however, dropped to 33 percent, for men before 60 years the reduction of risk has reached 87 percent.
The length of two fingers cited - trained during the prenatal period - include different levels of sex hormones facing the child in the womb.
A less testosterone is an index longer.
Previous research had shown that it is precisely the testosterone to help in the development of prostate cancer.
Vacla pprofesseur The Paces, renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said to TKC that he is aware of this study, but that he did not think, 'intention, that the relationship between the length of fingers and cancer is "completely demonstrated.".

The U.S. military has sent in Afghnistan a new "smart" weapon, known only under the code name XM-25.
The generals think that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and "will change the game" to their advantage.
The new weapon is like a 57-mm specific super-
His projectiles are guided by laser with an accuracy of a few metres.
The 50-caliber special 25 mm ammunition for this gun and containing an explosive highly breaking, actually run as small grenades.
You can program the ammunition so that they would explode on contact with the target but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
We can therefore use it against an enemy who hides behind a barrier, a wall or a ditch.
It is not protected from above and when he falls over a deadly rain of shards of steel, this may put him out of combat.
According to Richard Audette who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle infantry weapon is the first that uses technology "smart".
"The soldier is used mainly in such a way that he found the target, he sends a laser beam which determines the distance, gets a specific target, according to which he corrects his referred site and based on the trigger.
"Let's say you referred to 543 meters.".
"When you ▪ the trigger, the gun is responsible and draws to the distance of 543 yards plus or minus 1, 2, 3 feet," said Audette.
400 jobs off-shored
The group Fujitsu relocates its subsidiary of Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
The next year in July, 400 staff will transfer to Astro Park their place of work that is currently in the office building of the Place Mareinbader in the region of Bad Homburg.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its branch of Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As the giant said Wednesday that specializes in the manufacture and maintenance of computers, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located so far on the place Marienbader in the town of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a sprawling complex of offices located on the street Lyoner Straße Niederrad headquarters in Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesman said that in the medium term, the group should consolidate 100 other jobs still scattered up here in the region.
The supply of rental was extremely attractive. In addition, the offices to open area of Astro Park better suited to the method of work colleagues.
In Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was just tenant.
The general manager, Bernd Wagner, said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location with a remarkable infrastructure.".
He says the connection to the airport is of great importance to a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a large business inside the region sparked yesterday the joy of disappointment winners and losers.
The head of the Economic Affairs of the City of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again a "global actor" had been captured.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith on the location.".
Fujitsu is in the city and its implementation is a major boost to Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Greens), regrets the decision of Fujitsu.
Management has very soon informed the municipality of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our assistance to this company," said Mr. Korwisi.
However, the friendly relations would not have been able to change the difficulties of the computer maker against the owner of the building of the Marienbader Place.
In the end, the economic reasons would have been decisive.
The task now is to avoid a place where exceptional remains vacant for long.
"I hope that the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
A decade ago, the building of the Place of the City Hall, used by the company Fujitsu and the nearby "vertical" small, as well as the rest of the building of the Place Marienbad, were part of the controversial building project of the spa.
The product of a joint project of the Town and a developer of private projects, a new entrance to the city was created between the station and City Hall. It sparked widespread criticism, not only because of the impressive development surfaces that were once part of parking lot, but also because of the height of buildings.
In 2001, the company's rating and investment advice, Feri, the maker of computers for distribution systems of travel, Start Amadeus, as well as computer maker Fujitsu, at the time still associated with Siemens, have moved into buildings.
In 2006, The German group of specialized Frankfurt-based Immobilien-Chancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the property fund Morgan Stanley. A year later, these buildings have been sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The group Fujitsu headquartered in Tokyo sees itself as the third largest provider of computer products in the world.
For example, it puts computers and servers to businesses and also provides the essential service.
His branch established in the Rhine-Main area, is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu is certainly much more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle at Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries in this site is Fujitsu Services and a company named SRT.
For this, 7,000 square metres took in rental in the building Astro Park.
The old complex of 20 years, whose name recalls its plan star-shaped, is home to the headquarters of the Confederation of electronic and electrical engineering industry.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is finding it increasingly difficult.
The Internet service provider Amazon has expelled from its servers the site specializing in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude is perhaps political pressures suffered after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
Wikileaks founder Mr. Assange, is apparently in England.
In the United States, the site Wikileaks is attacked with still more force.
The group of cyber-activistes "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted up here in America and is now seeking a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, the prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman, called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And the Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is probably in Britain, according to information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks ruled out of the server Amazon."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom," said Wednesday local time (cyber-activistes) to the origin of the revelations via the Twitter social network.
Shortly before, the e-business, Amazon, had removed the documents to Wikileaks its servers.
Following the release of secret diplomatic notes, the cyber-activistes have used the Amazon Web Services (AWS) in order to reach the largest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Terrific, our dollars are now spent on caring for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a challenge to Amazon, "they should stop selling books.".
The CNN television, citing the office of Mr Liebermann, reported that Amazon has banned Wikileaks to use its servers after the investigation by the staff of Senator Joe Lieberman.
The chairman of the Senate committee for the protection of the territory had threatened the site Amazon to orchestrate a boycott against her, said, "the British newspaper The Guardian.".
"I would have liked that Amazon is taking this step earlier in the previous publications by Wikileaks classified information," said the senator.
At the same time, Mr. Liebermann called on other nations to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks is illegally, ruthless and monstrous. In doing so, it puts our national security in danger and risk the lives around the world," according to a statement from the independent senators.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, be it American or foreign, should help Wikileaks to disseminate the content of the stolen documents."
Wikileaks founder Mr Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on the list of people wanted by Interpol.
According to information released by the London newspaper "The Independent newspaper," the 39-year-old Australian lives in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where it was found.
The cyber-activiste has consistently qualified intrigue orchestrated by his critics the proceedings against her by Sweden.
The spokesman of Wikileaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, said in London that threats were made against the site.
"Calls have even been launched for the murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange fears for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
This is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson was responding clearly to the statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the leaders of the revelations made by Wikileaks should be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, the adviser to the Head of Government Mr. stephen Harper said on television, clearly ironically, that Mr Assange should "be killed" and that Mr Obama could "use a Drone".
Meanwhile, a controversy has triggered between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, a spokesman for the US president, Barack Obama, called it "ridiculous and absurd" the fact that Mr. assange has demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if it was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and released recently, to engage in espionage.
"I don't know exactly why we must address the opinion of an individual owner of a Web site," says Mr Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the assertions of a website."
The U.S. government is now completely to the test the protection of databases.
According to a statement from the White House, Mr Russell Travers, deputy director of the Center of the fight against terrorism, has been appointed to combat leaks.
Mr. Travers is responsible for putting in place "the necessary structural reforms" made necessary after the disclosures diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the will to verify the means by which the entire administration exchange and protects the information.
In addition, the U.S. government has announced that he wanted to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if ever they were threatened by the revelations of Wikileaks.
"We have made every effort to get in touch with them," said State Department spokesman, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of the Glace
"At the University of Bologna, Quartetto Gelato" is the confectioners of ice the best seasons of the year.
The three-day mini-orienteering organized for the future of the glaciers has been a great success and attracted visitors from across the world.
In fact, where any ice?
From Glacier and the ice machine.
The glacier, i.e. German kendziur somewhat old-fashioned ice cream manufactures, according to the rules of Italian art of ice-making.
The ice turbine-powered ice cream off the showcase chilled using a spatula, has in the wafers and then began to sell it.
To find out, we did not need to go to Anzola dell Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about the ice, cannot avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of the sorbetières founded the University of ice in 2003 so that the ice creams out of its machines meet across the Italian ideals.
The three-day mini-orienteering organized for the future of the glaciers has been a great success and attracted visitors from around the world.
It also offered special courses on the ice of chocolate and running for several days. Similarly, practical sessions are held in the froze.
In Full midlife crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others may simply to achieve their desire on the ice smooth.
This time, it is 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, Brazil to Saudi Arabia via Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of art education came from California's buff of the Slow Food movement. He wants to propose a European product quality in countries of the Glace.
Anke of Berlin is a management consultant and it wants to, after a few years, take something singular this trade nerve-wracking nerves.
Two young egyptian froze a dream to open in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian cleaning lady came because his children love Italian ice cream.
The master glacier Luciano Ferrari first explained to participants the ideal characteristics of perfect ice.
East rate-controlling not just the right flavor, but also silky the flexibility and the right consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during training the icing on the cake, the superstructure and, in general, southern Italian: "The ice is simply the best, and then it still retains a sacred dose of romance."
The first step in the production is quite simple.
Luciano pays the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilizers in a large mixer which heats up to 85 degrees through an electronic program, then cools immediately to four degrees.
He then opened a spigot installed on the machine: it is a basic white cream-coloured freshly, the foundation of all sorts of ice-melt milk.
The trainer is immediately assailed question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances stabilizing without?
How can we give free rein to the pleasure of experimentation?
Mr Luciano cautions be misled by the spirit of the time.
Anyone who speaks only of ice "made from natural ingredients," perhaps even used stabilizers: the more often a natural product, for example of guar seed flour obtained from the guar bean.
It is of course possible to make the ice without using stabilizer, only to sell it within 24 hours, otherwise it will collapse and the croquera client does nothing other than ice pellets.
Some amendments to the basic mass-production are permitted.
This becomes more exciting with flavourings.
The maestro Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that are acquired in the 10-kilometer candy or fruit from the supermarket.
In addition, there are Wood-Pulps and powder.
"suppliers will try all of you pass dozens of aromatised ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Either in revenue of fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Either in the creams made from the mass of white basis that, by adding eggs becomes a cream yellow and is, when you add the cocoa powder, the foundation of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now, all participants in the courses must move to the use of the machines to ice.
Luciano calls from time to time to make four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate and hazelnut moka, with or without eggs in the mass base with more or less vanilla flavoring or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of ice-melt fruits are also subject to the same experience.
More than fragrances, more purees of fruit: from the point of view of taste, it is not absolutely best.
The ice to hazelnuts is not necessarily the taste of the nuts, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
The ice the kiwi fruit, very popular, is made from the group, using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mix is properly the taste of an ice-cream," says Luciano.
The ice-making is a Non-GAAP exercise: if you use the purée with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar is reduced in the recipe.
An extra sugar is needed for the ice to the lemon.
Luciano presents a device with which it determines the sugar content of different types of fruit (winegrowers are used to measure the degree of Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate the calculations.
The ice-making no longer requires, as in the past, as much physical intervention.
This is not only the automatic Soviet-built machine of the mass of aid.
There is also a device in which fighting simultaneously the mixture of ice available to render it buttery and reduced to low temperatures.
In spite of all the -, minor breakdowns are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo is with of fruit puree from head to toe and implicating, and his comrades studies when control of the monster-sized mixer bowl escapes.
The maestro Luciano is of the view that an "incident that may occur during each course: this is only a matter of time."
The controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry is studying the cultivation of genetically modified plants has infiltrated the European Food Safety Authority.
That charge is now made by the group of experts Testbiotech who is regarded as an independent institute to assess the impact of biotechnology.
"This sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well informed," said Wednesday in Munich Mr. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech.
Some reports of what the president of the Group of Experts Efsa for genetically modified crops, Dr. Harry Kuiper, as well as other experts Efsa are under contract with the pressure group Ilsi.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Mr Kuiper has been instrumental in the development of Efsa testing requirements for genetically modified plants and is so clearly in a situation of conflict of interest, according to the criticism made by Mr Then.
The requirements developed correspond verbatim, by paragraphs, the positions of the pressure group Ilsi and the industry who basically would be controlled by the authorities based in Parma in Italy.
It is the second time Testbiotech that said a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking official of the Efsa recently joined without condition or without transitional period the Swiss agribusiness group Syngenta. In doing so, It has changed sides.
There is little time, even the Radio-France Central Germany Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR), revealed the existence of personal relationships between the authority of the European Union responsible for monitoring and the industrial lobby, which has aroused suspicion of both the German Federal Environmental Agency that MEPs.
However, the Efsa allows for the existence of any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that it operates all reliable data, including those of the industry as long as they are of good quality.
It does not prohibit experts working for the Efsa to establish contact with this business.
But they should make them public.
Mr Kuiper admits he works for the International Institute for life sciences (International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi) based in the United States.
The organization sees itself as a neutral forum bringing together experts who belong, among others, in the field of science, industry and policy to assess the risks of biotechnology without being in the pay of a lobby.
In this case, the independent experts such as Mr Then resent the fact that genetically modified crops are accepted without any testing in animals and food that we have not tested the impact of these plants on the environment.
"We want to know what are, for example, the impact of genetically modified maize issue in the field," says Mr Then.
The current practice is to test only proteins isolated and not the genetically modified plant, which does not obtain reliable results.
"If you do not research the risks, how can we find out about them?" asked Mr Then on an accusatory tone.
It is also the view of Mrs Angelika Hilbeck.
This scientific research since 1994 in the field of genetics and is currently working at the Polytechnic School of Zurich.
In this region as the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry tries increasingly to influence or discredit scientists criticism.
Therefore, there is barely even researchers who are not related to companies.
In the opinion of the businesses, the critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck says that "the industry control security research.".
The record of stone
Uli Gsell has provided a total 400 kilo about.
On Monday afternoon, she was standing at the train station in Stuttgart with his tube-type back.
There were d'etats.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators came and started to demolish a large part of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: Several thousand people demonstrated against the project S21, the transformation of the central train station in Stuttgart in an underground station that will cost several billion.
A large part of the wing was in ruins when the event led to the suspension of construction work.
Brisée in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
The limestone Muschelkalk (clam) of Crailsheim, a paved tender and rude poorly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr Gsell is a sculptor of 43 years living in Ostfildern.
It has provided a few fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He says with enthusiasm: "a rock modest and cheap, simple and land."
He said that in the färber to the saw, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
It is not yet known what he will do this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell too.
traces stones of Stuttgart lead to a former ammunition depot of the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen has built his empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man is trade old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition Ontario-US in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or if they disappear in the discharge," he said in his office in a mud hut, which was once a guard post.
He says he was subjected to insults and threats when in September, newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the wing north to the demolition company.
But it has been negotiating for days with opponents of the project S21.
And he explained that he could do nothing at all to oppose the demolition.
And if it does, then the most sensible thing would be to continue to use the stone.
About 200 opponents of the project S21 have subsequently won a parallélépipède stone weighing an average of 80 pounds worth between 6.50 and 14 euros.
Some keeps as a memento in just hoping to be able to make it at a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tonnes, 25 truckloads of a truck.
About half is still packed together in the forest, the rest being sold for a long time.
Propriétaires gardens, landscape gardeners, Individuals.
They came from everywhere and washed away everything that could enter the trunk and trailers.
These stones of scandal of Stuttgart turned for a long time in "Mäuerle" or limitations on the toes of herbs.
"In fact, this stone is nothing particular" Rongen said.
"absence does this policy."
He enters his car any ground, made the rounds of his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He studied law that it has dropped. Later, he began to study the biology before to look to the computer and eventually become a carrier.
And an amateur stones.
It stores 40,000 tonnes.
He amassed were treasures everywhere in Germany.
THERE says it is the largest dealer of ancient stones.
It is réfrène.
The stones are carved with sand art on the snow.
"In the past, they were part of the Marienbrücke bridge in Dresden.".
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, "he says with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
It takes the road that rides through the forest.
It shows a lot of finger: Pierre of red sand, formerly part of the train station in Karlsruhe.
And so on.
"Joli travertin."
The parallélépipède was once part of the forum of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, the travertin of Cannstatt from the prefecture of police, the reddish granite from the Cathedral of Saint Blasien, the nuvoletti from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What work, What efforts, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen think that once the stones were carved by hand and displaced palane using simple and carts drawn by oxen, it becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage was put in play."
He did not become rich, still less wealthy.
But the carrier now employs 14 people. In addition, stone cutters, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass-blower and a gardener settled in the forest.
"We are working hard, but it is gratifying," says the recycler of waste.
Soon, he will travel to Cologne.
There, too, there are rocks to save.
Fight of talent to conquer the potential top
The check- has a fierce crush.
16 students jostle to buy bread rolls to salmon, tomato sauce and blancs-mangers.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and automaker Volkswagen have invited students in design and mechanical engineering at a workshop.
In the context of a sort of competition of ideas, they must talk art about the car of the future with the developers of VW, and, by the way, know the firm "Volkswagen.
Today, many companies do not hesitate to go to hand-to-hand in the competition to find best brains and to commit, like Volkswagen, in a multi-faceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruiting graduates the most gifted as much as possible in the auditoriums before they arrive on the job market and they are courted by the other.
And since universities do not publish statements regarding the performance of their students, trying to identify exceptional talent in the context of practical projects and retain.
On the second day of the workshop in the Technical University of Brauschweig auto group softening talent.
A young lady of service of staff sharing pens, candy and cards with the logo of Volkswagen.
She talks about the timing of vocational courses and jobs students to young talents; it shows the roads for access to the compound of the group.
It is Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both sides: "Students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
"As the Volkswagen group, it can be students, a closer look serious candidates and appreciate those who come into play as a collaborator."
According to Mr. saddle, Such cooperation is unusual.
What is new is the offensive with which it seeks to attract students.
"In the past, the focus was on the project professional," says Mr Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much more bitter.
In many areas, companies can no longer recruit their colleagues by making a candidates-even on a clutch of candidates.
But they must tout their reliability and especially wooing the highly skilled workforce.
These are especially Graduates from engineering sectors that are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German engineers VDI, more than 40 000 engineers remained vacant in October.
And according to the forecasts of the VDI, the vacuum on the engineering positions is expanding again.
Roman Dykta goes to the hunt for talent for the auditing firm, KPMG, an accounting and consultancy.
He organizes events aimed at recruiting better-tasting talent, such as the KPMG-Race passenger-cruise race, a species of rallye-papier where competitors must find their way to the aid of GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year so they travel this way the United States.
Participants can only visit the subsidiaries of KPMG and the company.
Anyone who must participate are decided to advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used to search for potential top universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the batch through the passenger-cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little"
To the talent scout was Mr. Dykta, the account appears to be.
"Until today, we stayed in touch with all the people who took part last year in a similar action."
"Some of them are on the verge of completing their education and want to send their applications to our business," he said..
Outside the softening direct investment in the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are quite classic in participating in job fairs where they are engaged in hunting down the drain.
"We are trying to reach the graduates in participating in the shows."
"For example, at the show of solar technologies," said Mrs Sitha Stübe, director of human resources in Solarworld, maker of photovoltaic panels.
The company installed in Bonn employs about 1,500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe is aware of the problems related to the notes.
Currently, 35 posts are to be filled on the site of the company.
"At this time, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
"This is expensive and time-consuming," he said?
Another way to establish contact is through the university professors.
Solarworld has established a cooperation with various institutions of higher education, for example, the University of Freiburg.
"The professors suggest that the student has the opportunity to carry out vocational courses or writing his draft end of study among us."
The expensive advertising campaigns are announced in the solar specialists.
That is why the company is trying to do its advertising highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, hierarchy flat and easy communication.
"Often, a large group cannot do this," said Ms. Stübe, chief of staff.
A long time ago that money is no longer the primary role in the search for employment.
The flexible working hours, childcare or good opportunities for promotion are the other factors.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld occupies the 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The institute is a table of annual honor for German employers.
To this end, he asked the staff on their level of satisfaction with their work and its background while watching the framework conditions for employees.
The chief of staff Ms Stübe hopes that this investment will enhance the image of the company from job seekers.
"I think the candidates rely mainly to external evaluations in relation to a potential employer," she said.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer in applying a long-term strategy.
He advises clients to show more of authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means above all take internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to make attractive is going through its own staff," he said.
This is, after the jargon used in the sector, the internal strategy, i.e. the creation of the image of the employer within its own workforce.
"collaborators satisfied are the best messengers."
When dealing with its employees and that they identify with the company, they are all advertising of their employer with their friends and acquaintances.
"It is as if it was playing in an orchestra," says Mr Kriegler.
Obama puts a brake on new oil drilling
There will be no new drilling for oil in the Gulf of Mexico off the Florida coast, state of the southeastern United States, over the years to come.
The government of Washington gave a ban A ban equivalent and, finally, canceled its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remain for the time being banned.
The Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar made the announcement Wednesday.
It is the explosion in April, the drilling platform Deepwater Horizon "," which is at the root of this strict ban. It must remain in force at least for the next five years.
Faced with this accident that claimed the life to 11 employees and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and the industry, said he was willing to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Supporters of this solution to reduce U.S. reliance on foreign countries for oil supplies.
The question of who bears responsibility for the devastating oil spill in golf is not, to date, finally resolved.
The British oil group, which faces claims of several billion, is at the centre of the charges.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama must present its findings in December.
In October, the Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the freeze of drilling declared after the explosion of the platform.
As a result of this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and tougher safety instructions, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which was discredited after widespread accusations of corruption, is currently the subject of in-depth reforms.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced it would remove the lucrative tax breaks for oil and gas groups.
The players in this sector are now publicly warning that the flow of food in the Gulf would be much lower than is the case so far.
"The government's goal is to put a brake on the rapid growth of the oil and gas sector," according to the results of a survey carried out in the current audit firm BDO, before the drilling ban imposed on Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "Nobody knows what exactly will change with the regulation."
The investments made in support of new projects have been postponed until further notice, at the expense of growth.
The Ogoniland is dry-storage
The water flowing in the rivers is 151411 brown; she exudes an odor similar to that in the petrol station: Due to a leak, billions of gallons of crude oil have destroyed the Ogoniland in Nigeria.
The men live theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't watered," said the environmentalist reporters for the calm: "You today still enough mud of oil in the water lens."
The Nigerian 37 years tried to photograph a young bogged down in muddy water up to the chest, as well as drag fat that surrounds it: This scene seems almost beautiful in the glow of water the colour of the rainbow.
You can't see that the basement is full of dark-tobacco sheets of crude oil.
On the bank of the River Bodo-Jetty, Esther Badom said that, once, she collected whole-cell buckets of shrimp through here.
But in the meantime, the calm waters have completely dried up.
Five years ago, an enormous amount of oil has gushed from a pipeline that exploded in the vast swamp.
The fishermen living in the small nearby town of Bodo must now row for six hours to reach fish-bearing waters: The Ogoniland located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted in the world.
All the extent of the devastation is obvious when one walks through the mangrove swamps traversed by rivers.
Instead of a clear water, the motor boat beat-up a cradingue brown water. Anyone who is plunges his hand the cut off any covered in oil.
The roots of the mangrove will emerge from the soil as liquorice sticks. The isolated palms are sadly hang their Bars.
It looks in vain for the swarms of birds, as it usually meets in wetlands: Dés that the outboard motor stops, a silence ghostly down on this paradise of shrimp-like used at a gas station by the smell he identifies.
"What happens here, this is war on the environment," says Mr. Celestine Akpobari with a sadness: "Our life is characterized by a constant danger to health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni is a battlefield besieged for decades: There are more than 60 years, the first European explorers have entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. was executed later. In 1993, the group Shell had to halt its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Today, the return to Ogoniland is banned in this society: While more than 2 million barrel of black gold are daily pumped through more than 5,000 drilling wells and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines in the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields of Ogoniland are untapped, because the situation is too unstable for the oil group.
All the few hundred metres stand in the water semafor of steel as of outlandish sculptures: It is very affectionately "Christmas trees" heads boreholes.
They have up to 50 years, most deficit-ridden are non-corrodible until the benchmark.
Akpobari believes that a head of drilling of this nature breaks from time to time in the piece, because a constant stream of crude oil spilled into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion litres spilled on the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that which has passed into the sea during the accident of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off the coast of Alaska, one of the biggest environmental disaster in the history of humanity.
Who should be the responsibility of the lingering environmental pollution? the answer to that question divides the actor.
For the group Shell, sabotage and siphonage pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution. Environmentalists, for their part, see the blasts of the heads of drilling and oil pipelines perforated as the main causes.
In 2008, the American scientist Richard Steiner blamed the group Shell to apply in Nigeria safety standards substantially less stringent than anywhere else in the world: Only the failure rate of pipelines is "still far higher than alleures.".
Some emerging forms of mangroves to a place that, viewed from a distance, resembles a workshop abandoned, full of greasy and installed air-dry: They are completely naked and covered in greasy up to his neck.
A scintillating fire in one of the many tons that sometimes related to the pipes, sometimes scattered without ground on the site must be répérés: a small illegal refinery.
It was heat the crude oil in the barrel for several hours, "says Michael, the team leader.
As a first step, gasoline is entering a container through pipes, then, at the end of the conduct of drops of kerosene fall and we finally obtained diesel.
It is as well as Michael and his four associates daily four barrels of Diesel 300 litres: "This we reported 34 000 Naira," about 22 dollars.
The people of the Delta are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the country's largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal refiners can sell at a price cheaper than ridiculously low of barely 40 euro cents per litre of Diesel: Because they acquire their first free.
it is offered by the "gatekeepers" who put the network of pipelines in leaking across the country of the Ogoni. According to experts, the country loses this way at least 16 million gallons of crude oil in the whole of the Niger Delta.
Only a small part quite insignificant raw material is temporarily stored illegally purified: The organized crime networks that are also among its members of politicians and senior military officers, take the lion's share of tankers and are selling on the world market.
The militant Akpobari considers that the debate on the question of whether to award the environmental disaster, or rather the subversive activities to the public or to the method of production lax is purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not seen as intruders and if the foundations of the lives of the fishermen were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries."
But, meanwhile, the relations of the Ogoni especially with Shell are so deteriorated that there was no question that the withdrawal of the group. "perhaps operators with other nationalities, as the Chinese, will prove to be better."
So Michael gets nervous.
"It is high time that you déguerpissiez 'announcement the robust oil worker.
"The soldiers can emerge at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not subject to arrest, but at most they will offer bribes.
Even the soldiers mostly originating in the north of the country to take advantage as all Nigerians of the raw material.
"At any point of view, this decamped ploy brought down our country much lower," said Akpori.
Investigators discover construction defects in the reactors of the A380s
The A380s is clearly a big security problem.
In examining a device that has made an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible construction defect that can lead to "catastrophic failure of the reactor."
The airline Qantas now wants to make a complaint against the manufacturer of the reactor.
In early November, the passengers of the Airbus belonging to the airline Quantas had clearly been more fortunate: During the investigation it has conducted, the Australian authority responsible for air safety has found that the reactors of certain devices A380s posed a serious security problem, and it warns against a possible default of construction.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: It can cause fatigue cracks and leaks in the connection of the conduct of oil, said in a statement released Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could lead to a "catastrophic failure of reactors.".
Asian-made reactors are concerned the deck-mounted Rolls-Royce and 20 aircraft of the series A380s.
The company's Airbus Quantas, forced an emergency landing on 4 November in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now initiated legal proceedings against the English maker of reactors.
She filed a legal complaint to the Federal Court of Australia in Sydney. This gives him the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
The Director of Quantas, Mr Alan Joyce, said that his company would claim damages in relation to the incident in early November.
Pieces detached and bearing the surface has been damaged during the fire engine.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is inflammation of oil which is at the root of the damage.
After that incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
The Australian investigators said that further tests relating to safety will be done on the sq380 who are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The recommendations of security are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said the spokesman of the ASTB, Mr. Martin Dolan.
The security problem is considered important enough to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of his plane, the airline Quantas had stuck to the ground its entire fleet of A380s for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily detained three of its 11 A380s.
The company Lufthansa has replaced, as a precautionary measure, the reactor of a A380s.
The double-decker plane is the largest airliner in the world.
The snowfall across the territory causing transport chaos.
Germany any covered in white: In one night, snow fell on most of the country.
The chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are grounded.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
The winter is shaking Germany: For freezing temperatures, almost all the republic is covered in snow in Thursday night, which led to chaos in many communities.
In the north and east, snow reached 15 inches in places.
The movement is severely restricted on several motorways and on many roads.
On the national A7 at Flensburg, staff winter has worked permanently, but they have not been able to come to grips with the snow continued to accumulate.
In addition, violent gusts swept the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The federal Bureau responsible for maritime navigation and hydrography (DSH) expects tidal waves have held sue the Baltic coast of SchleswigHolstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
The piles of snow on highways and on federal roads have led to serious problems in Saxony.
That is why the warning of bad weather Meteomedia announced the alert level purple was announced in Switzerland nobleman: in fact, is the highest level.
In places there fell 30 inches of fresh snow and strong winds and were dispersed.
Several trucks and cars stayed stuck at night.
Even in the land of saxe-Anhalt, police authorities announced severe disruption on the roads.
On the A2 highway, snow and wind caused an interruption of the flow and caused traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the snow hit the A4-grade and A9 highway.
According to the Deutscher Bahn, serious rail traffic disruption took place in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and north of Bavaria.
The main problems are: the snow on the railways, fallen trees on tracks, the wires destroyed or needles.
In Saxony, it had to discontinue the interregional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg.
At Sallfeld, in Thuringia, an ICE train bound for Munich had to interrupt his trip.
The Fire Department paramedic and had to supply the 165 passengers on the train in blankets, food and drink.
Winds of snow swept roads.
The Falls of snow have led to numerous flight cancellations at major airports of Germany.
According to a spokesman of the standard and information on flights, a few cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport indicates that 40 flights have been cancelled at Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service it provides a permanent service.
It is true that passengers stranded at the airport are more numerous, despite barely 400 beds are available.
Accidents occurred Wednesday afternoon on many routes.
The night at Ostholstein, a truck driver was killed in a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The train's driver was slightly injured.
Because of the layers of snow on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was caught at a level crossing because the vehicle was stationary.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth in Nuremberg was closed until the early morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car was barrel on a slippery pavement in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists say good news: The snow will certainly still soft and powdery whirlwind, but in light of gusts.
But, the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be plagued by high winds and quick.
It is, however, very cold, up to minus 15 degrees in places.
The Deutsche Bank is seeking a buyer for its twin towers.
The Deutsche Bank is seeking to separate from its emblem: According to information reported by newspapers, the financial institution is seeking buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could fetch up to 500 million Euro.
Deutsche Bank has just beautify the group's headquarters: The twin towers located in the business headquarters have been upgraded; in the meantime, bankers have had to return to their former place of duty.
From now on, the financial group is seeking to recoup the costs of renovations and it seeks a buyer for its two buildings, writes the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland", citing a spokesman.
The spokesman did not indicate the reasons for the planned sale.
He said "we are checking whether it is more interesting to occupy ourselves buildings or to sell and lease it again later.".
It is as well as the largest financial institution of Germany has already given its headquarters shortly after.
It is only in the middle of 2007 that the bank had acquired the twin towers for $272 million Euro to holders of own-funds. She had then rehabilitated.
The changes to the energy resource-optimization have gobbled up indications, about 200 million euros.
A sale would obviously a lot of money in the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, industry experts estimate the value of the towers, renamed meanwhile "green Tours," about 500 million euros.
According to the spokesman, it is currently unclear whether buildings will again be sold to a fund owned by the bank or an independent investor.
Thousands mourned the miners who perished.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people have had a thought for the miners buried that have been reported dead following several explosions in a mine.
It had not yet been able to recover the bodies because the security situation in the stricken wells continues to be precarious.
There are just two weeks ago, an explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced in the stricken wells, but had found no trace of survivors.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gas and other explosions that followed, no rescue team was not able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second bang violent, the authorities and the administration had considered that the miners had no chance to survive.
So far the bodies could not be lifted.
Today, parents and friends held a party to the memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a brilliant sun Greymouth to New Zealand in the south of the island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 miners buried, it has installed 29 tables on which you could see the names, helmets and lamps.
The photos and personal effects, including clothes and surf boards, also had their place.
Flags were flown at half mast at all public buildings in the country.
The New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants to the commemorative feast that New Zealand has clung to the hope that the miners liaise to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr Lawrie Drew whose son Zen was buried in the pits said he can't resign themselves to accept the death of his son as long as he has not seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative feast.
small-dollar The British and South African of origin were also buried in the first explosion of 19 November.
Rescuers have begun to put out a fire inside the coal mine of the South Island of New Zealand.
The police commissioner Gary Knowles told reporters that when the masses of explosive gases are moved, the burning temperature inside the mine begin to fall.
Go to hell, warrior!
The film is a film Splatter artificial?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the kind former through his film, "Walhalla Rising," the epic warrior.
At what the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn he could suggest in turn "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye was taken prisoner; he unlocks his executioner and, with a force almost supernatural, removes his opponents one after the other. This seems ideal for young male viewers in search of a bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal assassination methods. When he is in a bad mood, he pulled up the gut of its enemies without waiting until they are dead.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the one-eyed is no word on his true name. Even the other characters leave escape, at most, the detour to one or two sentences a few screams of agony, appalling.
Otherwise, nothing is said in the festoie and incredibly beautiful mountainous landscape of Scotland, which is the scene of the universe of the Vikings, there are about a thousand years.
This would be ideal more mature filmmakers with an interest in the bohemia and acxess for the excellent.
When a film is several target groups, it is a pity that they are mutually exclusive.
big-budget The Winding Refn is considered, since the publication of "Pusher," his trilogy on the drug trafficker outspoken and full of style, as a kind of Quentin Tarantinon Danish, but he refuses to make a little more in the mood to the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality at the cinema of art and testing.
Most of the supporters of the art film must feel the horror in the brain that is spreading around and intestines.
Fans of action films die of boredom, one-eyed when embarking, for reasons that can be freely interpret, with a group of Christian missionaries violent in a ship bound for Jerusalem; they are drowned during an eternity by the quiet and the mist before the crew arrives in America and continues to shut up.
It is not surprising that "Walhalla Rising" has found no movie distributor in Germany and that there are in the DVD format.
This is mainly because of beautiful images of the misery that has earned some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, hides behind an appearance, hubris and bloody.
It is not dialogue in this movie, or a coherent, everything is mood, a fever dream turned into a film.
The viewer can't escape it.
Refn grants him barely a moment of relaxation and slowly cut throat with freezing images and a mournful soundtrack, but especially with an elusive hatred that springs from the heart of the characters.
Only a young blond boy, who is closely alongside the one-eyed, maintains a certain innocence, all others are motivated by anger.
More than anything, the one-eyed hero whose motives are not known, but who returned from hell at any time to fight enemies and provisionally allies in transforming itself into warrior, may be sent to the devil himself.
It represents the decay, but perhaps nothing that for those who are, in any way, rotted.
"Walhalla Rising" is a sphinx-like film that can be hating or admire, which is the irritation, enthusiasm and surprise.
A traumatic experience.
Mystérieux earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications for a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this subject, still less to submit to controls of the agency.
On the night of 5 to 6 September 2007 around midnight, at least four F-15 fighter jets attacked a mysterious Israeli I building cubic form on Syrian territory.
It lies on the shore of the khalid, the largest nearby city is located 30 miles: this is Dair as-Sur.
His name appears on the IAEA documents, because it is a question of the reactor that Syria has apparently built with the help of North Korea in parallélépipède stone, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electrical current.
According to a briefing from the intelligence services of the United States, the CIA, dating from the end of April 2008, the reactor, known as the nearby town, el-Kibar, would be able to produce plutonium, which would make atomic weapons.
In contrast, this technique is valid since the 1950s.
The CIA has shown a video presentation with satellite images blurred.
Through computer-assisted animation, it pointed out the location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the plant, which represents a miniature copy of the nord-Coréen model of the Yongbyon nuclear reactor.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building located nearby, even within it.
It seems that the reactor was on the verge of being put into service, but it was not yet equipped for fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli attack, there is barely more information that at the time, and even with the time the mystery thickens.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a el-Kibar reactor, but had been signs the country developed "an active program of nuclear weapons".
Some intelligence agents in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of a "alleged reactor," even if they see the presentation of the CIA as "plausible.".
This lack of hard evidence, as well as to the IAEA.
Asked about how it ensures that it has a nuclear reactor, a senior diplomat of the United Nations has given that a terse response in summer by claiming that the IAEA had "documents sufficient to ask questions.".
The Syrian certainly have kidnapped with haste the rubble of the "unused military building" and conducted a systematic levelling the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen, was discovered at el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, the IAEA received through a Member State of commercial --its satellite images showing the time which followed directly the attaque. it seems that they are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the sponsor anonymous, perhaps Israel, has learned exclusively.
It is impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always said that she had never made a secret atomic program and that it had not built reactor.
Damascus maintains that the uranium found at the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected that argument after analyzing particles in calling it implausible.
Since that time, damas refuses any discussion about this, just as on satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to conduct a second inspection on the site of el-Kibar and denied access to the rubble of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But, even Israel retains a stubborn silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then the Prime Minister at the time of the attack, said recently: "We will never make comments about it.".
It is as well as the investigation of this case has been dragging on for June 2008 without reaches a result and that it "is turning into a serious problem of credibility of the Agency," acknowledged a senior Western diplomat in service at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, finally it is a serious violation of the treaty banning nuclear weapons.
The IAEA considers that to achieve progress, we must clarify the existence of the other three facilities that must have a "functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
So far, the inspectors have neither indicated what facilities it is, or what is their function or what they suspect contain.
According to information published by the newspaper "Sueddeutsche Zeitung", they are known in the IAEA respectively under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf Iskandariayah and also the name of nearby towns.
The independent Institute Institute for Science and International Security (International Institute of Science and International Security in Washington has identified these locations and found on satellite images of a complex near Masyaf that would be very probably a suspicious objects.
It is possible that he is in a military base or directly beside it; this is exactly why Syria refuses access of the three sites to inspectors from the IAEA.
In Vienna, it says that the Syrians fear that the inspection group is, in fact, spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military facilities.
Indeed, it is an information provided by the American secret agents who drew the attention of the nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has the information, including satellite photos, indicating that the vehicles have been shuttling between the three sites and the parallélépipède of stone to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "be used in the production of fuel.".
He would have "no indications on the sensitive activities," such as enrichment and reprocessing of uranium, a process that are essential to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor is certainly thanks to the unenriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there is the rigour plausible assumptions about the following fundamental questions: where should have come where uranium and separate could later the plutonium needed to manufacture the bomb.
It is not known whether the debris that could conceal traces of great value, were stored in three sites.
When the hundreds of trucks of land will be gone, no one will have information on the place of storage of rubble.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria has been examined in 1998 the salt mine of al-Tibni, located just a few miles of el-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, to see if it can agree to the storage of radioactive waste.
In analyzing recent satellite photos to the celebrity magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, the former inspector of the IAEA, Mr. Robert Kelley has established a link between them and the reactor in question.
The satellite photos show that Syria has undertaken earthworks in the three suspect sites and moved from huge containers when the IAEA began demanding access to these places.
It is possible that this is a coincidence, but it did little to dispel suspicions.
As he said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months to develop a plan for the inspections to be carried out. This plan would allow Syria to protect any military secrets. Only time invested shows what interest the inspectors brought to this case.
Meanwhile, Damascus has also been dismissive of this proposal.
There was a year ago, though Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the urgency was not reported in this case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the U.S. ambassador who speaks for a few months what is known as the special inspections, one of the most powerful tools including the Atomic Agency to implement its controls.
The director of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option that I am open to the future," but it is still hesitating.
This means there is a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority on the Board of Governors of the IAEA and many of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation escalate.
on the other hand, as the diplomat who gives his: "This is the point, if in the end they find nothing"
The love War-Time
It goes wrong since Angelina Jolie made its debut in the summer as director.
She wrote the script itself: this is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
We know nothing more about this story, but it is enough to cause unease.
A persistent rumour indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with his executioner Serbs during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women's federations have immediately protested. In response, some shooting footage in Sarajevo have been displaced in the final minute in Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film was shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, the protests are still continuing in Bosnia.
According to information published in a newspaper in Bosnia, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war has sent a letter to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and she demanded to meet the actress. Jolie is a goodwill ambassador for the UNHCR.
She is no diplomat. A few weeks ago, it has proposed to these women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but they have declined the offer.
"The meeting will be held in Bosnia," said Hasecic.
There was no love stories in the concentration camps, and the scenario of Jolie says quite a lot about his attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that the organization of Hasecic subsequently recommended that the United Nations High Commission to withdraw the quality of a goodwill ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But, in fact, what kind of scenario Jolie she wrote?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of his screenplay, was given after some hesitation authorization from filming in Sarajevo, but we do not know why is not then come despite this authorization.
The young author assures itself that it does not pursue political goals with his film, that it is doing a lot of effort that it is aware of the Yugoslav conflict. It maintains that it wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and provide an opportunity for all parties involved to speak.
She remains vague about the content.
It is as well as a second story-line of the movie is circulating on the Net. It is quite different: The music-loving knew each other well before the start of the war. He meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, was deported in the third-seeded concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
This is a big difference with the version "a victim of rape is love his executioner.".
What the movie Jolie began well before the war, of course.
The pressure on it, and speaks Jolie, is "unfair and based on erroneous information.".
Now, only the Hollywood fanatics can provide peace: With illegally this scenario in the Net, as many others before.
Let us!
This evening, everything is again among the Irish.
no trace of dismay.
That is why the local team dominates excessively visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans scream of joy amid a strong music, they loved feet.
Baileyu-Pub Cork South irlande vibrates because the players are starting and manage to bring down the table tennis balls at a distance of three metres into cups of beer of the opposing team.
This bizarre show is called "bière-pong.". The winner pockets 500 euros more a ticket to go watch in January in Las Vegas in the bière-pong world championship.
Cian Tanner is an individual calm; this subtle game to drink and computer scientist reserved, these two behaviours are really not well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26-year-old is seeking to have fun, to shun the térébrante issue, which will result in the future.
The fun to play in Las Vegas is not in its projects. In January, he will lead job interviews in New Zealand.
"I have a strange feeling," he says.
"The homeland is so far away and I have no job."
Finally: His girlfriend the expected already to Auckland, "in less than two, she landed her job as a project to events, perhaps a good sign," said the young man smiling.
Because of the bleak outlook for the country, two of the three sisters of Tanner have tried their luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, resides in Sydney, her brother Colin is now a computer consultant in London.
The young go: The situation of most families living on the island are similar to that of the tanner.
Experts from the Institute of Social and Economic Research indicates that 100,000 Irish soon will leave their country.
They even predict a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these predictions are realized, this will be a stream of emigration comparable to that which Ireland has suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish have enjoyed a comfort, the grief is now taking the whole place.
The economic crisis is, however, especially young people, well trained, who have known until now that the moments of happiness.
The loss of employment and social deprivation were nonsense in the boom years.
Everyone had a job, there is money in excess.
But, meanwhile, three in 10 people under the age of 30 are unemployed.
The newspaper Irish Times publishes extensive reader letters written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything is adrift."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but one that has the potential, is going and our country as a whole generation."
"The last one to leave out the light."
The law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the union of Irish students, sees pointing a darker future because the government is throwing the smoke-and-mirrors and offers no future for young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the young student of 20 years.
She sees how his comrades is clinging to an unpaid internship to another.
She states that are his biggest concerns is to emigrate herself in four years.
"This is a sad and depressing."
However the men as Stephen McLarnon try to address this issue positively.
McLarnon organizes the show "WorkingAbroadExpo" that offers a full support on the theme "work abroad.".
"But the work abroad is new in the profession an extraordinary opportunity to take the first step in the levels of the hierarchy," said the official.
His website shows pictures of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Work abroad is not a boat, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For the past six months, Seán O'Donovan, knows what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing more to do in Ireland for the 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector e Germany.
A fashion house fate precisely to land in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other projects Hannover and Berlin.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan is rarely visit his native country, because it is in a position of overtime to complete to repay the credit contracted to build his house to the homeland.
"The situation is already a bit daft," he said in crossing the threshold of his home for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I live virtually over."
He broke out of a laugh embarrassed by crossing the cold.
The small house is in a residential area with gardens of before well cared for, expensive cars leading brands are stationed on the tracks.
Four years ago, O'Donovan has bought the house in common with her sister for $380,000 euros, funded 100 percent by the credit.
"It was moments of madness, no doubt, the money was easy," he said.
Was he afraid that any collapse because of the credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, inundated of hot tea and says: "I have no children and I'm young; the same everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The building engineer did not like the wailing that it is often lately.
"No one should suffer from hunger, our situation is not as dramatic as what was once lived here in the island," he says.
"Working for a time overseas, this is not what can happen worse, perhaps it is the fact that we were first Irish.
He laughs and then talks about her father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
"It was back after having spent seven years and, in Ireland, life continued, simply."
This idea appeals to Cian Tanner.
Let the future and discover how life happens elsewhere.
In his record, He already has a few years of work in London. That is why life should not be so easy in New Zealand for him and for his girlfriend.
But there is still something that worried well these past few days: the party to organise on the occasion of his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He fears it could turn into evening of goodbye.
"Only, not a lot of emotions," he says adult-like a long sip of beer.
"A farewell, it is still worrying."
"Let's call it an evening of goodbye, relaxed, with a few friends, with a few drinks and a few games."
The democratic routine
The support for democracy in Latin America continues to rise, as private business.
The crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential as the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarómetro poll taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Given that the survey was conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it tracks changes in attitudes in the region.
Two elements emerge from the results of this year's poll, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the mood sunny enough in Latin America.
The second is increasing the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
The support for democracy has risen significantly in several countries on the Pacific rim of South America (see Table 1).
For example in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6 percent per year since 2002, support for democracy has fallen from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61 percent this year.
It has also risen in Mexico, where the economy has rebounded after suffering a sharp decline in output last year.
But only about half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44 percent of respondents were satisfied with the way democracy in their countries worked in practice; it is the same figure as last year but with a sharp increase over the 25% in 2001 (Chart 3)
Some 34% said they had confidence in the parliament of their country and 45 percent in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but up sharply compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago, the economic problems in Latin America have undermined support for democracy.
If it has held good during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries of America experienced only a brief recession and benefited from a strong rebound.
In addition, a network of social security has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty rose only slightly in 2009 and fell again this year, to 32 percent.)
But the mood varies considerably from one country to another (see Chart 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of the outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
What is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crimes have increased.
This is only the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited the crime rather than unemployment as the most important issue for their country (see Table 5).
About 31 percent say they themselves or their close have been a victim of crime over the past year, however, that figure is down from 38 percent last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in rising support for private enterprise and the market economy: about 71 percent of respondents say that private enterprise is indispensable for the development, compared with 56 percent in 2007 (see chart 6).
Some 58 percent believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their developed country, against 47 percent last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support private enterprise); even if their leftist president, Hugo Chavez, expropriated many private companies.
Brazil is the biggest cheerleader in the region, mentioned by 19 percent of those surveyed (up from 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11 percent from last year)
But the United States are considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and in much of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A vote sullied
No one expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on November 28.
But it was far worse than the "outsiders" who wanted to help the stricken country and plunged in fear.
It has presented the ballot boxes and a new election, ballots scattered in the goutières polls, intimidation and ransacked
Polling stations opened late in the evening.
Many Hatïens, including many who were displaced following the earthquake in January, roamed in the neighbourhood to find where to vote.
Some of them eventually had to abandon.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several favorites, denounced the alleged fraud and demanded the annulment of the election.
Similar protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the top official in Haiti to the United Nations, considers the event as "an election well-dispersed in many ways.".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said cautiously that "they do not believe that these irregularities, as serious as they are, necessarily had invalidated the process.".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are beholden to outgoing President Rene Preval unpopular, and its candidate, Jude Celestin, must announce preliminary results on 7 December.
The second round expected is scheduled for January.
Any hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial appeal for the vote to be declared invalid.
But there can be problems if Mr Celestin, who has little or no perceptible support among voters, is said by the electoral authority as having reached the second toura reached the second round.
With a raging cholera epidemic, and more than 1 million survivors in the quake, which are still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be.
In this case, many Haitïens wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disruption.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards, necessary to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
The donors see the election of a legitimate and popular government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, it is clear, the Haitians do themselves.
The edge of feet toward the center
The weeks after becoming suddenly widow, Cristina Fernández, president of Argentina, has benefited from a wave of sympathy of the public who has improved his approval rating of 20 points, more than 50%; it comes to its highest level since it was elected in 2007.
Still, transforming it into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year might depend on the choice of Ms Fernández, visibly in mourning, according to which it would abandon the intransigence of her late husband, former political partner and predecessor, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this respect, the signs remain confused.
Mr Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, had used to develop budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
That allowed the first couple to spend extra income at will.
The government of Ms Fernández has lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has sunk in disarray following the death of Mr Kirchner of a heart attack on 27 October.
Some dissident members of the ruling Peronist movement rallied to Ms Fernández.
But after the chaotic sessions (where a lawmaker was hit in the face with one of his peers and others have accused the government of corruption), Congress did not approve the 2011 budget.
"I am not going to play," the president said.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president greater leeway to spend at will.
The economy over-heating widely: it is likely to grow nearly 9 percent this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1% but many estimates and private wage demands of unions, see the figure close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic meltdown, has made it a priority to growth and poverty reduction, rather than the control of inflation.
He has refused to deal with the IMF, it has harassed the private sector and served the INDEC, the statistical office, which conducted the falsification of official inflation statistics.
Ms Fernández now can moderate these policies?
She has called for talks between private companies and union leaders.
And his officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been buoyed by high world prices for Argentina's farm exports.
But inflation has eroded the boost to growth following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
This is perhaps why Ms Fernández shows signs of wanting to restore financial relations of Argentina to the rest of the world.
This year, the government has reached an agreement with bondholders who had rejected an earlier restructuring debt forced to which Argentina had not settled its milestones in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be emr towards year agreement with garanti governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 trillion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could involve an oversight by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Economy Minister, announced that the fund would provide a "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index, which looks like a prelude to clean the INDEC.
It is not clear whether Ms Fernández wants to stay in politics beyond the end of his mandate, now that her husband is no longer at his side.
If it does, it needs to win the support of the middle class, among which the's is very advocated.
When Argentines will be returned from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for it will have gone into abeyance.
If she wants to win another election, it will have to decide to repudiate or not, without noise, many policies of her husband.
A demi-hourra for China
The Taiwanese voters are user-specific is a sort of a closer union with the mainland.
What Taiwan think of his big brother located on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters have presented on 27 November, or 70 percent of those eligible to elect mayors and councillors in five urban districts, in the context of what is considered a general assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma is itself become a substitute for the feelings from the continent, with innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the biggest reorganisation of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr Ma passed the test, but just.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) has won three of the five town halls, he failed to win a majority of votes.
Instead, the démocrate-progressiste Party (DPP), which was leaning toward full independence for Taiwan, won nearly 50 percent of all votes for the KMT 45%.
If this had been a presidential vote, Mr Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, the part of his party's vote fell about 8 percent.
For the first time, the DPP has attracted voters, even with the KMT in the municipal councils.
The event has unveiled most of the key topics of Taiwanese elections, including trucks to campaign oversell and flags of mass rally with girls who danced in minimum required.
A mysterious assassination attempt has also been perpetrated.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, has made a campaign tour for a candidate of the KMT on the eve of the election.
A man in the crowd fired on the young Mr. Lien, purely across the face, injuring and killing a passer-by.
Bizarrely, he has not been determined whether the gunman wanted to hurt Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, said Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder has had an impact on the election by leading the suspicion over the RFPP and in turn voters toward the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking to see how the issue of the mainland itself was missing.
Instead, the candidates were affaris with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan has usually its de facto independence and hate the military threat from China.
Thus, the KMT has tended to avoid parade its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP has also failed to stir up anti-China sentiment.
This is the response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are essential to the economic survival of Taiwan.
Mr Ma, for his part, has claimed a confirmation as to whether its policy on China was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It is expected that the Beijing government continues to provide trade facilities, according to its strategy to lure Taiwan, homecoming.
China lost no time to send a negotiator to Taipei to hold a summit on investment protection and cooperation.
Of course, it would also like to see an integration policy; but start at the beginning.
Better to wait for it after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP is anyway reinvented.
Two years ago, it was wrong: his former chief, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison on charges of corruption.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a provocateur in favour of an explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under the leadership of Mrs Tsai and the PDP is working to attract professionals and young people.
Ms Tsai has been hailed as a DPP candidate for the presidency, as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he, too, can engage with Beijing.
Ms Tsai has announced plans to a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their talks can be held without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that his party has an "alternative worthy of trust" from the rushed approach of Mr Ma about China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said that the candidate of the PDP would have fared better if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for the presidency.
Even without the intervention of Mr Chen, the DPP will be hard-pressed to choose between its potential candidates.
It is important that the KMT are introspective self.
The evaluations of Mr. Ma were low and despite a staggering economic growth, the candidates of the KMT have not wanted to campaign with him.
His unpopularity appears to be largely due to unemployment and the widening of the gap between rich and poor.
A spokesman for the KMT said that his firm and its local offices will be revamped.
The good results of the HRP suggest that the support of Taiwan for the approximation is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "the point of no return is already past."
Appointments to the Grammy Awards: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "Best New Artist"
Complete at the request of a president, and people are required to take note of it.
Esperanza Spalding, the jazz bassist and 26-year-old singer picked by President Obama to occur at the ceremony of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a nomination in the category of "best new artist.".
Considering that Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the appointment remains a bit mysterious, but it is consistent with the rules of the Grammy Awards that an artist should not get out more than three albums before recording; what "establishes the public identity of that artist."
His ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society," was certainly a step forward and, given his vocal style slightly engaging, his hand nifty pop and funk influences and Latin-based, it is possible to draw at least a dotted line to Spalding relative to the resounding success of Norah Jones in 2003, the nearest equivalent to the Grammy Awards voters taking into account the productions of jazz in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, voters of the Grammy Awards have rightly honoured "Historicity" of Vijay Iyer Trio in the category of "instrumental album," a virée on a thrill invigorating a recording that was one of the favourites paramount last year.
Among these Iyer, "Moody 4B" of the veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the mastered John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, a favorite for the voice shouts of New Orleans and frequent guest "Treme" to HBO, was honored in the category of contemporary jazz; bows also heavily toward a merger certain with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with the steampunk, has earned a well-deserved awards in the category of large; in competition with the rich chamber-jazz Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland, whose album "Pathways" of his day's live was a fine example of the democratic control of the bassist as group leader.
Appointment of the Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in the classical categories
The conventional nominations for the 53rd annual Grammy Awards are a mix of landscapes of musicians and composers around the world.
At the top appointments include "Deus Ex Machina" by Michael Daugherty, for piano and orchestra, with five "yes "; and" Dreamhouse "Steve Mackey, an orchestral work, with three" yes. ".
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California, there is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles," a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and who opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in contention for a reward.
The conventional appointments are divided on 13 categories covering recordings of opera, orchestral, choral and solo.
A category for the classic producer of the year featuring five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classical album are the Symphonies No. 3 and 4 of Bruckner of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" by Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the art of the Castrati" featuring various artists; and the Verdi "Requiem" of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the category of the opera, the nominees are "Lulu," Berg of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" Adolf Hasse of Ars Lyrica Houston; "The Love of Far Kaija Saariaho's" the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Rodion Shchedrin and the Chœur Orchestra of the Mariinsky Theatre; and "Ivanhoé" of Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers who are up for the Grammy Awards for the contemporary composition Pärt are for the Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente More," Magnus Lindberg's "Graffiti" and for "The Wanderer Shchedrin Enchanted.".
The Symphony No. 4 of Pärt had his first at Disney Hall in January 2009 in an execution recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is dubbed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the ex-yukos oil Mikhail Khodorkovsky, jailed in Russia.
The "Mandolin Concerto" Dorman was nominated for his instrumental soloist with an orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles aviat said he wrote the work of 15 minutes specifically for the interpreter to the mandolin Avi Avital, who played the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
"I've written using sounds of the Middle East and a large number of product lines and rhythms of North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category of benefits of orchestra, for having led the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of the works of Stravinsky.
Among the instrumental soloists who have received a nomination include the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; the organist Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and a harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only nominated vocalistes-solistes; here they are: Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of conventional blends, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for his registration "Roots: my life, my song"
The project of the mosque of Temecula won the approval of the planning commission.
A proposed mosque in Temecula received the unanimous support of the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics have taken to the project by claiming that he was promoting both of terrorism that traffic jams.
But the commissioners have ruled Wednesday night that the new religious center complied with local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"A lot of people came to support him: Christians, Jews, Baha'is, you mention," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, taking the floor on Thursday morning.
"I am proud, as a U.S. citizen."
"This shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They were just very strong."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight, with most of the time, people voting for or against the center, the speaking time roughly evenly split, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's Web site.
"There's more to America," wrote one.
"This is another planet of the apes with Miss Liberty died in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The Islamic centres planned have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including the Ground Zero, site of the attacks of September 11, 2001, attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced the violence in the Temecula Valley.
His congregation of the order of 135 families co-exist without incident in Riverside County for years but it wanted a larger space and better than the warehouse that she has rented on a shared ownership with a maker of water filtration systems.
The new mosque of 24,943 square-foot Mediterranean style architecture would consist of two minarets and would amount to 43 feet high.
It would occupy a site of 4.32 hectares on the road Nicolas about two miles east of High Chaparral.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the City Council.
A microbe tolerant arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, broadens the scope to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although the researchers found the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say that this shows that life has opportunities beyond the major elements that were seen as essential.
"This body has a dual capacity."
"It can be developed with phosphorus, arsenic."
"That is why it is very special, even though it is far from being a form of life really" foreign, "said Paul Davies C. W. of the State University of Arizona, co-author of the report appearing in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But the researchers found that the bacteria, discovered in Mono Lake, California, is able to continue to grow after he replaced phosphorus by arsenic.
"One wonders what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. from the State University of Arizona, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers must be able to recognize the life, to know what life is like, said Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a news conference to discuss, which did not disclose the details of the find, has generated widespread speculation on the Internet, according to which the report would disclose the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This was not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary environments, organizations could be able to use other elements to flush the biochemistry and that the whole" standard "elements, we consider absolutely necessary for life, might not be fixed," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Institute of Scientific Research and spacial, Open University in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," said Cockell.
This was not a fortuitous discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Institute of Astrologie of NASA, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
The arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, she speculated that a microbe exposed to the two substances may be able to substitute for one another.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, the agencies have struggled to distinguish these elements separately."
"But arsenic is sufficiently different to that it doesn't work exactly as phosphorus; he got inside and, somehow, gum the work of our biochemical machine," said Anbar.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and have exposed to increasing concentrations of arsenic in which she was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that he can live with arsenic in place raises the possibility that some form of life using arsenic may occur naturally or else on Earth or another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea, according to which the arsenic could be replaced by the low-phosphorus, was not new, but nothing has ever shown that it could walk.
Arsenic was more common at the start of the existence of the Earth, she said, researchers have speculated that the first forms of life would have been able to use it.
This suggests that there may be other ways to form life, not just the way life on Earth was formed at the beginning, "said Foster, who was not part of the research team of Wolfe-Simon.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two dogs were found to exhibit stolen Compton
The other two dogs of exposure on four stolen from outside a motel in Bellflower were found, the Los Angeles County sheriffs have karzai on Thursday.
The four dogs of exposure - two akita Welsh corgis and two pembroke, disappeared Tuesday when someone stole the truck Chevrolet Express in which they had spent the night outside a motel 6 of Bellflower, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found late Wednesday, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the sheriff's department of the Los Angeles County.
"The good news is that dogs are good," said Whitmore.
"They are in good form."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore declined to say precisely where the dogs were found in the neighborhood and what were the circumstances of their discovery.
"An investigation is underway."
"We don't want to say," Whitmore said.
"We are following orders."
The owners of dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be reached for a comment Thursday.
They were meeting Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a County animal shelter in Downey.
The sheriff's deputies have recovered the truck and two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a male 3 years, and Didi, a female 10 months - were unharmed, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show the regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of Japanese dogs, were reported missing until their discovery on Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who lived in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the AKC / Eukanuba National "championat" of Long Beach, where they were present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in competitions of other tests in the days before the exhibition "AKC / Eukanuba," Peek said the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the judgments of the canine exhibition tour of almost a month of the couple.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard have checked into the motel.
They often remain in motels and garent their van outside, right next to the window of their room.
They have taken three other dogs, a puppy Boxer, a Parson Russell terrier and a springer Breton - who stayed with them in the bedroom of the motel.
But they have left the Akitas and the corgis, fur as thick in the truck where it would be more charges.
They have just opened the windows, so that the dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard have reported the theft of the truck at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, fitted with a microchip implanted to identify them.
It is not clear if a reward was granted on Thursday.
The lion is ready to blush again, the restructuring of MGM no longer expect that the final go-ahead of the court
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty, MGM has finally got the go-ahead to start anew.
A federal judge in the bankruptcy of New York, was officially praised Thursday the plan "packaged" by creditors that about 5 billion of debt would be erased, paving the way for the entertainment business, with 86 years of existence, to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television programs.
With the decision Thursday, according to which the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, no more legal obstacles remain before Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to recover afloat under the tutelage of the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the Directors-General what will be a LDAP studio.
The staff will be reduced to about 320 to 400 at the outset.
MGM really will not emerge from Chapter 11 as JPMorgan Chase will not have concluded a credit facility of $500 million, expected to fund operations and new productions of MGM.
It is being distributed under licence by the investment bank, which is itself to 75 million, and should be funded to mid-December.
The process of restructuring the studio began in May 2009 when the investment bank Moelis & Co. has been hired to advise the leadership on how to put its finances as it does not have the means to pay the interest, amounting to $300 million a year.
In August, the Director General Harry Sloan, has been replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and an expert in work-around known for his work with Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Attempts to Moelis and Cooper to resolve the financial difficulties of MGM and the studio's more than 140 creditors have taken much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties have agreed, at the end of 2009, putting the company up for sale.
However, the auction has attracted few bidders including none of them was willing to pay the $2 billion more whose creditors were looking.
In the spring of this year, it had to be re-look while the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer team had begun work on a restructuring plan that, after months of disagreements and internal debates, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM fate officially out of bankruptcy in the following weeks, companies Moelis and Cooper receive bonuses of several million dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already secured 1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
The companies of Cooper, who have collected $375,000 per month for their services to management of the company, will receive a "premium of success" of 4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum account restart production of MGM, which has released only one movie this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films that would emerge from 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit," with Warner Bros.
The studio must conclude a separate loan between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share in these two films, which must be done by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18 percent of the debt of MGM, tried to achieve a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies failed to produce an agreement.
Toys Tech to maintain your budget in balance state-give
Although the leading candidate for the most wonderful toy this year is the IPAD, followed, perhaps, by the video game system from Microsoft, Kinect, both can make a significant dent in your budget gifts.
Consider that, for the price of a iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 and a Kinect game cost the same price as conventional jump 10 strings of pearls, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your budget gifts in balance.
Recently, I visited three national vendors of toys - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - to see the electronic toys that I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that the Law of Moore has evolved, the technological toy this year is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price or a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, although there are generally fewer new toys associated with Web sites, two of the best known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more tender.
And toys to button cell batteries are increasing, as well as toys to rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise stated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and older) are stuffed toys of the size of a guinea pig who sing a note when you press on the belly.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second to compose a song.
If you buy several, they singing in harmony.
Attention: once you start to support, you cannot stop you.
To combine the song to dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and older) is the best choice.
Inspired by the technology of Elmo Live last year, the doll animatronic 14 inches plays games to turn as Simon Says and can make the lunar dance through its innovative articulated feet with Lock-in wheels.
Children who have essyaé the toy uses Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain of a lack of control of the volume.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you will recall of Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and more), with a backpack full of game cards questionnaire designed to transform a ride in a car in a session with a auto-correction and a three-ring binder of floodgates.
If you're suspicious when your child is your smartphones, here are three own-source alternatives.
The Mobigo of VTech ($60 for 3 to 8 years) is the less expensive and easier to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games don't educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for 3 to 12 years), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a screen more recent and brighter.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
The iXL of Fisher-Price ($90, for 3 to 7 years) uses a iTunes to offer games and electronic books and has an SD card that allows entry to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a box of match, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks in line before that time passes, it is ideal for an impromptu mis-spelling competition.
Increasingly, toys have a sort of online connection.
In basis on their presence in the toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online of Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2 "Mix 'N All-Star Figure Pack, $5 for 6 to 12 years), which includes a room marked a code hidden.

Make a softer side in maintaining order in China
Shenbin Tang 10-year-old a place in the city as a sergeant urban training inspecting severely its nerve expenses low, issuing orders with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan - architect-designed officials of public order in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression, and their penchant for violence - transmit a certain impression to a set of spectators.
"Stand right!"
"Be pierced!"
Show them, he says, "what are the pretty girls!"
Four girls who barely past adolescence in white gloves, dressed in jackets and pants, olive coloured identical gymnastics at attention.
Four pairs of black shoes to heel, aligned to the rule.
Four hats treated perfectly perched at the top of hair tied in a knot in blue and white striped.
"Personally, I think they look average," said Mr. Tang, with disdain.
"The models are cute."
More than a government tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
A city has demanded that all new recruits have a high degree.
The province of Guangdong has traded the gris-vert uniform of blue against a supposedly more engaging.
Wuhan, in central China, has replaced the baisser-les-yeux by how strong: in 2009, a report has reported that 50 officers had surrounded a snack cart uncontrollable by launching black eyes, strongly for half an hour, until the hawkers repackaging its business and leave.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 people in Chengdu, has chosen to make a big operation of image.
Since 2003, the district has completed its police urban street of 13 women, specially chosen for their looks, their galbe and their young age.
The idea is to give the police beginner a softer side, more feminine.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson may struggle to attract the gaze on this underground urban brigade of China
And for good reason, critics say.
Unlike the police, these agents are only permitted to enforce municipal ordinances imposing administrative fines or other sanctions.
But the Chinese media portray the news from a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors from the province of Hubei beat to death an observer after he used his mobile phone to film in dispersing a protest against a landfill waste.
Last year, a training manual for inspectors from Beijing, stolen and put online, described how defeat effectively offenders without blood.
This year in Shanghai, a hawkers of watermelons was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game steeped in violence, available for download online, shows Chinese inspectors trained to the assault of street vendors.
"Chengguan marked the government," said last year China Daily, a national publication, after yet another controversy on tactics.
The newspaper called for a "real complete cleanup."
Skeptics say that the approach is far away.
After that, the district spent an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial that appeared in The Beijing Evening News, questioned whether the women had real tasks or if they were a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The announcement of the District required female candidates, aged between 18 to 22 years, have a nice silhouette and "five facial features in the right order."
They must have a larger than the average of 1.6 metres or 5 feet, 2 ½ inches.
The retreat in 26 years is required.
The officers have said that the work was physically too difficult for women over the age of 25.
"This is the image that is important," said a district officer at Rednet.com, a quasi-government Web site.
"First, the out-of-state qualities of the candidates will determine if they agree; it's about the size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come the temperament and internal "qualities."
The women of the Chengguan are like vases of flowers, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the management office of the District of the city, did not agree with that description.
But he noted that the requirements for the 5.5m were the standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case of the zoellick on the order of facial features.
What this means beautiful is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, the disabled or disfigured need not apply.
"We cannot allow a person or a sounding chub come serve here," said Mr. Zheng.
"He would not give a good image."
Liu Yi, who patrol the place Baoguang near a monastery, is aged 22 and has the cheek with a finely grizzled pommelées mouth.
She does not consider the development of his appearance as sexist, was said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked a wry air.
Xu Yang, his colleague record-breaking the age of 21 years, said: "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They do not preclude their mandate is limited, they said, because they have greater career ambitions than simply drive the sellers in the alleys where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a dozen vendors who move quickly on foot or bike, trying to sell the most of buns or bowls of tofu before fleeing.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We have already said several times," said Ms. Xu while a seller has fled on foot, abandoning temporarily its vélo-charrette to noodle-making.
Officers describe their functions rather monotonous that difficult.
"This is about the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, aged 20, who is studying marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female officers do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate property sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public displays of animosity against the bureaucracy that are common across China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, revolted after false rumors spread that the officers of the chengguan had killed a 58-year-old.
In a night, more than a dozen police and agents of the chengguan were wounded, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But the calm is not guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the even-tempered place Baoguang, where female officers patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered around the corner.
Officers have confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike yelling to the scandal.
A power-struggle of 15 minutes followed before the police, their faces grim, have spawned a way to -gun elbow into their vehicle and are parties to speed with the motorbike and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the men's team, stayed behind, his badge white returned to hide his name.
As female officers, the coordinators - men aged 40 years or more - play only a supporting role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a icsar image.
"Sometimes, we fight verbally."
"Sometimes, we fight physically," said Mr Li said in a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, the public begins."
Prosecutors do not polluters Senator Ensign
The Justice Department prosecutors have lifted the criminal charges on Senator John Ensign, stemming from a case linked to an aide to a former campaign and its efforts to obtain lobbying work for the husband of the woman, have karzai on Wednesday the senator's lawyers.
The decision puts an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential until the scandal surrounding his case made national headlines last year and hurt his career.
The office of Mr. Ensign said he was "very pleased" by the decision, the result of a year-long investigation.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary action by the Senate Committee on Ethics.
Lawyers for Mr. Ensign said that the Justice Department had "advised that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he did not intend to keep any charges against him in this case."
The Justice Department declined to comment on this subject.
The announcement came as a surprise to many outside ethics lawyers at the Justice Department, according to which there would be significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign would have conspired to violate a criminal prohibition on federal lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first disclosed in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain a lucrative lobbying work to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the case of Senator with it.
Ms. Hampton had once served as Treasurer during a campaign of Ensign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political donors to find work for Mr. Hampton, and then he defended their rights after they have hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
Given that Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was banned for a year by law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
The ethics experts have argued that the unusual arrangement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems at odds with the ban's so-called revolving door lobbying.
According to the evidence that has been made public, "it seems to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to violate and violation of the law of the revolving door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients of an investigation by the government.
Although the Justice Department has refused to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in the case of Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers have said that the department appeared to be wary of political prosecution after a number of setbacks high-level cashed by its public integrity section, including the decision last year to drop the charges against former Sen. Ted Stevens accused of misconduct pursuit.
Federal prosecutors have clearly afraid to take up arms, "said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group that has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This rosenstiel says high-ranking government officials can now assumes the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, senior counsel for Mr. Ensign, said in an interview on Monday that it had received a phone call from a prosecutor at the Justice Department and followed the next day, telling him that the department was not seeking charges against his client.
The team of lawyers for Mr. Ensign had cooperated with prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins declined to specify the legal arguments it had made to the prosecutor's office.
"I am not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice, except to say that we believe they have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission has decided to drop an investigation following a complaint by the ethics group, arguing that the payment of $96,000 by the parents of Mr. Ensign to Hampton violated federal election law.
The electoral commission said that it was not enough evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, Nevada corporation which has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton to find lobbying work.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company has allowed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, the chief of staff to Mr. Ensign, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him he "mrs." the Interior Ministry on the issue.
Mr. Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another client of Nevada, Allegiant Air, and it has asked the secretary of transportation to set a meeting on behalf of the airline after having hired Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When the news of the case have surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his leadership post in the fourth ranking Republican in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago that he intended to run for a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped the Ethics Committee would follow the example of the Department of Justice and put an end to its investigation.
Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing her hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she says.
The appeal of Cheshire recitals to Twitter
A half dozen of them were in the process of typing away in rows of the courtroom.
They ferried every minute reports of horrific testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense has said there were more than 140 000 messages on the trial of the case of rape and children attached to their bed in a house which was burned down.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three members of the family in Cheshire, Connecticut, is expected to lead to a formal end when the judge would impose the death penalty, adopted by the board.
But lawyers for Mr. Hayes have already filed evidence in court that outline arguments, likely to be the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense coverage of the trial - as well as the widespread use and extended by journalists of Twitter - have created a "circus atmosphere", a debt-fuelled instant and widespread if incendiary with details that the jury was improperly influenced by the passions of the public.
The demand could push the appeal judges to debate on the question of whether the new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
"I have experience at this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in courtrooms violates the rights of the person to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, a lawyer for Mr. Hayes, chief lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. Blue State Superior Court, has tersely dismissed the claims in the judgment last week, saying that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury would have been driven by the passion.
But this does not seem to be the last word on the issue.
The courts of appeal have recognized for decades that media coverage of WellKnown cases may raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a landmark 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a osteopath of Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in his ruling that there was a "carnival atmosphere at the trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the movie "The fugitive.".
Some lawyers said the appeals courts seized to review half a century later the conviction of Mr. Hayes may be curious given the argument that new rules could be needed to manage the means of communication courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There's a reason to worry about the impact of new media" in the trial, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it has been arbitrarily enforced.
Professor Donohue says some appeal judges could be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of instant communication from courtrooms would allow fairer trial.
The case of Twitter is only one of many described by lawyers for Mr. Hayes, likely to be discussed for years, which delays the execution.
The defense lawyers also argue, for example, that Mr Hayes suffered a prejudice when the judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors in their showing grisly photographs of crime scenes in the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors said he was horrified by the pictures of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years.
The defense lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unfairly deported a juror, who had been critical to the prosecutors, and that he improperly put pressure for a verdict by taking the unusual step of bringing the jury deliberating in a weekend.
The jurors were not sequestered.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, as the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and it was discussed during the election campaign by the candidates for governor and U.S. Senate.
They have maintained that the computer media would cease to fan the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The stampede daily tweets of media, cameras and reporters outside the courthouse," wrote the lawyers, "were similar to what had been seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national level."
Their focus on the cover of the system Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists have said that the assertion that the instant new were more inflammatory press releases handed more slowly, was a luddiste impoverish that the policy of the Court governing media coverage of future trial.
But some lawyers said the appellate courts concerned often attracted by the arguments that the social and technological changes required an adaptation by the courts.
Lawyers for Mr. Hayes insist on this claim.
In their case, they make a reference to the Supreme Court decision in 1966 which had overturned the conviction of Dr. Sheppard because of media coverage of the trial and they said that they are the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," israeli, "is that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
The civility can bring the dividing lines?
After a campaign marked by invective and the negativity, a minimum of civility erupted in Washington this week.
Is this a harbinger of a genuine bipartisan cooperation forward or illusory moment before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders has produced no breakthrough on the big issues that need to be addressed during the session of the "lame duck".
But obviously, there are at least had a polite discussion on the differences of the two parties as well as on the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each side wanted to score ratings empty points. point supporter.
The public meeting Wednesday of the Committee on the president's deficit was equally civilised, despite political differences that remain between members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created a mutual respect across the ideological divide; but that, however, still divides the members.
It is barely enough to declare that a new era of cooperation arrived.
The two parties are now in a period of trial and mutual tested for signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
That is why Tuesday's meeting and the subsequent comments of participants unveiled a minimum requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a rapid change of climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxation, spending, health care or the rights, the two sides remain miles apart.
Still, the November election had moderate Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed in tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the side of the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
"It is inevitable after the elections.
The elections are partisan passions, and then they are estomptent.
This is good. "
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
The Bush tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of it.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve a part or whole, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment benefits, not least because Republicans can't afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the wealthy, while denying unemployment benefits to workers without jobs.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, more optimism over a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the "lame duck", with the ratification of the pact "New START".
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution, warns that a successful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the session "blade duck motivate" does not necessarily lead to a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress reconvenes in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, even inevitable.
"Once things that need to be made the will, the psychology in the short term will be up to a confrontation," he said.
Wehner has also expressed scepticism widely shared that civility would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I think most of what happens between now and 2012 as a pré-spectacle or a shadow-boxing compared to the main event in 2012, he said.
The reasons are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the electors present tea that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they should try to live up to their promises to cut government spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission which include reforming the tax code and to raise some taxes, to raise the retirement age and reduce spending.
The co-chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, by themselves, imposed the deficit issue on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the committee, composed of 18 members, to deliver their plan as a formal recommendation, and they have struggled to reach this number.
The greater resistance remains among the elected representatives of the group; suggesting there on tax issues, at least today, few reasons or willingness to compromise.
Galston provides for two phases in the fighting between the White House and congressional Republicans.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, given that Republicans are challenging Obama on budget, tax and health care, to be followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of change?
Public opinion.
It is widely proved that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still wants to see the two parties work together.
If confrontation leads to an impasse, as happened in 1995, when the two parties watching carefully the reaction of the public.
Anyone who will be tried in loss will have to change course and find compromises.
But this would be an optimistic view.
The partisanship and polarization are larger now than they were in the middle of the 1990s and there seems to be more ideological gap between Obama and congressional Republicans than there was between President Bill Clinton and Republicans.
At the same time, activists of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more consistent election in 2012.
Given this reality, civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on the part of both parties to find common ground on the issues that divide them.
The US disclosed documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "Kleptocratie" and spend up to the Kremlin part bribes and protection money that it collects, reported the US embassy in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service, are making huge rackets that help to explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only to legitimate businesses but also of organized crime groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical of power" - takes his hand while the money is moving to the top of the scale.
The memo, which was sent to Washington as Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by Wikileaks on its Web site.
The note is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow; and it is largely responsible for corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev but there has been little evidence of cleaning.
Luzhkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a construction company, have always denied the charges of corruption over the years; and he won several libel trial on those charges.
In September, he said the following a Russian TV channel, when he was asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "This is crazy, it is to throw, it is anything."
The Russians believe, by an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt, according to the polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in a report to embassy; and it is incredible to imagine that this would be to diplomats of a foreign country to do so.
The direct link established between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people in the name of "dysfunctional" and to say that the Government functioned more as a kleptocracy that a government, "according to the memo to the embassy.
"The criminal elements have a" krysha "(a term used in the criminal world / the mafia which literally means" roof "or protection) which passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Home Affairs (MVD) and the U.S. attorney's office, and throughout the bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"The analysts to identify a three-level structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB and MVD, the militias are on the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"It is a system in which the criminal groups fills a void in some areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report states that the FSB breaststroke the money of the largest companies and that police target small.
A source, he said, "explained that business owners of Moscow understood that it was better to get the protection of the FSB and MVD (rather than organized crime groups), not only because they have more weapons, more resources and more power than criminals but they are also protected by the law."
"That is why the application for protection by criminal gangs, is not as high."
The memo noted that, although the collection of the money should be extended, protection itself may be uneven, and even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their business shut down on one pretext or another.
Medvedev has mentioned several times in the fight against corruption, but he admitted the little progress.
The embassy sends the reports of men who bring suitcases, probably filled with money, up to the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on the bureaucrats," said in a recent interview Georgy Satarov, director of the Indem think tank in Moscow. "
"But it is part of this tape."
"It is not part of a political class because they do not exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indem, the costs of corruption would be, at the scale of Russia as a whole, to more than $300 billion a year.
The country has been ranked 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are classified at least to most corrupt).
The disclosure of the note of the U.S. Embassy, which was conducted yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, remuera with certainty of discontent within the Russian government; although Luzhkov can be blamed, in part, for the failures of Moscow, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is working to solve the problem.
Interviewed by the CNN by Larry King, Putin has speculated that WikiLeaks could be a fabrication and has reacted angrily to what diplomats from the United States had disclosed in the appellant Batman and bringing Medvedev of Robin.
"The problem is that it is our interaction, important factor in domestic politics in this country," he says.
"But to be honest with you, we do not any suspicion that this would be done with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics."
The veterans of the Khmer Rouge forced to confront the past
In a classroom poorly lit with concrete walls decrepit of poor quality, the director of high school to Anlong Veng referred to the man who had built, the last Khmer Rouge leader, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here likes Ta Mok."
"It was a good leader; and he cared about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, aged 42.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was head of the Khmer Rouge, the commander remains popular in this isolated former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia where he has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organisation still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge went to the government, the longtime loyalty is finally questioning at Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum of truth and reconciliation allowed the victims to respond publicly to the people who had participated in the plan.
In June, the government has distributed a manual of high school, which for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian court, jointly run with the United Nations, gave his first sentence for a former member of the Khmer Rouge, condemning, to 35 years in prison, the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture centre, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch.
Before the evolution of the situation, the anxiety has increased with veterans of the Khmer Rouge in Anlong Veng, complicating the reconciliation efforts and their wishes to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is some resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge regime, but they are powerless to do anything," said Youk Chhang, director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, an independent organization that conducts research on the scheme.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"The situation creates divisions within families."
Under the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, some 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government of Pol Pot-Unis in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There, they have launched an insurgency that lasted until the last movements go in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary heading the guerrillas from their base in the mountains of western Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a response to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations has led the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of fighters Khmer Rouge began defecting to the government, culminating with the climb-down of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had held the lead, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the Dangrek mountains nearby.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 pending trial.
Without their benefactors, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters have sunk in abject poverty, common to the rural areas of Cambodia; and there are many who remain nostalgic of the movement.
Although some Khmer Rouge elite officers kept their posts of local leader in exchange for having the weapons, it is farmers not qualified in low rank and file.
"These people have benefited very little follow-up after the capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Centre for justice and reconciliation that organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are soaked in the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
"They have been raised in a framework where doing business is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, has fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as poor rice farmer.
"The life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok feeds everyone."
But now, life is difficult because we need to meet our own needs. "
The Khmer Rouge tribunal has also caused worries here.
The court is expected early next year, begin the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The mandate of the tribunal is to prosecute senior leaders and most responsible for crimes but he has not said whether he went beyond these four cases.
It would take longer to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation turned to Im Chaem, 64, a former district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told the researchers of the Documentation Center of Cambodia that she had supervised the construction of the dam to Trapeang Thma, a project which forced thousands of workers have died.
Recently, at a torrid evening, Im Chaem was returning from work in the field near his wooden house on stilts, on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
While the sun was throwing long shadows on the grass absorbents, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past within the Khmer Rouge.
If the court convened, she says, she would refuse to go there.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," was said.
"If there is more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would happen if the court had several suspects, although experts and historians challenged this.
"Cambodia should dig a hole and bury the past, he said.
But the past is all that Cambodia must do to move forward, said Youk Chhang, the documentation centre.
"Reconciliation in terms Khmer is to reconnect the broken pieces," he says.
"We need to put these pieces together so that we can understand."
The centre has produced the first textbook approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, "A History of Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
It was distributed to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history books of the Department of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, aged 19, a student at the high school of Anlong Veng, said that the new manual was helping students to understand an important part of their history.
But her parents have reacted with skepticism when he returned with the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he says.
"They are wary because they don't know exactly how many people the court will continue."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
Still, the Khmer Rouge respect retain a powerful here.

Nuom Sothea, a 31-year-old saleswoman roadside mobile phone, said she did not know much about the man who was cremated at this location.
"But it has a great spirit; and many people go there to pray," she says.

The Belarus agrees to give up its stock of weapons-grade uranium
The government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it would abandon its stock of highly enriched uranium, a key component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials around the world
The agreement was disclosed in a joint statement issued after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, on the sidelines of a summit on security.
The US government had tried for years to persuade the Belarus to forgo the highly enriched uranium and appeared to have reached the horizon last spring.
But American officials have said the Washington Post that some 93819-1 operations were conducted with Belarus over the past two months to eliminate 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a research centre of Belarus.
That paved the way for a deal Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the field of about £500, according to an official who spoke about the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of the Nuclear Security Summit of 47 nations, organised at the initiative of Obama; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was useful to obtain an invitation to the former Soviet republic following the summit, in 2012.
"I'm really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit in 2012 nuclear safety summit."
"This proves that this process works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a group promoting nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "significant, very significant progress" made by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government helped six countries to get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
The Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the summit on nuclear safety of Obama, the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, said that the nation would ever to its uranium.
"We have kept the highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially weapons-grade uranium and low-enriched uranium," said Mr Lukashenko.
"This is our product... We're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're going to sell it to anyone."
"We're going to use for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus is closer to the United States a few months ago; however, expressing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to remove uranium from Belarus, in October, has been particularly complicated because the material had been slightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled over 1 300 miles up to a facility in Russia to be stored and eliminated, officials said.
The second operation was completed Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the officials.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million in its efforts, in large part to replace the research facilities of Belarus with low-enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
"A careful coordination and organisation have been implemented in order to build confidence", leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official of the Department of Energy England-based Threat Reduction in the world.
According to estimates by the Center for the Study of Nonprolifération James Martin, Belarus had this year at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus seeks to eliminate its stockpile by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of the harsh crackdown by Lukashenko of Human Rights.
But the statement Wednesday suggested a potential revival.
"While welcoming the progress on these issues of global security, the United States and Belarus have acknowledged that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential to improve bilateral relations; and essential to the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The government had no objection to the CIA flights
The government had no objection to the CIA flights with Al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners to Guantanamo across the Spanish territory, according to a telegram to the United States ambassador to Madrid.
This is shown by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks daily El Pais, adding that the first Vice-President of the Government of the time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Executive informed Spanish for "0950 demonstrate that they were appropriate vigilance on foreign planes through Spain.".
In June 2006, after a Council of Europe report that accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights in a dozen countries, including Spain, a meeting was held between the former American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report had "surprised the Government of Zapatero offside" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega said that Spain has no objection as regards the flights of intelligence by top Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" in order to avoid the "take off guard," said Aguirre in a cable.
The owner of the Department of External this time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, reported to the ambassador that the Executive Spanish "wanted to give this matter the looming as low as possible, even if, as it was in the hands of judges, the Government had a limited ability to influence.".
In turn, in January of 2007, the Prosecutor Vicente González was sent to the Embassy the fact that he would not block the initiative of the judge to require the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain no incriminating evidence, no sensitive information," said the embassy after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States still have shown their concern for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than for the declassified information of CNI o the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to manoeuvre the case quietly between the governments," said Aguirre.
In March 2007 during a lunch meeting between the ambassador of the United States and the Internal Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he said that "even if the Spanish judges are recklessly jealous of its independence, and what they consider appropriate," he had given instructions to his staff "to avoid the comments of an overheated rhetoric, trying to rebaisser the temperature.".
The ambassador also expressed his concern for the PP's action in this case.
"In spite of his pro-American policy, our experience suggests that PP certainly will take advantage of any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if those révélations-là have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," she.

And then she speaks of a mobile message that she had just received: "I want you 16,777 this month or you give me an address to send you the child.".

The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she does not remember how the facts were gone, "and it did not have the intention to do harm to the minor.".
Before she had confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and placed his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the attorney requested a psychiatric test.
The members of the People's Party would gain 4 seats in Congress and the SGPs in would lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the 1102n05.htm of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase of votes and members registered in the last elections, the PP self-governing Catalan has already referred the general because, even if there's progress or not, the outlook is more positive that, because the number of votes that it gets in these spider-man normally two-time that it receives in the Catalan.
Thus, the Catalan popular got 610.473 votes in the 2008 general, while the self-governing 2006, they had obtained 316.222.
The last Sunday, the SLCs got 384.091 votes.
If it maintains this upward trend desired, misuse of votes on SGPs and the retention of the electorate of the PP, analysts of this training have calculated that, if there would be a general election, the CPP could past 8 to 12 seats in Congress, while CiU in would also benefit four (it now has 10) and SGPs in would lose no more and no less than 9 Members (he was 25).
These pupose would see that the Catalan place is crucial for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the popular, CRFs would lose a Member of Parliament - it has three now - while CVI would keep an MP or would win a.
But if the election agenda continues, the more next appointment in May of 2011 for the spider-man, where the popular can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their charge--and at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, a government that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros to 2011-.
Both the nationalists as the popular agree with the fact that SGPs could lose town halls of Barcelona, Gerona and Tarragona Lérida, where the Socialists would the majority the opportunity to use their traditional partners, CRFs and LCI.
Taking into account the Republican debacle, it would not be far-fetched that it loses its representation in the city of Barcelona - it is necessary to get the 5 percent of votes-.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona and Tarragona, Lérida.
The nationalists are convinced of the fact that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they have ruled with the PP before the current Socialist mayor, Josep Felix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has recorded only a difference of euro500 votes compared to SGPs, including the mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign, they have found several times.
The popular recorded progress in 1102n05.htm other important as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
At present, the PP is present in 34 city governments to Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of communities.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
Besides the seven inmates in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three
The Pakistani seven Nigerian and detained by agents of the Commissioner General Information Barcelona Police formed a jihadist cell, which led from Thailand, facilitated passports to different groups Al Qaeda, among which "The Tigers for the Earth Liberation Tamil" (EPDP) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the latter being the author of the Mumbai attacks that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Department of Internal gave great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Kampai" has been "debility" the device of falsification of Al Qaeda at international level and "therefore, its operative capacity".
The investigators calculate that the cell, in two years during which she has been active in Catalonia, has sent thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that incorporated the criminal galaxy to Al Qaeda "fighters" can spend European borders and other Western countries with a total impunity.
The terror cell is the only one that the jihadist network operative was in Europe, which is why in the investigations have participated, Thai services, other European police units, which is why in the territory of the European Union there could be the following days of similar coups in the last Tuesday night of Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (it has held the Pakistani-administered Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammed Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), Thailand has been conducted another, with the capture of Muhammad Zeeshan Butt and Pakistan's Athar Ehsan Butt and the Sirikanlaya military-led Kijbumrung.
They were those who ran from Bangkok the cell based in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which has been hit in 2009 - was flying mainly tourists passports who met the conditions marked by the named "World Islamic Front.".
That i.e. say the documents should be on behalf of young men aged between 25 and 45 years, with a validity of several years, and without official embossed visas.
The investigators point out that so far it has not found any detail that connects inmates in Catalonia with the Mumbai attack, even if the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba," was one of the groups receiving stolen passports in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
But we must remember the fact that a few days before that this attack is committed, Catalonia is sent through a signing-on agency, a few miles of dollars that have been "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used after integral by the "squad" that killed 106 people.
The Police grabbed a vast literature.
PP demand that it suspend Mas to tax the complicity
The leader of CPP, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, has had the opportunity yesterday to expose myself to Artur Mas its conditions to support his inauguration as president of the Generalitat, identical to those set out during the campaign and which boil down to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of adventures philo-souverainistes as is the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wants to address to half of its mandate.
The President of Catalan popular came to rendezvous with Artur Mas with the security that gives having scored 18 seats in the elections last Sunday, more than enough to be loving, as the candidate of CiU requires that at least one training exercise that the opposition to abstain in the voting for the nomination.
On a possible agreement with the PP depend on alliances that the nationalists want to stay in Congress for the general election, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of political leaders are key in Catalan.
And what about the President of the PP, to support a nomination "it would eliminate all speech sovereignty and independence," and complicity economic - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the leader converge to submit even in the referendum.
The two leaders have in common is their bet to lose the political apparatus of a self-governing administration very exaggerated and the elimination of the tax applied to estates and gifts.
Details of the negotiations on the nomination of Mas will on the part of PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas met already with Joaquim Nadal (SGPs) - who has promised a tough opposition, Joan Herrera (LCI) and now it will be done with Joan Puigcercós (CRFs), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric says the deaths were not due to "lack of action"
The owners of the centre of Olot does not eliminate the possibility of nursing that their night has killed more than 11 elderly
Officials of the geriatric The Caritat of Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the harm caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least 11 elderly of which he was responsible in the meantime he has worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was accompanied by the lawyer of the centre, Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of The Caritat would be able to exercise the charge against the responsible" for the dead but "the legality and responsibility require us to assume the other situation of civilian officials.".
And apart from the discredited social entity to suffer for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the nurse at night, the great threat to The Caritat now takes the form of a significant compensation as the legal representatives of the victims' relatives calculate already.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime date of August 2009 and that from this day he has not ceased to kill.
The judge said in sentencing that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - old geriatric patients - care he suspected that in many cases no doctor did personally explored the deceased but, given the age and the illness of patients, the formalities were conducted by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, flatly denied yesterday that situation and said that "the lack of measures may not have been in no time the cause of what happened.".
Counsel for The Caritat added that "in this case there is only a hint of carelessness on the part of any other person that is the accused.".
The person already dubbed as the "Angel of Death" confessed yesterday 11 killings and said that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009, and a month and a half later he killed a second grand-mother.
In this case it has caused the death by injecting him with a sobre-dose insulin-free, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of pellets sedatives.
The director of The Caritat mentioned the fact that it is difficult to control centre staff access to medicines.
The injections of insulin and the cocktail of sedatives had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes nurse, in his desire to alleviate the suffering of internal, used to kill them.
But the laboratory tests will clarify if Vila is not lying by saying that he has sought for its first victims died less cruel or otherwise he burned inside the giving laundry as it has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed in the meantime 12 - 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the nurse at night, the number of killings confessed, they do not eliminate the possibility that the number is bigger and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in the change of the way to kill successfully after committing eight murders.
That is why they say they will remain available to the court to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threat
Investors have reacted sharply yesterday on the threat yesterday that Trichet warned that "the market should not underestimate our ability to react.".
The differentials peripherals have closed in the strength and the actions of the European banks have suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we must not underestimate the ability of ECB to be wrong, and the euro has barely registered an increment, which is a career-minded signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way that it collapses, it will recover, but motivated by fences of short positions and very speculative.
The institutional investor soon to lose the fear.
A month ago, ECB has cited today to withdraw liquidity measures and he will withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those who remain.
Bundesbank demanded the finalisation of the plan to buy public debt because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all the extraordinary measures of liquidity and leaving only access to the week.
After the Irish crisis hope that extending the current liquidity measures "until at least March" and maintain the quarterly auction unlimited access to the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the program of purchasing obligations and that even the signal of the increase.
If they do not perform the expectations generated, they are the excellent market reaction yesterday and if they continue blinded to withdraw liquidity measures, God help us!
As well as during their meeting in May in which they said they had not even considered purchasing the bonds and they have ccv markets, history could repeat itself tomorrow.
ECB must be believable and persistent.
In May it announced the bazookas Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, triggering a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday the auction of payable-through to a year in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury has issued only 500 million to 5.28 percent compared to 750 million to 4.81 percent from the previous auction.
Even so, types in Portugal have fallen 30 basis points across the curve, and reflecting a clear change of sentiment of market after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland we published the figures of the hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The figures represent estimated 10,000 and 15,000 short-term million potential and they have a delay until February to get the private equity or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not have detected the problem in July with the stress test, the numbers are ❖ in the Plan of Assistance and help to reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, the next Tuesday, the Government will have to get parliamentary approval for his new budget and it has not yet sufficient support, therefore Ireland remains in a household of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of his speech to release the tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that shows that we are a union and that we interpret all the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest the anthem of the joy of Beethoven.
In Spain, the president has had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of action that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Reforme pensions, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to reactivate employment ring to www.chs.ca investors as the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish stock market suffered the 4.5 percent, double that of the rest of the European stock markets.
The difference in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and radical and we have the surprise effect.
Now there is a enchère-clé of an obligation to three years will be 0603.10.11 by Trichet, therefore we hope to solve with strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our ability to refinance.
For Spain ask a Plan of Assistance would be a auto-immolation.
They give us a line of liquidity which we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in available liquidity, the three-time from March, types very expensive and they cut access to markets indefinitely.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of the wife Caesar, "in part, the sound.".
Courage, we can come up!
The president of Eulen challenge, the Board of Vega Sicilia asked by his son
The storm does not cease in the open conflict in the family Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Alvarez, founder of the group, challenge, because he sees "no right", the Judicial Council of El Enebro the next 16, requested by five of his seven sons in which they try to make their majority and seize control of the management of the firm's owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his son David and Jesús María José give their battery legal for the new chapter in their dispute for control of a share in the group.
The founder of the holding company of business services to companies does not appear to be willing to cave in his dispute to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
In its board it has been excluded by five of his seven sons who were appointed directors in the shareholders' meeting of 18 January this year, the challenge is registered in the Commercial Register and Corporations.
The judicial council of El Enebro for the next 16, convened by the Magistrat Commercial Issue 2 of Madrid, opened again the six-speed thunder in the family Álvarez.
The appeal to the judge for setting the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantee the convening of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Alvarez as a "desperate appeal of his five sons to try, across a wriggle process, the Act clearly defrauding and abusing the right, validate and correct the Assembly radically zero on January 18," according to his official spokesman.
This argument will be the basis for that, once the meeting was held, is challenged by considering that it is "null and void.".
The same protagonists, who maintained a discreet silence, have tried without success that the magistrate shall call a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a APFF company and holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the son of David Álvarez control the 100% of the capital.
The founder of the group of services seeks nevertheless usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to the protocols familiar.
This case is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the request of dispute for which there is not yet a date reported.
Red Bull F1 triumph with a secret weapon of Siemens
A software creates improvements on the cars in real time.
As soon as Red Bull es entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this swanky universe of speed was marked by surprise and by success.
As a first time, no one took into account the options of a new team who had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of recent seasons, the past November, in the last phase of the championship they have bet on the triumph of Ferrari's Fernando Alonso.
Without down the pilot skill as the champion, German Sebastien Vette, the capacity of the Renault engine that propels her car in the world of Formula 1 we talk about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is in fact a powerful simulation software to process that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with very distant goals of the 30-year-old competition.
Appointed PLM, this powerful instrument technology has been used to create assembly-line marion fabricantes plants across the world, energy, high precision instruments.
The objective is again, accurately simulate the product or process before the building of a real way, thus avoiding the flaws and avoidable costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi planes or more famous commercial vehicles Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial division of Siemens, says the fact that the use of this instrument technology in its factory in Formula One Red Bull has helped to create and implement "in a few hours, almost in real time," the amendments, changes and improvements detected during races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the stables of the year 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who was able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
In the Red Bull team work today 180 young professionals of high qualifications, equipped with powerful computers analyze and plan any kind of changes on the cars.
The head of Siemens PLM explained that the software is able to analyze and improve all elements of the Red Bull cars except the engine, which is exclusive responsibility of Renault.
It amends the materials, fuel, aerodynamics and security features.
The changes can spend virtual reality simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced systems and laser production by high-tech autoclave.
As only limitation of this madness technology development, there is the $40 million that each Formula One team may spend as each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has established the factory of high technology to create and produce its cars in a town 50 miles from London.
These are two buildings where the visits, especially for journalists, are limited.
Everything that happens there is considered "top secret".
The staff for this duty account 580 people, contained herein two pilots, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of the Red Bull Formula One, without doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Between the huge technological resources that the mark of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other protagonists hidden, whose activity is invaluable and zero visibility.
The director of technology at the plant, Steve Nevey, says there are five years of age you could say that the progress of R + D in the case of racing cars brought the 50% of victories and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology represents the 85% of success, while the pilots provide 15 percent value added.
Nevey admits that Vettel and Webber will never be replaced by the computer, because "they are gladiators unpredictable.".
HP will install in two years 20 stores own with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) has opened its first store in Barcelona in collaboration with its exclusive partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 stores between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain during the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in centres multi-brand sales dealer as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The Vice-President of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the redesigned store located on the Gran Vía of Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, with which it is 30 years that it works.
The American group has prepared a plan to build 200 outlets in Europe by 2013, a strategy that includes 20 Spanish institutions.
The first open were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next stores possible, even if she confessed that Madrid could be the next destination.
The Director of HM systems said the philosophy for the establishment of the stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and is responsible for the design of the exclusive furniture stores (with products that may be affected in an interactive way), which in Europe will hold a similar image.
In addition, HP covers personnel training institutions.
Helena Herrero has denied that it is a franchise system and pointed out that the exclusive network of businesses claims to "improve the service offered to clients and SMEs in the purchase, assistance, the post-vente and even the packaging.".
The store of Barcelona includes an area with a pilot program pioneer at global level that solves the potential problems of HP's computer equipment as collateral.
An online service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"Thus, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take two days."
"This system is designed specifically for the MPEs and users, as large companies already have contracted technical assistance services," said yesterday Helena Herrero.
Sabadell bet on 'fly' a million customers to rivals in three years
More optimistic that other leaders, the chief executive officer of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believe that 2011 will be a hard year for the banking sector, but initially rejected a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the war's liabilities.
Despite this, it provides a collapse of margins of interests, that the attempt to partially compensate with increments of committees and the price of credit.
Sabadell await capture in three years, a million customers, its task.
Sabadell has found a way to tap future for three years and be able to survive in an economic environment that is very complicated.
The bank will march in 2011 a new management plan that will hold a will lability of three years.
The goal, in part to survive without need to resort to public subsidies of FROB, is winning a rating of market by attracting a million new customers - 700,000 if you deducted those who can get out of the banque-, his great task, because so far the bank had spoiled more SMEs and the companies that the particular customer.
This year it picked up 250,000 customers and 50,000 companies.
His personal market is 3.5%, while the companies it exceeds 10%.
Another plan 2011-2013 is betting on productivity, or which is the same thing, of austerity, with the cost reduction objective, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when he presented the results of the exercise.
Few banks dare to set targets and make them public, because the financial crisis has disturbed all the plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year his blueprint Optima, ya it four years ago, although initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for a year.
Customers who leave escape the coffers of savings will be its main goal.
During a breakfast hosted by FIPA, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a difficult year "transcendental and".
The executive, in fact, think that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow.".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs," which is fundamental for the survival of the banking business, insisté-t-il.
And even if he thinks that the war liabilities - which penalises the margins - is reduced, the price of risk premiums that banks and funds are paying for its emissions to get liquidity moving already in the price of credit to offset falling margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and funding is structural and will be a factor of pressure on the credit."
"We did not close the tap, but the differentials are highest," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit the long-term credit and raise the price differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 nov.-.
He admitted that the trend of the banking sector now "is to increase the committees," but "there is a competitive framework.".
The management plan of Sabadell is based on organic growth even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of corporate operations.
This is not in vain that it ensures that Spain will be sought "larger dimensions."
"Everything will next year," assuré-t-il.
He says that the capital requirements "increase dramatically" and some Spanish financial entity might get to red numbers.
And he noted that the FROB can replace the market in the capture of funds in the case of new recapitalisations.
After that Sabadell can survive at the close of markets, it has diminished the importance of the fact that some banks are already predicting as a new liquidity crisis.
He noted that we cannot issue, but the opposite of what happened in June, you can obtain short-term financing through rest, which reduces the crisis.
ECCS rejected the possibility of a second wave of mergers among the pension-fund
The Director General of ECCS, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday dismissed the possibility of a new wave of mergers of banks and savings and insisted again on the speed with which it implements the restructuring of the sector.
When the trial of pension-fund concentration of Spanish savings began, there have been several entities that have said that they would not participate in this first phase and they reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the director general of the Spanish Confederation of Caisses d'epargne (ECCS), Jose Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday dismissed the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations.
"I think that most mergers has been conducted, we cannot say that the inclusion of Cajasol in the group of Banca Cívica is a second phase, adjustments."
"Most was done completely; it is possible that instead of 17 go to 13 or 14, but all major processes have been made already under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, who has worked a lot in this operation," said the officer.
In the statements during a breakfast meeting of the Association of Leaders and Exécutifs of Aragón (ADEA) Olavarrieta, explained that the process of concentration is "the greatest speed possible and we must be very satisfied with the way that it does happen in the time that it was set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain," emphatisé-t-il.
"The move 45 boxes with an average of 28,500 million volume of assets to 17 with 75.500 million is a trial without equal in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be a lot more big to comply with Basel," souligné-t-il.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of opinions fairly happy on the slow process" that demonstrate a "lack of sérosité and meaning," because "what the Bank of Spain is reminded that it must respect the period before the end of the year.".
The Director General of ECCS, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the financial system the most rigorous across Europe and "probably" in the world and he has attributed to persons who cast doubt on a "lack of knowledge.".
The leader said that given the current economic climate, "we can stay very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and crates of savings, a system that has begun a process of concentration "very important" and "goes to the greatest possible speed.".
He recalled that the Spanish banking sector was well stress tests that ECB has made in July.
Zapatero and German red line
Berlin has opted to stay in the euro, but he lays down the conditions for the entire Union.
Tensions markets have caused a doble government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, which range from tax cuts for SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or removal of euro426 euros in aid to the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, airport management Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the Loteries of the state.
On the other, the Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel in regard to its responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should we interpret these movements?
It should be noted that the position of Merkel is not a mistake in its communication policy.
On the contrary, it is a further restriction of the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
And Germany has a radically new vision of what must be his future, which angered with maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
Facing European resistance, in Germany we begin to speculate on the possible three out of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the currency area.
The second, the recovery of Mark, although now it seems like science fiction, with a current of opinion very favourable, nearly a 50% of the population.
The third, a new design of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines for countries that transgress, possible suspension of payments to them and an extension to the private sector costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it's been a long time that it is now, therefore there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both IMF as the European Commission motivates deficits, the German Government has invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first signal of a discrepancy between what Germany thought we had to do (plans for fiscal rigour and stability of public finances) and its European partners, ci-inclut France, practiced.
The second shot of the Central European countries was when Merkel has hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
From the time she was the subject of a fierce critic, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and published were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, toward the end of October, Merkel expressed a clear position, asking the reform of the Treaties of the European Union to make possible the rescue of a country and at the same time compel private lenders bear a share of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, because it hastened the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although a little watered down, has been approved, and the following month, we should see the process of reform of the Union which is possible these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it did not believe cross.
And it said all that, even if now we must take measures with which there may not be too agree, from the date the former functioning of the euro would have finished.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the countries that break the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to be declared in default and, in this case, the private sector to bear as a party of the costs.
Germany we said that we must follow a tougher path to growth with high rates of saving and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive out-of-state bargain-basement.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over the Spanish growth in the years of the boom, will simply not be tolerated.
The setting is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear.
It is not only to renew the public deficit to 3 percent by 2013.
What we request is much harder.
And what it absolutely must not do in these circumstances is we deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence happen to us tranquility greater.
And that we can seize the opportunity that we gave, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also heard of this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after the meeting of the past Saturday with big business and yesterday's announcement of the new measures) suggests that, despite criticism from Merkel, it opened the way to the argument that we must bring order to the house.
But the red line that Germany has mapped out is there, and they don't seem to move.
And among the possibilities being considered, we cannot exclude that to abandon a monetary zone too chock-full of less serious.
And in this case, Germany we can still say that it had warned.
Sport and fraud the law
Ruses similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show ingenuity but not the desire to escape punishment.
The expulsion engineered in principle by two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the game of 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League has caused much ink on the unsportsmanlike nature of such behaviour and if both players should be punished by UEFA.
As you know, a few minutes before finishing the game (that their team already earned clearly), the two players have deliberately lost the time when they committed fouls to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will eventually be leader of his group, the two players will perform the regulatory sanction for the game's next match against Auxerre and dam will pass without boxes to the next phase.
Finally, the Discipline Committee of UEFA has punished with two games the team coach, Jose Mourinho and different economic are the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not new, if not quite common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, an rules, but followed the sport.
Part of the debate emerged in the case reported to the fact that this was a team player of the entity of Real Madrid (which in its national anthem has the nobility and honor and opportunities in the past has fined his players for similar acts) and to the dramatization orchestrated, it seems, by Mourinho, which adds an episode of its history histrionique technician dilated and provocative.
In any case, the debate whether this type of behaviour not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e., whether with these actions it is committing a fraud laws; because they are rights-impairing with the settlement, but appear to evade its meaning.
The question is to look at the type of damage they cause to the spirit of sport.
A property that includes the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of opposing players, an aspect that with these actions has not been put in danger, there has been no violent game.
Another of the property to which you referred to with the game right is to prevent the team players offenders is an unfair way to the team, which is not the case.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it does not accept that normally characterizes as cheating ♦ fraud the law, since its infringement of the rules was not conducted in secret to try to avoid the penalty, but their action has tried to be the most obvious possible to receive the criminalisation of the arbitrator.
They waited and they have happily accepted the sanction.
Another issue is the type of benefit that offenders get faults intentioned examined.
Here it seems necessary to see that it is not in a situation of disadvantage to rival and there is an advantage in the same match, because obviously the result of the action involves letting their own team with fewer players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club could not rely on these players.
Of course the advantage lies in the fact that the players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cartons that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term benefit, with a degree of precision, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and from that, with this action the players perform a match penalty and spend in the second round of boxes, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cartons happens with one less than in the first round.
So, moving up the ladder, this is not so clear that this is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the spirit of sport, which is still part policy decisions that promote the maximum advantage of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players have not activated to avoid the application of the penalty (this would be a clear case of fraud the law), if they chose the time in which they are subject to it.
They have made a strategic decision without thwarting the penalty or flee this.
Even if the border between genius and fraud the law is diffuse, in this opportunity I think it was a clear case of genius.
The controversy, I believe, is because of two factors: because there were two auto-expulsions and because of the way to transmit the director for cause.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as much ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive of offered to capture Christmas dinners for groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the timetable is focusing this year a spate of bookings for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-financed celebrations by employees who wish to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
As the nougat, and all the lottery, when December comes back as the dinner of groups before Christmas that continue to be the ball of oxygen for restaurants and entertainment of Barcelona, but because of the crisis have lead in an offensive te price adjusted to capture the majority client: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or lunches coincide businessmen and industry associations interviewed.
To complete complicating accounting, the timing of this year (as the night of the Saint Sylvester falls Friday) has focused the claims in the week of 13 December, with the result so far a flurry of bookings dinners for days peak (17 and 17) and almost nothing the prior week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of the difficult times, there are a lot of companies that have eliminated the collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, a lot of employees are paying their own pockets.
Any is the situation, they all charge prices of battle, confirms the president of Gremi to Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employers now does not dare to predict how the holidays this month.
"People thought a lot before booking."
"They want to get out but they are paying a lot of attention to the price," he said.
The case will go well "for those who provide quality at good prices and good service," he said, and pointed out that customers have the tendency to go down one level with the crisis, so that the under-40 around EUR 25 became a majority in the application.
In a survey in various institutions of the centre is the collapse of applications for the night of 17.
The group Soteras indicates that there is a genuine boom in applications for the friday, with the contention to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to complete forms, with 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 institutions in the city (Hostal of Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the uniqueness of the timetable has assumed more advance bookings, even at the beginning of November.
"We have done everything possible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes of 19.95 at euro30," détaillent-ils.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 local, remains optimistic after being detected a rise of billing since the second half and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group noted that the 18 will also be a active day in groups of friends who celebrate in advance the holidays.
In their six menus of group they added one for the noël, with 30 euros or more as budget famous and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend a 10% more than in the past year instead to demand more details, such as the Catalan wine manufactured according to the champenoise - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies call for new employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
In the part of employers Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment of Barcelona), its vice-president Enric Gomà, says in the opportunity to begin to see the end of the tunnel and argues that overall bookings are "immigrant-led", although customers are "negotiating the maximum.".
This is true, the hope for the festivities has not fallen, regardless of who pays, "he said.
The Pakistani nuclear program generates a great concern to the United States
Islamabad product of atomic weapons "to a faster pace than that other country.".
The 4.3.6.1.3.filtration of Wikileaks confirms the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US embassy in Pakistan and the Department of State of United States filtered through the portal Wikileaks confirms the huge concerns that causes in Washington the Pakistani nuclear program.
Aside from the insightful and tasty that provide details on the content of the conversations and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear security, instead of increasing, decreasing "unstable" and that the Asian countries produced nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world.".
The distinctive feature of the Pakistani nuclear program - the fact that the weapons are not assemblies, but they are difficult to make emmagasinnées components by destroying them in case of attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
It is as well as the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report before the visit of the former National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities in the territory under Taliban attack, the dispersal of nuclear materials noise-protection including the short and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials.".
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and missile programs is planned, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferant and a reason to maintain the custody.
"Pakistan's hiring staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline of educational and cultural levels, extremist organisations have more opportunities to recruit people who works in the missile or nuclear programs," said the expert Yuri Korolev, the Department of Russian Externes during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered through the portal of Julian Assange is smaller each time the cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high level of production of Pakistani nuclear armas.
A dispatch from the Embassy in May, which qualifies as "frustrating" communication with Pakistan, argues the following: "Transparency is frequently non-existent; the offers of help remain unanswered or are eliminated.".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, an official of the National Intelligence for south Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan has nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world.".
The Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by the head of the Army, Gen. Ashfaq Kayani, to understand it "very clear" to the charge that "the Army of Pakistan should end with the tacit support to terrorist groups.".
In the hunt of the head of Wikileaks
Obama a to a high official in the fight against terrorism to prevent new infiltrations.
Interpol issued a red alert to monitor the movements and locate to Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated maze where it is difficult to have a certainty on the facts.
Yesterday Interpol has issued a "red alert" to "locate and track movements" of Assange.
Nevertheless, it is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, it is not new, otherwise it datt of 20 November.
And it has nothing to even with the latest filtration of more than a quarter million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the charges of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, the creator of Wikileaks, lawyer Mark Stephens, said that "the police know where and how to contact Mr Assange.".
The 20 with the international police agency based in Lyon (France) has dictated the order to request for Sweden, but it has not made public until yesterday, after receiving the approval of the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol received an indication to identify or locate Assange "to get its provisional arrest and extradition.".
Although Interpol does not give the order to arrest an individual affected by a red alert, many member countries, according to the explanations of the organization, consider the appeal red notice a way for the arrest scrubbing the national police bodies must achieve, especially if they have a bilateral extradition, as is the case of Sweden and England, where we think that Assange is.
The movement has outraged the lawyers of Assange, who yesterday issued a letter faked the fact that the founder of Wikileaks, 39, has been prepared to respond by video conference to Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange has sought and obtained the licence to get out of Sweden, the prosecutor in his case, as compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of the security of Stalin.
"This appears to be a fighter, not a legal persecution," said the letter.
While the world the seeks - and Australia his mother defends the innocence of his son -- Assange continues to be in an unknown location, but it is not silent.
On Monday he gave at an undetermined location in an interview with the director of Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he has called for the resignation of the secretary of the state of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If we can show that it was responsible for giving orders to U.S. graduates that they eyeing to the UN in violating international treaties that the United States has signed, it should resign," he says.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who has described as "ridiculous and absurd" demand for resignation.
"I am not sure why the opinion of a type with a web page should look," déclaré-t-il for CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a high official of the fight against terrorism, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The trial of the spokesman for President Barack Obama to reduce the importance of Assange contrast with the views that politicians and conservative commentators proclaim these days.
Congressman Peter King, which from January will chair the Committee of National Security in the Lower House has asked the Department of State that it is studying the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organisations "to confiscate his funds and pursue anyone who provide them with contributions or assistance.".
Once later went to Tom Flanagan, an adviser to President Stephen Harper, who has come back on its statements after being told that Assange will "be assassinated.".
"Obama should turn in goal and to use a plane without a crew or something similar.".
A person who has not asked for an apology was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and a possible candidate for the presidency.
"Anyone who is in the Government, which has been leaked the information is guilty of treason and everything that is not an execution would be a punishment too kind," déclaré-t-il for Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in CRFs with wink at the devotees Carod
The Republican leader will give the party a secret voting on its continuity.
Huguet Executive proposes a more diverse and the end of the meeting.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe for solving the umpteenth internal revolt within CRFs, without north because of the loss of 11 members and half of the votes.
The president's party is aware of the fact that his resignation threat is not sufficient to followers of the former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now also diluted his liar and that it cannot possibly give him headaches he had with other common extinguished.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will win its new criticism with wink at which it can be air-tight up in municipal elections.
For a start, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national advisors to CRFs will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
For the letter-ballots, not in a show of hands.
If the carod want to convey a certain penalty vote to the president, they can do without fear of reprisal.
In fact, the head of ranks wants to avoid the image of division and bid to his person.
In several interviews he said that he would not be ratified with half a vote, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, as a result "in the Bulgarian" would not be good either.
The people close to Carod require the president a little more than put its position at the disposal of the militancy, a move that is not Puigcercós when the maxim control body between congress.
But because they did not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to register with the executive a road map until May.
For that, they hope to participate in the development of strategic reorientation that management will submit to the vote of the National Council on 18.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for the promise of it to plan the congress in the fall of 2011, what the leaders see as a course.
The leader of CRFs admitted that the "polyphonic" affect the stability and that its aim is to do that once and for all the organization is able to wash his laundry room in the family.
In this line, the article that the current adviser Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologue of Puigcercós, the owner of Innovació was thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" it is as if it was done.
And it has listed five, he points to two.
The first, "repack" the executive for it is at least 90% of the militancy, i.e., include new figures from the sector Carod aficionado.
The second may be the big news.
Huguet of liquid CRFs proposes that once and for all the assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, he defends a reform of the statutes that allow the achievement of the congress through of delegates elected by vote.
To finish with the model assembly, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has struggled in this direction in the last two Congresses.
In fact, hysterical the conclave of 2008 instructed management to review the model of meeting in a special congress of reform of the statutes.
The meeting remains unfinished, because the tide of recent years did not recommend this topic.
Now, without critical areas on the lookout, the time could be good for the resume and close it forever.

China maintains the objectives of reducing greenhouse gases
The representative of this country in the COP16 said that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and detailed that it maintains its offer to cut up to 2020 between 40 and 45 percent its emissions of greenhouse gases.
China maintains its offer to cut between 40 and 45 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, said Su Wei, representative of this country to the COP16.
In his first public appearance in the 16è Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei said that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and convert its industry.
In fact, exposé-t-il, the last four years the country has invert 245 million in efforts to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.
Nevertheless, it has clearly stated that China will not change its target, but it will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He noted that the Chinese strategy in the field of climate change is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; construction of institutions and support for pilot programs.
There has been progress in all these areas, ci-inclut approval last year, a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives addressed in relation to the reduction of greenhouse gases, has expliqué-t-il.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with the local government and to achieve the objectives of saving energy, use of energy efficient and reduce emissions.
In addition, déclaré-t-il, there are various multi-annual plans underway or completed, both funded by the Chinese government as by the governments of other countries.

Expulsion legal Espino: Cesar Nava
The national leader of NAP99 said that the former leader paniste has the right to apply to the Commission of National Order to claim that right.
The national leader of NAP99, Cesar Nava Vázquez said that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former leader paniste has the right to apply to the Commission of National Order to claim that right.
In the interview prior to the protests of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision adopted at the local level.
"It is an autonomous decision of the Commission of Order of Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to apply, where appropriate, by making a complaint to the Commission of Order of National Council, so that it is a decision in a competent organ," noté-t-il.
On the other hand, he was informed that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been on the negotiating table an alliance for the presidential nomination.
Nava Vázquez was convinced of the fact that Acción Nacional would be stronger after internal elections next December 4 and 5, which is expected to elect a successor.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is something that has never been on the table, at least for the moment, this has been an approach for the local elections that has been successful and achieved its objective," mentionné-t-il said.
The paniste leader said that NAP99 is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary" we relish and makes us stronger, "said déclaré-t-il.
He said that without doubt the Board will élégir the best leader / e including Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so it would give the notes "the person to be determined by the board."
"I am completely quiet and open, I would be proud to leave the office of president of the party to any of the five".
He forecast that the stimulus recorded by the party in past elections of July 4, will be looking to the next row, even if "this is not the time to think about 2012."
"At the moment it comes to accompany the governor Gabino Cué in this task.".
In this context, he stressed that the three governments from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a earth-observation right across the country, so that there was "a lot of hopes for them, and I'm sure Gabino will live up to expectations.".
When asked about the criticism of PRI against President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during its four years of government, Cesar Nava asked priistes to reflect on the six years of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari administrations.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo, Salinas were better than those of Fox is Calderón; they are starting to defend them; they come out of the cupboard," he says.
He said that the holder of the Federal Executive may be expressions such as those he made in his speech in the National Audience, because in the country there is no gag, and less still censorship.
Obama promoted by Twitter the law in favour of undocumented students
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, called silent senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitté the U.S. president in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama is meeting today to national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of the social network Twitter.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, called silent senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitté Obama.
His short message keeps open a cyber relationship with a document further asks the public to immediately contact the senators, because the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote expected soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he says.
The message was released after 42 Republican senators have threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of tax cuts to the time of Bush and government funding to continue.
Such Lock-in, announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
When asked about the Republican blocking the Dream Act and other projects, the presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confidant that once the problem is solved we can set a plooy for the rest of the projects.
"I think that we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we must solve the tax problem before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at a given moment in this direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he says.
The Democratic Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, said Tuesday that he would seek a "vote of closure of the debate" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be passed from next Thursday in the Senate, although the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the Act of the dreaming American would legalise 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before age 16, they stayed in the country the past five years and they have been accepted by an institution of higher education or by the Army.
But supporters need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they need the assistance of a large number of Republicans, in times when the project's partisan organizations protagonists intense lobbying to ensure approval of the Act.
The Democrats, the majority of which supported the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
But at least one of them, Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican has expressed its support for the bill, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
It is for this reason that supporters of the Dream Act require the votes of several Republicans if other Democrats decided to vote against the initiative.
Among Republicans the most courted the Maine senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and incumbent Senator George Lemieux, of Florida, who has completed the mandate to Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported in the past the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch, Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would not support it as another opportunity.
Another Republican who supported John McCain, has not defined its position so far.
Even if the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree with the fact that the biggest of the Dream Act in the Senate.
With the literature it puts its finger on the wound
The second phase of Plaisirs language was a walk in which participants flexed storytelling
"Sex in the language, I understand it, but... the nail on the head? that hopefully me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited has open the second phase of the Plaisirs of language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and this time has used the subtitle of his question (for a separate show the round table has been dedicated to the Sex in the language, expliqué-t-elle).
The finger on the wound "... puts us in embarrassment," said Argentine writer gently to the public, most young people, who had gathered at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and attended Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela has read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz has defined after as a great history, with Luisa in first person as a protagonist who seeks out what is the "wound," she goes from one doctor to another, without getting a response, only tracks in the same narrative thread.
In the public she is convinced: "patience is not my strong, it is perhaps my wound.".
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the trauma who has cut the breath in the middle of the lane, but who explained that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst that reveals the mystery: "the wound is opened in reality, the symbolism is the scar.".
The protagonist 1970s--which relieved and concludes: "on the wound I only know that it is in fact that is open and it is not there," but convinced of the fact that the pleasures and pitfalls of language must be very linked.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez has exposed as a beautiful narrative that he titled Éloge invention, where the finger on the wound is not enough but at any given time is discovered.
With overtones of magical realism, he speaks of a famous bewitched who was in receipt of clouds, was returning people who had gone far or repaired of the virtues that a damsel had lost, a narrative that veers to talk then America, the big news that has been from the beginning its own columnists and cited to Bernal Díaz del Castillo that criticizes the excesses of the conquerors narratives of capitan.
"Cervantes who we invented all (writers) made fun of false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but a aitre way you would never conté the history of America with an imagination that lacked even the indecent assault".
Nevertheless, "souligné-t-il," the fools and liars have the best imagination "and here the reality converges with the lie, we no longer know what part of the narrative belongs to a band or another, where the literature of fiction reached its peak.
We call this the 'tradition of Cervantes'.
"It is thanks to his legacy is what storytelling.".
In turn, the writer Mayra Montyero has annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the IBLE with its round table The must on the wound.
The Cubaine-portoricaine has put her on the scourge of the great social violence that his country is going through - and the Latin America division - product of -year-old disputes and the sale of drugs.
"I think the good literature, poetry good songs contain a commitment that is not obviously premeditated," indiqué-t-elle said, after just the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of engagement between the author and readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction".
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, who also stressed "this must on the head of the writer committed.".
It considered that in a world that lives in fast-train, also concerning intellectual habits and the control of consciences that turns to the benefit of abandoning, "behind each statement there is a small and behind every denial there is a small yes.".
"To be the masters of our own feelings and be the masters of reality, we must qualify: and nuance means a lot of times the finger on the wound and disturb the people who feel very convenient thinking in caricature, in black and white, established ideas and without nuance and disturb the powers who prefer a world in black and white," he says, by inviting to recover the meaning to write.
Romano in the hunt for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he was able to achieve three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are two different styles who face, marked by their technicians, who find them a sharp contrast with the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the final, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he was able to achieve three times the decisive series, although so far it has not put in the mile and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentine eventually console themselves with the medal, he remained a sous-champion behind the winners and oddly with the same team he has played consecutive finals.
The santiste strategist came to his first final as a me in the Tournament of Opening 2002, when he took the reins of Morelia with which it has lost with an overall score of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the Closing 2003 he's also got the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and this was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the Tournament Bicentenary 2010, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered a new setback, because his team did a like-for-like game to 2-2 against Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the series of penalties he got an advantage to 3-1 with two opportunities to win the title and eventually three of its players have missed 11 yards and he suffered the jump to the result of 4-3.
Rubén has lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, so it doesn't have the same fate, he tries to break the curse to celebrate for the first time a title, although he says that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I do not want to break any statistics, it is for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I've mentioned before is more important," said helmsman when asked what would be its weak points in the final.
He remembers much of the last final, which he says he has learned a lot, "the only lesson that we can accept is that until the arbitrator whistling the final, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in line, the players, too, because the last time, with two penalty kicks to draw we were already prepared to run and I believe that this is a lesson, before the end of the match, you can't celebrate.".
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worried, because he says in his players: "It is not ever to reach the round of penalty kicks, trying to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we have that we prepare, the tournament before we were prepared, unfortunately the fate we made a wrong turn, sometimes it is the emotions or anxiety to take the title in our hands, hands we escaped, it served as a lesson for this final and we hope that we can no longer in this situation-là.".
Romano now has the opportunity not to be a sous-champion technician and tea party for the first time the glory of the securities.
The European Union is changing the rules for the issuance of a visa
The people must go to the centres of Service for Non-refundable claimants Visa before their interview in the Consular Section; the cost the waiting time will be reduced.

The new procedure will present some advantages for candidates, among which is the following:
The total cost to deal with the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to get an appointment, another payment for the treatment of visa and another for mail service delivers the document.
The aspiring will make a one-time payment to cover the three services.

In any form, the creature uses the arsen as a way of life and it makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that were not our atmosphere.
According to the astrobiology, if these agencies use the arsen in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different to the one we know it.".

The tourist sites must be treated
The tourism entrepreneurs regret the crash of the foreign tourist because of poor conditions of the rond-point Sanchez Taboada to Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a trough of rond-point Sanchez Taboada, the tourism sector of Mazatlán, has asked the authorities that they pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor conditions and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Retailers of Zona Dorada, recalled that they have repeatedly requested that the image of the destination is treated and new activities must replace other than tourists are bad.
He said that the poor state of the streets and sidewalks affected because tourists come to walk and they see the disorder and avoid shops close.
"The politicians know only means closing a business one day and they do not know the fortune that it loses, they did not work for so long and without proper planning.".
The hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist has exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance of City Hall.
"The established as municipium must assume its responsibility and prevent this happening again, how to do it, and thus has a preventative maintenance and do just the remedy," he says.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only due to the fact that this is a tourist zone to maintain it, but as people who deserve a place to live and own the City must change its strategy to maintain the city.".
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, "he says, such as Escudo and Venadito of Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it is only the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he says.
"It is lent their attention that it should be and this type of facts said something that is well known to all, maintenance is necessary.".
Raúl Llera Martínez, under secretary of Promotion Touristique, said that the recovery of the tourist sites of Mazatlán is urgent, because they are not used properly and plan a bad image.

"Fortunately Mazatlán offers plenty of historical and cultural sites and places that you should order first, clean up and put us in line to make them attractive to be able to add to the inventory that we have to promote this destination.".
IP application results in Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of CEC-related, has proposed that MPs will take the major responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa because of various provocations to which confronts.
The business sector of Mazatlán seeks a Legislature of dignified work and free of agreements between the parties and the executive branch of government, because Sinaloa is turmoil and meets with major problems.
Yesterday we installed the 60-è legislature formed by seven political forces, 19 Members of PRI, 13 NAP99, three of the New Alliance Party, two of DRIPs, a TPs, one of Convergencia and PVEM, total 40 representatives popular.
The list of expectations that the new government congressional integrative management is a clean and engaged with society and different sectors that need a legislative work responsible and that the same models of spirit of party or paternalism will not be repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos, president of CEC-related, has proposed that MPs will take the major responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa because of various provocations to which confronts.
"We hope that the Members have actually their right, free of agreements between the parties as the custom is that they are the covenants to ensure their own interests and they become masquerade carnival of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions.".
That is why I ask that they certify the commitment to build the bridges that are the current Gouvernant forward.
"We will ensure that they do a credible job and especially committed with the company and the areas as people of Sinaloa have given their vote of confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association of Hotels Tres Islas, considered a major provocation of 40 representatives popular is pushing and add forces in seeking economic growth of the state, as the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and this in a way that will stimulate the generation of jobs.".
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new lawmakers give it the importance it has in the government budget to shore up the Governmental Secretariat of Tourism.
"I understand that this is the second Secretariat of the state with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as important economic activity and generator of foreign currency and investment and which competes directly with the Agri-Business.".

14 alleged drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in'Estrie, on Wednesday, in the framework of the dismantling of a network of production and sale of cannabis.
Fourteen people were arrested and will face various charges.
The searches were conducted in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used to produce the drug.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment used in the production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Surete du Quebec.
In all, 11 men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged heads of this network, two men of Sherbrooke.
Those arrested were due to appear in court in Sherbrooke in the hours after their arrest.
They could face charges of production of cannabis, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
The raid took place after a lengthy investigation, which lasted nearly a year.
"This is information received from the public that allowed us to make these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 officers of the Regional module of the'Estrie of the Sûreté du Québec, Service de police de Sherbrooke and Régie de police Memphrémagog, took part in this operation.
The illegal migration will continue without any problem.
The bill of conservatives who, according to the government, should address the problem of ships loaded with illegal migrants, will obviously be beaten while the three opposition parties have indicated Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I am relying heavily on the Charter."
"I am standing with a party that has created the granite beneath your feet," said the Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, while he was surrounded by deputies after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
Liberals argue that the bill as proposed, which would hold up to a year anyone from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Bloc Quebecois, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill, because he is attacking the wrong target.
"We are against and it seems that all the opposition parties are against, then we'll see what the government will do," said Mr. Duceppe.
The criticism of the NDP, Olivia Chow, dismissed out of hand the criticism that his party is not tough enough on illegal immigrants.
"The New Democrats agree to take action against smugglers of illegal immigrants and that is what we are doing through another bill, Bill C-35," said Mrs Chow.
"We do not support the bill conservatives because it takes to refugees and imprisoning children for at least a year," said Mrs Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney, has accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The Canadians say massively to MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations targeting Canada and treat the country as a doormat."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," said Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a confidence vote on his bill, which could lead the country to elections if his rejection.
A conservative, he told the QMI Agency that the government would seek a vote to each lawmaker who opposed it then explained to his constituents.
The new unit is not unanimous
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public inquiry into the matter.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea is not new: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation in New York on this matter as soon as January.
The city has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
Still, Tuesday's announcement has surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on police services from Quebec, on 29 October last year, this measure was never discussed, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It does not need more for the PQ critical public safety, Stephane Bergeron, calls this announcement "rabbit out of a hat" and "add-on solution on the corner of a table.".
The Minister Dutil has meanwhile responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unit.
"You'll see the result when we will announce, is therefore limited to say."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the QSF, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
"More Mr. Charest persists in not wanting to create the commission of inquiry, more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he said.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," said about him Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this impasse, it suggests to Quebec to give a special mandate for the Auditor General for investigation into collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," rubbishing.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, allowing it to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the boxes the Charest government.
Quebec also would seek to Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request emanate from the prosecutor of Operation Hammer, who has advised the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this kind of investigations.
The federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague, Justice Minister Rob Nicholson, is currently working on some amendments relating to this issue.
During the operation Spring 2001, which hit the motorcycle groups, even though the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people have been arrested.
Ottawa has subsequently passed the Act on the gangsterism.

As we must add the precipitation to the melting of the snow already accumulated in some sectors, there are fears the overflow of several rivers.
The flood alert warnings were issued Wednesday night by the Quebec Civil Security for rivers Ouareau and Achigan, in the Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, Saint-Jérôme in the Laurentians, and Chêne, in Parliament, was meanwhile under flood watches and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rains caused the overflowing lakes, Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
At Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was washed out because of heavy rain.
Ten homes were evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Ottawa, the outpouring of some lakes has resulted in the closure of several roads, including in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security remains on high alert and monitoring the situation closely, "said Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Centre for flood forecasting of Quebec has issued severe flood warnings for several rivers, including Maskinongé, The Assumption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and the Wolf.
Dupont partially after
The radio of Quebec Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) for controversial remarks on social assistance and Haitians and his foul language on air.
The CBSC judge that Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but that certain statements contained "incorrect information on social assistance, representations unduly negative Haitians and vulgar language that is not suitable for broadcast during the day.".
The Council also concluded that a discussion about the suicide, including the release of the names of two people who were suicide, did not violate the codes on broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints about comments made during programmes broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Common Front of Quebec social Computer-Aided.
The group complained that the amounts cited in the programme were inaccurate.
The facilitators are to present solid information rather than misleading.
With regard to the suicide, the facilitator Stéphane Dupont said that suicide is an act of a coward.
The majority of the Committee concluded that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes involved" Dupont the noon "have touched on a sensitive issue in a fair and appropriate."
No blame has therefore been withheld at his place.
The latest dispute centred on statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort were then delivered to a media standoff that had generated a lot of reactions.
The facilitator of CHOI said he had made no donation to help the Haitians because we could not know with certainty that the needy people really would receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but their cumulative effect is a negative unduly representation of Haitians.
"I have served my suspension three days on that."
"My file is blank for a year and a half," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of foul language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM worked "beyond its obligation.".
The consequences are minimal for the station that will, among others, announce these decisions once during prime time in three days.
A King of craig in Montreal
The Algerian-born Montrealer Nacereddine Zemmal 4.6-kilometer has a very particular.
The athlete who excels in "sanda craig" (" full contact "), boxing and Thai Kickboxing is mat on the 11-year and the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts as the craig and the Kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, said Zemmal, installed in the city since 2008 to evolve among professionals."
"In my case, I am seeking fighting everywhere, as for those who don't like the ground game now in mixed martial arts competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the one who works as a security officer and as a clerk for the company UPS has just issued bad news to its rivals, winning two gold medals in the Amateur Championship of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the Kickboxing classes full contact and Thai boxing, he said."
"Right now, I am preparing to go to China for the World Cup of san shou."
"The veterans who have finished among the top four at the last world championship in each category were invited."
"I won the bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, China, I have concluded the tournament ranked fifth, while I came third in Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What is interesting is that I have made progress in each competition."
"At this rate, I will be first this time around or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline from China where punched and kicked, and projections on the ground, are allowed.
The shootouts are originally on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The bogdan the most famous of this form of combat is the American man of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, recognized in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has learned that a single event in his career, he will certainly his presence in the super- tournament "King of Sanda," the Super Bowl of craig.
"This competition is most evident and most prestigious in China," said the stocky sympathetic. "
"It is a bit of the equivalent-to-spouse Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stage of Thailand)."
"it has been a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semi-finals of its class (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"Anyone who defeated was a real pro, he analyzed."
"There are four veterans by category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals are clashing in the final of their class."
"Then, the winners of each category will face to crown a single champion, the king of the craig."
450 million in contracts without bidding
Hydro-Québec has given over-the-counter 450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium of firms OPI, Dessau, SM and Montreal-based Axor who got the most important, the stewardship of the project, to $295 million dollars without bidding.
The consortium called Energy stewardship was formed in 2004 concurrent Hydro-Québec in the private sector's responsibility for managing this important hydroelectric project of 5 billion.
In early 2005, the consortium Energy stewardship landed the lucrative contract without public bidding.
For the Parti Quebecois, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and result in higher prices.
"This is the new way of making the collusion and shoot down the competition."
"It is the people, instead of making it a secret, now do it openly," said yesterday the PQ MP Sylvain Simard in press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard has raised the issue at the National Assembly because it is difficult to see how the public interest can be served this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, countered in the afternoon, vigorously denying that there has been collusion for the contract.
"I'm starting to have my trip," she pneumonic, arguing that the PQ had been "dishonest" and had "failed rigour".
She said that "it would be the least" that the PQ apologizes.
The formula consortia is a common practice in the world.
It is usually an alliance limited in time that allows two or more companies to consolidate their respective expertise to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The project Eastmain has a high level of complexity given the scale of the work.
The site is under way and is due to run until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition from; there had been negotiations.
So, the formula consortia is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week, Le Devoir, the formula consortia in the engineering sector is being investigated by the government.
A quick overview of the business register of Quebec can count more than 200 consortia, some of whom appear to be permanent.
For example, the firm Dessau works in partnership with most of its major competitors, whose Génivar CIMA +, SNCLavalin, and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, back to a single legal entity, Dessau.
With respect to the consortium stewardship, Energy Minister Normandeau stressed that "the James Bay Territory responds to the dynamics of labour and that Hydro-Québec responds to particular way since the 1970s.".
The big boss of the project Eastmain, Réal Laporte, the James Bay Energy Corporation (SEBJ), gave an explanation that raises eyebrows on the fact that the contract of stewardship of the project has been awarded contracts.
"If you're going to tender and that there was little bidders, your price will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take people who are in this market and you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that this is not the price that is important, it is the responsibility of the people," said Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the consortium Energy stewardship is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Quebec or SEBJ Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert for the project.
After verification, Le Devoir has counted 109 consulting contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including laboratories of soil.
SNCLavalin took 22 contracts, Génivar in scored 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not to mention her participation in Energy Stewardship.
All contracts were negotiated.
They account for 449 783, including the $344 contract to Energy stewardship of 295 131 $564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (OPI, Dessau, SM and Montreal-based Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec.".
The Minister Normandeau dropped that the PQ is also linked to these firms that the "fund", adding that it was more of its leaders.
Barometer responsible consumption - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More green, but frankly sceptical.
The consumer confidence in Quebec made very few actors of sustainable development, but also fair trade certification and greenification to guide its choice.
Worse, even if it is carried in a media universe where messages in favour of a more responsible consumption abound, there is a lack of credible information, act as brake even to its commitment, Barometer indicates the responsible consumption, the first reading of which was delivered yesterday.
Even if they have increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them are in fact not believe environmental commitment of companies like the green advertising companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Centre of responsible consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another observation: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official qualifications on so-called fair, but also the credibility of products and brands if healthy-weight as responsible, said the Barometer.
In the same vein, the speeches of politicians on this theme is taken seriously by only 14.6 percent of Quebecers.
The information responsible consumption, it seems essential to stimulate this lively timber-frame consumption by almost one-third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the gap and the eyebrow-raising nature of the information rebuilt the ardour of 46% of consumers.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
Separately, a third of Quebecers say they are also wary about the performance of alleged green products or services that are trying to put their hands.
On another note, consumers have been nearly half in 2010 to have changed their habit and especially changed mark of one or more products to meet their belief.
At $61%, they have also fostered of purchases from merchants in their neighborhood and privileged buying food grown in their region, said the Barometer.
More green and responsible - the index of responsible consumption has reached 64 on a maximum of 100 this year - Homo consumus Quebec likes to present himself as the king of recycling that seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by concern for the protection of animals.
But his social and ecological conscience, however, appears to stay out of his car, said the Barometer: in 2010, only 28 percent of Quebecers said they used public transit or have advocated the Green car-pool to defend their interests.
Walking and cycling have also been supported by 39.1 percent of the participants in this vast behavioral survey, which has just taken his first cliche.
A loan for the takeover of eXcentris
The government of Quebec, who has been asked to commit financially in the movie complex takeover of eXcentris by Angus and Parallel, agrees to cooperate, but for a loan only.
The Société de développement Angus and Parallel, who had hoped a gift of seven million of the Ministry of Culture to redeem at Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on Boulevard Saint-Laurent him in restoring its full role theres, don't get what they demanded.
The government agrees to become involved in the issue, but on its own terms.
Rather than the split-receipting expected, the Quebec government proposes a loan which would be lower than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution to in-coming, at least in the view of sources from pharmacies in the state.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and a plan of action have been sent to the Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who runs the record of eXcentris.
It sent a final report 10 days ago.
But the counterproposal cabinet is received at the SODEC Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until 31 December to respond.
It seems, however, that the assumption of the gift of the state should really be ruled out.
It should be noted that the Association of drive-in owners and cinéparcs of Quebec objected to a direct investment of the state to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture did not to finance real estate projects, it has not done for other movie theaters.
But several stakeholders demanded a substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the onus of proving with for 10 years has been at arm's length film in its premises of the complex after having financed his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is shouting at Montreal, and eXcentris was able to retain its customers.
The Corporation Angus and Parallel, led by Christian Yaccarini, fly, on their side, a private fundraising campaign, hoping to collect $700,000 to push at the wheel of the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of the three screens, The Parallel, continues to release movies in eXcentris.
The purpose of the buy-side future is to reopen the three rooms on 27 February projecting the very beautiful film Xavier Beauvois men and the gods.
But Christian Yaccarini has not recalled Le Devoir and it is unclear what he and his group believe the proposals down that they are made.
The veil lifted on a 1.2-hectare...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables disclosed by WikiLeaks to lift the veil on what the United States consider the inferiority complex of Canadians to the Americans, but they betray the same time the sense of superiority of the latter to Canada.
For example, American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian elector has not Canada-U.S. relations in mind to vote and believe that the visit of President Obama has helped the Conservative government to pass its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, over public yesterday, offer more titbits that the substantive content to put themselves under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in a federal election campaign, recounts how the United States are not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
At the astonishment of the US ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanation for this situation.
"A Canadian inferiority complex is perhaps the inherent almost Canadian political leaders to talk about everyday domestic issues rather than focus this election on the United States (as in the campaign on free trade, 1988)," he wrote.
The United States is therefore, he said, "the proverbial elephant in this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk about it.".
The ambassador includes less this "deafening silence" that the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically, he said, the ability of a candidate, party and even more of a party leader to manage this crucial relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind to vote."
The other expression of this sense of importance reads in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, charge d'affaires in Ottawa, preparing for President Barack Obama on his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help to ensure the survival of the government in the vote of confidence early February on the federal budget, for which Canada will post its first deficit in more than a decade because of a stimulus package of 30 to 40 billion dollars," wrote Mr Breese.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas to avoid being ousted by the coalition and the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the recovery plan proposed.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington from the increasingly negative image of drama series that aired on CBC refer to the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about emissions Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are few subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or abductions to CIA interrogation.
Another cable recounts that, at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton has asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some prisoners to Guantánamo.
Mr Kouchner said yes, but on the basis of "case by case.".
At the end of the meeting, it said, "he submitted a paper to the secretary of state in respect of Omar Khadr, a Muslim of 15 years of Canadian origin."
"The secretary has agreed to review the issue.".
Finally, tempers running high on the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC that the head of this mass exodus should be "murdered".
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renovate the'Éclairage
The UN has proposed yesterday in Cancún a renovation plan domestic lighting, commercial and industrial in 100 countries seeking a reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) which is almost a third of the additional reduction that it must do to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
The ambitious plan is in the wake of big concrete projects that the UN hopes to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding commitments to cut by industrialized countries.
According to the plan filed yesterday, if the incandescent light bulbs who monopolise still 50 to 70 percent of the market were replaced by light bulbs, or better, cfl light bulbs with light-emitting diodes (LEDs or "LED" in English), most of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHG issued on the planet to inform humans would be avoided.
The'Éclairage is responsible for 8 percent of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen, last year, the major emitting countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, have engaged in voluntary reduction plans that should get the overall GHG emissions of 53 Gt to 49 gigatonnes.
But it will reduce the toll still 5 gigatonnes to achieve by 2020 to stabilize climate rise to 2 degrees centigrade, so that it becomes out of control.
In the incandescent light bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates as heat and the remaining 5%, produces light.
With cfl light bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, reducing the need for energy twice.
The cfl bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those that launched the manufacturer Philips this week - the company has been involved in the study of the UN - have a life expectancy of 25 000 hours and consume 80 percent less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives an idea of the economy with an alternative plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These all new bulbs can also work with rhéostats in addition to providing very little heat.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several experts showed concern with the cfl light bulbs because they contain mercury and eliminate them as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the manufacturers put in place guidance.
But, the report says, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not compact fluorescent light bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent light bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25 000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that would each country through the international agenda.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars a year in purchases of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 thermal power stations whose construction would cost it 2.5 billion.
The Ivory Coast expected in nervousness the announcement of election results
The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, called for the release "without delay" the results of the presidential election in Ivory Coast, after the expiry of the deadline.
"The Secretary General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce provisional results without further delay," said a spokesman for the UN chief. "
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to take responsibility and to refrain from any move until the announcement of provisional results."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission has missed the deadline of Wednesday midnight without results, three days after the election.
About 40 minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the president of the IECs had said that the Committee "continued to work" to announce the results.
The calls 2,520-mile Wednesday in the world for the CIS proclaims the name of the winner of the second round between President Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the annulment by the Constitutional Council votes "fraud" in the north, held by the rebel New Forces (FN) since the failed coup of September 2002.
Pascal Affi Guessan Don, campaign director of the Ivorian President, said that the intimidation of voters by the FN in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the incumbent president to vote.
All the election could be canceled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are selected by the Constitutional Council.
However, opponents of Gbagbo believe that the country's highest court is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man who denies any link with the rebels, said it was "unacceptable" the delay in announcing the results and called on Gbagbo to respect them, but it's not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies say that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and file a complaint with the Constitutional Council, after have prevented the electoral commission to release the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election, on Sunday, was supposed to cap the process of reunification and reconciliation to a country remained split into two for years.
The United Nations warned on Wednesday the Ivorian political class that she could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished at the top of the first round, on 31 October, with 38 percent of the vote against 32% to Alassane Ouattara, who received the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France in the 3rd quarter
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Labour Office (ILO) has remained stable, at 9.3 percent in mainland France (9.7% cash in the overseas departments), show the data seasonally adjusted provisional (CVS) published Thursday by the Insee.
The number of unemployed is 2,631 million in mainland France.
The data in the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3 percent of the workforce in mainland France and 9.7% with the overseas departments.
On a year, the unemployment rate up 0.1 point poster.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they are available in two weeks to work and they are looking for a job.
The situation of young people on the labour market have worsened, with a further rise in the unemployment rate, increased to 24.2% in mainland France (+ 0.9 point in three months, + 0.5 point for one-year) and 25% by including the overseas departments.
In the third quarter, 637 000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
Senior citizens, for their part, have experienced a slight rise in unemployment, to 6.4% in mainland France (+ 0.2 point in three months and a year), or 482 000 people 50 or older, and 6.6% with the overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 years received a stable unemployment in the third quarter, to 8.3 percent in mainland France (-0.1 point in three months, + 0.1 point in a year) and 8.8% across France.
The Insee does not publish more monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a controversy over his method of calculation.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency, continues on the other hand, and on Tuesday announced a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October after 9.9 percent in September.
Alexander Guérini indicted and detained
Alexander Guérini, 53, leader of waste treatment companies and brother of the president of the General Council of PS Bouches-du-Rhône, has been indicted and jailed to house arrest of Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into the alleged procurement fraud.
Alexander Guérini was indicted for abuse of social goods, and embezzlement of public property, concealment, bribery, influence peddling and being in possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexander Guérini is combative and wishes to explain himself on all the issues that the judge will ask him, not fantasies."
"It is easy to continue for a variety of leaders, it is another thing to prove," he told AFP her lawyer, Florence Rault, before the hearing of his client.
Mr Guérini's brother, the strongman of the Socialist Party in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, held, through his lawyers, to get to the judge before his hearing a memo to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also indicted Wednesday night and arrested.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything other than run landfills that he had to manage.
As for the award of contracts or destination of funds related to their functioning, he has never seen, "said Mr. Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, now-former general of the town of Aubagne, was indicted Wednesday for misuse of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with ban to meet with the parties to the case.
"My client was able to provide explanations to the charges against him."
"The judge has given by depriving him no freedom," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were charged and released on Tuesday night, with placement under judicial supervision for two of them, said the deputy prosecutor of the Republic Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General at the cleanliness of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is being sued for "influence peddling and bribery.".
Two officials of the town of Aubagne, Michele Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are indicted for "removal and misappropriation of public property by a person to a public service mission," the other for "complicity in misappropriation of public funds.".
Finally the companion of Alexander Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, has been under investigation for "concealing abuse of social goods.".
Among those who have been facing Stephane Brunengo-Girard, Mr. Guérini was arrested recently in a parallel case of procurement fraud relating to Corsica.
Investigators suspect its companies to have been used to launder money from crime.
The investigation is being conducted in the framework of several legal information available against X in April 2009 following anonymous letters, for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, especially in the waste stream.
A source close to the investigation, the investigation is focusing in particular on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill of La Ciotat, which collects the waste of Aubagne and some towns in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Case Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than 10 months from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for espionage, held the opinion on tenterhooks in France, put diplomacy on alert and increased the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
The all under the watchful eyes of diplomats from the United States.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by The World reveal some below this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained his strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice for the treatment of their own crises of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of backpackers.
They show how French officials have sought to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman had not had to return for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by the U.S. Justice for smuggling materials for the benefit of Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they put under a harsh light how the French Presidency sought to manipulate the media to give credence to the idea that the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on August 12, 2009 in Paris is titled "Iran: French comments on how to handle cases of hostages.".
The Elysée adviser for strategic affairs, Francois Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay to North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talking with the US diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do so, to repatriate their nationals selected of force in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "emphasise" in the media constantly the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate release".
He needed to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive about its image.
"Do it all the more the Iranians ask you not to do so.".
Because, past attempts to discussions by quiet channels, "the silence will not solve anything," the Iranians are "masters in delaying tactics.".
Mr Richier added that the arrest of foreigners is "a tactic familiar: the Iranian hostage to political blackmail.".
He announced that the prison release of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on August 16, the day she sought refuge at the French Embassy) "will require the payment to the Iranians of a large sum of money" (230 000 euros bail).
And he indicated that the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon which "will worsen.".
The Iranians may stop "in the near future another of some 1 800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is out of jail for 12 days, but remains blocked in Iran.
An information is disseminated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, including the United States wants extradited to an illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris, on decision of a judge.
The U.S. Embassy, as many observers, is mulling over this troubling coincidence.
For Washington, which tracks the Iranian clandestine networks equipment procurement for the nuclear program, the enlargement of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
France she accepted a bargain?
The release of the Iranian against that of the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on 4 September, Francois Richier ensures that this is not the case.
The Elysée Palace, he says, has not only been "completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision," but sought to oppose it.
"There has been heated exchanges between the French Presidency and the Keeper of the Seals" (at the time, Michele Alliot-Marie), but "the French government can't get back on the court decision", he said.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" supervision of the French intelligence services.
The Elysée adviser composed a phone number, oyebola, and then informed the US diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian Embassy.".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée is sparing no effort, through press releases and "leaks" in the media, to make people believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays a role "important" and "impact" of "mediator".
The Americans are watching this activity without irony, and found that the manipulation is bearing fruit as several news articles affect French the official version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 refers to "the French official media blitz '.".
What is based "gratitude" expressed to Assad, is asking the embassy in Paris.
"Despite their statements full of praise, French officials acknowledge privately that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done.".
The document then examines the reasons that led the office to pay in this fiction.
The intense effort of communication "to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria," he said.
A policy launched in 2008, "which was perceived by many critics in France and abroad, as premature and undeservedly criminalised".
In "exaggerating the role of Syria," Paris seeks to "demonstrate to Syria which praises it can draw in playing a constructive role in the region.".
The aim is also to "sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran.".
The US embassy knows of good source.
On August 11, Francois Richier told him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we have thanked anyway."
"This should at least confuse the Iranians.".
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy received at the Elysee Palace.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria, for their "active role for the release of our compatriot.".
No games in line for the young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law known as the "Cinderella" which prohibit teenagers playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask companies to online games to block access to these games after midnight, young people under the age of 16 years, said representatives of the ministries of culture and family.
"A lot of children play in these games all night and then have difficulty to study at the school and to have a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is needed to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, the ministry official in charge of the bill.
Online games will be available again at 6 o'clock in the morning.
The companies will have a year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government also plans to ask companies to limit the time daily access to these games for young people whose parents so request, the official said.
It will also be available to people who are calling for free software to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" and newspapers regularly reported events related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of online gaming world competitions.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, with 58 other nations.
2018-2022: FIFA World Cup host countries means
In turmoil because of suspicions of corruption, the executive committee of FIFA designates Thursday host countries for 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a highly political choice where the struggle for influence and lobbying could not take on the technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the competition Queen of FIFA will take place in Europe, traditional stronghold of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Espagne-Portugal, Pays-Bas-Belgique).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its introduction in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of prominent part of delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Jose Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the Dutch and Belgian government leaders, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) shows the extent of the economic issues and policies of a World Cup.
The backroom dealings are likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the evaluation report from FIFA, English, hispano-portugais (2018) and American (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations do not weigh very heavy for the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, the source of the revelations that led to the suspension for bribing two members of the EC (Amos Adamu and Reynald Temarii), could have ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football which has hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
The BBC has handed a coat, on Monday, making a documentary that pin three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What piss FIFA and embarrass the English officials, who have engaged in an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron first in line.
The head of the government hopes to repeat the shot managed by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained in 2005 to London the organization of JO-2012.
This flurry of activity be enough to boost the image of England with the EC?
Nothing is less safe because the duo Espagne-Portugal does not lack of assets with its stadiums ready, his expertise (Mondial-82 JO-92, Spain Euro-2004 in Barcelona, Portugal) and its culture soccer.
But the gloomy economic and financial prospects of the two countries could shower their ambitions.
The retaliation against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the rating of Russia, has become a normal-weight outsider despite the shortcomings of his record (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided not to make the journey to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote," in a thinly veiled reference to the English press charges against the members of the EC.
"They are covered in mud, trying to compromise," said Putin.
For 2022, the United States, the experience of 1994, are emerging as the logical favorites.
First world economic power, the seat of the main sponsors of FIFA, the country seems to have an edge on Japan and South Korea, who built separately a very beautiful project.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries co-hosted the event in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of the Mondial-2026 to China, highly desired by FIFA, which would make obsolete the chances of Asia-based for 2022.
With Qatar, who pulled the big game by proposing futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA will continue its expansion into new areas, but these two countries pose more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of TV rights paid (because of the time difference) by European countries, the sinews of war to FIFA.
The clear mandate:
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand did believe that he was afraid.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac have not the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
A mandate to the Elysée called another.
So the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not mix well with the share of mystery attached to the presidential office.
So we must act as if the question still existed.
In a sense, as in the other.
In 2006, even without believe this, friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On 15 November, with a serious air, Sarkozy said he would take his decision "somewhere in the fall of 2011.".
What he refers to parliamentarians UMP, Tuesday night at the Elysee Palace, the prospect of "two terms" has caused a bit of a buzz.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
It was a long way away.
The president did that remind you that the constitutional revision of 2008 limited to two five-year terms.
It was a fact, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he refers to the presidential election, the tone of humor, at such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you have yet to seven and a half years with me," he launched in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't believe that I am not considering the step after that."
His remarks the day before yesterday does not make it more then-candidate than the day before; they are not less.
If they raise comments, it is for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the nomination, the PS.
But it is not the entry standing of Segolene Royal, Nicolas Sarkozy is to unveil.
That is because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many in the party are calling for a formal order of battle earlier than expected.
The bad polls.
For the first time the right-wing voters would prefer the nomination of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46 percent to 44 percent, according to BVA-L' Express).
"We have a candidate and there was no discussion of the UMP on this," cautiously reacted immediately and the Prime Minister's inner circle.
"If he believes the defeat as possible, it will not be a candidate," said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"It will always be able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the obvious.
Euro: forced the ECB to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be an opportunity to clarify the terms of a crisis, or at least, to announce the judgment of a number of unconventional monetary policy must be 05.50 at the end of the year.
European sovereign debt crisis, the Institute of Frankfurt will probably not afford to be as compelling subject to aggravate a tense situation today in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, the French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, has welcomed the active role played by the ECB in favour of the resolution of the debt crisis of the state in Europe.
She declined to say whether she felt that the central bank should do more, increasing by example its program of purchasing sovereign bonds.
"I reserve my reflection in my European partners...".
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the president of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, has not been more endanger about his intentions, saying only that the program to buy government securities in the secondary market "continued," and that "we will see what we decide" at the meeting this Thursday.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main interest rate unchanged at 1 percent, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the Treasury bond purchases by the ECB have doubled last week, to nearly 1.35 billion euros.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have made new purchases of securities Irish and Portuguese, yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem bought for 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among market participants, expectations of continued purchases are no doubt (see page 29).
Economists either did not expect significant change of course.
If the lending operations to more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB, the latter is still unlimited allowances according to conditions and generous liquidity for periods from one week to three months.
Economists now expect that the scheme will be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine that it varies significantly his program."
"Otherwise it would be taking the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," said Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A gradual exit announced during the first quarter 2011 seems more likely," anticipates his side Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions in the market of public debt, "the ECB should maintain a purchase volume of these obligations to pep up a sluggish market," said Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposure to the markets of a eurozone sovereign debt, the central bank has no other choice than to maintain its presence on the market.
"He is a substitute for the lack of investors on the market and act in such a way as to prevent a runaway yields paid by the most fragile states," reflected an important bond manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates are soaring, states will be even more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not the stabilizing.
The protection is the price of the euro.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is round the back
After an early week worrying for Italy, the situation is a little bit relaxed, yesterday, with the ebb 10-year bond rates.
A return to calm.
In emerged from a meeting with the Minister of the Economy, the chairmen of the area said they heard Giulio Tremonti called the situation "indecipherable" and expect a weekend "unpredictable", which he then denied.
On Tuesday, in any case, the spread with German long rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of contracts to hedge against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) was flying to 263 points, causing some panic in Rome.
The Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi has noted that in Spain, the spread with German rate was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "deeply concerned" by "the market turmoil and a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, a third of the euro zone economy, is not as Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, the problem is the lack of weak growth and tax revenues that goes with it, making the state run the risk of not being able to cover its funding needs.
The latest forecast from Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
The Italian growth is now expected to 1.1% in 2011 and to 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under consideration in the Senate on 1.3 percent and 2 percent respectively.
In these conditions, calculates the European Commission, the public deficit will still 4.3% of GDP next year (compared with 3.9 percent forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new budgetary measure that could be put in place after the holidays, for a $7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will be taken," said the Commissioner for economic affairs, Olli Rehn.
For now, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The fundamentals of the economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been saying for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, an Italian director at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy to the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate future, nor in the short or long term, because despite its large debt (119.2 percent of GDP in 2011,", stabilization efforts requested in Italy are lower than those charged to other countries, "said Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OECD.
There remains the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a censure motion in the House of Deputies, after which early elections could be held in late March.
If would open a period not conducive to the decision in the case of a serious crisis.
The Europeans think the strengthening of anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde has yet said yesterday in a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I believe that it still has demonstrated Sunday in the day and into the night, are obviously Solidarity-based, determined, committed to defend their currencies and monetary zone."
Although all relative, the trigger registered yesterday on the rates of European government bonds has brought to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But you can't even talk of an early normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's said it may downgrade the mark of Portugal's debt, target the most referred today by speculation.
"As in May, there was a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs on the banking systems," said economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since "the time is much slower than the time of the markets.".
Aware of this gap and the dangers that it contains, European countries are stepping up talks to strengthen existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal consultations between finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their peers of the G20 are going well.
And in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin early next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the menu, the fate of unconventional measures to support countries in the euro zone in the crosshairs of markets (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began Tuesday in Singapore a tour of Asia to inform investors asian developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it is certainly the ground.
The first of the EFSF are scheduled next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase of funds raised by an additional direct involvement of the IMF.
The countries that are first in line, Portugal and Spain, for their part, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that add to the austerity measures to effect closer.
Lisbon and Madrid want to borrow a way different from those of Greece and Ireland.
Both are at all costs to avoid asking international support before putting up their own budget adjustments and structural reforms needed to restore lasting confidence.
The European lenders, finally, talking about the options available to speed up the process of normalisation of sovereign bond markets.
While in Paris, the 24 November, Axel Weber had the first advanced the idea that if the €750 billion mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to call out to the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the market of the European sovereign-debt, believe that an increase of about 100 billion euros would be enough, "preferably" in the form of direct injection of cash.
The vehicle is there: it is the European financial stabilisation mechanism has, to date, 60 billion euros.
A council which is likely to be carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions were getting worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in Orange sharp-eyed
The episodes pack are still difficulties, particularly on the secondary network in Britain, and disrupt certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in Orange sharp-eyed because of the risk of ice and snow.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Deux-Sèvres and Vienna, have added to the 20 departments already in sharp-eyed orange, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne, Gironde, later in the night.
According to Meteo France, snow showers supported affect the north of the Gironde Charente and snow and low on the Ile-de-France.
The layers of snow ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters, punctually 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and 1 to 3 centimeters, or up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of the Charente and Charente-Maritime, Côtes Armor, Finisterre, Dordogne, Gironde, and those of the Poitou Basse-Normandie regions, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The episodes pack are significant enough to create difficulties of movement and disrupt certain economic activities, warns Meteo France.
In the Côtes Armor, several departmental were banned to heavy goods vehicles over 7.5 tonnes, in which the axes Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The movement on the secondary network in Britain is very difficult, according to police who recommend not to take his vehicle that in case of need and the movement of some buses B was suspended for the day.
The school transport have been banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measure was considered Wednesday night to restrict the movement of heavy-hitters.
The prefecture "urges all motorists to the utmost caution on the roads and adapt their driving accordingly.".
The Civil Aviation Directorate (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel Thursday 25 percent of their flights at the airport outside Paris and 10% at Orly because of snow ahead.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers to contact their airline.
In Britain, the Gatwick airport south of London, and Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Great Paris Métro financial sketches first:
Since the time that the debate around the modernisation of transport in Ile-de-France is in full swing, the billions are raining down.
In the discussion at least.
It mentions in particular 23 billion for the subway Grand Paris that must build the Society of Greater Paris.
To start the GSP, the state has announced an investment of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical, it is this which will then to the GSP to borrow on the markets a share of the funding of his double loop.
Today, it finally comes to the first additions.
The Finance Bill amendment 2010, examined in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the devices to find the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special tax of equipment and a tax increase on the offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, said in the text of the draft law, Article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Corporation of Greater Paris".
It is encrypted: "The proceeds of this tax is $117 million euros a year.".
The second is a redevelopment of a tax on the offices that already exists "to modernize, to increase the product and allocate the increase to the Society of Greater Paris".
This would bring how much?
Mystère.
This is not encrypted in the text.
It is a far cry from the 4 billion.
"It is clear that these tax money is in addition to the €4 billion of capital endowment that will be mobilized by the state and made to the Corporation of Greater Paris as the project," it said in the statement of reasons.
At the GSP, we do not find it shocking.
"From the moment when we created (the two taxes," we can cover the studies over three years and then type in the 4bn, after it explain it. "
"It will be entered in the budget and fired as".
The GSP estimates that 4 billion will begin to be enrolled in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the 4 billion promised are still no response, likely to cause a parliamentary discussion a little restless.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Hackers revenge and spies in care
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it is a manifest scandal, a scandal that appears as scandal that before the hypocrisy governing relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other, it announces major changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by the regression.
But are in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, this is confirmation of the fact that each case constituted by a secret service (from any nation) is composed exclusively of press clippings.
The "gee-whiz" US revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those which Berlusconi owns), and the profile eerily caricature of Gadhafi was long on the cabaret artists to sketch.
The rule that the secret files should be compounds that new already known is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you go into a bookstore devoted to arcane publications, you will see that each book again (on the Holy Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château Templiers, or Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in previous books.
And not only because the author of texts under-the-table don't like to do original research (and does not know where to look for news on the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to the occult only believe in what they already know, and reconfirms what they had already learned.
It is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
Ditto for the secret files.
The informant is lazy, lazy and limited of mind (or) the head of the secret service (otherwise it could be, whatever, editor of Libération), which is as true that what he acknowledges.
The top secret information on Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy in Rome sent to the State Department were the same as those that Newsweek published the week before.
So why the revelations on these issues have made so much noise?
On the one hand, they say that any person cultivated already knows that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the heads of state can call or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic service and, with the exception of a few small exercises of representation, have turned into centres of espionage.
Any viewer films of inquiry knows very well that, and it is only by hypocrisy that we are pretending to ignore it.
However, the repeated publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and is used to place in a bad light American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker can capture the secret any more secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
The scandal Does does not so much in crisis victims that the "torturers".
But come to the very nature of what happened.
Once upon a time, at the time of Orwell, it could design all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy was completely proved since, that can control every movement through the phone, each transaction, the hotel visited, the highway used and so on, citizens became the victim of the eye of power.
But when shows, as it happens now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the monitoring report ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
The power control every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - vengeful elected as the citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How a power that no longer has the opportunity to retain its own secrets can it take?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a real secret is a secret vacuum empty secret (and will never be unveiled); it is true, also, that know everything about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually a secret empty of secrecy, because in the public domain, but reveal, as did WikiLeaks, that Hillary Clinton's secrets secret were empty means to remove any power.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy and Merkel, but made too much to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is clear that in the future, states will no longer be able to get online any information burqa-clad - it would publish it on a poster pasted around the corner.
But it is also clear that with the current technology, it is vain hope to maintain confidential reports by telephone.
Well, it's easy to find out if and when a head of state moved by air and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can be maintained in future reports private and reserved?
I know that, for now, my prediction is the sci-fi and therefore is fiction, but I'm forced to imagine government agents who move discreetly in due diligence uncontrollable routes, disease-carrying is that of messages learned by heart or, at most, by concealing the rare written information in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be stored in a single copy in drawers locked: basically, the Watergate espionage-related attempt has been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is now in crab-fishing, i.e. going backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has reinstated a telegraph on son (voice-grade).
The video (analog) had allowed the researchers to explore a movie not film, not to go forward and backward and discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now the CD (digital) do that to skip chapter by chapter, i.e., by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, we are going to Rome to Milan in three hours, while air travel, and it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is not extraordinary that the policy and communications technologies in return for cars on horseback.
A final observation.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what went on in the secrecy of the embassies.
At present, these are embassies which requested the confidential information to the press.
Climate: how France quick its promises of funding
A year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to examine the promises of funding quickly released (pre-IPO fast start funding early or) made by developed countries.
And the big cobble French are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries are committed to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France 1,26 billion euros ($420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU has pulled out the big game to persuade its partners in the reality of its commitment to the fast start: report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, large side event, distribution of leaflets...
The operation transparency is welcome and appreciated: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announcement have reached in 2010 euro2.2 billion, which puts it on the right path to respect its commitment to 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, after the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional", so as to ensure that an additional effort is made without being at the expense of official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what it means to "new and additional".
While the Commission had proposed a harmonization, some member states, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, people choose the reference that best suits them.
The European Commission has, for example, seen as referring the year 2009: the international financing are maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years of funding fast start.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of the year or in terms of the level of official development assistance.
In contrast, France believes that the funding of "all new projects" of 2010 are "new and additional".
In other words, there was no reference to the previous years' expenditures or to the overall level of official development assistance.
In practical terms, the total amount of French support for developing countries can remain stable (or even diminish), it claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional financing"...
Another crucial element, the division between donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and each one chooses his calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that €1 paid amounts to €1.
Obviously, this is hardly justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the mitigation of emissions that are based on more efficient technologies), it is disingenuous to present a euro that will be recouped as equivalent to a euro that... At the most, should not be counted under its commitments that the cost of the loan to the country's lender (equivalent to an interest rate).
But France does that make of this reasoning: it "respects" its commitment to 420 million euros in making 91.5% (389,8 million euros) and 8.5 percent of donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use if heavily the loan.
Germany is required to 46 percent, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (other) respect their commitments with 100 percent of donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union is €1 to meet its commitment, France does that 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Joli trick!
In summary, in its funding fast start, France operates a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of the action in time and the reality of the financial effort.
By spending that 36.1 million euros, she comes to believe that she spends 420 million "new and additional" consistent with its promises.
The handling of the Ministry of Finance (because it appears that it's Bercy, which has made the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why the other Member States would continue to give it is sufficient to lend?) and in the negotiations since developing countries are not completely fooled...
The chapter of early funding is only a small issue, on the short term, compared to all of the discussions on the climate.
But it could be a grain of sand in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
Anyway, it is essential to learn the lessons of this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in the way of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and equity with other EU countries.
But above all, France could advance discussions on issues of long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently being discussed): it will not escape the issue of "additionality" or accounting of the loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope is based on the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on the fast start of France and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence necessary for progress in the discussions.
Alert to pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old eats in a day 81 different chemicals, according to a study released Wednesday by the association Generations Futures (former Movement for Rights and the respect of future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no statistically significant value in the light of the low number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem dealt with," has purchased between July and September food usually eaten in four meals and a snack in one day by a child of a decade, the supermarkets in the'Oise and Paris.
These meals types, including the formal recommendations - five fruits and vegetables, dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as snacks, were examined by laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The death toll from the base is damning: 81 chemicals including 42 are classified as carcinogenic possible or probable and five substances classified as carcinogenic some and 37 substances that act as endocrine disrupters (PE), according to studies of several institutions such as the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each substance taken individually are not exceeded, it is clear in our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to contaminants possibly carcinogenic and / or PE is worrying," said the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea containing more than a dozen possible cancer-causing residues and three proven carcinogenic as certain as well as nearly 20 residues that can disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, planned as a snack by the study, presented traces of six chemicals including a fungicide yet banned in France.
Same thing for green beans from Kenya, included in the lunch, on which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, ground beef, canned tuna, and even the stick of bread and chewing gum were strewn with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water analysis revealed the presence of nitrates, chloroform.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the plastic base used to heat the meal in the microwave was not free.
The final risk to the consumer of this "cocktails of contaminants" "is probably underestimated," according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Greens (EE-LV), meanwhile, has proposed "given the urgency of the situation" a moratorium on the use of pesticides, to stop "the increase in diseases of civilisation".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in grains.
