The Republican party's strategy against Obama's reelection
Republican leaders justify their policies is a necessity in the fight against electoral fraud.
Brennanovo Centre, however, such fraud refers to as a myth, saying that election fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die after lightening.
Republican lawyers, moreover, for the past ten years have seen only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States.
One thing is certain: the new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly to undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the u.s. have responsibility for the organisation of federal elections.
And in this spirit most American Governments since 2009 announces new laws that make it difficult for the process of elections, or write to the electoral list.
This phenomenon has seen a boom after the elections in November 2010, during which there were 675 new Republican representatives in 26 States.
As a result, it was only for the year 2011 presented 180 bills restricting the right to vote in 41 States.
New election laws require voters to present photo ID and proof of u.s. citizenship.
These laws also limit the period for the elections in advance, supersede the right to sign up on the list of electors on the day of the election and withdrawing the right to vote to citizens with a criminal record.
Before the elections in 2006, would not require voters to present photo identification půkazu any American State.
The first country to introduce this requirement, it was Indiana.
The constitutionality of the law was confirmed by indianského in 2008, the u.s. Supreme Court.
The Republican authorities busied with the extension of this procedure as well as to other States.
For the last two years have supported proposals for such laws in 34 States, with the aim to force voters to present photo identification cards.
It should be noted that, unlike Quebec do not have American citizens universal identity card, such as the health insurance card.
In fact, owns 11% of American citizens. 21 million persons in the age to vote, no photo ID issued by a Government Office of their State.
In addition, does not have such an ID card for about five million new voters in 2012.
In addition, the acquisition of the certificate of identity is often more than one hundred dollars.
The new limit will disproportionately affect mainly the young, minorities and people with low incomes.
25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with income below $ 35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 years and 20% of the voters aged 18 to 29 years old therefore does not have the identity card with a photograph.
And that's not all.
Students who are as voters known for their conversion to democratic candidates in several States are not authorized to use your ID card with a photograph issued by your school.
On the other hand, these same States may allow members of hunting and fishing clubs, opting rather to Republican candidates, cards issued by these clubs in the elections.
In 2004, would not require any State document of citizenship at the polls.
The first such requirement introduced by Arizona.
Since a dozen States adopted the 2011 law requiring voters to prove they are u.s. citizens.
These measures clearly are aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
Indeed, should be noted that two out of three Hispanics prefer the Democratic Party.
Republican legislators in 2011 in eight States have supported laws that cancels the registration of voters on the day of the election.
In addition, limit the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to enroll.
These restrictions have their own implications.
For example, during general elections in 2004, helped campaign for the registration of voters to register some 10 million inhabitants.
The measures taken after the year 2009 but caused the drop in when writing new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers in five other States have adopted laws aimed at shortening the period for elections in advance.
For example, during the general election in 2008, Florida made up 33% of African American voters, who voted in advance, although African-American voters in that State was only 13%.
For Hispanics it was as well.
Made up only 11% of all voters, but 24% of citizens voting in advance.
On the other side of the white men, who accounted for 76% of all voters, consisted of only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Against pass laws, which restrict the registration of voters, of course, very strongly built democratic legislators and their supporters.
Democratic Governors have blocked his veto several bills.
In order to suspend the most controversial laws hitting even the Attorney General of the United States.
Damage they partly curbed.
For example, laws requiring submission of the identity card with a photograph taken just 16 from 34 States.
The newly introduced rules, however, quite difficult to power in the 2012 vote.
Democratic critics of the talks mainly about the bias of the approved laws and consider them for the obvious effort to affect the results of the 2012 election in key States.
Brennanova report of the Centre from 2011, shows that the States where those laws were approved, representing 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed for victory in the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain already: the new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partly to undermine the American democratic system.
The detection of prostate cancer: tests or not?
The PSA Test can yield false results that have been incorrectly negative or even incorrectly positive, leading to unnecessary medical procedures.
All of this has increased the hesitancy of men, who are already reluctant to investigate at all.
To be examined or not?
We have asked the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States showed a high degree of contamination between the tested groups, it is difficult to interpret the results and provide valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found differences in mortality among patients who underwent testing, and those who did not go to them.
This study also demonstrated after the 12letém distance, that those who do not go to investigate, they have about 30 to 40% higher risk of metastasis.
I recommend therefore, screening from age 50 or 40 years if your direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men are also more at risk of a group of African-American origin.
The key is to take the right decision, as soon as the cancer is discovered.
There are aggressive cancers and such species which are inert.
It is therefore necessary to properly explain the patient's degree of hazard of his kind of cancer, to offer him alternatives, neléčit necessarily prostate cancer that does not have a long-term impact on their lives, and to focus in these cases more on active surveillance of diseases.
Today, a number of men, for which she was diagnosed with cancer, left untreated, because their kind of cancer is not aggressive and does not jeopardise the life.
We design them rather implementation of active surveillance, and in the case of disease progression to offer them treatment.
More and more frequently and with greater precision design criteria to help you decide which kind of cure and which not.
Therefore, I recommend testing still to complete.
But the important thing is to undergo an interview with a doctor and determine whether it is appropriate or not to undergo the examination.
In cooperation with the international urological societies established a movement Movember tool that allows you to evaluate the pros and cons in the context of the examination of the DOG.

Disease prevention
Unfortunately, there is no miracle method for cancer prevention.
Despite advances in research, it seems the best way to reduce the risk of adopting a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if all healthy eating and moving is enough, you could prevent up to 30% of cases of cancer.
"If everyone stopped smoking, this figure would be increased to at least 50%," underscores the André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian society for cancer research.
On the other hand, it is estimated that approximately 10% of the cancers caused by inheritance.
Some percentage also remains completely unexplained.
For the Canadian society for cancer research remains a priority the fight against smoking, though the number of smokers is declining.
Cigarettes worth 85% of cases of lung cancer.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
It's extremely detrimental to human health.
"Today's 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," shake their heads spokesman André Beaulieu.
An encouraging indication: 10 years after a smoker stops smoking decreases the risk of cancer death by half.
The Weight Of The
Tělnatost and obesity are in accordance with the SCC additional risk factor for the occurrence of the disease.
Increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," says the report.
Nutrition
The organization also recommended to limit consumption of red meat.
At too high consumption can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is advisable to avoid, as well as cold meats, which are subject to the same thing.
Preserving of meat smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"May cause damage to the cells of the organism, and lead to the development of cancer," says the report.
Vitamins
In recent years, various researchers have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Research, however, has so far failed to produce unequivocal conclusions.
The study focused on vitamin E in accordance with the SCC are contradictory.
Although according to one of them is to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, another study speaks rather about the increase.
No effect of vitamin D for cancer is not clearly demonstrated.
Mr. Beaulieu also insists on how important it is to talk about your concerns and precedent from the family physician.
"To submit to an examination does not mean that you have cancer."
The Higgs boson are examined by the
Notification of the Higgs boson of the likely discovery raised legitimate uproar last summer.
There is a view that the boson is involved in the mechanism that is responsible for all mass in the universe.
And this is the last particle whose existence predicts the standard model-our best or the "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter-which, however, has not yet been empirically observed.
So far, there is little sense among physicists, with 100% certainty that it is a Higgs boson.
No doubt about it, that we have a completely new particle, which is very similar to the Higgsovu boson, as predicted in the standard model.
New data published this week in the great physics Congress in Kyoto it rather confirmed, however, in the absence of any information to be able to have absolute certainty.
However, let's assume that it is a Higgs boson, since the risk of error, it appears as a small, and look at what's going on.
In this world is completely unambiguous law, according to which two things cannot exist at the same time in the same place.
You cannot bypass this rule-and it's never too hard, otherwise you hurt.
Even though it is a very strange world of particle physics, it turns out that it applies a similar law: the Pauli exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if you are in the same "quantum state"-this "status" roughly speaking creates some of their properties.
Particle physicists were further divided into two categories.
On the one hand we find a decent citizens, also known as fermions, which obediently follow the Pauli principle.
And at the other end are bosons, sons of anarchists who do not appreciate nothing at all-certainly not this principle, which means that they can still be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the devices (by the way absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in the laboratories of Berkeley: mesony, here we leave unnoticed, and "force particle", which spreads the great forces of nature, and with whom is the Higgs boson, probably connected in some way.
However, to say that these bosons are not as exotic animals, as would have been possible to believe.
If you read this article, it is thanks to boson with an unusual banality: the photon, the particle of light ", or" that is "bearer" to electromagnetic forces.
When a particle with an electric charge to speed up or change its direction, "interrupted" by an electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this "interruption" is electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing more than a fotonem-and thus one of the bosons, "holders of power".
More stable field
Also it is with Higgsovým bosonem, with the only difference being that "disturb" it is necessary to other field, Higgsovo field, to make this boson appeared.
The Higgsovo field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the excitation is necessary to achieve very high energy values, similar to the frozen lake, already moves just a lot of big rocks.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge Collider Accelerator at the laboratory as part of the CERN Large Hadron Collider-with dedicated volumes is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! -in order to develop such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field, we again suited to elucidate the relationship between Higgsem and matter.
With the electromagnetic field is because not all the particles do not react or all materials.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but not others-for example, a piece of paper will never by itself to stick on the fridge.
And as well, with Higgsovým field do not respond all particles: those that do so, have a certain mass, while others (such as the photon, let's look at him) do not.
And Mrs. Smith asks, what all of these researches are what "will"?
In terms of science with regard to confirming the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicists to study any mismatch between the observation and predictions of the SM.
Many physicists, literally wants to find them, because the slightest difference in space could open up "new physics" and close some of the gaps in the model.
It is necessary to note, that model has not yet huge flaws, does not add any elucidation of gravity (Whoa!) or dark matter, which makes up approximately 80% of the space of matter (again!).
So far, however, the CERN facility such contradictions.
The Response Of The
The response of these researches in the daily lives of Mr and Mrs Novak can be predicted only with great difficulty, but it would be a mistake to believe that there will be no.
Look here: at the very beginning of the 1960 's. years should not be the pioneers of the laser at Bell Labs, nor any idea of the revolution, already their work occurs.
Expected scientific use, but nothing more.
Physicist Willard Boyle-who worked at Bell Labs, where he was the laser in the 1960s invented and created the first permanent laser beam (previous rays were pulse) in 1962, I have already said-laser was initially considered to be such a "toy to the lab".
Just imagine ...
And besides, it can also result from the application of all the tools that surround research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during their work focused on optics.
This sensor, even though it initially planned at all so Boyle, now serves as the "eye" of all the digital cameras in the world, and earned him a Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities around the LHC are bound to change your life, it means that you really never know ...
Palliative care-the best way to go from the life ... | Le Devoir
Through its Commission for dying with dignity, Quebec has recently engaged in delicate questions about the rest of his life.
The debate should continue at the same time, and soon is going to Bill.
In this crucial area of a lot of work remains to be done.
The magazine Le Devoir tried to look at this question in more detail.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. l. has lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
Prostate cancer, which it consumed with a two-year reprieve granted to him.
"They were giving me five years of life, and it's been seven," he says without emotion on his cot in the House for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil where arrived the previous day.
"It's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The disease has done its work: with tremendous weakness it prevents them from remove himself to the bathroom or eat alone.
Eyes looking at the delicious-looking breakfast and agrees to help him eat.
It is a bold and even smiles, conversing with strangers who stop him, brings him medicine, offer a bath.
Courage to death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of diarrhea, this is embarrassing to me," confides.
A few hours later, the team of doctors found on his drug problem.
"In his life a man teaches that guys Peeing standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
To return to the stage of the child is for some people unacceptable humiliation.
"Depends on the capabilities of man", whether he accepts the return, says psychologist.
In the opinion of a number of individuals dealing with palliative care, with the crucial moments are taking place in the very heart of such a return.
Patients who picked up home with palliative care, Victor-Gadbois, suffers from all the cancer.
Their prognosis is not more than three months to live.
At this stage, they are a team of doctors and nurses that care of them, does not provide so-called "therapeutic" care.
In the case of Mrs. a., 89 years old, is the worst fear to die "on suffocation in full consciousness".
Disease but to discover their children.
"I've got good kids," he adds.
"In my life I have no wishes," he says, and then gives her to have breathing apparatus.
Yet he still looks forward in the days ahead on the last visit son of Italy.
In a home Victor-Gadbois, in cooperation with a group of volunteers provides body care with the help of nutrition.
So looks like palliative care, which comes when you cannot do anything else.
That death was more comfortable.
In Québeku find one bed palliative care at 11,700 inhabitants.
It is very little, if we realize that we all are going to die.
Here life goes on under optimum conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martelová, one of the doctors at home.
Whether in terms of the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, you can give him, for example, a SIP of brandy or pepsi, to taste.
Diabetics no longer need to keep an eye on your blood sugar.
And death is a part of everyday life here.
Last night, carrying a beer Mr. X, who died later in the night.
This morning his son finishes a beer in honor of the late father.
"Helping patients as well as their loved ones," says Nathalie Savardová, Director of nursing services.
In a home Victor-Gadbois go days one after the other, but not with each other.
In addition to the třiadevadesátiletého of a man who was the last meeting with my family thoroughly vypodložený on the cushions, while his připíjejí in his honor, dies tragically šestatřicetiletý man surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children after having tried all the possibilities to do so, in order to survive.
"Six months ago there is always three to five beds, which are designed for people with cancer to 45 years old," she says with concern Dr Christiane Martelová.
53% of patients who in a home Victor-Gadbois come, come from their homes, 47% of the hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply does not have access to palliative care. to care, which is intended to mitigate the suffering of the sick as soon as reaches the final stage of their lives, whether it's at home, in a hospital or nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and Company for home palliative treatment area Grand Montréal, specialize in more or less exclusively to the care provided to cancer patients.
And it was this essential health care unavailable in Quebec leads to the fact that many doctors specialising in palliative care is concerned about the adoption of the law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October is circulating a manifesto signed by leaders in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount, and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martelové is not a Quebec health system powerful enough to ensure access of all persons to high-quality palliative care, than it will be possible to agree to perform euthanasia.
As he says, recently had a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in huge pain without anyone did take the necessary steps to make her feel better.
Fears that patients did not ask about the killing on the grounds that they do not get appropriate care.
And at the same time, many oncologists caring for his patients until the last moments, regardless of the negative prognosis.
Hopes for the survival of Hélène Richardové have been minimal, leaving the arduous chemotherapy.
When my onkoložce that I'm done with treatment, she said, that she regrets it, losing fight, tells us.
And told me that it's over!
There is no omnipotent care
Doctor Martelová it is estimated that 90% of patients who wish to die, thanks to their treating physicians to consider that their wishes have not completed when their team palliative pussy eased pain.
However, it must be said that palliative care is certainly powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereauové, Director for palliative care in the home palliative care society of Grand Montréal, patients prevents treatment of pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of his life often doctors use palliative sedation, which the patient to sleep until the time of death, whether by fits and starts, or whether they are permanently served him a sedative.
You cannot pretend that this part of the ordeal.
The patient, which outraged pain, will have an increasing ability to access paliativním sedation.
Sick, which is not provided with a sedative, they say, always the same: "I want to die".
But it does not always necessarily mean "I want you to me euthanasia", rather it means "I want to get rid of me pain".
The implementation of this report made it possible to grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for research in health care.
Extensive real estate scandals in Quebec
Administration officials, entrepreneurs in construction and public works, lobbyists, political parties and experts on Italian mafia still tell what they know about a "system", in which it is mixed construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and Goodfellas.
This "study" came to Quebec taxpayers very much, in particular, between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system crumbled since we adopted crucial measures," says Jacques Duchesneau, ironically, a Quebec member of Parliament and former head of police in Montreal.
Thanks to him, erupting scandal in 2011 on the basis of rigorous investigation focused on the embezzlement of funds in connection with contracts to build roads in Quebec, which then-liberal Prime Minister Jean Charest a Quebec approved only after long delays.
"Duchesneauova report" confirmed a direct link between industry, non-transparent financing of parties and corruption of civil servants.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he says, "save only the Ministry of transport on orders $ 1 billion," when some people keep at Bay their instincts to get them to share!
Charbonneauova, the Commission "has already led to the demise of the two mayors," he adds, with the hope that it manages to "uncover the priest of some people".
A permanent unit for the fight against corruption was established in year 2011
A permanent unit for the fight against corruption was established in the year 2011 is also involved in a fight with his army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
The officers "Marteauovy company", who as of 2009 to ensure that the Montreal penězovodů "cartel" significantly eased inflation of contracts ...
In recent weeks, have made a series of inspections and charged of fraud and corruption, a number of municipal representatives, such as Frank Zampino, and Richard Marcotte, the Mayor of one town from the suburbs.
Next on the list to be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just stepped down from his duties of the Mayor of Laval, Quebec's third-largest city.
Is alleged to have repeatedly received bribes in Exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges have already received, as well as traffic engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito caused a sensation when the Commission explained the mechanism of "the system" obtaining public contracts.
He devoted himself during these years, 3% of the value of contracts won in Montreal, intermediary associated with the mafia, which then transferred the money side of the Union Montréal, for which he was elected Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Zambito was after the year 2000 Christmas in all directions and devote more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euro) provincial parties, and in particular, however, the Liberals, who were then in power.
He confessed also that he organized an illegal gathering finances for the former Liberal vicepremiérku Nathalie Normandeauovou.
Contract with penězovody, the prices of nadsazoval
In Montreal to work "system" of corruption very alive and well.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transportation engineer it before the Commission described in great detail: during the ten years he received from construction companies gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, to restaurants, to hockey games and pocket money worth a total of 736 000 dollars in Exchange for a contract with penězovody, where the nadsazoval price.
Other public officials from the realm of transport admitted that they had to pay compensation for that, about 30% to 40% of the nadhodnocovali through false invoices for the extra work.
The Mayor's Party Organizer Martin Dumont then Tremblaye accused of turning a blind eye without embarrassment over the completion of the budget, which in its Treasury was always getting dirty money.
Based on these revelations Tremblay resigned in early November, which has plunged into a large crisis, Montréal.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first members of the montrealskými, who headed the warning signal.
As Mayor of the District of Rivière-des-Prairies in the East of the island since 2010 advocates against the sale of municipal land purchased for $ 5 million and sold at. .. 1.6 million promotérům in the middle of a thriving trade in real estate.
70% of dirty money in electoral campaigns
The investigation, which will be finally launched, says that "pulls the strings in an attempt to understand the functioning of the system of promořeného ants to stop gangrene and načapalo the culprits".
The process is a "painful, but positive".
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but it is necessary to set up in Montreal's own investigative unit and to ensure oversight to these dubious practices could not return back.
As when will be cleaned.
On A Regular Basis.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "the public officials they had hundreds of millions of dollars", but worried in particular tasks "members informed about this", if these backroom nenamočili!
It is estimated that 70% of the funding of electoral campaigns in Québeku comes from money laundering, and with irony: "I've heard that this is just a weak decoction of reality."
A Quebec Government proposes to limit donations to $ 100 to the parties, but it does not solve the situation, according to him: "as long as they strictly restrict the electoral expenses, dirty money disappear from politics."
Proposes a comprehensive control of public procurement and financing parties: "we can't drop which; If we focus on the nature of things, boldly we can build again on stronger foundations and greater control and compliance with the law. "
If this story defamed image of Quebec and Montreal and abroad, Duchesneau urges all who scoff at him, to look at your own backyard ...
"PSG is FC Barcelona."
In this season you have deployed an entirely new pace of PSG.
How do you explain this evolution?
Can be explained by the fact that all individuals have gone to each other, or a totally new dimension of PSG.
They came to us with great players.
Every day I am beside them.
Technical team too much help.
Every day these facts allow me to elevate their games.
And it's easier for matches.
In football everything goes so fast.
But I am not losing my head.
Since my beginnings in the preparer in INF Clairefontaine after moving to Saint-Etienne I have always walked on the various stages.
Thus, a competitive environment you are using, which introduced Carlo Ancelotti ...
Reinforcements from this summer are accustomed to play matches at a very high level.
They also know that any training is essential.
And it follows from this that a player like me has a bigger appetite to match, and wishes to give maximum performance.
Plus a lot of Carlo Ancelotti gives me in connection with my position.
To his assistants, such as Claude Makelele, who played the same position as me.
And Ancelotti has the operative word at the right time?
Of Course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all engineers.
Today is 1. the League peers, and one of the best European coaches.
He has tremendous experience and with top teams won a lot of titles.
He also worked with excellent players.
According to me is going to win the title in Paris.
In January I attended a comforting interview.
I had a number of injuries behind him.
Trust me, is another reason my performance.
As you look at the first part of the season, PSG?
In the 1. the League picked Lyon us frontal position.
But we're staying in tow.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we very easily advanced to the round of 16.
What does your club goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Now anything can happen.
But we certainly want to be a quality European teams a tough opponent.
We want first to win its qualifying group ahead of the Port, in order to be able to play in the round of 16 at home in retaliation.
PSG may state in the short term a major European club?
The budget has already ...
To Paris has become a major European club must win titles and enter into history.
Today it is not.
On the financial aspects of the PSG means that this intention was carried out.
And it would be a great failure in nezvítězit 1. League as in last year's season?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
A lot of this year we want to win the League title.
In last year's season are still missing.
In may, we were disappointed because we had to win the game.
We had a great season.
We've collected 79 points.
Typically, with 79 points, you clear the master ...
But another Club, Montpellier, had a season even more amazing.
I think this year it will lead.
Although the title to the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think we have the weapons to beat.
Do you think that the media from PSG expect too much?
It is not unusual to expect a lot from us because what is here and what we have invested players.
We accept it totally.
Is the fact that when at home to beat Troyes 4-0 and still finds something in the papers accuse us, so it's not very pleasant.
One wonders what from you people still may want more.
It is not, of course, winning 4-0 on each weekend.
We Are FC Barcelona!
We are trying to set up the game's style.
To build a team, you need time.
In the Champions League we proved that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, who has already qualified for the finals for the second season, and in doing so too have invested large amounts!
In relation to the case of sumám, is to be expected that you will have in front of the other 15 points ahead of the curve!
By insulting the members of other clubs and the French League.
Clubs Lyon and Marseille, which in last year's season was, too, with the new PSG have moved to the next stage.
It shows how a 1. League of amazing.
I hope that in May we can smile and say that despite all the difficulties, we managed to win.
It seems as though PSG in all relied on the performances of Zlatana Ibrahimoviče.
It is good that it is said that there is "Zlatanovi".
This means that Ibrahimovič is a very powerful and that gives a lot of goals.
Because of this, he came here and proves she's the star of the 1. the League.
Everywhere, where passed, prove to be a great player, the world star.
In our team we respect the man and the player.
He respects the people around you.
What he has accomplished is truly exceptional.
This has led others to improve their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is among the best defenders in the world, also allowing others to grow side by side.
How you Euro 2012 with the French representation?
As a disappointment.
I wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, due to injury, I couldn't play the way I would have imagined.
But I have experienced this and I came out of it stronger.
Today I was getting and in representation of the play good matches.
And I had hoped since its entry to the team.
We learned a lesson from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe to ourselves, to our demeanor exemplary.
As you look at the first of the month Didier Deschampse at the helm of the national team?
For him, the results of the talks.
In qualifying at the World Championships, we're in a good location.
The coach chooses the players around them, and can get excited for the victory.
This was also Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want them to be compared.
Blanc had reached his goal that we qualify for the Euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will take our team to Brazil.
Is a draw (1: 1). October in Spain a solid starting the game?
This match gives us added confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Prior to this shock in Spain, I am such a struggle throughout his career.
Thanks to Bitcoinu you can pay and sell without banks
All the negatives of the current financial transactions based on central banks, identified the cost of processing transactions and among the beneficiaries.
How, in the context of these technologies often true, there is a feeling the apparent political views: the belief that the existing financial system built on banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, whose inventor is Satoshi Nakamoto (pen name), presents how virtual money (However, convertible into dollars, euros, etc.), so a secure transfer protocol like Bittorrent, which allows you to Exchange files between pairs of partners.
Thanks to the 15 000 computers connected to the network has already been registered about 200 000 transactions.
About a thousand Web pages already adopting bitcoiny as gifts or as a means of payment.
Course bitcoinu first reached a high of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later fell to $ 2, now moves at the border for about ten dollars (an overview of the courses can be found on the page bitcoincharts.com).
In comparison with the world in Exchange for real money or financial products it's nothing impressive.
And yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) for interests of this fact in its report on the virtual finance that came out in October.
Bitcoin describes as a "virtual money", "competing with the dollar and the euro" and "analogous to the ordinary cash".
Bitcoin is from other types of virtual money is different in that it is like "credits" that are used to process in the video game, which one gets the game or that you can buy (and sometimes even back to replace).
Social networking site Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Each month, but the central body checks and processes the individual communication.
In the case of Bitcoinu, all network nodes to the depositary book current accounts, supervisors, issuers and buyers as well as sellers.
How does this site work?
Each transaction between two users is in fact between two electronic addresses by using e-mail.
The user may, however, choose a different address for each payment, which provides anonymity.
A set of information associated with this transaction is electronically signed with a double key encryption system.
The network can verify the legitimacy of transactions.
Thanks to the contents of a file, you can ensure that the exchanged bitcoiny existed in the common accounts book public, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key lies in the writing phase of this new transaction to this book.
By using the mathematical task solving specified computers, whose principal investigator, a sort of temporary central banker, will have the right to write this additional line.
This is a phase cutting file; i.e.. on the transformation of a huge file on shorter and a unique digital fingerprint.
Computer "will take over" this new transaction and added to her number, then all "cut it".
The goal is to find a number that provides a particular fingerprint (lots of zeros at the beginning).
As soon as this number is found, the other nodes can easily check its accuracy.
The transaction is then connected to a display string unsinkable all other transactions; any adjustment would be to change the impression.
If a user wanted to pay twice the same fraud money very quickly (within 10 minutes), the network may be confirmed only one of the two transactions-the second will be abandoned, because each of them has a different imprint.
A computer that will solve the challenge, win 50 bitcoinů.
In order to avoid inflation, this remuneration is divided in two on a regular basis, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoinů in circulation is so limited number of 21 million, but can be divided up to a hundred millionth, making room for mark-up is here ...
The difficulty of the task also increases with increasing levels of calculation.
The network already has experienced its ups and downs.
Websites that provide services for Bitcoin were infected and there has been a theft of stored bitcoinů.
"The flaw is not being used by the log itself," assures Pierre Noizat, who founded the company, for the payment of Paymium real money, which uses a network of Bitcoin.
The ECB also checks the possibility of money laundering with this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Notable players as Wikipedia refuse gifts of this nature.
Others, like blogging platform WordPress, is accepted.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, recently analyzed the book and current accounts showed that almost 80% of bitcoinů is not orbiting.
In November have been launched "huge discounts".
"Thirty thousand dollars have changed," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul dealing with the transformation of bitcoinů on gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of educational books relating to these funds, has a great deal of confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to the credit card (real money) or bezkontaktnímu payment of mobile phones, but uses a system of authentication for transactions, Bitcoin which are cheaper.
In addition, the wearer maintains its identity, and can remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up, where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
Just give the address, that can be a telephone "ofotografovat and recognize", explains Pierre Noizat, which assures that already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge the hierarchical systems and transition to horizontálnějším systems.
"Before, it will take the Bitcoin it'll take time, but the year 2013 could be decisive," predicts.
In addition, in its report, the ECB assumes that a reassessment of the various risks, which are today considered to be increased if this kind of money is going to be successful.
We left Afghanistan.
And what's next?
French troops have left its area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi district).

And it's just fueling a sense that Western States were here just to get it to be hijacked.
Without energy for the processing of iron ore or copper on the spot without funds for the transport of raw materials across the mountains but no extraction of minerals cannot take place.
The Chinese have already almost left mine at Aynak, and left Mes copper international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) the opportunity to explore a large Buddhist complex in order to retain the role of the most important employers in the province.

Difficult to work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Mohamed Morsi embarked on another hand of Poker.
While Egypt remains in its history the most divided due to the publication of the Constitution, which he temporarily granted unlimited powers, decided to play.
Announced Wednesday, regardless of the opinion of all the other, that the constituent Assembly will approve the final wording of the next day.
Less than a week ago by the head of State of this Assembly of another two months to complete the necessary work.
For nearly two years, Egypt uses a provisional text, which has been amended many times, which weakens the constitutional stability of the country and leads to a by guessing.
This new initiative is only further strengthened the country's ambivalence.
From the perspective of opposition the President lingers in his "autocratic delirium" is no longer "violates his word" and "tramples on the right".
His supporters, however, make sure that it is a means to turn around as quickly as possible with the constitutional and political crisis and to speed up the transition process.
Two weeks later, a referendum should be held.
It is a very short period of time, which will force the brotherhood in Egypt to withdraw from the plan text to clarify the article after article.
For the President it is also a way to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country like a prolonged protests.
As confirmed in an interview with the US weekly magazine Time, Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for.
Especially because this hastily organized vote puts the people of Egypt before the ultimatum: "Either you approve my text, or I'll have unlimited powers" that would otherwise have come to an end after the approval of a new Constitution.
And in this particular air yesterday, 85 members of the constituent Assembly with a large majority of the text was approved by the Islamists.
The majority of Liberals in voting.
In mid-November, shortly after the publication of the Constitution, to shoot the doors that do not have the opportunity to promote their views.
Human rights advocates, civil society or members of religious minorities, the same step.
In order to achieve a quorum, was yesterday morning in a hurry or not accompanied by 11 persons from among the alternates.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
No surprise then, that the articles of the Constitution have often been voted into unanimously.
Commentators also suspended over the fact that one of the few disputes that day about ... hours for prayer, when some members of the Committee believed that the clock in the boardroom is not properly adjusted.
The Text, which voted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
Subject to the General attention, article 2, remains in the end is the same as the version of the Constitution of 1971, stipulates that "the principles of Sharia law is the main source of law".
Salafi parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the basic requirements, they were hoping to replace the term "principles" the term "rule", which would allow for a stricter application of the.
For the Islamists, in turn, the fact that this article has not been repaired, is a sign of their good will and respect for the other components of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", argue the Liberals who see this as just a rhetorical problem.
According to them, namely the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They focus in particular on article 220, which confers on the al-Azhar University, a consultative role, in particular for the control of compliance of laws with Sharia law.
According to the specialist on Egypt's disturbing Pommierové Sophie because "persons called to express are not chosen and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings of theocracy ".
Concerns of Liberals even more stirring up the fact that the next Rector of the University should be less restrained than the current one.
"For the moment, did not show any specific religious consequence.
With this Constitution, Egypt remains a general civic State.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text, not ulamové, but University workers, many of them studied in French schools, "soothes fears Alexis Blouet, which prepares the work of the constitutional transition in Egypt.
Agrees, however, that "there may be disagreements about the interpretation of article 220 because it used terms belong to the religious vocabulary.
There is, in particular, the reference to "fiqh [Islamic jurisprudence, note red.].
And in the future, you may experience the question of to what extent they are civilian judges competent, to be able to express themselves ".
Yesterday approved the text, in addition to religious sites very criticised due to the extended powers conferred on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that it was a significant restriction compared to the old regime.
Another contentious point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the army will not carry out the verification of the defence budget in Parliament, but the National Defense Council.
Also not in military courts with civilian control is disabled, as it called for the Association for the protection of human rights.
These associations referred to in connection with the text, which is directed against the freedom of their doubts.
The offence of blasphemy and insult is retained, it is still disabled, which could have serious implications for freedom of expression, in particular for printing.
In addition, no article does not address the protection of women, Heba Morayefová the Organization stresses the Human Rights Watch.
According to her, is the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in article 36.
This word is not mentioned in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to leave last night in a televised speech this afternoon, the rallies are scheduled.
Supporters of the head of State will demonstrate on Saturday.

"Great and powerful" shall notify to Moscow: the emigrants to save money's language
While MEPs and human rights defenders still debating the law on compulsory language tests in the country have already discovered the cheaters who are selling "counterfeit" certificates
In Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities every year, arriving 13 million foreign workers.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkménie.
Their sole purpose is to earn enough money to support families at home.
On 1 January 2002. December entered into the effectiveness of the law, according to which the migrant workers will be required to pass a test of knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and municipal economy, lifestyle and retail sales.
FMS, however, promises that over time the tests mandatory for all visitors.
However, the tests will consist not only of linguistic knowledge, but also from Russian history and introduction to law.
Knowledge of the language will also be necessary to attest to the acquisition and extension of a work permit.
The exemption only applies to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
Are not subject to this law, or people who have successfully managed to achieve certification and earn an academic diploma in the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefits, the conviction and the protection of the rights
A network of test sites will work under the auspices of Pushkin Russian language Institute, the University of friendship among peoples, Moscow State University, the State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take exams in all cities; today in Russia is already opened more than 160 such centers.
Initiative to support the introduction of testing often supported by members of the State Duma and FMS (Federal Migration Service).
But before the law entered into force, many human rights defenders were able to ask the question: in the press and what it actually bring?
What changes the obligation to be familiar with the language for the Russians and for the visitors?
For one thing-the representatives of the migration service-match will allow it to reduce the number of people who are suffering as a result of "slave labor."
Many people today are talking about protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains Chairman of FMS of Russia Viktor Sebelev in Tajikistan.
Protection of their rights should be initiated prior to their departure.
Only a system of organized recruitment of 90% will solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise with emigrants without occupation, without education, who don't know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language-says with conviction-Sebelev is the future migrant sentenced to clashes with rogue people, who under the guise of assistance shall ensure "voucher" to the terrible, tight places to stay, in which he and dozens of others like himself, suffer for months without food and documents, and to work for 12 to 14 hours a day.
From our migrant workers, we get a lot of complaints.
"In their homeland by promising them one, but upon arrival they get cheated, is to keep belts, are not paid the promised wages," the head of the main Tajik labour migration management MS Tolib Šaripov.
Don't Scold!
The less that many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who intend to go to work in Russia, recognize that not only do not know the language of the country in which they want to get, but do not have experience even with the work.
Of course, it is not so much their fault, but rather disaster: very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to raise at least adequate basic education.
After all, their families need also to feed the kids something, not to mention the fact that they should be decently dressed, put the boots on and equipped for school.
As children mature into working life, it must be at the first opportunity to go to work.
Without knowledge of the language is hard-admit.
"Do you feel the humiliation and inferior."
It is true that with regard to the law on language tests point out human rights defenders on one very important thing.
Testing will be implemented only for those migrants who have legal status.
If you do not have it, so they don't even take exams, or get any other official work.
In the meantime, she lives the majority of migrant workers as well as ever in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or Unauthorized entry prohibited"
Many of the arriving workers argue that gain official status in our country is not easy.
Reason-bureaucratic obstacles and all the linguistic difficulties.
Legalization in addition costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Employees of the Russian police know that we have a basically false documents, without registration, and this provides cases of extortion.
"Require a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea,"-he shared with reporters about their experiences, a citizen of Tajikistan Umed Chuškadamov.
"Come on, don't be stingy, get yourself a painting"
On the first day of validity of the law on language, it was found that fake documents migrants are not just for registration.
FMS staff already confiscated several fake certificates of passing language tests.
Counterfeit documents are printed on a color printer.
Of course, to the new owners do not come for free: each of the migrants in the hope that you will help with every problem tests, paid for this document is seven thousand rubles.
It is a two and a half times greater than the official passing test: the migrant workers will cost three thousand rubles.
The main task of the near future is to secure the system against corruption in order to get workers could simply buy documents, this is the same government officials and human rights defenders.
Government authorities, meanwhile, promise can foreign workers who haven't mastered the tests the first time, the time required to have completed Foundation course of the Russian language.
For visitors who don't know Russian, is expected to work in areas which do not require active dealing with people.
The MVD (Interior Ministry) does not take into the circulation of illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes with the use of legally-held weapons is very low
MVD of Russia presents proposal for tightening the law in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
It is the Government's response to recent events: the stimulus have been cases of shooting at weddings, which are round, with no casualties, and the massacre prepared Moscow lawyer Dmitri space station, causing seven people were killed.
Police wants to ban the wearing of dangerous weapons in public places and to increase the age from which you can obtain a license to carry weapons from 18 to 21 years of age.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma's Committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Jarovaja, that promised to change the law on weapons will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem through "tightening screws".
He appeared on the network, open the letter with the authors-representatives of various social organizations require rejection of the shooting "senseless tightening" of the law.
The percentage of the hooliganism of the authorized weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and a criminologist in an interview with the Russian section of the BBC.
According to statistics of the Ministry of the Interior was in six months of 2012 committed 142 offenses using firearms registered by the authorities of the Ministry of the Interior, while during the same period, a total of 1168 was committed thousands of crimes.
The authors of the open letter are convinced, tightening of legislation in the field of civilian weapons cause the offender to switched to a "black" market.
According to their words, you can currently find in Moscow any weapon at a low price.
At present, the Interior Ministry said that the situation with the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races after officers
"Black" market is supplied by several channels.
The main channel is five, says retired Colonel Victor Baraněc, who has worked for ten years at the Ministry of education and the General staff.
Screenshot pages that accept orders weapons
The first of them-"an army or military way", that is, a weapon that had been stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"Russian officers and stole Weapons and themselves Caucasians," says Baraněc.
Another type of "black" are the weapons stolen by criminals for representatives of the security forces.
Baranec explains that this includes theft from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from the staff of law enforcement agencies.
Illegal "mainly" to receive into sales from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses often leads to explosions.
"There is evidence that some of the fires were set deliberately-in order to cover the difference," says a former soldier.
Bring in the words of your post and arms-producing Barance.
"Currently private simplified joint stock enterprises which are not competitive on the international market, and discarded weapons, which deliver on the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.
Another source of "black" market is contraband.
A particularly large number of guns and machines comes from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes there are weapons manufactured in malovýrobě, and the mafia, which was organized by their continuous production," explains the former soldier.
Where is the gun?
So experts, what is the approximate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal arms to the "black" market.
A report on this subject prepared by the Center in 2011, problem analysis and designing of public administration.
Specialists to examine the statements of the Ministry of Interior and the Russian statistical agency, kriminologickou literature and public data portals focused on weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, say researchers, comes from the military and executive bodies.
Half of all weapons on the black market was "the fault of official agents, whose work is associated with weapons," the report says.
According to the data available to researchers, 17% of the weapons from the armed conflict, in 14% of cases there was a theft of weapons in their manufacture, 5% is "black".
Salesman-consultant one of the arms deals, which asked us to never mention his name, believes that the weapons found in the excavations of black "archeology" a long time ago-nobody is buying are just too old.
Most often, he says, sellers's rides for new shipments directly to military warehouses.
Ensign's lead over buying a unit, such as the TT pistol.
The weapon's order and he sells it to you over the fence.
"This is going to take her to the city and sell it for 900 euro per piece with two magazines," she says.
"The truth is that the police are well in the image, and therefore begins to burn them at any plan in the objasněnosti crimes, carry out the control purchase at retailers with illegal arms," says the Adviser.
"As in a luxury store"
Seller buyer most often found each other through their familiar.
I attended websites and blogs, as long as it's not the guy who offered me the opportunity to go to the platform's "trial", where will be the man who led me to the "corner", where together we act.
The price mainly I learned there
Military correspondent Viktor Baraněc
I want to get a gun, I need someone who knows the way out, tells the salesman-Advisor-I have known This, but I just don't trust him fully.
Sellers on the market, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "by Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell that her tooth fell out."
And now they get there through man, which I am.
He is also the only gives me, because he knows that and he spat on him.
Beginners looking for weapons in various ways.
A former soldier Viktor Baraněc was trying to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s. years ago, when processing the article for publication on this topic.
The schemas are in his words did not change.
They gave him a photo album, where it was "what you think".
"I felt like in a luxury store," says the soldier.
The buyer, in the words of Baraněce, do not offer a pig in a poke-everything you can try.
I, a potential client, simply do not buy-we go into the woods with the seller, and tom's build target.
"Give me the ability to shoot, and when they see that the gun shoots well, started to act," describes how to connoisseur.
Stack on a sofa
Search engines on the Internet will bring you to websites and groups to "Liquid", where he offers to buy weapons "for different purposes".
Do not need any documents or personal meeting.
"You just have to have a set amount of money," says the caption in the ad on the website "to buy a combat pistol or machine".
On this website, users leave their notifications and ask questions.
And sale of a minor?
"Of course, without a licence," queries the user "Ivan" (spelling is preserved).
"Buy The TT.Moscow "-briefly formulates a request to" Fedorenkov. "
The Federal Security Service recently threw up a huge network of dummy Web sites and people who wish to buy a military weapon, can for a shovel.
People flock to the hungry fish bait and then conquer the coal in Siberia.
Military correspondent and higher military official Viktor Baraněc
I've heard about such schemes: Web pages are usually registered beyond the scope of the Russian legislation.
People take orders.
The purchaser shall make payment through an ATM.
"In response to this, the seller will send him a photo and description with instructions on where the gun is hidden," says spokesman for non-governmental organization "right to gun" Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baraněc confirmed that after placing your order on the website, you can remain unarmed and find themselves behind bars.
The Federal Security Service recently threw up a huge network of dummy Web sites and people who wish to buy a military weapon, can for a shovel.
"People flock to hungry fish bait and then conquer the coal in Siberia," confirms.
Makarov for $ 100
When buying illegal firearms to pay according to the estimates of experts the amount typically from 100 to 900 dollars.
In the words of Dmitri Kislova of NGO "right on the gun" take the pistol Makarov for 100 to 300 dollars.
You must wait a month up to one and a half months.
The weapon is dispatched to the long-term storage of the warehouses through stores in the middle of the article.
According to the official statistical office has dropped compared to the period January-October 2011 the number of such crimes in Russia a total of about 7%, and amounted to 22.9 thousands of cases, and the number of cases of theft and extortion explained weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the u.s., shipyard workers fastfoodů and supermarkets
Work on the register of establishments "McDonald 's" passes up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, in America picked up the wave of protests against low wages in the hypermarkets of Walmart and in restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as the "McDonald 's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy 's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
So far, no one can predict whether this wave of converts to the ninth wave, or whether she is fated to disappear soon.
This entire share support trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to the increase in the modest salaries, they receive the rank and file workers in Wal-Mart and fast-food systems, is the goal of the organizers of the protests to achieve in them creating in their trade unions.
Currently, this economic sector is virtually unaffected by the trade-union movement.
46 cents a year?
The action began last week after a day of Thanksgiving, in the so-called "Black Friday", when America struck orgy cheap sales, has gripped millions of inhabitants and in some cases were accompanied by even brawls.
On this day some workers the company Walmart that works around the world to 2.2 million people, leaving their workplaces and demonstrated together with the trade unions and left-wing activists, commercial chains of multinational companies whose goods are addressed to people of the lower and middle classes.
Walmart sells all over the world everything from diapers through a hunting rifle and a car battery to the vacuum cleaner, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average about 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-wage employees in the stores Walmart purchases only in her work.
The availability and range of goods made from a string of Walmart, one of the largest companies in America.
In the words of critics can afford to sell goods at Walmart so cheaply partly because few pays its workers.
They also complain about bad working conditions, such as lack of automated trucks or hand-held scanners.
The demonstrators of "Black Friday," demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance rose sharply from from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical worker Walmart getting 9.5 dollars an hour, but this does not correspond to the height of the expenses, the employees say.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley show that if Walmart will increase the average wage at $ 12 per hour, it will cost the company $ 3.2 billion a year.
It is, on average, 1.1% more than the company spends on salaries now.
If the company Walmart moves fully on the shoulders of wage increases, consumers will each visit in-store only about 46 cents more.
For the year as customers spend about $ 12,39 more than today.
Defenders of the company Walmart have pointed out that the protest took place only in nine countries and companies should not cause virtually no damage.
"Black Friday" in the stores of the company lasted from 8 p.m. Thursday until midnight the following day, and during this time the company Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
Overall, the box office was "Black Friday" nearly 100 million transactions.
The company official Dan Fogelman said in an interview with the left-leaning Huffington Post Web site-centric, that jobs have left a total of "less than five" employees of Wal-Mart, and that the protest was "all other media sensation", organised by trade unions.
"Vacant cash register!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where their aim are not department stores Walmart (the ones in the pokrokovém city are not very popular, and therefore almost do not), but the "McDonald 's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and then you or not be paid sick leave and does not pay you for your hard work!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council in New York
Currently, the minimum wage for their work, in accordance with federal law and with the laws of the State of New York $ 7.25 per hour.
Fastfoodové restaurant this salary increasing progressively, but only slightly, and, on average, receive their rank and file workers in New York City $ 8.90 per hour.
In this expensive city, no less.
Well I don't see how you can be in New York for that kind of money.
Employment for "McDonald 's" can get away with almost a quarter of the American teenager, who work behind the counter after school on a part-time basis and they live with their parents.
Only a few people in it as their main source of livelihood or planning to stay there for long.
At present, constantly meet in an interview with the staff of "McDonald 's", who complain that they must live off of that money, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand on the Forum Wall Street Journal hang comment, which the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if you don't know how you feed them.
Participants in the protest, which began at 6: 30 in the morning on Thursday for "McDonald 's" on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashier and cooks in fast food companies began to receive at least $ 15 per hour, which is more than double their current minimum wage.
Also demanded that in the realm of fast-food outlets have been set up trade unions.
U.s. laws prohibit the Administration prevent the establishment of trade unions and trade union activists to punish through bullying and layoffs.
From the other side to manage them rarely makes life easier.
To introduce fast-food enterprises, trade unions, however, is complex and for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the extremely high staff turnover.
The Opposition Of The
In this day of noisy protests also were held in a number of other cheap restaurants of Manhattan.
The culmination of the event was at noon for "McDonald 's" rally near Times Square, where he had several local democratic politicians, in particular, Jumaane Williams City Council Member, who said: "McDonald 's", says it sells billions of servings, and then you or not be paid sick leave and does not pay you for your hard work! "
The protesters see also support other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for mayor of the city of Bill de Blasio, who said that "we need to get together to support workers fastfoodů so as to achieve fair remuneration for their work and economic prosperity, it deserves every New Yorker!"
As it was described by the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American fast-food realm.
But it was attended by only a few hundred people, though by no means all of them were fast-food employees in New York, which employ tens of thousands of people.
If this event happens the spark that ignited the flame of a mass movement, it is so far unclear.
"So far, on average, to deceive the brains"
Among the fans of modern technologies of virtual reality is a popular topic of augmented reality; the last time it means to perceive the world, in particular through a special Prism glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, at its annual Conference, Google demonstrated a working model of this news, and in November it was announced that the application for the patent, Microsoft also filed.
From an interview with the head of a group of interactive 3D technology in Cambridge lab Šaramem Izadim Microsoft implies that for scientists of this company are the glasses of the past.
Luring is the prospect of handling virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, the creation of virtual public spaces.
-Tell us please outline what is involved in your research group?
-We deal with the interactions between man and machine, but at the same time we're trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
Mankind so far, gets stuck in the stage of working with pixels on the flat screen, sometimes no more than a finger touches the screen.
We are looking for 5-10 years in advance and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox and Kinect sensor-this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not for sale without the Kinect sensor, because for all is a very interesting possibility of control via gestures.
-What is waiting for us in the future?
-Not to mention that Kinect has delegated to a natural level of interaction, a great many of the interactions is still in progress on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Input to improve the flow of information (system receives a greater amount of data), but the output flow while not particularly.
We're trying to change it, we're working on a truly three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projektivních.
You must let the computer world into our physical world, to make it more real.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary to know not only the user but also the space around it.
Then we will be able to add to the real world of virtual objects in a much better form.
And in the first place-to hell with those silly wearing virtual reality!
-What do you think about voice control?
It is a popular thing, but nepřeceňuje?
-Of course it cannot be considered a panacea-there is the question of privacy, because not always we want to inform others in our neighborhood on their activities and intentions.
In fact all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, to control the devices in public places, we had a project in which we think about the gestures, but not about sweeping, only such skoupých, short.
The gesture would nesnímala camera device, but the bracelet that tracked the movements of the bones and muscles.
So far is great, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
In General, however, that the future of the joint control type, such as gesture + voice.
-And how?
-For example, you ask me to give you this can of lemonade?
You say that and show at the same time.
-I usually just talking.
-Oh, it will be very difficult to detect.
-So you want to force the user to adapt to what at any given moment may or may not machine?
-It is not necessary, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the development of new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human response.
It may be, for example, laser sensors, which provide relatively good depth resolution, it is very important.
-If you have to talk about their work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for a modern camera?
Today is not sufficient resolution, depth, or something else?
-Basically the current generation-that is, from what we can be reflected in our work on the 3D detection.
Of course it would be good to obtain 8 Megapixels at a rate of 1000 f/s.
But it's not just about megapixels, but as an array and depth.
While looking at the thing are all current technology for us non-přidělává the work of designers of algorithms.
So we have to bear in mind not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also from.
So very important is also the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movement is quite dynamic and simultaneous data flows 30 frames per second are, frankly, a bit low, especially for the gesture.
Stephen Betishes from our lab in Redmond did touch sensor with adjustable delay processing of 1 to 100 ms, with the current, mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction between man and machine.
For me, the work was very helpful the equivalent of such a device, only I don't need so many touches, but I need some kind of frames per second.
-And increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?
-Kinect are now used three "camera", one of which is in fact an infrared transceiver and receiver-signal second reflected.
And the third camera-this is actually a current sensor of the visible zone.
She is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem ...
Or worse, because it would have increased the volume of carried out necessary calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog Kinect play with the curve of the location of the cameras and see how it will help in determining the three-dimensional position.
-If I recall correctly, Microsoft (apart from Google) publicly presented himself not wearing his glasses.
Don't you think that when it comes to daily use of augmented reality technology by using special glasses, this is one of the most promising platforms?
-Of course, walk and constantly while keeping the hands upraised smatphone is not very comfortable, but I think: the most powerful variant would be "portable" form of the extension of the reality, when it would be possible on the basis of the clouds of the glasses to anytime switch smartphone, projection screen and all round.
The glasses-it is a very personal device, that's their strength (private things you see only you), and at the same time weakness-augmented reality on the basis of glasses will not allow you to work on the virtual objects at the same time with other people.
-Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of the virtual hologram objects in the air is available not only Tony Stark in "Iron Man", as well as the current No.
There is one issue on which critics often point out: there is no touch response.
Hands do not feel anything!
What your group is preparing response to this challenge?
-In his lectures often say that augmented reality-this is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in mutual interaction between man and machine.
I think that the addition of tactile sensations you could become the eighth breakthrough.
So far, uses one of interesting tricks-using second hand as a certain type of substrate for viewing.
In an outstanding fashion records depression!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding hmatatelnosti to these "paintings in the air"-for example, interference of several directional ultrasonic beams in the defined point where the finger tactile sense, but it's still a very weak-as if you were blowing on the ball of the fingers.
There is also a bracelet on the wrist, which affects the nerve endings in your fingers-also a promising direction.
-Have you tried to fool the brain?
To think, to feel what it seems at the moment should feel when they see something?
-It is a good idea that we haven't tried.
Here is yet another challenge, which will be fought for a long time-how to get a man who is physically located in a very confined area, he believed that an open, virtually infinite space-we're also working on the concept of cross-country skiing tracks (not at all, such as in clubs), moving platforms, and also the huge balls.
If the deception of the brain becomes the goal, so there is still work for many years.
This is what makes working on virtual reality so attractive for researchers-many things are in the early days of the ABSOLUT.
Vkusovština instead of culture-Rosbalt. ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "St. Petersburg avant-garde", devoted to the citizens, who are in the lead, are avantgardou of culture and art.
At the top of the list have already been significant figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements extend beyond the city, often found recognition in Europe, without reaching the all-Russian fame.
The new hero of the "Rosbaltu" is a stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller-bearded man who is all dressed in red, which meet at the Russian Museum, the summer garden, in pubs and at fashion.
Images of Cyril Miller, wherever they are exposed, always attract crowds of spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of a purely social and philosophical petrohradských storytellers, creators of the new mythology.
Cyril Miller-this is a striking man of the St Petersburg of the avant-garde end of the 1980 's. and the beginning of the 1990 's. years.
In addition, it is the urban man, his appearance on the streets gives the smile on the face of citizens, increasing all mood.
Recently picked up a barrel organ and became the Petersburg flašinetářem, because in this difficult role is ripe with all my Bohemian life, philosophy and image.
-Cyril, why so you go around town dressed all in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
-I chose a red color as the designer engaged in appearance and image.
In this world the red color represents a compromise between the artist, the imagemakerem and the public.
Though it is generally true that everything is just a little different from the gray, aggressiveness and awaken the wrong properties.
But my provocations are aimed at making the interview has been made.
The whole history of my provocative acts is first and foremost an invitation to debate.
-And when you have to realize that you have to be an artist?
-At the exhibition in culture House on Nevsky Avenue, where they were exposed to my work.
I understand what is my way.
When the wave crossed the old free unofficial artists and new types of artists, free I could not understand.
I made friends with the artists of the new wave, post-gazoněvskými, who brought us the "Puškinské 10", and other waves.
Attracts me to the theater, clothing, music, all genres except words.
-And it all into your art-clinic ...-For me it was important to be in the center of Saint Petersburg, where the culture should gather all the best forces of creativity.
In 1995, I was awarded a place on Puškinské 10, and there even before reconstruction, there was a musical-Art Club, Bohemian Club, home of the petěrburkské of Bohemia.
There are many born: NOM, Tequila Jazz, remember how the Cord with the project "Van Gogh's Ear".
Lines and his friends sang under the plywood light songs, they dressed in tight-fitting trikotů, midway between them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in vogue.
When the band started playing live, "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg led many programs hali-galivských times.
We have given them, the Trachtěnberga began his United career, basic education and vocational training has received from us.
Gallery "D 137", Club "Griboyedov-this is the echo of the Art Clinic.
This way they left our working and permanent guests.
I am a hero of the last century, when the culture still meant something.
In 2000, he organized the survey was in the press, the special price was "People in our city".
In the nomination "artist of the year" I was appointed, I ended my top.
In the new times under the old rules the work is unpleasant, I'm a man of truth, honesty, and culture of the last century.
In recent years, it is easy to become popular, but the culture and the popularity of today are different things, you may be popular, but not too much cultural.
-Your works are characterized by an identifiable way.
-Many of my images-these are the hits, in which the live captured the topicality and incisiveness.
I have the programmatic exhibition "Russian Museum of clowns".
Clowns are timeless categories.
Previously, I used to be sociable, today be accompanied is painful and terrible.
But the clowns are all blurs, picks up the tragika.
I love of the grotesque, had some kind of grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world by totalitarian nařizovacím in disguise.
Today people meet under clothing, focusing on the external drive, but on the inner man.
Or maybe he can't shake hands and has to spit in the face.
And the fallacy of change will be deleted.
-Recently we saw you in the role of the organ grinder.-Cultural City should have such a hero.
And who would it be, if not I?
-And may be commercial art beautiful?
-At present it should be commercial, utility art thorough, considerate, sweet.
Decomposition of cultures.
Previously, people gathered in bunches, La Bohème loved one, free from other people.
Today, everything broke down on mikrospolečnosti, today it is very hard to please everyone.
I'm not stodolarová note, I liked them all.
Today you need to think who is zalíbíte.
Today, everyone has a cultural hero of 100 fans.
Stasu-A few thousand viewers comes Mikhailov!
-For him to come, there will be engaging fans sexually social sphere.
And the cultural soil comes 300 people and 10,000 of them to come, and as a result there is less management, money, all languishing.
I have fans, the main thing is that there is no one can't fool and will not infringe, that is changing.
When I was young, I painted such pictures that hung on the wall of collectors, along with Falkem and Larionovem.
I started with the images in which people mostly ends.
Today, people often confuse the terms.
They say: the culture of spiritual culture consumer.
There is no consumer culture, it is from somewhere else.
I am a man of culture yesterday, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused the money because of the drawing of images.
And I have for such a culture.
-Cyril, Saint Petersburg is the lack of what?
-Good experts in culture.
There is such a concept: the officer had through culture.
Not all of them can deal with culture.
During the fair it was not the tsars in everything, maybe too along with the culture Czars, but understand that there is a need to promote the real experts.
In Moscow today are good consultants.
In our country we have people in St. Petersburg, who might be experts, but they are shadowy figures in the corner somewhere, because they are great professionals who need to properly appreciate these experts and bring them on the correct path.
Today is the vkusovština.
The same Erarta, but differs from it by honestly say that not everything modern art we accept, there are artists who should look for another Museum.
-What is your Petěrburk?
-Petěrburk-this is not a capital of culture, Moscow is much more culture, there is the right soil.
And on our úhoru the art of doing miserably.
We need a cultural land, but is now with us writers over readers, this is wrong.
In Europe, the very many people who are curious, who like to walk on exhibitions, concerts.
The US is such a layer is just weak.
We need to make art became a fad, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented by means of a grant St. Petersburg
Born in the universe
The country is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravan space transports with earthmen on Board shall be issued on a journey looking for a spare planet.
To save the mankind, the main question arises: how to keep your rod in conditions of weightlessness, or on the planet?
I think that the choice is not great.
In fact, there are only two planets, that it is possible to adopt, if only hypothetically.
"It's a Venus and Mars," says a senior researcher of the State Astronomical Institute of p. k. Šternberga (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
While on Mars, but better conditions for life on the surface of Venus can reach temperatures of 500 degrees Celsius.
There is only possible to live in a high altitude or in orbit around Venus ... in the universe.
Reproduction issues in the universe, scientists started with flora.
Already half a century ago experiments were performed on the plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from their terrestrial relatives.
After the pronouncement of the insects has been carried out at the orbit-very small fruit fly Drosophila.
In 1979, was sent into space a quail egg, to see how the embryo develops in weightlessness.
At the output we get absolutely normal bird.
But then the problems begin.
"There is a problem with the fact that this bird must find a foothold, it must stand on its own feet and begin to move," says head of laboratory of the Institute of biomedical problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Sychev.
If you do not find a foothold, the birds fall down doing somersaults and chaotically.
After 10 hours of ' freshly hatched birds to a total extinction of the instincts.
The birds have not responded to light or sound.
And the trouble was that within four days you just died.
"Twice we left hatch birds, but we refused, because it is simply impossible to work there with them," commenting on the failure of the experiment with chickens in the universe Vladimir Sychev.
The last "miniarcha" with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 will be experiments continue.
In biosatelitu "Bion" but will only be beings of one sex.
An experiment with rats that were broadcast into space already pregnant.
Basically there was nothing supernatural.
"It was only on biosatelitech, but again-this is a unique experiment, and such attempts should be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on Earth, the cosmic rat offspring were born.
To approach the problem of reproduction right in the universe has so far failed.
It is a difficult task.
When you lose the usual animals to the environment simply cannot realize their sexual instincts.
Person, unlike animals, may in principle.
Homo sapiens is ruled by abstract thinking and is able to create the corresponding emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments to be carried out.
But women are flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger threatened Tereshkova 's.
The most valuable thing humanity has is the female body.
Our Chaika flew and no one on the ground was unable to say whether the last flight into space.
After this flight, whether it can give birth to a child.
"But that question still no one answered," says veteran Economist-space sector Vachtang Vačnadze.
In June of 1964, more than a year after the flight into space, gave birth to the first woman-cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova.
Father of the child was also a Vostok Nikolajev.
In 1988, he was born the son of the second wife-kosmonautce Světlaně Savické, which was visited by orbit twice and that she also worked in the open space.
However, the risk remains.
We only have a few astronauts, after long years of born and grow healthy offspring.
"In addition, it can be dangerous even when the orbital flights," says astronaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
Humanity must inevitably find new paths in the area of biotechnology, radiation protection and the formation of artificial gravity.
Hydrolaboratoř-is a mandatory stage in the preparations for the flight.
Here in conditions of zero gravity, astronauts's embrace habits needed to work in an open space.
The water simulates weightlessness.
Although adult is water, while comfortable, but in a way, a strange environment for young children is a natural phenomenon.
Small ichtiandři it seems to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that the child is present at an average of 9 months in the mother's amniotic fluid and it is then easier for them to adjust to the water.
In principle, it is logical, because from the time of birth, from the moment that first swim, only takes about 2 weeks.
"It's a very little on it, that the child has forgotten something," says instructor swimming of newborns Marina Aksenovová.
In short-if it is for a newborn baby, a more natural state of weightlessness for women is a natural inevitable gravitation, attractive force.
In a State of weightlessness occurs very quickly to the decline of the abdominal muscles, the muscles of the pelvis, decreases the body's ability to expel the fetus.
We can leave aside, if they perform activities of promoters of the muscles during delivery.
After all, it is possible that the birth took place in a Special Chamber, in which the body of the mother for forcing product.
"And what else?" asks Valeri Polyakov complex issues.
On the other hand, the baby also needs an artificial gravity.
If it is not on the body causing gravity, cannot correctly form a skeleton, or a set of muscles.
Newborn to orbit is not possible as an adult to wear a special suit with loads, in which he could train.
Just will be deprived of what is essential to its development needs.
"If you go to the experiment, which will admit the birth of a child in a foreign environment, deliver on the ground, a disabled person who is going to be absolutely non-customized ambience," predicts head of Commission for Bioethics IBMP RAN Igor Pestov.
So childbearing in the universe today is just a theoretical question.
Once, however, the time will come when it becomes a reality, and when the earth shall issue in their sailing to far-away planet, which becomes home to their offspring born in the universe.
Czech: švarcsystému Check failed due to politicians
The Czech Republic has in connection with public procurement good reviewers and quality legislation is lagging but in its application.
In an interview with now it says Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office Miloslav Kala.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct-it is what we are missing, in my opinion," commenting on the current situation of Kala.
Similar findings also suggests common control of Czech and German officers.
As an example of improper practice provides access to Petr Nečas to so-called "švarcsystému".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the CDP will be entrepreneurs bother him checks-so it is disabled or enabled?
"The law must be somehow adjusted, and if anything, that disables even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the activities of the Office, which has the duty to supervise and enforce the obligations to walk," he says.
At a meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of deputies have spoken about a joint project between the Czech and the German party, within which it was matched by the legislation on public contracts in both countries.
What specifically?
As for parallel control, which we started about two years ago.
To put it simply, that European legislation regulates the manner in which public procurement deal, followed by the various national legislations, and then also the practice.
We put all this together, and even if the check has not yet been completed, showed us a very interesting differences-in General, the legislation is perhaps even "stricter and more perfect", but the practice is in certain parameters better in Germany.
Therefore, it is not enough to create still more precise rules on and on, but there is a need to pursue the application of the law.
What are you actually can help this project, what it means for you?
Just such a joint control could help to stop its endeavours to refinement of the law, reduction and improve the limits, when it does not have such a positive impact.
Economy of means to obtain the appropriate thing for a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price, in order to avoid the enrichment and, where appropriate, criminal proceedings.
But by lowering the limit orders, that we may not necessarily achieve.
Maybe the system is overloaded with so much "paper", that those who want to search for in that system, so you will draw much more easily than if the limit remained higher.
You're talking about domestic issues with converting public procurement legislation into practice.
How does the system of control in Germany?
There is similar to our Office, the SAO, or is it set?
What authorities regard as the SAO Bundesrechnungshof works there, which is organized similarly to the us, also has a College, just make up a little differently, but, in principle, both the authorities shall apply mutatis mutandis.
Also powers are similar to a certain extent, however, by the fact that Germany has a federal arrangement, so has the following courts and at the level of the individual Länder are the system from our a little bit different.
BERNE may control only of the federal money, represented by State resources.
Public funds, which are managed by the County and municipalities, there are federal-level accounting.
What are the terms of the legislation, so it is easier to use than ours?
Generally, I would do it without specific data I don't like comparing, however, in some respects, Germany is called the pattern, but I cannot definitely say that it is all better.
It is therefore even better by having reviewers?
Certainly not, but again, I say, I do not have such a comparison.
But it is necessary to say, that even countries that we consider to be a pattern, are faced with a wide range of issues.
Otherwise there would be no benefit for them to cooperate with our Office, isn't it?
As regards domestic legislation, what for your Office was the amendment of the Act on public contracts, are already somehow its effects?
Whereas the period of validity of this amendment is quite short, so we still in the checking operations.
Because we do the ex-post checks, is a force to be reckoned with some delay.
We observe that so far only in the process of preparing future checks-we started our new tool "detection risk inefficiencies", through which we shine almost 14 thousand contracts, and we analyzed the being-there is, of course, those changes will be, because it changes the limits, conditions for some types of tender shall be adjusted and so on.
Approval of the Bill, therefore, do you consider more of a contribution, or another load of bureaucracy?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope that it will confirm.
A problem that can occur is that she rules "tighten" and can not be observed.
For the operation of the previous rules are controlled by persons committed by the provider (for example, in the case of the Regional Council of the regional operational programmes) to ensure that any failure to comply with the law on public procurement means violation of budgetary discipline.
Has the price of the law in this way climbing?
I don't think so in this way.
The system must exclude those who want him to attack and abuse, and not to punish those who are guilty of the formal misconduct that does not have an impact on decision making.
Such a system will only create more pressure on the bureaucracy.
And how it out?
Let us show you the way no way.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the CDP will be entrepreneurs bother checks that the so-called "švarcsystému"-what does that mean?
Švarcsystém is disabled or enabled?
The law must be somehow adjusted, and if anything, that disables even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the activities of the Office, which has the obligation to go to inspect and enforce the obligations.
You may say: "we will change the law, and we are going to do it", but can not say that we will do nothing like that.
In the Act on public procurement are fairly strict rules on how to be formally carried out-which is to properly protect the public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when a lead with the best bid is barred only for formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct-it is what we are missing in my opinion.
The roads are icy in places, but mostly passable
In several places in the Czech Republic are also patches of ice and snow-covered roads.
In most cases, but the road passable, somewhere with caution.
The Karlovy Vary region
In the Karlovy Vary region were this morning the road passable, but patches of ice and snow.
The temperature has dropped between five to ten degrees below zero during the day, but it has a slightly warm.
Snowfall in the region ceased, and the country is just a weak layer.
On the ridges of the Ore mountains, however, is about 30 inches of snow.
Sometimes it was even less visibility due to fog, is apparent from the data of the regional control centre, Montreal.
Expressway R6 and first class communication are in the region now can be run without user intervention.
However, caution is in place, for example, on some of the přemostěních, where it can be of course not and slippery surface.
2WD all paths are also second and third class including mountain roads.
On them, but in some sections still lies the remains of the frozen and snow ujetého.
At higher elevations, above all, need to pay close attention to driving.

On some roads in the Eastern Bohemia there is ice, and at higher elevations in the mountains may be on the road travelled by the layer of snow on its website, inform the Directorate of roads and motorways.
Road bikers warn the driver before the frost may form especially in the higher elevations of the Pardubice region.
Ice may be in the vicinity of Oflanškroun, Usti nad orlici, shelves, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, especially on the roads of others and third classes.
Chemically treated road I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy.
The snow is, in particular, on the roads in the Krkonoše and Orlické Mountains.
Driving a snow layer is in the highest positions on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In Eastern Bohemia is today mostly clear to partly cloudy skies with no precipitation.
Temperatures are typically between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, light wind blows.
Plzeňský kraj
Roads in the Czech Republic this morning are passable, but with caution and should be adapted to the weather.
It is in the morning chill, temperatures are between three to nine degrees below freezing.
After the previous snowfall and subsequent cooling down so may be some patches of communication.
Drivers must count with the fog, visibility will gradually improve.
It is clear from information of the regional control centre, Montreal.
Highway D5 is almost without restriction, however, administrators recommend extra caution communication between 80 to 131 mile.
Most roads of the first class has a surface of dry and vymrzlý.
On the South the Pilsen region and the Tachov region but may be patches.
Communication of second and third class are moist and also in this case, the notification of patches.
Drivers should be careful especially on less busy roads in area of Šumava.
The Olomouc region
With a snow mashed on the road must now count drivers heading to the highest positions of the Olomouc region.
After the chemical remained at the winter Červenohorském the saddle and on the road in the direction of Videlský cross.

At night they went out into the field as well as their colleagues in the Jeseník region, ways to ae highest position are now according to them, after the chemical treatment of bare and wet.
On one of the roads are passable with no restrictions on Šternbersku, however, had the drivers to watch out for in forest areas, where road conditions remained humid.
Ústí nad Labem region, Liberec region
Several difficult to passable places reported today in the morning road bikers in North Bohemia.
In addition to several places with snow or napadaným with ledovkou is closed and the mountain road from Telnice, Knínice Usti Region on the results from the police database.
Temperatures will hold in the lower elevations below zero, so ice and snow may be on the road.In the lowlands, in particular, to the southeast of the Czech central mountains, on the other hand any problems are not as a rule, and the roads are dry.

Šimon Ornest were added: at concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the fact that he has less than a month to be end of the world?
It's just one of the more alarmist, which we humans like to catch.
Together with the band The Tap Tap, we're rather fun and we say that we are the only band in the world that is able to collect enough positive energy to the end of the world, to delay or avoid.
In addition, in December to organize a totally unique project three concerts against the end of the world.
You can introduce to readers?
A national fund-raiser, which we are planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on 21. at 11: 10 am in the morning.
The day before, 20. December from 9 pm to 3 concerts will take place in parallel in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
Results will be around the time when on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is in the time zone about 12 hours ahead of us, the Mayan calendar comes to an end.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally, this was probably my idea, then we all would be made together with our artist and John "pray for her.
In addition, we want to amass enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to along with the public think about the condition of this world once we to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we also have created a unique collection of articles, shoes, t-shirts, bags or original germ against the end of the world which you buy on www.e-tap.cz people may also support it.
The Tap Tap along with other performers also sang a hymn against the so-called end of the world, which is called "end of the world."
Today it is very popular on YouTube, you will hear on these charity concerts?
Of course, in the end, if we get it, and there will be no end of the world ...
It will sing all the artists at all three concerts at the same time.
At the same time also links the hymns in a unique live on Czech television.
The words to this song written by and starring Jesus in a clip played by Tomáš Hanák, sings in her also Xindl X ...
How did you get to interact with them?
We cooperate with other personalities from the Czech cultural scene, due to the fact that we're having a lot of charity events and concerts ...
We're trying to is intensively involved in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in cooperation with us and having fun.
What will the proceeds from concerts against the end of the world?
For the equipment of barrier-free training center's Studeo, already the sixth year is realized with the civic association Tap in Jedličkově Institute.
For students of the Institute regularly attend Jedličkova teachers and pay them in activities that they enjoy and are interested in.
Students themselves do not have the resources for teachers went on their own, we try to give them a permit in this way.
In the context of the completion of the Jedličkova Institute in the future there will be a separate building in which we move on with this project.
Each concert will feature several musical groups and performers.
According to what you selected?
We tried to build a program that will appeal to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will Chingy, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
Full details can be found on www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar "bombastic action" in the future?
In May we will be performing at the Prague Spring Festival for the first time, so here I'm sure we will prepare an interesting programme with interesting guests.
Next year, we would also like to play in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, when we'll be in the us, I would like to connect with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalist, yet have you performed, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group consisting of handicapped people.
How these paths you can manage logistically and organizationally?
It's not so bad as it seems at first sight.
We have five members on the power wheelchair, the trucks must travel in the cargo hold, as well as with each other, of course, vláčíme a large amount of freight and crates with the tools ...
However, so far, it always ran without a hitch, the CSA as well as British Airways on us were well prepared, up to the number of times I wondered.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was no problem.
Thanks to výjezdům, you can compare how the different barriers, public access to the handicapped, and so on.
What you haven't yet met?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other places, where everything works better than us, we have just witnessed in Russia on the East, everything is still in its early days.
Compared to Prague is Moscow very barrier, here is still unusual for a man in the electric wheelchair itself in the center of the city.
There is not even such common sense, as that should be used by wheelchair users prefer in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are now even civil unions, which are trying to highlight the problems of people with disabilities.
And conversely, what we still have to catch up with more advanced countries?
There are plenty of things in which we are still behind.
But it is important to mention that the improvements and enhancements to the situation is always dependent on the pursuit of the people concerned.
In London and in Madrid is quite common, that even people with severe disabilities separately move in public, they can go to the bathroom, to the Museum, anywhere ...
But it is not very usual that there would be a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, in which we, in turn, with The Tap Tap a little in advance!
Respect for the public or bezbariérovost is one thing, but only when we are both notable athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, so things start to change for real.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but a couple of years back what you made in 1998 to establish it?
I joined as an educator in the Jedličkova Institute, where I was around a lot of young people who were interested in something to pursue.
And since I'm a musician myself, I play, inter alia, on saxophone, so I along with a colleague, he founded the extracurricular music group.
Well, over time we're saying our moderator Lada Angelovič, a little out of hand (laughs).
But popularity has come up in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that helped us when we started to connect with well-known singers and also actively work to promote the band.
We work, which is seen as essentially did not exist.
Thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can afford high-quality teachers, equipment and so on.
Was your goal is to make it with The Tap Tap this high?
From the beginning I felt the potential that I can do something else.
Showbusiness is chock full of things where one mimics the other.
It is logical in its own way, everything new is being received with caution and it takes a long time.
Things that are unique, there is very little, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of someone who sees us for the first time, is of course a pity, it's only natural ...
But this is utterly useless, because people with disabilities there is no suffering from all the abandoned creatures, which we'll have to regret it.
These are people who can live a full life and to develop, of course, provided that they have the necessary resources.
I am saying that if something can be accessible to people with disabilities, so it's not a shift just for them, but for society as a whole.
This success was helped by the fact that you are also a strict boss, how many people have you identified?
When we want to do quality work, we must be uncompromising in many cases and require a certain amount of discipline.
But I think it's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic notion and with his head in the clouds, and when he finds that it must twice a week to walk on the attend exam preparation and spend a lot of time on the road at the concerts, so is enthusiasm quickly leaves.
But the way it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something.
The band currently has The Tap Tap 20 members.
How many of them were its beginnings in 1998?
Only a single Lavish Angelovič.
We are an open Group, people are leaving and coming, I can't stop it.
Who has the will and the desire to always be with us, the door is open
It will take place a day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21 hours
The Incheba arena will take place in Prague, Brno and Ostrava, Flédě gas tank with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three cities are at the end of the evening when telemostem links common singing songs of the band The Tap Tap "end of the world"
The aim of the concert is to collect funds for the equipment of multifunctional barrier-free training center's STUDEO in Jedličkově Institute in Prague in the amount of $ 25 million
Admission to the concert is 400 CZK, children up to 12 years have free admission tickets in advance Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
In the past week, it was at a meeting of Ministers of the European Space Agency accepted Poland as the 20th member of the European Space Agency, as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic, which is a full member of ESA was November 12, 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994, and over the next years, participated in a number of projects of the Agency.
However, the path of Poland into space began much earlier.
Flights into space with the Polish enthusiasts already before the second world war; but not always met with understanding.
For example, to hold a lecture and. Šternfelda in Warsaw astronomical observatory that 6. December 1933 was the thoughts of her groundbreaking work entry into the space.
Thoughts of a young engineer (b. 1905) let the audience cold and after years of Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
Šternfeld in 1934 received an entry in the Astronautics in France Robert Esnault-Pelterieho and André Louis Hirscha.
There the doctor Jan Gadomski (1889-1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and Astronautics.
In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote a series of books dedicated to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became world known promoter of Astronautics and its contribution was awarded by one of the craters on the far side of the Moon was named on his behalf.
Already in 1925, was in Poland built rolling stock, which should be the dandy horse equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the design is not known and not known, nor the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether the missile was to be used to start or stop the mantrip.
Information about the handcar are known only from the fine print.
Since 1933 the rocket missiles began to deal with the Polish artillery.
Research conducted Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Wolfkem and Prof. Mieczyslawem Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the material, it is clear that the research has come to the stage of prakzických tests.
However, the arrival of the German troops was researching interrupted.
In 1937, in the trade press suggested photoelectric fighter rockets, designed by engineer Rohoziński and in the following year published work give penalties NP.rakieta-torpeda powietrzna rakietobomba author Leliwy lotnicza i-Krzywoblockého.
Both projects have been designed for military use of rocket motors.
Just before the war, all military use of rocketry projects devoted to Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which has coordinated all the work.
The Committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of its activities, putting an end to start a war.
Other works dedicated to the aerospace sector after the war in the Polish press thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time is a mention of the company in the year 1954 the magazine's November issue, in which there are four more comprehensive articles dedicated to Astronautics.
In one of them, by Prof. m. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a company that will deal with the space.
At that time he was already spreading out projects of artificial satellites and it was clear that space research is a perspective branch.
From the beginning in 1956, the Polish company astronautická snažia (PTA) to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in the fall became a full member of PTA.
And in the following year, the first President of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became Vice President of the International Astronautical Federation.
This position he held until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has significantly contributed to the development of the very successful meteorological rockets RM (give penalties NP.rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket, which carries out scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first was 10. October 1958.
Missile with dostupem 1800 metres long, was about 80 cm and her weight was less than 5 kg.
It was later built an improved version of the RM-1 and in the summer of 1959 were launched in the Bledovské desert flight tests of a two-stage missile RM-2.
The rocket was long and its weight 1,4 metres was about 11.5 kg.
Next release should be able to type the actual scientific work-RM-34 rocket should have a service ceiling of up to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the upper wind.
In 1962, however, further development was suspended.
A descendant of the first missile type RM has become a Meteor-1 rocket under development from 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was conceived as a two-stage, its total length is 510 cm and starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Have been developed in three types (denoted by Meteor-1A,-1B and-1 c), which differ in the size of the space for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A was a room with a capacity of 0,4 litres, Meteor-1B with a volume of 0.34-litre and Meteor-1 c of 0,62 litres.
The maximum ceiling for all three types was 37 miles away.
Between 1965 and 1968, took place in the Aviation Institute of development of missile Meteor-2, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Rocket Meteor-2 had the starting weight 380 kg, and was able to bring the payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 miles.
Subsequently built version of Meteor-2 and Meteor-3.
I still need to mention Poland's accession to the COSPARu (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, and the creation of a National Committee of a VALVE in the two years later.
Poland is also in the INTERCOSMOS programme involved in research space on the Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became second after Vladimir Remkovi interkosmonautem.
The abolition of the law on public works is not an option.
In the past week, the Constitutional Court annulled the law on public works.
The resolution gave rise to a lively discussion in public.
Certainly it will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in a globalized world are based on the principle of more unregulated competition.
In effect this means that individual economic units national economic systems, is in permanent conflict with each other.
This is the principle of free trade, and free, unfettered movement of private capital, together with the unbridled financial speculation.
Due to the considerable differences work, prices (wages) to the price.
Under this term is to be understood as a situation in which the manufacturer is trying to import low-priced goods to compete in the competition by "screwing" price of the competitor in order to tear down the bigger share of the market and thereby increase their own profits.
On a massive scale that means for most entrepreneurs either translate production abroad, or cheap to buy, or crease.The result is high unemployment in countries where prices are in comparison with other economies.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and thus the responsibility for his vyprodukovanou unemployment, rising social spending necessarily state.
The whole situation is a complete unwillingness on the part of business owners pay taxes and thus replace the social economic and social damage that has done in pursuit of profit.
The situation is so widely known that it is not necessary to indicate specific statistics.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital in individual economies, create a situation where Governments are forced to enter into mutual competition in order to artificially reduce the social level of own population in order to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, Governments give to the private capital to attack its own population regardless of social decline.
It manifests itself primarily in the amendments to the applicable law.
The goal is to force its own population accepted price dictation of private capital, in particular in the area of wages.
This is done on the system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, as well as restricting workers ' rights in the field of labour law.
The result is a growing poverty, together with the increase of differences between rich and poor.
In Germany there are already many years public dispensaries food for the poor, who cannot feed their own work.
The number of these people are already in the millions.
In the context of improving the competitiveness of the German economy is quite commonly cases regularly employed people get such a salary, that they must become subsistence pay.
Such a scandal was published and in the case of auxiliary staff of the Bundestag.
Austerity measures virtually all of the southern States, the EU no doubt lead to the same State, when people are under pressure from a disastrous decline in social standards forced either to emigrate as they did in the 19th century. century, or vegetate for the hungry wages on the edge of society in the hope that he will come to the land of private investment capital.
Here it should be, however, one might wonder where the but comes in?
If it will be from other EU countries, poverty then moves from one country to another, or not coming at all, as the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, or Turk, Marokánec, or Egyptian or African still work for a fraction of the wages.
This applies To the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theory and media ad nauseam argues that the State is unable to participate in the capital on their own premises that command economy leads to economic disaster.
Private equity stubbornly insist that the State must not interfere with the economy managing interventions.
You must then ask whether the private equity does not affect now actually be governed by policy and the entire State in a custom egoistickém.
Here is a unique answer that Yes.
The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all Member States.
The result is a desperate situation as reflected in the area of corruption, providing mutual benefits, legislation, where practically everything is reprehensible, but nothing criminal.
In Germany, the situation is such that the State Ministry for the lack of funds to be awarded the drafting of laws to private legal firms, which are frequently used in conjunction with the industry.
These bills are then reconciled in the Bundestag.
All the power in this way does not come from the people how to preach Western-style Constitution, but from financially strong groups preferring their own interests.
It is clear that the Liberal-oriented democracy is now quickly get into a situation, as it describes the Appiános in his work the crisis of the Roman Republic in the time of Caesar and Pompeia: "the State has already long been in full decomposition and authorities occupied by force.
For bribes, illegal obtaining favours and using stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption without any inhibitions and closest to the people went to the polls with sold voice "..."--people already at the Office, so that one was a consequence of the breakdown of the State eight months without consuls ". .."Indeed, began to talk about the sole and exclusive remedy in bad situation is far from that and you have to choose a vibrant man.. " While Appiános thought of the pompeion but became Caesar, which changed to take democracy to autocracy of.
Conclusion as in the ancient world is a company based on their own preference for the benefit of the reckless regardless of overall social interest.
Private equity is no longer inherently able to understand and apply the overall social benefit.
The result is now, as then, the unprecedented decadence elites without any efforts to reform a deeper impact.
Causality the onset of fascist and Communist regimes we must therefore search in the indiscriminate liberalisation of economic systems 19. and 20. in the 19th century.
In the current state can be the demise of these systems in favor of democracy liberal of type a can be regarded as a break with the expectations of the next round.
Especially disastrous is the fact that the current elite is completely ignored in the future the Ombrone Pistoiese, loss of life, humanitarian and social disasters, which we are now witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the history of the old and new.
The abolition of the law on public works is not an option, at least not permanently.
Under the pressure of competition both at the international and national level to the European level, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social standards of the population.
This trend is, therefore, a system.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the State's participation in the economy of capital, will strengthen the influence of citizens on the Government and weaken the monopolistic position of private equity in the company in favour of the State.
Israel: laboratory of chaos.
"Nothing can come from violence and never can't" Sting in the song Fragile whose main verse in the chorus is "Let us not forget how fragile we are"
"If my sons didn't want war, there would be no" dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Rothschild in 1849 Amschela
After the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, a lot of vyrojilo reactions.
One is for Israel, they argue its right to self-defense and Palestinians fit into the role of terrorists, while others support the Palestinians argue racism Israeli State genocide being perpetrated against the Palestinian Arabs and the State of Israel, they fit into the role of a terrorist State.
I don't want to think about it, who's in the periodically recurring waves of killing the culprit and who is the victim, after all, today's residents of Israel, including the self-governing territory were born into the current political situation and the beginning of the violence to a new level.
My point is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look at who primarily serve 95 years of tension (counted since the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of land in the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning is supported by available historical facts, some of which are derived on the basis of my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
The history of mankind are primarily the history of the struggle for power.
In each epoch we can trace some of Alexander the great or Napoleon.
What is not so evident is if it was always these personalities who absolutely autonomously governed by its actions, whether for their throne stood someone who direct their actions to advance the vytýčenému target.
We have to admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth in the hands of a few individuals zkoncentrováno and that concentration of money and the resulting power could occur in the life of a generation.
Between these astronomically rich families, one stands out, which could be regarded as the head of an Octopus (if anyone still stands over them I don't know, but I do not exclude it)-Rothschieldové.
I write about them.
Of Course.
The first press agency (Reuters) bought in the 1990s. at the age of 19. in the 19th century to stop the merger of his name with the highly criminal acts, in the background and that they always meant the consolidation of power, increased wealth, or both.
Have major stakes in almost all central banks of the world and against countries where shares in the Central Bank do not maintain or preparing war (from attack of Afghanistan it was 7 countries, for invading Iraq was that 5 countries, Gaddafi left over after dropping just four, but in the meantime, Russia was subordinate to the Central Bank of the Russian Government).
Anyone with this family tried to resist, he died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the Central Bank of Rothschieldově Bank of America, during the civil war, began to issue its own (read Government) money, and he was assassinated in 1865 at the theatre.
JFK began to issue their own money and wanted to abolish the FED, was assassinated in 1963, Member of the Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for the unleashing of the great depression in 1929.
Their desire for global power led in the years 1859-1871 to formulating a plan for three world wars a Freemason Supreme, 33. the degree of dedication of Albert Pike.
The first war was to remove large monarchical State units in Europe, the second was to remove colonial estate in particular Great Britain and the third has lead to a reduction of the world's population somewhere in the 0.5-1 billion people (a quantity of slaves for their comfort and the luxury of enough and do not consume so many resources), create one universal religions (ecumenism is nothing more than proximity to such a solution), and the final takeover of absolute power.
The method by which a group of the world's richest families, headed by Rothschieldy works is the invocation of the crisis, and then offer a solution (order ab chao – order out of chaos).
These solutions are but false and always leads to the deterioration of the situation (see the founding of the FED, to avoid a crisis like the one in 1907).
So after they managed to assassination of the Habsburg successor to the R-U to the throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo to unleash the first world war, Tsarist Russia destroyed by the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war came to a sudden, militarily and economically unfounded, the surrender of Germany (there was no need for war for the destruction Tsarist Russia) and subsequently to the unraveling of the Central European powers, Austria.
In order to facilitate the unleashing of the second world war left the bankers create policy latently conflicted by Germany have imposed huge war reparations, which created a presumption of radicalisation of impoverished masses and then it was just to foist the Germans sufficiently strong, the culprits and simple solutions to identify the Publisher of the Leader and the creation of a multiethnic, with a strong German minority in Czechoslovakia, which was supposed to play, and he's played, the fifth columnWhen the ignition of the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century to inspire a Rothschieldové the establishment of the Zionist movement, of which one branch sought to create a Jewish State, preferenčně in the field of historic Judea with Jerusalem as the capital of (return to Sion).
Already the Balfour Declaration created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, began to experience the first clashes with the local Arab population.
The terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
The second world war broke out, if Hitler snapped out of the chain, where it initially held the international bankers, or everything that has made it the plan is difficult to estimate, but the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created a prerequisite for acceptance of a Jewish State as a world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, like the war reparations Germany was off to a 2nd World War, it was the announcement of the State of Israel created an outbreak of war.
If international bankers can unleash, the Jewish nation, like the other victims in the front line of fighting, now together with the Arab or Muslim populations of the Middle East in General.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only within countries, but also on an international scale (consider just how sharply divided people on supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where grieving in the endless chain of injustice begets violence, when at the beginning of everything was the greed of individuals and their desire for a global power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish between simple people of Israel from their leaders, because like us, podstrkují international bankers people choice in the elections solely their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel Hawk Netanyahu is a typical example of fašizujícího, the international bankers loyal, a politician who is doing everything to ensure that unleashed the war with Iran, which, due to the membership of Iran in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, ...), threatened to turn into a global conflict and given to check Iran over through the Strait which travels 20% of all the world's oil (shipping corridor is just 2 miles wide) as well as the destruction of the world economy.
In that light, now appears to be speaking the words that David Rockefeller in 1994: "all we need is the general crisis and people will accept the new world order."
The new world order in their vision is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population is the comfort of a handful of the financial aristocracy.
A world where every new narozenému individuals implanted at birth, a chip that makes it totally controlled.
"And forcing all small and great, rich and poor, slave and free, to have on his right hand or on their foreheads branded, to buy or sell, which is not marked in the name of the beast or the number of its name.
It is important to understand: let him who has understanding adds up the number of the beast.
This number indicates the man and it is the number six hundred sixty-six. "
Movie: worst call Hollywood
In November 1979, Islamist students demonstrating crowd occupied the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
Should be released in Exchange for the ousted Shah of Iran Mohammed Rézu Radicals, which after the revolution, he fled to the UNITED STATES, which had been a patron of his regime over several decades.
For the u.s. Administration the situation does not provide a positive solution-throw the Shah of Iran across the Board she could not afford, because they would so fundamentally jeopardise the confidence of allies in other countries.
The release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, has not been able to reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later deepened fiasco attempt to rescue the hostages by force.
Detention of diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations brokered the Algerian Government.
Their fate at home sparked a wave of solidarity and protiíránského sentiment.
Debacle in Iran significantly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter's with Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
Film actor Ben režírujícího Afflecka Argo describes one episode in the history of America, which has brought a small victory.
Just prior to the occupation of the Embassy of her six employees fled.
After difficult haggling ended up at the residence of the Canadian Ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with Canadian authorities managed to get them help from Iran, while the extravagant cover-story on Canadian passports, as members of the film crew, who was walking in the country of the location for the filming of sci-fi epic.
The combination of genres
The plan, which was invented by an expert on the "exfiltraci" Tony Mendez, required the cooperation of Hollywood.
That legend was credible, I remember reading about a film project in specialized magazines, there were press conferences, a fictional production company had a real Office.
Details of the operation were classified for a long time, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck movie is a special combination of multiple genres.
On the one hand, realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time. "caper movie" the story of vydařeného piece, happy trip-an example might be a series of Danny's men.
In the film, alternating moods-on the one hand a documentary conceived sequence from Tehran (in titling sequence are shown the iconic period photographs as well as the way in which events were the same the situation presented in the film-the large differences in that they are not).
On the other hand, lightened passages from Hollywood, treated with irony and slight exaggeration.
And then there's a scene of CIA headquarters and other institutions-men in suits discuss situation in meeting tables, in the corridors of the Office, on the phone ...
Ben Affleckovi is a remarkable way he managed to restart his career.
From vysmívaného, the actor became a respected Director, as well as his acting has ceased to be the butt of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after the dark crime drama Gone Baby Gone (2007), and the thriller the town (2010).
At the same time it is the first slide to Affleck not taking place in the Director's home in Boston.
A feel for the atmosphere of the place was between the characteristics that režisérovy older povyšovaly films over Hollywood standard.
And Affleck him in Argos, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, to reconstruct real events-the opening sequence fall embassies is impressive in its clarity, which also conveys the emotion of the confusion and nepřevídatelnosti, which occurs when they move out of the history somewhere.
A similar effect of Affleck and his collaborators are in the scenes of fictitious (fake crew on teheránském Bazaar).
Too many processes on too many places
The Director had to deal with the fact that story does not actually much suspenseful scenes in the movie sense.
Quite successfully with it almost works, sometimes to the reality of something přimyslí-there all so elegantly comes out (the scene in which the impending crisis in the teheránském airport turn away a phone call in America and chase after the runway is pretty far fetched).
Weakness of the ARGO's distractibility resulting from the need to show too many processes on too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in the roles Hollywood associates a very playful, their figures should, however, have more space and are not in the movie is far from the only.
Affleck movie kind of losing a dramatic stroke, it's a snapshot, which you can track with a slight concern, to appreciate the implementation and retro style reminiscent of the thrillers of the 1970s. years.
Sweeps away but a hard time.
As a reminder of one yet in a way, living history and proof of how exaggerated are the images of všemocných and vševědoucích of the secret services, but it is sufficient.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
Server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually announces a poll about the most ridiculous bank fee, has now decided to announce a competition for the "most ridiculous regulation or ideas from the workshop of the EU".
"Led us to this last event when the EU plans to adopt a 40-percent quota for women in the management of large European companies," said Organizer Patrik Nacher poll Law.
Among the nominated absurditami already is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court on the unification of the scales of premiums for men and women.
Yet at the same time, women were in the prices of life insurance beneficiary, because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
"Another incredible ideas from the workshop of the EU people can nominate by the end of this year.
The vote will take place by the end of February 2013, "said Nacher.
Among the controversial EU regulation is also required the incorporation of fuel to mix bio components, which are harmful to nature, as well as the prohibition to use reliable mercury thermometers just because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances, or the directive on the size of the chicken cages, which went up significantly this year.
Previously also faced criticism from a de facto ban on the use of the expression for spreading butter or disposal from the sale of incandescent bulbs.
High-quality bananas should be 14 inches
The Union device often decide under the pressure of one or another business or industrial lobby in Brussels, whose requirements usually espoused by any State or group of States (the Czech Republic and now the threat of a veto by pushing for requirements of their banks).
The interests of the lobby and stood by, for example, high quality bananas had to be extended in the European Union of not less than 14 cm in length and were not allowed to show an "anomalous curvature".
The European Commission has said that only the existing fragmented national standards be harmonized, which may complicate the trading.
Standards relating to fruit and vegetables for the EU despite the resistance of some countries softened with by pointing out that the existing directive lead to wasted food.
Candidate for victory in the poll may be last year's EU regulation, according to which it must be sold inflatable balloons indicate that it is compulsory for children under 8 years of age must not inflate without supervision of an adult.
The EU has appealed to the u.s. research, according to which the balloons between the toys leading cause of death of children choking on.
Similar restriction now applies to children up to 14 years for blowing up pouťových frkaček.
Quaint ideas are born at home
Absurd is the rule concerning the European officials-anyone who has in some official capacity, the EU cannot, having regard to the sensitivity of the topic for the use of the name Macedonia and Greece should instead talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Server Bankovnípoplatky. com, in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists to nominate Laissez Faire the poll in addition to some of the above absurdities, even the Union's regulation of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU set maximum amounts of food supplies, which could be located within the territory of the CZECH REPUBLIC on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then crossed for example. provided for preserved mushrooms in volumes, for which he was threatened with high penalty.
The organizers of the poll took the idea to pay some countries that do not have a sea, and the idea for the granting of subsidies for the application to obtain subsidies.
These ideas, however, not in Brussels but in Prague.
"We handicapováni that we do not have sea views.
We will ask the European Union for a refund, "he said in the fall 2004, then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).
As the argument stated that we urodilo a lot of grain, and as a result. intervention buying had become full of warehouses, which had to export.
Considered that the Czech Republic has continued on to us ports, the EU should pay according to Palase hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission has finally stepped out of the CZECH REPUBLIC towards the fact that organised a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Grant to acquire the grants offered to municipalities Ministry for regional development Minister Paul-German (US-DEU), specifically, should go on writing applications for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: bizarre regulation are the exception
Although the regulation in the Member States can easily be criticised, the EU's efforts on the regulation and at the same time the more efficient operation and development of the entire Union, according to a number of experts deserve more recognition.
A more serious problem, according to experts such as drawing EU subsidies for projects that do not have even a hint of anything to do with the deepening of European integration, but that's in budget negotiations required Member States.
Emotions between Czechs raises, as well as other countries of the Union of the CZECH REPUBLIC in Brussels must fight for the right to a specific indication of its traditional products, which do not always succeed in this match.
While the Czechs after six years fighting with the Germans and Austrians of Olomouc tvarůžky designation uphold, but domestic rum, whose tradition dates back to the 19th century. century, they had to rename the producers on our home.
The naming of the rum can carry only products made of cane distillate, and not from sugar beet.
In the EU's official list of registered products in the company's world-famous cheese feta and gorgonzola, Marzipan from Lübeck, Germany or Parma ham already have such as Carlsbad rusks, pohořelice, Trebon carp and hop from Žatec region.
The EU trade mark may also boast of Pardubice gingerbread and rolled wafers.
People want to save the Republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how comes that he wants to run for President?
It's not about that, to be a Senator or President.
If it worked in our country without any problems, I'm not running anywhere.
But I can't watch the last twenty years the country rozkrádá, how thieves are running here, people are raising taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, so I'm trying to come up with a solution, how to change it.
And since I was 40, and I'm an independent Minister of Justice, I have no choice, how things affect than to run for Senator or President.
You got to the Senate, but soon you set off to the Castle.
Neotáčíte it back to the people who elected you?
The whole time I said that to fight about the Castle go according to the outcome in the Senate election.
Later, I made it clear that if elected Senator, I'm going to run for President.
But my goal is not a function, the function is a tool, how can I make my vision.
Therefore, I need the greatest possible impact and what the strongest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we spell in the pub and on TV, but that pošlapeme anyone who wants to try to change.
To this must be added the media that man dehonestují and which confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
About me, claimed that the journalist or uplácím that I was Adviser Jiri Paroubek.
Let's go to your visions.
In the battle for the Castle you started out with the thesis material and criminal liability of politicians and property returns over twenty million.
To do this you need to change the law.
As President but you do not have such authority, and the Senate as a whole may propose laws.
How do you want to solve?
When I as a citizen lobby for that guidance was free trade, it managed to push through.
The problem is politics-when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or from the right, on purpose shall be rejected, and that citizens resides.
As an independent Minister of justice I have much greater potential to obtain support from all parliamentary parties.
My preference is that no party škatulkování and dogmas can I take something that is best for our country, from each side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself more of a human right or left-wing?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people rank rather left.
For me it is not important if a little to the left or a little to the right.
It is important for me to go forward.
It's not about whether or not someone belongs to the left or right, but I want people to associate.
Always happy to support any public good solution, although it suggests the COMMUNIST PARTY, or ODS, and so I'm going against the wrong idea.
Čertíte, when someone tells you that you're populist.
But doing what you said?
When you create a byznysplán in your company, you also have some perfect aim and vision.
And you're trying to reach.
Someone may call it populism, but all proposals, of which I am speaking, in the world of work, and discussed the major experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you're gonna be just your password.
And it's in politics for a long time won't do.
Or do you think that when you people walk and talk with them, they will manage to push through, for example, criminal and material liability?
I have no choice.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on his side, in order to enforce it.
If I were elected President, there is no problem to organize the TV live broadcast, where I ask the President of the parliamentary parties that they enacted a material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they would have to disclose why it won't.
If it's a strong personality, which will name ills such you can push on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the President, it was deserving of public pressure.
On the plane I'm saying that I'm an amateur, I'm not a genius, nor intellectual.
For his views and visions I'm trying to look for allies.
I've only just started in politics and for your program I will try to get majority support.
Things I'm trying to push myself, if it doesn't work, I'll end up in six years and go back into the private sector.
It sounds as if it should save the Česko. Okamura
I'm no Savior.
I know that in one person to do anything, which is why I am walking around a set of known people, whether they would also stand as candidates for the Senate.
I went for the Jančurou, Radim due to the amount of work.
So I at least support the investigative journalist John Lorencovou, which rozkrývala scams with light heating oils.
I ran with the fact that people are really uncomfortable, but now I'm having second thoughts.
Sixty percent of the people not to vote and those who have gone, mostly chosen representative of the establishment.
We in the Senate only two independents.
People navolili the Senate so that the changes will be difficult to enforce.
However, I will fight for your vision, such as the direct election of mayors and Governors.
Are you thinking of setting up his own party?
I have not thought about it, because I don't have time to check the net past any potential straníka, and I don't have the money.
I don't have the money or the presidential campaign, on my transparent account is only 20 thousand.
You do not have the money?
You're talking about equity returns, what's yours?
Private property would be about 60 million.
In Prague, I have a plot of land about 25 million, ten million, an apartment for another apartment for eight million, a collection of works of art in about ten million, amounting to 3.5 million Aston Martin and Skoda Superb in a million, and then I have a few million in the account.
By the way I have a Aston Martin because it was my dream from childhood-I always liked James Bond, who was in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time he fought against by and nešvarům.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, do you have a thing for 60 million and you do not have the money to campaign?
Are you saying that you want to change, but the actual money you don't want to give too much.
It is not very compelling.
I do not have 15 million on the campaign.
It got into debt?
I bumped into a campaign already 2.5 million.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors, attests to the fact that my program is not such an interest.
And I have no obligation to pay from your campaign.
The cost of the campaign basically covers what I will receive senátorský salary.
But he would like a job, for example, I was unable to pay the son of an English-language school, which costs 30 thousand per month.
If I just wanted to make money, I'm not running anywhere.
So you'll continue to do business, so you could live?
Didn't you say that pressing these activities?
But it has nothing to do with the amount of salary.
As promised, I partially canceled its activities.
For example, the Director of travel agency in the spring become my Deputy.
People would want me to be a good Samaritan, which will save the Republic.
But I also need something to live with.
How much have you as an entrepreneur was used to get a month?
Two hundred to 400 thousand, which I take on.
And if I were President, I'd have my business.
You can find the full interview in the Saturday edition of the law.
Architects MVRDV are proof that the real adventure is located just in the head-for example, Spijkenisse and recently built Mountain books-2 images
"The building seems cheerful, looks futuristic. Finally, it is something interesting to see again, "says Lisette Verhaig, that goes around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a large firm, says: "of course, this House is nice."
I, however, I'm asking, what today we need a library.
They all have internet, ipads and e-books.
Into any of these old-style libraries today, nobody goes on a voluntary basis, or Yes?
Spijkenisse, near Rotterdam, custom jobs that was not worth a visit, holds a special record.
This village with 80 000 inhabitants, has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To make this stupid situation resolved, the decision was made a few years ago to contribute to general education and build seven nicely painted fantasy miniatures of reinforced concrete bridges, which are depicted on the euro banknotes.
The success of an educational offensive but he was not giddy.
And Councillors so that there is only one way how to become masters of statistics: we need to have a library!
Winy Maas of MVRDV Rotterdam architectural Studio, a master of insanely courageous column charts and one humorous, often even cynical buildings, took the thing with the usual calm and competitive negotiations in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the Commission still stunned looking around and crouched, shoulders, vršil free gifts on their Maas by size and its aktivisticky motivated speech ended with the words "Dear city village!"
This is my proposal for a mountain of books in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg.
Nine years later the mountain for 30 million navršena.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes an underground parking garage, a supermarket, a post office and a few adjacent homes and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November was a mountain of books is awarded second place "the Best Library of A.D. 2012."
In addition, the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award for 2012.
Maloměstská gray, who still could not offer more than postmodern pedestrian zone and an unusually nasty Town Hall, whose white façade, would you rather expect dairy, is richer by a bit of contemporary architecture.
But more importantly, has now Spijkenisse first public cultural construction in the history of its existence.
Long way to go to the book
First impression: Reader's Eldorado under the hatch on the cheese.
Means of the mountains runs the elevator, but the real spatial and reader's passion to discover the walking control of topography.
From all sides of the glass-covered interior is bright and clear, the floor of the burned Klinker bricks and elegant street lanterns clearly reflect the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You can see the park benches, the dog and the boys and girls who play soccer.
And everywhere, books, books, books.
"Normally stand racks of books along the facade and in the middle is a large dark space, that's the most uncomfortable one, and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We are a classic spatial configuration built upside down and space to the reader we ran out from the inside out.
The Interior of the Mountains of books is skillfully used: in the middle are the Office, the library, the Internet Chess Club, the organic Center and Central plumbing.
Special with black bookshelves, which are one panelling, parapet railings and stairs.
The appearance, structure and the smell is strange.
Over an unknown building material to shake their heads, even the bitterest architects and construction engineers.
"We are here to work with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the urban municipality of Spijkenisse, on the question of the Standard.
And so we are in one fríském the farm one day came across a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields used in the Netherlands as a base under the roots produced the fleece from synthetic materials.
It is cheap and time efficient.
Thin fabric lasts one, two seasons and then it's ripe for being bulky waste.
For the library was the first time in this fleece-quantity-; on the boards with a thickness of four inches.
By the action of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) turns in the dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells a little bit like a new car, and a bit like sports shoes.
After 105 steps leads to the top.
At the end of almost 500 meters long wandering in the literary cafe rewarded with not only fantastic views of the city, but also the Dutch croquette and fíkusy in pots.
You take care of the atmosphere, but also for the correct humidity in the literature.
Gifts for a new soul
"I did not believe it, but this House is in spite of many glass surfaces a prime project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
Heats and cools the Earth's heat.
Although Mountain books is located beneath the glass hatch, the Sun is shining in a short time, and even in the sunny days.
Wide laminated wood trusses, which is perpendicular to the glass facade, serves as a shade and captures a large portion of solar radiation.
The climate in the room is very nice.
The rest of the deal fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, an initial skeptic of the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
Even Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who Boekenberg even referred to as the "long awaited soul" Spijkenisse.
The reason: each of the inhabitants of the city a few weeks ago was invited to the opening, to bestow one book from your personal Fund.
So should first be filled with optical gaps in the not yet fully equipped library, which currently includes 70 000 units.
The concept has worked well.
The shelves are completely filled.
"There is nothing worse than half empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation to the new House now has a population of each particular relationship.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it is just for decoration.
This worked in the Royal discipline of MVRDV, which in the professional jargon says identity formation.
Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.
However young and uneducated.
It is ultimately a starting point for identity.
Szabo, "the Germans must play a greater role"
Germany abstained when deciding to take Palestine.
According to an expert on relations between the US and Europe by Stephen Szaboa the Berlin poised on a narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany at the beginning of the week, first suggested that it would vote against the proposal on the observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But Berlin abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany doesn't support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, of course, must be Germany because of their special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time I think it will not support nor the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence — without, of course, it was too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also delayed the vote, when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
She pushed through NATO.
It is difficult for Germany to take on major international topics clear position?
Yes, this is the case.
The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy, and that the direction from the policy, which has been controlled by the UNITED STATES, so to speak, in the direction of German foreign policy.
The situation is all the more difficult, that Europeans do not have a coherent and consistent policy.
The Germans are, therefore, between the two queues.
It is expected from them, that will play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think its role is only zabydlují, but are on their way to more "normal" foreign policy.
To foreign policy, as in France or the United Kingdom.
What specifically does "normal" foreign policy from the German point of view?
Shows a willingness to take in the case of national interests and attitudes that are independent of the positions of the US and European partners.
I think, that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, export and its relationships with certain areas, such as Russia, China and the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to some extent the non-economic interests of other powers, and must, therefore, protect their interests, Germany.
Economic interests should influence on the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN?
First of all, Germany has large outlets in the Middle East, especially in the States around the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, it must be careful that the neodstrašilo the public, but not the elites in the Arab countries.
It certainly plays a role.
I wouldn't want to do this but not to ascribe too much importance, it is not completely one-sided relationship.
In any case, however, it plays a significant role in German.
Damaged Germany's relations with the United States, as in the case of Germany both important decisions, such as abstention in voting on Palestine?
I think in Europe and even in the United States is ruled by a great understanding for the German position.
That's why I don't think it was such a dramatic turning point, as in the question of Libya.
Perhaps even benefit from Germany of a certain respect.
It indicates that it must be considered to be an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe there are different views on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, by contrast, clearly favour the veto.
There are between the United States and many European peoples differences?
These differences existed in the u.s. as a result of internal politics.
I think that the Obama administration has a substantial understanding of secretly European position.
But due to the political situation cannot, of course, hold this position publicly.
I think the diversity of opinion actually aren't as great as they always seem to.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not too much excited about Netanjahuovou policy.
Germany is not difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the us on one side and with the positions of the most important partners in the EU on the other hand?
I think it makes it harder for the Germans this exactly.
For the Germans, of course, would be a little easier if there was a coherent and integrated European policy, which is currently happening.
Cannot be part of a wider line and must instead take things forward on its own position.
It's just they are doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany takes a leading role in the future and will push Europe toward the European position.
For Germany, of course, is not easy, because of the relationship with Israel.
It has always been a touchy subject.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they must play a more independent role.
Germany sees itself as a major international player? He wants to take over the lead role?
Or is the leading role for Germany still difficult?
Germany is still not on it yet, it's still annoying, and for this country is for obvious reasons still hard to play a greater role.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, as always, when Germany will take a greater role, protiněmecké mood.
It's easier to the Germans.
It's actually an old problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this perspective, Germany in a much more difficult position than the us.
It has to be acceptable to all sorts of neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
The influence of the US in European politics now has steadily decreased, however, the EU is currently this vacuum does not fill. Who else is there?
The Germans simply will have to play a greater role.
Even if they don't like it, it is annoying and makes it even more neoblíbenějšími-c'est la vie!

"The protection of brands" in China: when the Puma and Armani at the same time, the Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
But what is Armani Polo?
It is a designation that is officially registered in China completely, but with the original company has nothing to do.
Shall enjoy protection, however, as long as it is nezažalují real brand owners.
And even then it is not clear whether the making of the law.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners in China to protect its brand," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the Office of Taylor Wessing, which specializes in violation of rights in the far East.
Every week it lands on my desk in the new case.
Counterfeiters have a few extra letters, so that they can log on their brand.
From the brands Gucci, for example, becomes Lu-Gucci and Prada have their register instead of the Prada-Kny.
In this way, are legally copied and the German company, sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a binder with the trademark office records in Beijing.
September 14, 2010 there's left one Chinese company to protect the brand name of Zegna DF Puma. An artificial name that acts as a parasite on the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are the world champions in the copying and infringement of intellectual property rights.
In the big cities are in a multilevel shopping malls, which are almost exclusively sell fakes.
Pattlochovy cases are different. On behalf of its clients shall proceed against Chinese companies received from the Trademark Office officially completely right to use the mark, which is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", associated with the brand.
The word focuses on "Bang is Dakuan".
This meant women who hunt the rich man.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It harms the trade, we have to deal with," invites Pattloch.
"Mark is diluted, the exclusive position disappear, damage to image is huge."
Financial losses and legal costs the affected industries are in the millions, particularly for precious sample products.
According to data from market research company CLSA China with a volume of eur 15 billion per year, the third-largest market for luxury goods and the market, which is growing the fastest.
Deletion of the offending record in the register marks can be difficult to achieve, however, and it is worth something.
Management can stretch for up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch tells of cases where the Court has rejected the claim, because the name was vytýkaný after a long duration of the "market reality".
If complaining party has bad luck, it must still pay the plagiátorovi, because of the damage its brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes it's the law of the jungle.
Known cases of concern as well as graphical elements.
Daimler lost in 2009 legal dispute with the manufacturer Sany construction machines, undertaking, which recently took over the German manufacturer of the pump Putzmeister concrete mix.
The Chinese are approved to use the logo, which is similar to the Mercedes star.
Company Geely bought Volvo, which originally used the blue and white logo, which resembled BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
Manufacturer fashion goods Lacoste in China lost to counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who the famous crocodile turned in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although the CTMO Trademark Office acknowledges that there have been shortcomings in 2010 due to the too small number of staff and space.
But in the last year, supposedly "the progress of the work process returned from emergency situations to normal".
For example, the number of outstanding opposition declined by 22 percent.
Matched was 57 000 such cases, about 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Still waiting for the Office still 81 500 complaints pending.
Something to do is expensive
As is the case in China, often, they're impressive numbers.
Last year there were delivered to the CTMO more than 1.4 million applications for the protection of marks, which is almost a third more than in 2010.
That's a record, and it means that for the tenth time in a row, China leads the list of new applications around the world.
This is also true for the number of all valid trade marks-there are a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011 the fees collected 1.8 billion yuan.
To put it simply, this means that on average each login is 1280 Yuan or € 160.
To start a dispute against it is a multiple of, as shown in the case of a German family company Freudenberg.
This concern has been more than seven years of fighting against the Chinese plagiátorovi.
The Germans may have been canceled by its illegal production of automotive parts imitovaných.
But forger clinched China's rights to the mark Freudenberg.
We have neglected themselves, as in Germany the surname cannot be protected, says Hanna Wentzler, President of the leadership of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
CTMO Trademark Office also is opposed by the Munich firm has rejected.
In two other instances, Freudenberg, gaining the defendant in the lawsuit fights on this day.
You need to be a horrible warning
It is now a matter pending in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that the case would lead to a good end, and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But it also says: "control is extremely expensive and it costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be quantified. In the archives of the company having to even look at a hundred-year-old writings, to submit evidence.
Five years ago the company Freudenberg counterparty in vain offered "high šestimístnou amount in euros" in order to settle the dispute.
"You see what it means to us," says Wentzler.
There is a risk from the far East and Europe hits.
In the case when there's imitators ensure unprotected brand.
One Chinese producer, for example, wanted to sign mark Freudenberg in Germany for the footwear and leather.
This area of business concern, but gave up a long time ago was able to stave off the registration.
"It should be give a terrible warning," says Wentzler.
He and a lawyer advising German Pattloch businesses to trade with China were very careful.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark law. Foreigners would rather they had "everything that in any way is worth the protection log, as well as in China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg in the last act of his drama with the mark falling, then I would have to pay royalties for the non-proper name, explains Wentzler.
Or we'll be in the segment pushed out of the market.
World AIDS Day: stomping, singing, help
In Heidelberg tested Imbongi choir-and in Swaziland have the pleasure of orphans after their parents who have died of AIDS.
The story, which overcomes a lot more than 8733 kilometers.
First, there's the foot-stomping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's shoes and men's moccasins on the dance floor looking for tact and quickly found it.
One-two-three-four.
Then slowly vzedmou the voices of singers-Alto, bass, tenor and soprano-pressing, is bright and prosecutes.
29letého conductor Fiete Hopfa it almost rises from its textile shoes, when combines with voices vláčně wild gestures.
It is Monday night. In the Music Hall of the Institute of medical psychology in Heidelberg tested choir Imbongi new song.
It came to fifty singers and singers between 23 and 69 years ago, from human genetics, including the caretaker.
' Om ' Obani "is not an easy song, each backing voice has a different text, and also in a very foreign language-zulu spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help to self-help
Unaids, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS, estimates that worldwide live roughly 34 million people who are infected with HIV.
The 23.5 million live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland is 245 000 orphans after their parents who have died of AIDS.
HIV-positive is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans after their parents who have died of AIDS, in the village of Esitjeni Association Voices for Africa found patrons in Germany.
70 of them attending school second degree.
In 15 or 20 euros a month you can take over the sponsorship.
Guarantees the child's tuition, school uniform and one hot meal a day in a Gogo-Center.
Imbongi means in the language of the zulu "storyteller" or also "the one who extols".
Gas bantuštinou fails in this area, no one to talk to, just sing.
For nearly ten years the choir is rehearsing songs in this alien soft speech and sometimes also brings back where it originally came from: South Africa.
In the great circle distance 8 733 kilometers from Heidelberg is in the northeast of the Kingdom of Svazijského village Esitjeni, which depends on the cardinality of the votes of the German congregation.
Forty percent are infected with
About 2,000 people live there, some even in simple mud or straw huts where. A large part of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer has a parent, as the latter succumbed to HIV.
At Esitjeni is seen in miniature, the sick across Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infikovanosti, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Male circumcision of the foreskin, which reduces the risk of infection by half, the population does not accept.
More than forty percent of the people in Swaziland carries a virus weakened immunity. It is no rare thing that die in less than thirty years.
This village discovered the choir to the common journey through Africa in spring 2005. In particular, many of the children have seen Imbongi members on the streets, which lacked not only parental care, but absolutely everything: food, clothing, education.
Without complete school education in a poor country had absolutely no chance.
At first it was private individuals that deployment for a couple of euros a year to send a child to school and give him one hot meal a day.
But a year later was founded by choir "Voices for Africa", which has since old about orphans after their parents who have died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
Which are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
To bacterial SPI belong to syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea (gonorea).
Frequent viral STI, HIV, Human Papillomaviruses, herpes genitalis, or hepatitis.
Crabs and scabies include parazitárním to SLEEP.
Who belongs to the group most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea is found mainly in men who have sex with men.
Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five of all cases of syphilis to, that have been reported in Germany, are transmitted by sexual contact between men.
For heterosexual adults are sexually communicable diseases that occur often, chlamydial infection, trichomonad, candidiasis (mold), gonorrhea and Human Papillomaviruses.
HIV is between heterosexual adults in our expanded relatively little, but about 20 percent of people newly infected with HIV is accounted for by this group.
Among adolescents with chlamydial infection occur significantly more frequently than other population groups.
According to European studies, three-fourths of all infections involve young people from 15 to 25 years.
In addition, the US among adolescents frequently Human Papillomaviruses.
How developed the number of infections?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
The number of infected syfilidou, according to the Robert Koch Institute of 1697 disease in 2001 more than doubled on 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of people newly infected with HIV in 2007.
The year 2011 has been approximately 2700 cases.
It is roughly one-tenth of less than a year before.
What symptoms point to venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause sores in the genital area, difficulty in urination, vaginal discharge, pain in the lower abdomen and pustules or warts.
Often, however, do not cause any pain or other symptoms, and therefore will remain nezpozorovány.
How is it possible to protect yourself?
Risk of infection can reduce the condoms, however, do not offer 100 percent protection.
As the originators of the sexually transmitted diseases may be partially transmitted and infections from impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend, in particular, in the case of frequent alternation of sexual partners, routine examinations.
In the case of early diagnosis it is possible to cure most of the SPI and avoid later consequences.
Thanks to patronage, charitable donations, and last but not least, the honorářům choir's singing earns all across Germany, gather some money.
"In total we have sent to the Esitjeni roughly eur 200 000," says Chair Annette Lennartz.
Money from Germany managed in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, confident woman who can push through.
It also takes care to orphaned children have found shelter, for example, for some of the grandmothers.
Gogo language, zulu says old women are the mainstay of the village.
Some of them even took 14 orphans, had given them a roof over their heads and they take care of the children arrived every day in uniform in time for school.
Children who do not have anyone to go to the shelter to Khanyisile, lonely woman, paid by the Federal Government as well as two cookbooks, cooking each day for more than 200 hungry children.
"Voices for Africa", established the school of sewing, pitted two henhouses, and together with the American health organizations had DOGS that many people in the village had to do a test for HIV.
It's not a matter of course. Although the disease is apparent throughout the country, everyone is silent about it.
The King has 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has nothing to do with sexuality."
Actually pretty strange in a country where the King officially maintains 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch in Africa, black King Mswati III is known for his nemírným lifestyle.
Polygamy rather than democracy.
This state-approved way of life also, inter alia, bears the blame for this, that the HIV virus in the past decades and spread rapidly.
But many migrant workers who spread the virus.
Annette Lennartz says that condoms are free on every corner, "but no one is in use.
Culture is different-open intercourse. "
To at least somewhat supported cultural exchange, traveling choir Imbongi once every two, three years after South Africa together and singing songs full of grief, militancy, confidence in the future and self-esteem of black, which many in the southern tip of the black continent is known from the times of apartheid.
A bus full of white people, who sing the songs in the speech of blacks-such awards brings not only the mood and pleasure, but also for many tears vyloudilo wild frontier troops.
The path always leads to the Esitjeni, where the singers visit children, over which the sponsorship.
Although this village is unlikely to find on maps, in the Valley of the river Ezulweni is more than well known.
"Go to the Esitjeni, there is light," say the people there.
And when you return to Heidelberg, which is as the crow flies from here to dupajícím kilometers 8733 singers Bergheimer Straße in service on the, you can see that the light is shining here, too.
Messenger: NASA found ice on mercury
Messenger spacecraft has found evidence that the ice on the planet Mercury.
Ice cap could have a thickness of up to 20 metres.
The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
When it is closest to the Sun, there's also frozen water as a consequence of the three studies, which on Thursday published a magazine "Science".
Messenger spacecraft has found evidence that in the area of this planet, which lies in a permanent shadow, there is ice cap.
She is reported to be at least 30 inches long and maybe even up to 20 metres thick.
This water came apparently from comets or asteroids, of which to the Mercury.
Nedávejme only find ice in connection with the existence of life on this planet, said leading scientists working on the probe a Messenger, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on mercury can be up to 4 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings of the US could help clarify how to water and other basic elements of life were given to other areas of the solar system.
Probes, telescopes, and small robots as Phoenix, nepozorovaní, is involved in the exploration of the depths of the universe.

One of the largest and sharpest images Hubble Telescope: the Whirlpool Galaxy
Images of spinning galaxies according to their colouring become real works of art.
The shot, which published the European Southern Observatory, shows a few thousand light years distant in the constellation Sagittarius Trifid Nebula.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, the trigeminal), as dark lanes of dust is categorized as a glowing heart of this stellar maternity into three parts.
In the constellation of Ophiuchus astronomers have photographed a precursor to cosmic collisions: at a distance of 400 million light years from Earth, the wife of the two blended core of galaxies and must inevitably lead to conflict.

Who does not like technical shortcuts, you may call it the nickname the southern pinwheel.
Photos from the Hubble Space Telescope shows a cut-out of the Nebula in Cepheus.
This 1400 light years distant Nebula consists of dust grains that are ten times up to 100 times smaller than the normal house dust.

Our eyes in space: the most important telescopes
Telescope allegedly invented the year 1608 Hans Lipperhey. Before Galileo Galilei one year later, it was used to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirror optical telescopes grew-and views that they are getting deeper.
The largest telescope in the world has been around for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Haleův telescope on Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
Mirror in this picture had a diameter of five metres.
In the u.s. State of Arizona is the Large Binocular Telescope.
Allows you to look into the universe using two mirrors, each of which has a diameter of 8.4 m.
The Interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands-La Palma is enormous. Just mirror measured an average of 10.4 meters.
Mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to congestion costs.
Still, its diameter is about 11 metres.
The disadvantage of a cheap method of construction: the telescope is provided hákovadlem in the high angle, which limited his mobility.
In elevation angle is fixed and the Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas.
Its special feature is the high gain of the luminous flux.
This is in spite of the relatively small diameter of the mirror makes up the largest mirror five world.
Using the radio telescope at Arecibo (Puerto Rico) in the universe, scientists searching for extraterrestrial signals.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.

Look at his Observatory European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
There is a Very Large Telescope-and it does honor to its name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can prosvítit even the middle infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large telescope is planned on the Chilean Observatory ESO.
Its main mirror is supposed to have full 42 meters tall and is composed of nearly 1000 should be mirrored elements.
You can count the slides first in 2018.
Two Keck on Hawaiian Volcano Mauna Kea have been until 2007, considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.
Keck Observatory Mauna Kea are included, which, besides them looks into space and use the telescope Subaru and IRTTF.
Also on Mauna Kea has a new giant telescope-with třicetimetrovým diameter mirrors.
Here you can admire it in the picture.
The most important impressions of the universe are, however, mediated by Hubble space telescope.
Shots of distant worlds gives us from 24. April 1990.
The space telescope Kepler looks since March 2009 after extrasolar planets — especially those that are habitable.
February 2, 2011 NASA announced that since the beginning of the mission it was found 1235 candidate planets.
Pictured are documented in a final preparation before starting the space telescope Kepler.
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be the first in the year 2018 fired into space aboard rockets Ariane5.
Space-based infrared telescope's primary mirror has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for the light the first stars and galaxies after the big bang.
Scientists are based on the fact that it is led and at the South Pole of mercury.
For this, however, there are no reliable figures as Messenger circling around the planet far closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements show for several decades on the ice on mercury.
Thanks to probe Messenger, which was launched in 2004 and is the first to orbit mercury, scientists now have certainty.

Ride the Talyš we can call a wildly romantic.
The van rattled down the road with its many bends along the densely wooded hills, rivers, and prey simple rustic buildings.
Everything is green and juicy, it almost seems that we are in the black forest.
But this here is the ultimate South Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is just a few kilometres away.
Caucasian ethnic group lives here Talyšů that it is not very known, except that he speaks Persian and Azerbaijani: perfectly and with a very high age.
It is the terminus of the Lerik.
This town boasts too monumental architecture of Soviet times, the picturesque mountain landscape somewhat inconvenient.
Tourists from Europe here. Arrival from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku is too difficult.
The 323 kilometers it takes eight hours, because the road is only jednoproudová.
Fabulous wealth for which the country owes much to diesel in the Caspian Sea, to the country still had not arrived.
Pilatus Fatullayev (48), however, is convinced that it has the Lerik, to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku in may famous Eurovision Grand Prix-and we're going to next year's festival will be the oldest people in the world," says Fatullayev.
She is the Director of the Museum of longevity, probably one in the world.
There is a documented life nearly eight dozen Talyšů in the vicinity, who are older than 100 years. Fatullayev shows black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
In the age of 136 years even fathered a child.
The star of this museum is, however, herdsman Şirali Müslümov sheep, which allegedly was 168 years.
Birth certificate, however, does not exist.
And due to the fact that the oldest person with the documents was 122 years, it seems Müslümovův age extremely dubious.
"This area was born in 1805 and died in 1973," he says Fatullayev.
This man was allegedly married three times and had 22 children. In the age of 136 apparently even fathered a daughter.
So Şirali I Müslümov at his age for a couple of decades?
The ancient people of Central Asia, however, heard and Rembrandt Scholz gerontolog Max Planck Institute in Rostock.
"Obviously many people old age living in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia lives extremely a lot of very old men."
However, due to a lack of supporting documents cannot be lodged no scientific evidence of the age, especially when in the absence of the Registrar.
Every day, the glass melted butter
But the fact is that people tend to live in the area around Leriku the biblical age of strikingly often.
Currently, there are 20 persons who are more than 100 years.
Why, then, has been living here in the South so much of ancient people?
Azerbaijani guide that explains the special Mugimzadeh Farid genes Talyšů.
Director of the Fatuljeva Museum, by contrast, believes that it is in nutrition.
However, that calorie diet Talyšů who love meat, bread and dairy products, and many of whom a day drink a glass of melted butter is so healthy, from the bromatologického perspective is plausible.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiranu, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzajeva lives.
In the 97 years at this latitude is still relatively young.
Mirzajeva, which says that it has 143 descendants, living in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the entire Caucasian region.
Sitting on the ground with máselnicí, which relentlessly kolíbá.
Under one roof there are eight people, among other things, one of the sons of Mirzajevy, and his daughter. They are both long overdue grandparents.
Jump around and two young children.
For the guests in the kitchen preparing tea, which is served in a typical břichatých jars "he".
White teeth Mirzajevy make up the perfect series, and under a scarf hiding long dark blond pigtails, we proudly reveals to her son.
I always wash the hair milk, so I looked and regain color.
"I also never used shampoo," says Mirzajeva.
Monthly pension to live simply
Always ate only what came from its own Court, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
For all my life I never once did not buy food at the supermarket.
Then he tells the story of a man who was in the army.
The worst of it was during World War II.
But everything has improved when the oar took over the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev.
Propaganda is from the mouths of old women.
However, the cult that is done around the figures of a father, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows no bounds.
He was in power until 2003, then took over the oar from his son Ilham.
Old people do not suffer, at least in Azerbaijan.
Mirzajeva receives a monthly pension of 230 manatů (about the same amount in euros). It is the sum of the ratios which can be well to make ends meet.
And maybe he's right and long grizzled son of Mirzajevy: "Old people enjoyed great esteem in our culture."
They live in the middle of a large family, are loved, opečováváni and are happy.
If that's not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of "human rights" in the Constitution is missing
The revolution came back to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo revealed a deep division in the country.

The Egyptian President has spared no pathos.
We need to make the transition.
"And for that we can, I'm responsible, before the people and before God," said on State television.
His speech was addressed to the entire nation, but above all Christian Koptům, Liberal, enlightened Muslims, and secular parties.
They all, yet hopelessly confused in rozhádaní opposition, namely fear.

The judiciary should be shorn of power?
234 sections, which stohlavé a constituent Assembly with a predominance of Islamists hastily approved in the patnáctihodinovém the night marathon, partially raise concern.
As in previous constitutions, it is said in the proposal, that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what is meant by "policy"?
It was and is a matter of interpretation and to worry that the Islamists this vague wording and the related legal free space to be used for a stricter interpretation of the Sharia.
At the very least it is lit by a newly added section: in all matters relating to Sharia, it is necessary to consult with the University of al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institutions in the country with great influence on the whole Sunni Islam.
It may not, but may mean that klérus will perform oversight of the legislation, which would have resulted in a de facto deprivation of Justice, MOM.
In the draft Constitution is many things to the interpretation of
The problem also is that it has to be continued civil jurisdiction of the military courts.
These courts were used for Mubarakovy the Government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship was in military custody to 11 000 civilians.
Standing in the design State should also protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family and support her morals and values".
It is a legally phrased so accurately, that you should use this section to State institutions, even to check the contents of the film art and literature.
In an intelligible speech that does not mean nothing more than censorship.
Indeed, no section in writing does not define an explicit equality of men and women.
But another section forbids vilify or defame the Prophet Muhammad and his envoy.
However, it remains unclear what is defamation and how it will be prosecuted.
The same wording that is ambiguously is prohibited "insulting people".
Just in this case, the President or the cartoon joke already on behalf of rights experts?
A matter of interpretation, as many others in this proposal, which shall be submitted for signature and Morsi, in his own words will be "very soon" to present to the Egyptians to the popular vote.
"Revolution regained"
For several weeks the opposition is forming against the outnumbered the Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people in unusual unity gathered Friday night at the Tahrir square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the constitutional instrument before the beginning.
"The revolution has come back and we will be victorious," said Hamdín Sabbáhí, who was in the presidential election placed third.
Nobel Laureate and former Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei has stated that the draft Constitution include "to the dustbin of history".
Through the short message service Twitter followers accused Morsi 's, that they want to carry out "a coup against democracy."
"If you announce a referendum, we'll go to his palace and can overthrow him," said opposition Member Yasser Said.
"We are not tired, the blood of our brethren is not penalized," she quoted the Egyptian media of opposition politics Khaled Ali.
Several judges reported that they don't want to supervise the referendum, which would become null and void.
"The Quran is our Constitution"
Well organized Muslim Brotherhood announced vzdorodemonstraci, but not in Tahrir square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile from Cairo University.
She took part in the many veiled women and supporters of the Salafis ' who called: "People requires the application of the law of God."
Morsi: "clean up your act called on the Earth!" and assured "the Quran is our Constitution."
The fight for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir square, where it all started, would probably be raised the status similar to the civil war.
It quite obviously did not want followers Morsi's risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood claimed that opponents and supporters of the draft Constitution, loud and clearly expressed.
Now it's time to let the people at the ballot box to decide in which direction the country should go.
For some is considered to be most in favour of the Islamists.
"The word ' human rights ' does not occur even once"
Forced constitutional controversy, which should actually continue until February and integrate all the social forces, Hafez Abu Sa ' ročiluje du.
Osmačtyřicetiletý human rights defender and President of the Egyptian Organization for human rights (EOHR) defended by members of the Muslim Brotherhood, while Mubarak in jail or stood before the Court.
Not because they shared their ideology, but because, for him, are human rights indivisible.
He was beaten up, sentenced and imprisoned.
"And in the new Constitution now are the words ' human rights ' even once," she complains in an interview with "Welt am Sonntag".
Morsi's expansion of power on all three power components in the State forced the lawyer to resign.
These measures are scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of to the President of the civil society, in fact, it set aside, '' Sa ' da.
However, civil society organisations can democracy work.
Sa ' da feels abandoned, as well as the international community that follows the match of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
He could come back to haunt.
Demonstrator in Tahrir square warns: "you've Created a monster that already you can't control."
Norwegian rakfisk: Most smelly fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway is enjoying one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also in the world.
It might be the secret to success of the country associated with the local appetite for an extremely smelly fish?
Take a few overripe cheese.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet soccer equipment.
Leave it for a week.
So, smell the smell of a paralyzing rakfisku, one of the largest Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There are wonderful views of the snow-hangs in the air and the ubiquitous smell.
Rakfisk is a salted fermented trout in the water for up to one year, depending on how much you want the fish smell.
As it gets dark, and starting to get cold, the Norwegians here in Fagernes dating to the festival dedicated to this, how best to say it, nejpodmanivějšímu.
"You eat it raw, and then it zapijete a aquavitu," says Havard Halvarsen, local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "General" Rakfisk, which is responsible for the progress of the Festival.
All around us people eat small fish cubes and is washed down with plenty of alcohol.
"Some people would rather have than aquavit rakfisk," says Havard.
Beverage can smell Squish.
I'll try a few pieces.
If fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad-it is similar to a piece of sushi that has been on a long journey by bus.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different era, when it was in Norway, poverty, and yet because there were no fridges, fish in the fall of the hides into airtight barrels with water and salt.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, Shanthi and ate-senses are dulled by alcohol.
In front of just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their land and seek work, with the majority emigrated to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly – more than 13% are immigrants přilákaní large amounts of work, high earnings and an extensive system of care.
The inhabitants of Sweden, an old rival, which not long ago was much richer than Norway, flows into the country for work.
The rakfisk is seen as something important, indispensable, even if quite smelly part of Norwegian history.
Among the more expensive dishes on the market.
Although expensive, it is everything-a small glass of beer or sandwich you come out at 9 pounds (14 dollars) apiece.
Norway is the world's messages often lack-and it seems that most people that way.
The name Anders Breivik, a right-wing racist extremists, who last year shot a 77 men, women and children, people here still refer to begrudgingly.
Instead, the event is called the "shooting of the 22. July ".
The Norwegians can hardly believe in their peaceful country was one of them capable of such brutality and murder.
For the current wealth of Norway is the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries from the early 1970 's. years of the 20th century.
"But oil is not the only reason, why are we doing so well," says when you place your plates with uleželým rakfiskem our waitress Anna, who with his long blond hair and startlingly blue eyes represents the epitome of nordického wealth.
We are, as you say, that sensible people.
Her English, as well as most of the English people, it is absolutely perfect.
Don't ... grandstand, we don't like pomp.
Norway is treated with its gingerly oil wealth-in addition to a small percentage of it is most of the money from the industry invested in a special fund for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading up to the global financial meltdown threw the money they didn't have, the Norwegians had its purse strings firmly tightened.
"As long as we can go skiing in the winter and in the summer to go on trips, we're happy," says Anna.
"And eat the rakfisk," he adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for something to eat-rakfisku I've had enough.
A Moose burger is definitely something different and is beautifully juicy.
But in the evening it is stinking fish again.
Hotel where I live, is one of many places where the rakfisk for dinner is served and where guests choose the best, or rather for the sense of smell the most fish.
They have a connection with a live television transmission, in which the moderator with a bow tie, surrounded by a plate with the rakfiskem.
It's like singing contest Eurovision.
"What kind of score you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergene?"
"Here's our scoring, Håvard."
So, too, a round of applause and laughter.
Man falls from his chair, maybe quite aquavitem.
Or maybe the fumes of all those fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a difficult start
As the incoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto preparing for taking office, the visor Will Grant from the BBC to the challenges they face, and to the mixed expectations of their fellow citizens.
Transport in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In a city that is clogged even in the best of times, were erected steel barriers closing a number of key routes into the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
The goal, however, did not prevent commuting to get to work, but to prevent protesters from gaining access to the Parliament.
On Saturday the new President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto has received the presidential sash and takes over the leadership of the nation.
Facing a challenging task.
Mexico at the time of the outgoing Administration's Felipe Calderona performed well economically, however, the country is in the clutches of drug war, which has an estimated 60,000 victims took the lives of six years.
"My Government has a strong commitment to the Mexican people in the reduction in violence," said the President of Pena Nieto, u.s. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that objective.
Before he shook hands with the u.s. President, received the President of Pena Nieta political experience as Governor of his home State in Mexico.
Opinions on a new leader are different even in his old home, lidnatém and vast state surrounding the capital.
Straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo for him remember for good.
Citizens attach to the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
Now the city can be reached by one of the new motorways, which let Pena Nieto build up. These highways are a huge improvement compared to a leaky, and the uneven roads, which were previously.
Plate with his name also hangs on the wall of a modern sports centre and the impressive interactive museum with the theme of climate change.
"We expect it will bring real and lasting change," says a friend and political ally of Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, State Deputy for the party of President Pena Nieta, institutionalized Revolution Party (PRI).
In particular, we hope in an interesting and real changes in the field of security and the economy, that our country so desperately needs.
After uninterrupted 81 years in power has been the PRI'S party pushed out Vicentem Fox.
Member of the Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace, Los Pinos, within the party from Enrique Pena Nieta many expected.
And refusing to express opposition to characterize the new President as a person without any substantial content.
It's a very straightforward person, very impressed with the excellent vision of the country.
Is a great statesman and a man who knows how to listen.
But on the other side of the State, this is not the impression that has of her former Governor many people.
In the Nezahualcoyotlu, also known as Ciudad Neza, cannot be the contrast with its cobbled streets Valle del Bravo more apparent.
Tucked under motorway flyovers in many ways reminiscent of the suburbs of the capital city of Mexico.
And problems in the autonomous region are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, the army has been called in to help in managing drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, particularly poignant is violence against women.
Just in the last two years have been on the desolate places next to the vast waste land pohozeny bodies of dozens of murdered women.
At the time, Pena Nieto was Governor, in the State of Mexico murdered more than 1,000 women, which is much higher than in the notoriously violent city Ciudad Juarez-a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
In the best case, critics say that Nieta Pena in his tenure in Office failed to adequately addressing the problem of murders of women.
And in the worst case, his leadership is accused of escapism.
In the concrete House, typical for a dilapidated neighborhood, me Irinea Buendia shows photos of his deceased daughter Mariana Moon and suppressing tears.
According to the official version, she committed suicide in 2010, Marian.
However, her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, so it looked as though her body being washed, '' recalls Mrs. Buendia.
There were signs after the strikes began, and rigor mortis.
As her mother tells the story of the visor down, Mariana from the picture on the wall, next to a cross, on which there is a single word: "justice".
However, this is, as he says family, exactly what they have been denied.
The State authorities appear to me as if I was an old gossip, potížistka and kňouralka.
They want you to just accept what they say, and they were silent.
"But it cannot be right, when there has been so many errors and omissions," he says.
Sasha, the President of Pena Nieto on Saturday will receive, is accompanied by a great deal of responsibility.
In the last six years, tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico and the new President has promised that for the duration of his time in Office will be its priority.
"I hope it will be the same by the President, as Governor," he says in the Valle del Bravo member of the PRI'S Olvera.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fears most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of mistreatment, according to military prosecutor
Military Prosecutor trying to rebut claims made by Bradley Manning regarding abuse in custody.
Hearing focuses on Manningův stay in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The Defense wants the case to be dismissed on the basis of gross treatment with Manningem in prison.
A soldier is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
A military prosecutor is trying to demonstrate that private Bradley Manning, who is accused of leaking secret material, the largest in u.s. history, missed many opportunities to complain about the abuse, which allegedly suffered in military custody.
Military Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein cross-examination private Manning during preliminary hearings in Ft. Maede in Maryland claimed that records of weekly visits that Manning had with officers of the units in the nine months detention in Quantico, Virginia, do not show any complaint for bad treatment.
Cross-examination, which occurred during the hearing conducted on the proposal to reject the defence case opened against Manningovi due to the abuse at the time of binding, which in itself is sufficient punishment, took place a day after Manning testified that he thought about suicide in custody.
An army intelligence analyst, was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never has not confirmed that Manning was the source of its information.
At Friday's hearing, has undergone a military prosecutor Fein together with Manningem forms that officers fill out after meeting with Manningem in the remand prison at Quantico, where he was from July 2010 to April 2011 held in scheme with increased security.
The officers of the Manningovi questions and the valuation of his answers.
When Fein on Friday on these forms asked Manning conceded that treatment by their guards was assessed as "excellent" and the overall treatment in facilities rated as "very professional".
Forms do not show any complaints of ill-treatment, even if the officers Manning was asked directly on it, how it is treated, Fein said.
Manning said that the concerns relating to the various issues expressed by word of mouth and that officers who visited with him and talked about these concerns have indicated that they will deal with these problems, however, have not seen.
"Write" no problems "(after discuss fears), and it might not necessarily mean that I didn't mention about them," said Manning.
Judge Col. Denise Lind, Manning also asked why her party complained in January 2011 during a meeting with the Commission reviewing the suicidal thoughts that a few months earlier, expressed in the form.
Manning said that in the course of this meeting, it was his intention to achieve reduction mode on "prevention of injury".
The army said that for him, this restrictive mode (one level below the supervisory regime due to suicide) used for the protection and security of others.
"I wanted to keep the peacekeepers in custody they knew I was all right and that I wanted to cancel this mode to prevent injuries ... so I could enjoy enhanced quality of life, as I saw it," said Manning.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transported to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before it was transported to the prison on the Marine Corps Base at Quantico, Virginia in July 2010.
He said that Kuwait was considering suicide and once there he fainted due to heat.
Stated that he was not allowed to know what it is and what's going on in the rest of the world, it was very daunting.
"My world is whittled down to the base of Arifdžán, only on the cage," Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in the cage.
Manning said that upon arrival to Quantico, he spent most days (at least 21 hours, but often longer than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said that he was only allowed one mattress, blanket, nazouváky, some clothes and glasses.
He said he had tried to walk, because sleeping or just lying in the course of the day was against regulations.
Manning stated that he always slept with a light on the outside of the cell.
Stated that if the guards could not see his face when he turned in the night on the other side of him, and had to turn back.
Manningův legal counsel filed a formal complaint to the treatment of Manningem of the soldiers in January 2011.
Manning was in April 2011, transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, judge Manning also questioned on allegations made by in Thursday's testimony, relating to the fact that after he was forced to sleep one night in his cell at the Quantico naked, was also forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates in early counting.
Manning testified that when counting was not allowed to conceal their blanket.
During Friday's questioning, carried out by judge Manning said that, by order of their guardians decided that my blanket, which could to cover up, to defer, but admitted that his order to postpone the no one has gone before.
On Thursday, Manning testified that was last night forced to sleep naked, because the officer had tried to show that he is not dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use the belt from his underwear or his nazouváky to get hurt, but he didn't do it.
Manning testified that the night was removed from his cell to his underwear, his nazouváky and glasses.
His lawyer hopes that the judge will take into account its experience in the course of his imprisonment and in the case of his conviction before a military court, which is expected to start early next year, will significantly reduce his sentence.
The defense said it plans to have Manning admits to blame in lower crime and fight against other charges, because they are too extreme.
The beginning of the hearing is scheduled for this week, it is expected that the military prosecutor will defend the remand conditions as warranted.
The Pentagon statement said that Manning was being held in accordance with the provisions relating to all those arrested held in custody for a maximum security prison.
Among the charges against Manningovi include aiding the enemy, causing illegal disclosure of intelligence documents on the Internet, transmission of information relating to national security and theft of public property or records.
If convicted on all counts, could be sentenced to life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of a lack of options, of which there are.
Mexicans tend to blame those who are gone; remind them to tough times, he says.
Navarrette says that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds.
During the last trip to the capital city of Mexico, I hardly made his way through the crowd and I got into the agenda of immigrants, where I encountered a problem.
Arrows pointing to one of the two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and one for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and all my life I was called "Mexican".
It is ethnic stands, the same as when my friends in Boston called "Irish" and my friends in New York themselves referred to as "Italians".
So later I ended up in the designation "Mexican American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need to use shortcuts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
However, I do not have the vocabulary of a native speaker and I don't know how to get rid of an American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and stood in a queue for "Extranjeros".
I was thinking about the moment when this week the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has visited President Obama in the White House.
The program had the usual issues that are discussed when the leaders of the two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons is the same probability that the Mexicans would remain in Mexico, such as the national visa holders; to the United States.
He wants to join with the United States and Canada to create a North American trading block similar to the European Union.
And Pena Nieto has promised that he will continue in the Mexican war against drug cartels, although they did not give any details.
For Mexico's relationship with the United States, complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leader, under the threat of weapons to override the half of Mexican territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans who are thinking in the range of hundreds of years, not minutes, comments are ubiquitous.
So one minute after the representative of the United States says something just a little critical of Mexico, you'll hear in the press and among the elite of complaints about how the Americans interfere with the sovereignty of its neighbor.
And kids Montezumy stepping out on a war path.
And yet it is a true challenge for Mexico's relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about the hostile feelings?
A lot of them.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, the people of the country offers opportunities, and others which do not.
The only reason why so many people with Mexican roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that in any point of our family tree was the person, maybe a parent or grandparent who has been denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And more often than it would seem this person fit the profile-dark skinned, poor education, origin from the poor village, and so on.
We are their descendants, and we're loyal to them.
Not against Mexico.
And even though now we are living the American dream, we go to good schools, and we've got a good job, we can never forget the fact that we are living the American dream, not Mexican.
Our identity can sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It is on the United States.
And in addition, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class, not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
He sees us as a reminder of the humiliating defeat and should regard us as an inferior race, that is not enough Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.
Our existence is in their opinion only.
If our families in Mexico fail, so they never left.
And we are now trapped in nenalézali silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but i still lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and in childhood legally arrived in the United States, reminds me that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, there is a tension, because more Mexicans understand who they are, and Mexican Americans resents it.
Even if he is a citizen of the United States sees itself as part of the two countries.
And at the same time many Mexican Americans, that I know of, does not feel as part of either.
We love listening to Mexican groups Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteena.
You will get the best of both countries, but you have no roots in one.
In Mexico on us as Americans.
And in the United States are considered to be Mexicans.
And to make it even more complicated relationships, they want some Mexican leaders and part of intelligence, as I learned during his trip, reconnect with the diaspora by bridging.
They want to keep Mexican Americans worked for Mexico as a "makeshift ambassadors" and represented Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American fellow citizens, how great is this country to visit, and push on the political leaders to solidify relations with Mexico.
Well.
So it won't happen again.
Too many hostile feelings.
And thanks to income inequality and prevalent corruption and drug abuse, many of us are not certain, it's a great country.
I have a feeling that it's up to you, amigos.
This is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States as it did with Mexico in front of one and a half century ago, so must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel indignation for the manner in which it was treated with their family members in a substantially closer to the past.
Hmmm.
Maybe we are more "Mexicans", than I thought.
The old battle, new Middle East
Their fire between Israel and Hamas would still be uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that every such problem is in vain.
Among the usual useless conjecture about who started it, there were many buildings changed in rubble, killed more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time rockets from Gaza near Tel Aviv, the Israeli capital, and in the Holy City of Jerusalem.
But even if it seems that the Israelis and Palestinians are stuck in their ancient conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.
The Arab spring changed the old ways, and Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are engaged in the ensuing chaos in the region.
Maybe this causes their struggle will be even bloodier than ever before.
However, there are reasons to think that it may suspend their deadly stalemate.
The war, which is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, it appears that currently there are not many reasons for optimism.
Even if the cease-fire concluded 21. last November, the fighting this week have strengthened hawks on both sides.
Leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that governs the Gaza Strip since 2007, will argue that forced the Israelis to retreat, even if Gaza has suffered defeat.
Despite killing several leaders of Hamas and the conclusion of the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip in one of the most pitiful and the most populous parts of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently controlled by his bitter rivals from Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders may very well lead to the conclusion that time is on their side.
Islamists throughout the Arab world gained greater influence, so Hamas has gained powerful and wealthy friends.
Znovuvzkříšená Turkey, a regional power that was once Israel's closest Muslim ally, joined to the side of Hamas. Similarly, Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
Cheering the people of Hamas say the Islamic Crescent encircling around Israel from Lebanon in the North, where the party/militia Hezbollah, via Syria, where the rebels, who are increasingly inclined to islamizmu, can unseat Bashar Al-Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas's allies are a threat to the King.
And, above all, on the southern flank of Israel changed the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, led by President Mohammed Morsi, Egypt, by far the most populous and crucial Arab country, the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, not Hamas.
In contrast, the brotherhood is the cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more influenced public opinion.
In a future diplomacy can Hamas emerge as a player who cannot be expelled either Israel or America.
In contrast, Israeli hardliners to run out to the opposite conclusions.
In military terminology, Hamas was stored back into the crate.
Israel's iron dome missile defense system could have a price and a lot of rockets Hamas has been destroyed.
The Israelis can sleep better-for a while.
In diplomatic terms, America is as unflinching as always. Many European countries also vinilo Hamas of starting the latest round of violence.
And Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, that the peace process is mostly ignored.
Although the rockets from Gaza since 2004, killed about 30 Israelis, was relatively quiet in Israel from suicide bombings, bombers, in part thanks to the wall that intrudes into the West Bank, the main part of what one might be a Palestinian State, and protects the Jewish settlements, which are still growing despite its illegality before international law.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose Likud party is at the beginning of the campaign in the election held on December 22. January teamed up with an even more radical group led by Lieberman 's, is in a good position.
Why spoil the treacherous Palestinians by allowing them to have their own State?
If you would really ruled the West Bank, the neodpalovali missiles, as they did their compatriots in Gaza?
It would be better if we hold that wall and sock 'em is when the rear of the head.
Hardliners might win, but the Arab spring can make their calculations change.
Even though the Islamists who are gaining power in Egypt and other countries, do not have Israel too in love, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel's defense spending is higher than the expenditure of all his four Arab neighbors together.
Launch of a new war with the local superpower hardly will help new Arab Governments to recover its economy.
The fact that President Morsi collaborated with President Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire, is a good sign and could mean the beginning of something new.
Also, the Israelis would look at a given situation should look at in the long term.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world becomes more democratic, creating a denial of the rights of Palestinians to self-determination sud powder keg, which must one day erupt in areas occupied by Israel — as well as a bus that exploded last week in Tel Aviv.
Currently repression undermine democracy in the Jewish State and the situation is exacerbated by demographics, how Arab population grows.
Bloody attacks against Gaza is held every few years for the purpose of pushing Hamas will increasingly choose diplomatic toll.
Both parties need to incentives from the outside.
The answer is what they preach reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two States, when Israel shall be forwarded to the territory because of safety concerns.
In the short term, there is little hope of stopping the fire from outside pressures will provide at least a little more leverage to promote this stuff.
Egypt, which along with Turkey and Qatar must to stop the supply of arms to Gaza, in a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish State based on the 1967 borders with replacement of parts of the country, and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs also needs to push from the outside to match between Hamas and Fatah.
It would be for the creation of a Palestinian State has done more than the immediate offer of virtual State sovereignty at the UN.
President Obama also has its part on how to get Israel to the negotiating table.
In his first parliamentary term, neglected to show his own peace plan.
Now, back at the White House, seems to be just as reluctant in its entry into the process.
It is woefully short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the entry into force of the laws on nasty cigarette packaging
The unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, are a warning for smokers and the sick part of the body.
Into force joined Australian laws on tobacco and cigarette packaging of ugly, the first of its kind in the world, and the logo and colors of the markers to be replaced by General olive green stocked with packages of ugly pictures of sick with body parts and babies and newborns sick as a result of their parents ' smoking.
In addition to the various health warning messages, and pictures are compulsory since Saturday, the only difference between brand names stocked with packages that are printed in the same small print.
This is the strictest regime in the world relating to tobacco packaging.
The Australian Federal Government claims that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking by his attraction to get rid of this bad habit.
It relies on studies that show that if people don't start smoking by the age of 26, is a 99% chance that they begin to smoke.
"Even in very young children, you can see, that means the message that tobacco companies trying to sell, along with his product," says Tanya Plibersek, the Federal Minister of health, citing studies that, for example, have shown that children associate the Crown in the logo with the idea to be a Princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering the introduction of similar steps.
The tobacco industry against the imposition of these laws lobbied hard.
The tobacco companies argued that this law will increase the trading on the black market, which in turn will lead to cheaper and more accessible.
"Thanks to this legislation, there are serious unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of the company British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters in China and Indonesia they bring much more of these products, which will be sold to Australian streets.
Another claim, that the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said demand for cigarette packaging of Silicon that is used to cover the sick boxes, two months ago, when the company British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost its appeal relating to the laws of the Australian Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales.
Ha said that the company sold Zico nearly 6 000 pieces of wholesale dealers and expects new supplies.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible hitch, experts say the popularity of social media for the demographic group that the focus of the plan.
The wide range of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsorship of sporting events and requesting that most vendors held a cigarette in front of the direct-view, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned Internet advertising undertaken by the local companies and websites, but it cannot restrict foreign sites.
"If you are a marketing specialist in tobacco industry and you have only a small space for promoting your products, is for you an online space unmatched place in which you want to be," says Becky Freeman, researcher in the field of public health at the University of Sydney.
Ms. Freeman has seen an increase in guest brands on social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, carried out the "average Honza".
We have to ask, it's just a private citizen who really loves cigarettes Marlboro and took the job and created this video, or there is involved a marketing company?
British American Tobacco Australia contends that the industry has focused on how it would deal with the new rules, than on marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for attacking the new regulations-countries in the framework of the world trade organization claiming that the trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries has not dealt with Australia.
The judgment is expected to be SOO in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says that the Government has held talks with other Governments that are considering similar laws relating to packaging.
Canada was the first country which in 2001 introduced a mandatory warning photos.
Now have spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia defies.
Images have no effect on me.
Just ignore.
"I'm just pulling a cigarette box and stick it back," says Victor El Hage when buying a box with pictures of a tumor in his mouth.
Frankly, there's only one reason for me to quit smoking, and this is my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns a newsagent's King of the Pack in the heart of Sydney, says that thanks to the single packs of is harder to align the shelves.
"Being unloaded it took me one hour, now it takes me four hours," said Yu.
"The Government would simply be completely disable, then we said to ourselves, ' OK, this is the end, close the shop '," he said, and threw up his hands.
In the world of constant connection is not so bad to be bored
Last Thanksgiving I've unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport, when our plane had mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for the arrival of the next aircraft.
So we had a lot of time thinking about the boredom.
I'm not going to lie to you.
Wait for half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, in spite of the distractions, magazines and books iPhone (not to mention the duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts on children's development of increasingly come with praise nudění.
They say that for us (and our children) is a good idea to occasionally get bored.
It makes the brain go into interesting directions, which can encourage creativity.
And whereas most of us nowadays is constantly connected to the screen, we have a chance to enjoy the boredom.
We should therefore support the boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll be back to do so.
First of all, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon, which occurred with the advent of more free time.
But he says Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek and Roman history at the Canadian University of Calgary, who is the author of Boredom: A Lively History (history of boredom) (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, has a long history of boredom," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii Latin inscription was found on the boredom, dating from the first century AD.
And then there is also the question of how we define boredom.
The trouble is, that was defined and discussed a variety of ways, said John d. Eastwood, Professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After seeing the research literature and presentation ideas to an audience of about 100 people Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy, but I wasn't capable of doing this".
Boring apathy from them by a person not into anything plugged in, but she wanted to be.
He says that there is no urge to do something about apathy.
He says that at the heart of boredom is a "distortion of the process, the attention in a bad mood and a sense of time passing slowly."
Boredom can remind a lot of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship to each other, they have bored people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed, challenge yourself in the sees themselves.
Sometimes we think that kids will grow, if we only have difficulty concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed out in an earlier experiment, in which participants listened to the tape, on which a person read an article from a magazine.
Some groups heard loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so quiet that it's barely noticed, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard a TV program, reported more boredom than the other two groups had difficulty concentrating, but were not sure why this problem and attributed them to boredom.
When you're trying to concentrate on a difficult or interesting task, the disruption of attention lead to boredom, said Mark j. Fenske, a Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, "as the search is bad components on the factory line, can help with that distracting music to keep you busy."
In fact, he said, now we know that twisting and doodling, which is often seen as a sign of boredom, it can really help with boredom and keep people physically fight even more jittery.
"Research shows that kids who are allowed to fidget, learn more and retain more information than those that are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
We all sometimes boredom experienced-my flight delay, the loud speaker, especially a lengthy movie.
But some individuals are more likely to be bored than others.
For help with measuring boredom scientists in the 1980s. years of the last century have developed "a scale for susceptibility to nudění" (Boredom Proneness Scale).
The scale includes questions such as: "a lot of things that I need to do, is repeated and is monotone," and "I have so many interests that I do not have time to do them all."
Using these scales, researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a Professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, in particular, with regard to the need to have more and different external stimulation.
However, in General, teenagers are indifferent.
In 1991, Reed Larson, Professor for human and social development at the University of Illinois, performed an experiment in which seven or eight times a day has contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents.
He found that 32 percent of teens reported that they were bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent reported that they were bored, when they weren't in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents reported that they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentage of boredom now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said he knows that '' adolescence is a peak time for boredom ", which is to a large extent due to the fact that children and young people are not given a lot of control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: "Is boring for you good?".
As research shows, sometimes not, because, in its extreme form can lead people to undergo absurd physical risk, gambling played the abusive or addictive substances as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discuss the link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the issue for more than two decades.
"Boredom is a way for the brain, how to inform you, that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a Professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain does not always the best thing you should do.
If you're bored and you use this energy to playing guitar and cooking, you will be happy to do it.
However, if you watch TV you happy just for a moment, not in the long term.
So if your child is bored, and you give him an iPad, I get bored, but learn how to entertain itself or as a single drive, Professor Fenske said.
And "this separate control is transferred from one situation to another," said the professor.
Your child will learn only how to amuse itself, but gets greater self-discipline in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate the boredom.
But we wouldn't even against it should not be too critical.
Our aim should rather be to feel comfortable when we are away from the incessant rattle of activities and technology.
Professor Eastwood said.
"Prosecuting it from the need to bore you with more, but boredom is painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.
What people are actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy the leisure time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly přestimulovaní," he said, "it's hard to find ways to entertain myself, when the noise shuts down."
In Colorado there is no Handbook on the new law on marijuana
19 year old Anthony Orozco, a student at the higher technical school and football player from southeastern Colorado, faces charges of criminal offences for something that will soon be in its State-legal for possession of a few grams of marijuana and a pipe, which was used on her smoking.
Mr. Orozco said that one September day he went with a few friends in Lamaru, on the plains near the border with Kansas, when he was stopped.
After a police officer found marijuana in the car, it was Mr. Orozco issued a summons for possession of drugs and paraphernalia for drug use-minor offences for which is a fine of $ 100 for each-and he was made for the court date.
"They come to us as criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But it is a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks after the coloradském vote on the legalization of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use depends on the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases on the spot rather than on the law.
Hundreds of cases of offences for possession of marijuana has already been here and in Washington State, which has approved similar measures.
The Police Department stopped blaming adults aged 21 years and older for possession of a small quantity to be legally permissible after the law in the coming weeks will come into force.
But prosecutors in more conservative districts of Colorado have said they will continue with existing cases relating to marijuana, and still blaming people for possession.
At the same time several cities from the suburbs of Denver toward the Western mountains to prevent votes on the opening of new, state-licensed shops with marijuana in their communities.
"This issue is evolving so quickly that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel j. Oates, police chief in the town of Aurora, East of Denver.
Gossip's head as well as regulators in the State of Washington.
Looking for instructions on how to set up a licensing system for the cultivation, manufacture, distribution and sale-everything in term 1. December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether good or bad, is ahead of most States in the regulation of marijuana, first for medical use and now even pleasure.
"Colorado has a regulovanější market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian e. Smith, a spokeswoman for the Council for licensing the sale of alcohol in the State of Washington.
But as Mr Smith said, no space or the system could not do more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent by which we can control," he said.
The Washington law. I-502, shall enter into force 6. December, which also leaves the annual vacuum during which still does not exist a State licensing system, but legal possession.
And there is an important mechanical questions that must be resolved during this period, such as how to balance the State's directive concerning "appropriate access" to the licensed marijuana with its ban on the trade in cannabis up to 330 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centres.
"There will not be more difficult to place the licensed trade in hemp than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan areas of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a spokeswoman for the Center for legal hemp, the recently established research groups.
on November 21, he sent police chief Oates from the city of Aurora to its officers email in which they announced that the city prosecutor will no longer prosecute misdemeanors for possession of a small amount of marijuana for each citizen aged 21 years and that police "with immediate effect" to stop blaming people for these crimes.
Chief Oates said that the police will enforce the city's laws regulating medical marijuana growers and that will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In the District of Weld in Northern Colorado District Attorney Ken Buck is a stricter view.
After the vote, said that his Office will continue to prosecute cases of possession of marijuana, mostly as a way to push users to seek treatment.
Currently faces charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana 119 people, though many of them face additional charges.
"Our Office is obliged to prosecute criminal wrongdoing, which were criminal offences at the time they occurred," said Mr Buck, in a statement.
The reaction was complicated in places like rural district of Mesa, where voters rejected a joint initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, did not blame adults for possession of small amounts.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger,, this decision supports, but also decided to nezamítnout all pending possession cases.
"I don't think I'm losing my time continuing law enforcement until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of the coloradských voters supported the measure, while recreational marijuana into the arms of Government and legal system will never be simple.
And contradictory responses across the State have revealed with regard to this great State green experiment the deep ambivalence among local officials.
For district prosecutors it is "a cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents accused of possession of marijuana, and the local spokesperson for the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They spent so much of his life chasing people, that still cannot actually accept that it's legal," he said.
The first States that a small amount of marijuana stop as to alcohol, Colorado and Washington are poised to become a national test case for legalizing drugs.
Advocates and State authorities are planning a new frontier for legalised the sale and at the same time also anxiously awaiting instructions from the Federal Government, which still has a plan to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana for federal crimes.
Advocates of legalizing marijuana are hoping to the Ministry of Justice gives in.
Despite the arrest of several vendors of marijuana for medical purposes, and patients who use it to get attention, mostly left the Federal Government deals with medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington, and an additional 16 States in operation.
While the protidrogoví agents may not be the monopoly of the door, to capture a small bag with the drug, it is likely that the mine permit State controlled shops with recreational marijuana allowed new laws, said Kevin a. Sabet, a former advisor in the area of drug policy administration of President Obama.
A few coloradských towns instead of waiting for the federal authorities.
Even before election day, some local governments have approved a moratorium on any new business with marijuana, although it will take about a year before they will be able to any shop to open.
Last week the city of Montrose to the West of the State proposed a six-month ban and is likely to enter into force next week.
"We don't want to find themselves in a situation where someone we license and then we're going to have a big federal business," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We're looking at it, for what the municipality voted, contrary to what the State voted.
There's really a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to move out of Oxford, because I'm a conservative."
Their opinions are not only attacked today's University students.
I don't remember that I ever dreamed about studying at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother studied at the University, of which I think is the world's largest knowledge-based, modern Greek ovíněné Symposium encourages the two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And so far I have at the end of the 1980 's. years of the 20th century within two weeks after the onset of the Worcester College where I wanted to study history, packed my bags and I poured in the first scandal of his life.
My father broke down and wept.
My friends were confused.
Daily Evening Standard claimed that I gave up, because I had objected to the loving students in the next room.
Writer And.  N. Wilson cheerfully said that I left because I was forced to drink from a chipped mugs.
The truth was less comic.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of their somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from private schools.
I was haunted by for one reason and enlightenment in this cradle of the suspected it was how bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a Senior Advisor to Margaret Thatcher and the conservative party, I devotee.
You may be asking, why is it up to now.
Just because recent reports suggest that the new generation of students to the right from the Center suffer from similar persecution.
Institutionalised and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students sought the protection of equal rights, as gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Association of the younger vintages (JCR) at Corpus Christi College, argues that because of their political views are "often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks, and they made clear that they are not welcome."
Called for a position in the University Committee for equal opportunities, which would ensure that their views can freely communicate.
Their situation did not help nor recently referred to BBC Two television documentary called Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (faery: young, smart and right-wing) about student politics, which conservatives portrayed as Weirdos and neo-Nazis.
In the show, he was introduced to the graduate Joe Cooke, former President of the Oxford University Conservative Association (Oxford University conservative Association-OUCA) who drove a Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a cane with a silver head.
At other universities, students say that a conservative is with them due to the introduction of higher tuition fees are treated as "sacrificial lambs".
20 Luke Black, Vice President of Nottingham University Conservative Association (Nottingham University conservative Association), told the Sunday newspaper, that "left-wing influence in universities is increasing.
People believe that we as a Bullingdon Club, without having us all come together. "
Hand-built by a student of history at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says that such a climate is "annoying", while devatenáctiletá the President of OUCA Stephanie Cherill says that in JCR members access to people on the right from the center of a deterioration.
"It poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as for the welfare of the members," he says.
During his first few weeks at Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I joined in September of 1986, 18 and cripplingly shy.
Hatred toward the conservative side was nejhorečnatější.
A year earlier the University voted to refuse to grant an honorary degree to the former student Margaret Thatcher due to cuts in funding for higher education.
From the atmosphere would be even stalinisté chvěli.
During the first few days in the opening week, when new students come together with each other and with the professors, I got a taste of Wormwood, which was to come.
I discovered that not only do the professors in silence by prodding the conservative students, but with flavors and take part in it.
In the wood-panelled classroom was introduced during a mining strike policy, privatization and the Government's resistance to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa.
My first lecture concerned the translation of the French text of the 18th century. century into English and to what followed, I was not prepared.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "fold in first paragraph, please."
It was pretty tight.
Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like a cake batter, was a lot of žlučovitý.
"Thatcherovci refuse to learn French, or are you just stupid?" he asked.
Other students sniggered.
Eye to eye with tears.
"I suggest you read in his spare time took some basic lessons in French, unless you're too busy to social issues," said Professor Pitt.
Shattered, I returned to my room.
During dinner I sat alone at school, when I felt a light tap on the shoulder.
It was a second-year student named James, who introduced himself as a member of OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said gently.
Unfortunately, it is so.
Anyone who is suspicious of conservatism, is the target.
For me, it's bad enough, but know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you it will be even worse.
Most of the conservative first years, pretending to be are labouristi.
Later in the local pub I chickened out try and pretend.
I insisted that I do not agree with everything what Thatcher said.
This trick has proved unsuccessful.
First-year Student in philosophy, politics and economics, that (How ironic) attended Eton, he said: "are you the daughter of fascist pig."
You're infected.
Other students with him notovali.
I was depraved, dirty.
"How conservatives love?" asked one.
Hitting one another, right?
I felt like they had to feel homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
I could ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
I would have been forced to meet with like minded people just after dark?
I'd have to change in labouristu and suppress their natural tendencies?
Three years in front of me had been developed as a purgatory of ignoring and isolating.
The only openly conservative Professor was Norman Stone, Professor of modern history, that dwelt at my school.
He was hated for being conservative, but even that is an adviser to Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy, and one of those who write speeches.
Almost there.
He hated this place for its parochialism and pettiness, and for his tendency to Marxist-deterministickému looking at the history.
In 1997, the post of Professor at Bilkentské University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You will not be happy here," he said.
I started to commute from Oxford in the House of his parents in London, looking for refuge with its uncommitted Metropolitan of friends and family.
I told the father that the Oxford I hate and why.
Could not believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, have been accepted by all political opinions.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said affably.
They wouldn't do that, not in a dreamy mood.
Even my friends had a communist always perfect ways.
His wet eyes zasmušily.
Give it a try yet.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted from frequent trips to London with my emotional resilience.
My friend, also a supporter of the conservative party, succumbed to pressure and give up their beliefs.
The following week in the course of teaching, when another professor of history in total seriousness said, that I am "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Even though I was blushing with shame inside, I confessed to my parents "their brains" and called them "old fools".
Relief was only short-term.
Nail in the coffin of my career my father boarded up.
At that time he wrote every week two bars in the Murdochových newspaper.
My door was locked.
I was huddled up inside and after five minutes of my pursuers give up.
When they were gone, I packed a suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never went back.
You can call me usmrkaným scorn.
But none of the 18-year-girl or boy should not be at an educational institution subject to such intimidation and virulence.
Even more tragic is that it was Oxford, from which not only has 14 Conservative Prime Ministers, but also to this day, hiding behind undeserved reputation points with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino has elegance rather than the praise"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: master of fashion creation", which was launched this week in London, spoke to ABC with Naty Abascalovou, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemiszovou and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Isabel I of English, is the only place in the British capital that is worthy to host an exhibition of Valentina Garavaniho.
The designer confirmed it at the start of apologetic retrospectives "Valentino: master of fashion creation", which represents more than 130 top fashion models created his Studio for the past 50 years.
"This lock I adore," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is at the end of the story, in which the "il signore" Garavani the only protagonist, but without his cherished clients could not be written.
Valentino always felt charmed by a rare and distant world of the aristocracy.

Valentino exposing these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from the simple tailor from the city of Verona in Northern Italy on idol international ' Bohemian royalty ".
Like the Royal family, there is nothing wrong with that.
"At least they'll netípnou cigarette into the exquisite carpets, as they do some gorgeous celebrity pop music," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemiszová.
In the 1960 's. and 70. years, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino's impressive host and guests enjoy the abundantly and with elegance.
"We are all very pleased when we were invited to his chalet in Gstaad," explains the bounty hunter "Heiniho" Thyssena and close friend of forgotten beauties as Marella Agnelliová or Eugenie Niarchosová.
"Valentino had always prefer elegance than glory.
And even so, he's a star. "
Valeria Mazzová presents Valentina
On the charisma of the designer not the Argentine model Valeria Mazzová.
"It's been a lot of years, what we are after one show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome went to him for dinner.
It was us and among us were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, Jr.
In each of the odds and ends his apartment, decoration, food, music, and was depicted in all was to feel his spirit.
All invitees are thanks to him could feel important and loved, '' recalls a top model who started working with him during the week of the Paris high fashion in 1995.
"Never goes out of fashion, because its proposals are works of art," concludes.
A parade of nobility
Gravaniho life is a story of obsession, but really opětovaných ones.
He loves people with good vychováním and better titles and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been converted into a distinctive 70-metre passage, which offers an exchange of roles: the visitor becomes a model and marching passages, to watching the "audience" dreams that he's wearing Valentinova masterpieces such as dress, which she chose Jackie Kennedy at his wedding to Aristotle Onassisem, costume that she wore Monica Vittiová in "Night", or a coat made of wool and furthat belonged to the Empress Farah Dibaové.
In the audience models, names like Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxisu, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie of Austria.
Naty Abascalová and designer in 2006
Many of these clients are saying that the first Valentino is like first love, "not to forget him."
"I remember it perfectly.
They were pants, shirt, vest, "gillette" and jacket from the autumn-winter collection from the years 1971-1972.
It was a gift that he had done for me, "says Michelle Abascalová, one of the návrhářových of the muses.
"I give him in front of other priority for his femininity and a great love for women, because it underscores our beauty," added the former Duchess of Ferii.
"I really like the colors that are used by a lot of doors cheer up and give the" Sparkle "face.
The proportions are perfect. "
Even the Princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola D'Arenberg cannot forget how the first time she's Valentina.
When he grew up and lived in Italy, wanted to be of legal age and have the opportunity to get some of his evening dresses ...
In the end, had to go through the late 1990s. years.
"My first dress from Valentino I bought on the occasion of the celebration at the castle of his cousin, prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had a skirt with Ruffles, a tea towel draped bodice and strapless top.
It was a dream that became a reality, "says the widow of Rodriguovi d ' Arenberg.
"Valentino is lax to fashion, his passion is timeless," says Italian Aristocrat whose life unfolds between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg has saved návrhářovy festive dress "very carefully ... because the clothes are not just dress, it's also a set of memories that they have in each other."
The "King" of fashion
The highlight of the exhibition at Somerset House are wedding gowns Marie-Chantal Miller from her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
To create these silk dress ivory color with builtin pearls, twelve different types of lace and a long siding with four and a half metres were needed four months of work and 25 "girls" (as called by its designer seamstresses).
According to the journalist Suzy Menkesové, the greatest authority of the specialist press, represents a landmark Summit this dress fashion end 20. during the 20th century, "the return of clients from high society".
Valentino dazed over the years an elitist "savoir-être" is now its best example.
As a Cavaliere di Gran Garavani Croce (the highest honors in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L ' Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, and the award of the Legion of honour to accumulate as many awards as any spouse of his clients.
"My attention always attracted the vybranost, take it easy, groomed and perfect look," acknowledges the Princess D'Arenberg.
"The last time I saw him a month ago at the gala dinner at the Museum of Orsay.
He was at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
It was perfect, it's time to leave no trace. "
When it says Princess ...
The hardest profession in the world: medium sulphur in the Kawah Ijen volcano
In four of the euro in the medium hazardují Indonesian volcano with your life and health when the sulfur tolerable 70 pounds down the steep stone trails.
There are people for whom their work hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of 400 miners, who make their living mining Kawah Ijen volcano of sulphur in the East of the Indonesian island of Java.
Because of that, each day, to accompany him to the bottom of the crater, where sulfur gases are escaping from inside the Country and in contact with the air passes into the solid state.
After slash large blocks of sulfur, which together weigh up to 70 pounds, he is on his shoulders in two bamboo baskets after steep stone trails.
To the top of the volcano, which rises 2 386 metres, is only 250 metres away, but the spent media takes over 40 minutes to rise at the pace of a turtle's back up, because they maintain balance and thoroughly rozvažují their steps to neuklouzli and nezřítili, into the abyss.
They know that any stumble could become life as it happened to one of the French turistce, which years ago collapsed from Kawah Ijen rocks.
Kawah Ijen in miners earn five cents for each pound of sulfur, which yields
When they are at the top, he makes his way around tourists who photograph them as if they were a monkey in a circus, and tired feeling is hard to recycle bin to scale mining company ranked slightly below, at an altitude of 1850 metres.
This is the company PT Candi Ngrimbi, which in a volcano benefit since the 1960s and have never paid their workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo.
Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) petrochemickému industry, because this mineral has its place in everyday life, and is used in the manufacture of matches, Fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even in the teeth of the sugar.
"Because it is commonly worn by 70 pounds, we earn about 46 000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each journey," explained us Anto, which usually completes three missions a day.
One takes three hours and at the end is destroyed, but can you make 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Although it seems like an insignificant amount for such inhuman effort, it's three times what they would have earned on the field.
"The daily wage of miners here is very high. For example, for the collection of coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the salary for the fourteen days is two million rupees (167 euros), "says Porter, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a bricklayer.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (6.2 eur) per day, and the work was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, villages near the volcano, from a serious reason, who is in Indonesia as well as convincing sulphur: "I married a young girl from Bali, which is a Hindu, and I took it to Java, that converted to Islam."
Anto has asthma, he breathes, still coughing and irritated eyes toxic gases
In its 27 years of Anto three times a day, risking a Kawah Ijen volcano in whose sulfur him already began to take its toll, although my face is protected by a special mask and goggles.
He has asthma, he breathes, still coughing and irritated eyes toxic gases that escape from the volcano.
That's the price you must pay for it to achieve his dream.
"I will work two more years because I want to open a business or study Spanish or French," promises more than passable English.
This likable and intelligent young man, a poverty-stricken destiny could be a tourist guide, the waiter or the reception at the hotel, and instead of doing the work.
Dirty wooden shack he shares with other carriers and gets up every day at two o'clock in the morning, because sulphur at night continues to build up and its characteristic yellow color changes in blue, and September through the darkness.
Despite the surrounding darkness fárá Anto into the crater and illuminates your way a little lamp, which is attached to the helmet and he bought it for his money.
About 400 media brings out on the shoulders of the Recycle Bin with sulfur from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has a high income, the extraction of sulphur due to cost savings, or carriers of nezmechanizovala working on my own and with such effort, no equipment.
In fact, and do not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (€ 2.50) from the additional fee for photography, who along with ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) collected by guards from the natural park of tourists who come to get pictures taken in the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for the cattle, and not for the people," argues Madrusin, stout, Porter, who works at Kawah Ijen for three decades, ever since he left school.
Uzvednout can handle up to 110 pounds and assures us that the last work, "how it goes", because he needs money for the education of their three sons between the ages of 18 and 10 years ago.
I'm not going to retire, I'll die here, because the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulfur burns the throat and stings the eyes, when the wind unexpectedly turns and trapping the miners in dense vapours, which of the volcanoes, the miners are being told that none of them are complaining that they are suffering from serious diseases. .. but it is clear from their frequent respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and ran on the shoulders caused by the weight of the baskets.
Unainik, which balanced its basket on his back, get in their 53 years can load only 50 pounds.
Every day he and his colleagues get in 15 tonnes of sulphur, volcano which in turn three trucks transporting steep way between brush to the warehouse in Tamansari remote 18 miles.
"I'm not going to retire, I'll die here, because the volcano has been my whole life," says Unainik and opens her mouth wide so that missing a few teeth.
Of his five sons, the oldest, 30, also earns the mining of sulfur.
Time passes, but the constant poverty, one of the most difficult crafts in the world persists from generation to generation-craft, carrying out human mules in the Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for babies in order to save the economy
Singapurci bring it, they don't have kids, career, stress and the cost of living and education.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you're a patriot. Splňme my civic duty and zploďme a new life!
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of the advertising for menthol candy, but in spite of — or perhaps because of – the video earlier this year in Singapore en masse spread on YouTube.
These sentences are part of rapping, which uses local cues such as "put a bun in the oven" as a mockery of birth rate in Singapore.
Ad Agency BBH, which created the video, hoping this commercials they can raise the issue in a light-hearted manner.
The Agency's Art Director Douglas Hamilton said he wanted to take advantage of the influence of music to ensure that people meet "their civic duty".
"This is strictly a matter of the Internet, so it must have been fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem of this country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we had the feeling that this is a topic that we need to touch it.
We knew that the Government attempted to extend a lot of things as perfumes with pheromones or organize dating parties.
Many of these ideas may be creative, but not fully functional.
So we thought, why not make the most possible thing, such as the composition of the rap in order to resolve the issue. "
1.2 children
The one who does not take too lightly, the Singaporean Government.
US $ 1,300 annually to encourage the citizens to have more children.
The Government's package for marriage and the family provides up to $ 15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
All these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy city State with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known konzervatizmem their leaders and strict social controls.
Birth rate in Singapore with regard to the distribution of the population is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time exceeded the birth rate the value 2, which is considered to be a measure of recovery, in 1976.
Why do Singapurci have more children?
Tan Wei Mingová, Director of the marriage and the family of the National Agency for the population says that this is due to the "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"People have at their disposal a wider range of options when it comes to the objectives and priorities, it's not only wedding and family," he explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of free people and delaying marriage and the procreation of children. The result is a decrease in fertility rates in Singapore.
While in the context of immigration policy, there are efforts to drastically increase the flow of immigrants as a measure against a decline in the population, among the locals it caused resentment.
On some Singaporean website you can see open xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low wages and little desire for integration.
An increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year's ruling Singapore its worst election result since the beginning of independence.
After the election, appeared an effort to deal with the problem by using the quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in fertility rates has a known impact on national economic growth, tax revenues, spending in health care and immigration policy, in the case of Singapore, there are also some unexpected consequences.
The Government is trying to make nestavělo as many small homes.
For example, has begun to affect trade in real estate.
Bureau of urban development began to regulate the number of small dwellings known as "shoebox", that can build in certain urban zones.
These apartments have an area of 46 square metres, and had great success in sales.
However, there is concern that these flats can support the Bachelor's lifestyle, and deterring developers to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, Managing Director of real estate company EL Developers, claiming that their "shoebox" are selling far more quickly than larger houses.
"They are more popular, so that they sell for days to weeks faster than homes with larger size.
Therefore, for our cash flow much better. "
However, he admits that the new standards lay down clearer rules developers who were previously limited to when they wanted to offer too many small houses in a single project.
Too stressed out
Singapore is a city state.
Although the new rules could be directed towards improving the nation's fertility rates, interview with Singapurci working in the financial district in the Centre of the city indicates that it will not have a big effect.
"People are still under stress, the houses are expensive, as well as education, that's why a lot of people," says the young clerk.
"The others whether they are children.
But for me it is important to rely on your own time and money, "says another, about 20 years, young man.
Both men and women mentioned career, stress and the cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So let the Government trying to compel any citizens to have kids, they're just finally Singapurci, who have the final say regarding the setting-up of the family.
What is private is private and offline online
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy is about something that has a personal nature or about "the area of private life, which has every right to protect against any disturbance."
What is privacy for a man under the age of 16 years old?
How to apply this definition in their daily lives and on social networks?
Means the dangers to which it is exposed, when on the Internet exposes matters which would certainly anyone at normal communication?
Journalists from elPeriódico, convicted five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years ago, who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, consider the concept of privacy as "something completely custom" in personal terms and a "username and password", if there was a social network.
"Has the biggest secret I violating policy," says 10-year Jorge in an attempt to explain the meaning of privacy on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, which accounts for two years.
"It's a very secret secrets, my mom might not know about them, but not the whole world, '' he says.
"On FB I give nice pictures or photos, how we're playing.
There's also talking with acquaintances.
I didn't take a photo, that would not be my, or photo that someone would be embarrassed, "he says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, nude photos, or photos of the crimes, or write demeaning or rude comments.
Jorge says, that he knew all 35 friends, which has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
Among them is the mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
"I set up an account on Twitter to express their views and write interesting posts.
I don't know if someone responds, I just, I, "added.
"Social networks are fun, may I speak with relatives, who are far away or to quickly communicate with friends," she says.
Without hesitation, saying that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
Nor would he care if someone recommended by someone unknown.
Case 14-year José is different.
This teenager's own accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask and the last mentioned the network admits he does not know 20 people from your friends list.
"I'm not afraid of it, because we have something in common, such as music," he says.
According to him, this boy, none of them nenaváděl, and after him did not want to address or phone number.
"If they urged or demanded of me, simply remove them from your account," she admits.
Jose volunteered to Ask after they read the recommendations on Twitter.
The boys are not a foreign experience with what is now called cyberbullying (cyberbullying).
"Famous friends on the social network was being blackmailed.
They threatened him and demanded money.
He never knew who he was, "confirms.
The victim, according to José neodhlásila of the account.
"He's raised a private regime."
Then he explains a series of steps, how to safely set up account.
In contrast to this, a boy named Jorge photos known in unpleasant or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I would have done it, if someone kind or I just felt like it.
Even though I know that this is cyberbullying, "he says.
The key questions
Marielos Porrasová, an English teacher and graduate of the field of Education and teaching, it is considered that to children and adolescents in social networks is correctly oriented, they must understand that the main objective of these networks is to inform.
States that: "the Internet arose as a means of finding information, but as a social network, has changed the rules of the game."
Marrielos Porrasová noted that academic staff member Marc Prensky, a graduate education at Yale University and the author of the article Digital Natives and digital immigrants, introduced these concepts in order to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants, who we have to teach, and in doing so yourself just learning, '' he says.
He explains that it is a complicated subject, "as it is we are asking, as they dropped to what is appropriate to disseminate, publish and say, and what not, in an age when it is not yet mature."
Also, to be-what concerns around-mentality, at a time when what most want is to be loved, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences, "he adds.
According to the administrator, and is the most efficient way to children and adolescents to show what it's privacy, asking questions that lead them to think.
"Telling them that doing something is not working," he adds.
In addition, Marrielos Porrasová lists some of the options: there are things that you stranger, so why are you doing on the Internet?
Or: would you like it if someone has posted your picture as you published a friend 's?
You know, what about the rest of you be published?
When you call the person in the photos of the celebration, you asked them for permission?
And one more: they need to keep everyone know what are you doing right now?
Another point is to realize that they must behave in the environment of the Internet, as well as outside of it.
These are the same rules.
"A man outside the internet be governed by respect, morality and other principles and the same it should be on social networks," he says.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a University Professor, a teacher in the first degree and an educational adviser explains that it is necessary to read carefully the parents of children the rules of social networking.
"If you understand the intricacies of every single, have a good basis to make with the kids talked about the consequences of opening an account on the Internet may have.
For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to share or publish, '' he says.
Guardia is of the opinion that it is essential to remind children of the traditional rule of "don't talk to strangers".
The Summit of the Americas ends and the Declaration of Lima not published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru today ended without having released a statement from Lima, which has been announced and which was supposedly signed by the seven Presidents are present.
The Agency Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of the Unasur, but representatives of the Foreign Ministry and Presidential Office, who at the beginning of that document will be published after the end of the Summit, said they will later be posted on the Web site of the Peruvian Government.
Further argued that the content of the President's Ollantou was published in Humalou a few short press releases.

A small amount of information that should be available to reporters, was provided by speakers of some Governments, who were present, but not the hearing's speakers.
The only paper published during the negotiations, a list of the participating Presidents, which caused the indignation of hundreds of journalists from different national and international media, who have been asking for more information.
Later, Peruvian media's Office sent out an email with the "final Declaration" of the Summit, but this is just an expression of President Humaly, and not an official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-Países Árabes, ASPA) and on this occasion it was not originally promised a statement from Lima, although it was published in the press eagerly required.
The official website of ASPA, you can see that the document was published last Tuesday.

That are supported by actions to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and transnational organized crime, in order to improve the availability of drugs and cheap Internet in all parts of South America and to the joint and efficient measures against the risks of natural disasters".
When Europe is in crisis, "does not have the economic consolidation (Latin America) winning the essence, but can serve to enhance our productivity and show our peoples a better future," said Humala.
"We decided to give priority to a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve transport links various places of South America, especially in rural and border areas ... to make our country better linked and created new economic ties," said in čteném speech, the Peruvian President.

Rafael Correa: South America must learn from the integration of Europe
Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa announced today the creation of a common citizenship is the goal, in which the "South America, in this case, really, must learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said in a State television TV Perú that Europeans "are killed in 2. During World War II "and in other conflicts," but now they are practically one country ".
In this sense, defended the project of creating the South American citizenship, that Member countries of the Organization of the Unasur.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in the context of any South American country, which is already occurring among the members of the Andean Community, however, there are still reactionary area, which makes us want to go back to the past," he said.
The Ecuadorian President has, inter alia, expressed its agreement with the reformation of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that reduces the influence of Anglo-Saxon countries and take into account, those who signed the Pact of San José on human rights.
"Those who are in the lead, never useless, and we do not oblige the South Americans, in turn, all we'll get.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on human rights in Washington is funded by the United States, "he said in allusion to the political asylum granted to Ecuador and the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assangeovi.
President Correa confirmed that this decision has no regrets, because I did not betray their principles, and respecting their "deep democratic values and human rights".
Said that at the time "there was reason to suspect that Assange could be extradited to a third country, regardless of the ongoing process".
In addition, he criticized the Swedish judiciary, asked him to be on the Swedish territory subjected to interrogation for alleged sexual tort, while "my Swedish legislation allows to carry out the hearing videokonferenčním call, that could take place from the ekvádorského Embassy in London".
Correa said that there is a risk that Assangeho is the deterioration of physical and mental health.
"I have not spoken with him since he's on our Embassy, but the Ambassador informed me that my tiny lung problems, but nothing serious," said the head of State of Ecuador.
"There is, however, that his physical and mental condition deteriorates, because it is locked up in a small space without the ability to exercise in the open air.
It would have affected the health of everyone, "he said.
President Correa said that the solution to asylum provided Assangeovi from June at still earlier Ecuadorian Embassy in London on the basis of the permit which allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, and stressed that the London talks were held to resolve the incarceration of the founder of WikiLeaks.
"We respect human rights nevyjednáváme, such a word in this case, we do not use, but constantly carried out interviews.
A solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, because the Assangeův Attorney Baltazar Garzón leads a series of proceedings in various European instances, "mentioned.
Stated that "If the United Kingdom issue a pass, everything comes to an end tomorrow."
And if Sweden Mr Assangeho to listen to the still earlier Ecuadorian Embassy in London or via Skype, as it allows without any problem, its legislation and as has already been done in other cases, this issue will be made tomorrow. "
Correa took advantage of this situation in order to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, and clarified that definitely does not tolerate "podprůměrnost, bad intentions and a lie, which undermine the freedom of expression".
The biggest enemies of a free press, we're bad and evil politicians, but bad press in the service of profit, nátlaků and blackmail, "he said.
From this perspective, expressed joy over the fact that even these journalists, "neither bankers nor a hegemonic country nor the bourgeoisie do not speak Ecuador", and point out that, if re-elected, will "continue changes conducted the right way and in the right direction".
President Correa also backed the decision to continue maintaining the veto expressed regarding EU membership Paraguay Unasur at least until the next election, and argued that the whole "must be firm and netolerovat opportunism and pučismus wrapped in legality", because, in fact, "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay's democracy."
In addition, the Ecuadorian President said that it considers "completely appropriate" wishes of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime border between the two countries, now at the time of the judgment of the International Court in the Hague, which ruled in favor of Nicaragua.
Is not currently accepted the judgment.
"The problem is between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome will walk together.
It is necessary to examine, to have been overcome and the possibility to go forward. "
It also expressed the hope in the settlement of the dispute over the maritime border, which resolves to the same Court of Peru and Chile, and expressed the opinion that "it is good to search for Latin America of the international instances, if both countries undertake to accept the verdict, whatever it will be hard".
In connection with the possibility to be a candidate in the next presidential election in Ecuador, to be applied in the order of the third mandate, noted that the perception of this option "with great optimism and joy, even if it's sometimes very hard".
Correa said that if the election in February 2013 loses, retires from public life.
"I personally never care too much, but so unfair situations, such as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador, can correct only political power.
My political movement believed that I was the one who guarantees likely to win, so we have to take this responsibility, "he said.
"If I won, it would have been my last presidential term and then I walked away from politics.
If we lose, I've got the same thing.
I've already decided, "he said.
Correa has also mentioned about a new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, Cuba.
"I was just talking with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás takes Madurem, who says that President Chavez went to the planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.
This is not a relapse in the State of health of the President, "he said.
The head of the ekvádorského State, today attended the sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was terminated to greater regional integration in order to sustain development, equality, and security.
AIDS victims today are the result of late diagnosis
Fabriziovi was 21 years old when he was confirmed by the result of his test: HIV positive.
"It was as if lightning hit me," she says, when memories of the moment of truth, which the doctor was trying to "moderate", but apparently without success.
The boy in front of his family.
He decided to take his disease alone to shoulder and started to inform about it. And with such a commitment, that it celebrated the 43. birthday.
It is without a doubt one of the nejdávnějších patients HIV Unit in a civilian hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from 22 to 28 years, which was something unimaginable in the early 1990s. years ago, when there was a lot of doubt, a few treatment options and greater stigma.
At that time, even with the Director of the clinic of the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) say goodbye, "because he had a cut".
At that time it was synonymous with AIDS have died.
Now it is possible with this syndrome to survive and live fully.
However, it is a lot of people who doesn't know about your illness and come up when a virus caused the destruction of the organism and vysílil immune system, and they are then victims of accidental infections.
31 years since the AIDS disease appeared in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, "is a great success that the length of life of the patient, which in due time and in an appropriate manner to begin with the treatment, it is exactly the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit in a civilian hospital in Guadalajara with the fact that this information was confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
Infektolog and a specialist in HIV/AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have come to the conclusion that since 2008, AIDS is not the judgment of death, but that the length of survival and living a full life depends on the degree of impairment of the immune system of patients, which is a disease is diagnosed, the better are those who use drugs: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years of age and people with 500 CD4 cells up to 50 years.
Simply put, this means that the person is HIV diagnosed in 25 years, according to this knowledge "while adhering to treatment to live without any problems until 75 years", explained in an interview with the doctor.
To emphasize this progress, it is recalled that the average life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years old.
Although the death rate has decreased significantly in recent years and in the case of Mexico dropped the number of people who have died of AIDS, of 6 678 in 2007 to 4 862 in 2011 (Yearbook of the UNITED NATIONS joint programme on HIV/AIDS-UNAIDS), it is also true that since the discovery of AIDS were killed according to the national statistics, 60 percent of patients.
Only in the State of Jalisco in 2011, died 255 persons and in may so far 187. However, since 2005, is to ensure universal access to antiretrovirotikům.
-Why people continue to die from the disease?
-"It seems to me that the problem is not how to access treatment.
This is what I see, this is how it's going for us at the hospital.
At least for the past 12 years, we have not used stocks of pharmaceuticals. The problem is that patients are at a very advanced stage, because they don't know the status of the disease, or in the late stage of the disease. "
Adds a compelling figure: "nine out of ten patients comes when it will take effect any associated infection. The only thing you need to do, so we can more affect the overall mortality, the disease is diagnosed early, and therefore it should be on a large scale to offer tests to detect disease, all persons who request them. "
In its proposal is compliant with specialists and officials from the National Council for the prevention of AIDS in the State of Jalisco as well as directly with patients as Fabrizio, who came to do tests to a private laboratory because his friend did it, and despite its low age for him AIDS erupted, and also suffered from Kaposi's Sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the usual complications.
"Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I have to die, I'd rather vyřádím three times a week," they say, but it is not my case.
The change was for the better, healthy eating, I practice, I take drugs. "
To this day his parents knows only that he suffered from cancer.
"I'm living a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I'm traveling, I have an active sex life, but responsibly, I give attention to yourself and to the other person, "lists the Fabrizio, who took on the challenge to share their experiences with the MILENIO JALISCO today within the framework of the world day of AIDS motivated their testimony to those who are afraid.
"Let them have their tests done. If so, whether he knows as soon as possible if they are HIV-positive, it's better. And if you already have been diagnosed, they realize that they can live like anyone else, if they are held accountable. "
This message summarizes the password battle against AIDS this year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Among the programs for health and common citizens is a huge gap, said Ricardo Salazar, guadalajarský journalist who finds information on HIV.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places that are dedicated to this task "will actually increase the distribution of condoms, used to give one or two today, give us a hundred packages of condoms, which is very good, but still there are people who do not have access to a condom, '' he said.
Between nejnáchylnějšími to new diseases are adolescents.
"What do you want?" is a common question full of irony and the assessment of social workers, educational counsellors, employees of pharmacies and medical personnel that teens want to avoid, says the reporter.
Designed this ineffective distribution change. Whether condoms are not just for counters, but let the hundred is located in dávkovačích in public men's room, where often young.
"It's not promoting promiscuity.
And it's not about them "to pay for beer and motel" as Governor Emilio González responded when asked if he would agree to the distribution of condoms in his district.
Takovásexualita is not. It is best to make condoms to those who have sexual life they lead, "he said.
Key figures in the State of Jalisco
13 435 cases were recorded (12 158 cases of AIDS and HIV cases 1 317).
This means in fourth place in New Mexico and recorded cases of AIDS and 13. place in the context of HIV.
92% of disease is sexual way, 6% of the blood path y 2% perinatálně.
It is estimated that with HIV can live for about 50 thousand people, as one registered case is four to five persons who do not know about the disease.
Judgment of the Court of Appeal approved of the United States, which does not recognize the debt restructuring of the company Grupo Vitro determined bankruptcy in Mexico raises the ominous precedent for any national firm with offices in the neighboring country and the solvency problem.
It appears, therefore, that the procedures for the restructuring of companies that allow Mexican law, in the country's bars and stars despite international agreements do not apply.
Approval of the judgment issued by the 15. in June last year, judge Harlinem Hal at the bankruptcy court for Northern Texas Mexican companies in practice leaves without defence against the possibility of confiscation of their property on the other side of the river el Bravo.
However, the judgment opens the door for the Mexican producers of glass to the Supreme Court of the United States, citing irregularities against the three.
By way of introduction, it should be noted that while a judge in this case contends that the lenders are governed by the insolvency law of the United States Court of Appeals Fifth District based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure sets out the bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
First, it was the ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
Basically for this purpose created a model law of the United Nations for the unification of international commercial law, which arbiter specifies the Organization of the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment States that without a vote from the branches of internal corporate structure, which is recognised by the debt of the parent company Vitro to branches, would not be achieved the required majority to approve the restructuring.
However, the possibility of Mexican legislation.
The fact is that the case of Vitro was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There are a half-dozen examples such as Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, for whose internal debt guaranteed by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute.
In addition, it is true that even after the deduction of the votes would lenders – who branches against the company Vitro stood before a court in the United States. funds "vultures", as are Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool did not achieve a majority of Limited-.
The vote would have reached about 45 percent to 37.
This figure does not take account of the Court of appeal.
From another perspective, the Court accused the company Vitro from a difficult situation, which has faced since 2008-against the backdrop of a serious economic crisis that struck the United States.
In the meantime, the family firm Of González lodges an appeal for reconsideration right next to the Court of appeal that the assessment was carried out for the full participation, i.e. with the participation of five judges, because originally voted just three.
If he fails here, it will require a revision of the appeal process as above, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States.
The case is a serious failing that the court document sent to them by the Mexican Government as a service of the amicus curiae, in which the procedure is described in detail the company's Vitro as part of Bankruptcy Law, in which he points out that the company helped matters by the agreements signed by the two countries, confronted with the law to chapter 15 of the Insolvency Law of the United States.
Navícse points out that the country complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission for international trade, that is, rules for international insolvency cases that guarantee equality for borrowers and lenders.
The impact on both sides: the penalty for the company Vitro.

Basketball GlobeTrotter Héctor "Hetin '' Reyes has been associated with this sálovým sport for more than 60 years and toured the whole world because of him.
Few people in Puerto Rico has so many memories on the history of the local basketball, as Héctor "Hetin '' Reyes.
Reyes was before he caught in 2008 stroke on a wheelchair, fired into the sport after more than 60 years, whether as a player the younger category, a player of the National Basketball League BSN, owner and coach of the team Vaqueros de Bayamón in the National Basketball League, or the President of the Puerto Rico basketball Federation.
"I in the course of his life in basketball a lot of roles, including several at the same time, like when I was in the 1990 's. years by the President of the National League BSN, national team General Manager and President of the Federation, "he remembered Reyes during a visit to the newspaper Primera Hora reporters at his home in Bayamónu, where he lived for more than 50 years with Isabel, his faithful wife.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes in his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with pictures and memorabilia from his long career, attest to this.
Bayamón in the heart
With the greatest emotion of all those guards, which are reminiscent of his tenure with los Vaqueros from the mid-1950s. years, where he was a player until 1982, when at the same time celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or owner of the team.
"It was my best years, I enjoyed the most, because I had the opportunity to be with a team of los Vaqueros from 1967 to participate in eight Championship, whether as owner, co-owner, or coach.
It was a number of successful years, including five championships held in the years from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to the Championships-one in 1981, when he made his debut in the BSN Jerome Mincy.
If the team has taken over the "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great leader, "said Reyes.
"I remember that Gene Bartow, who was previously the head coach at the time, and he taught at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said to me:" I said, shaking for you 2 m players.
Do you want him? "
And that was the beginning of the Mincyho, one of the best players ever, Puerto Rico.
Bartow me then recommend the quarterback Raymond Gausseho, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I said that if Bayamonu will bring victory in Mincy Championship, then Gauss will contribute to the next. "
The Championship, when he played for the los Vaqueros team Gauss, enjoyed, but only at a distance, because already in 1988, he was President of the basketball Federation.
At that time he wanted to fully concentrate on its features and enjoy the Mincyho location in the national team.
"I remember how we beat the United States for the first time in Olympic qualifying game in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we ended up, but we had to have a bronze if the Canadian judge, who let us repeat the final face-off, "Reyes said.
Is a team from the World Cup in 1990, the best national team, that you have ever seen?
It is among the best, as well as the one that defeated the Dream Team at the Olympics in 2004.
But my favorite was the national team in the Panamerických games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and vypráskali we are a team of the United States, which was quite similar to the one that blew us a bronze at the World Championships.
This team should not only Mincyho, Gausseho, Ramona Rivase, Fico López and "Piculína" (Ortiz), but also there were youths (Javier) "Toñito" Costa and James Carter, brothers Leónové (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who was unable to be on the team in 1990 due to a knee injury.
A team that might not be the perfect composition, but we managed to win a gold medal and bring great joy, it was the team of Olympic qualification in 1995 in Argentina's Neuquénu.
With the players on the roster, as they were "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced a player excluded due to a skirmish in Panamerických games in Mar de Plata, we, despite all predictions to win the gold.
What was the best player of Puerto Rico?
It was without any doubt Piculín Ortiz.
Its number of international tournaments are impressive.
No one from Puerto Rico to achieve such results at this level as Piculín.
Not to mention his involvement in different leagues, where he played.
Who was the best coach for portorickým?
It is very hard.
We had a very good generation belongs to Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
From young I like very much the work of Leo Arilla.
His success in the Federation which you consider to be the greatest?
That I was a part of the era's most famous national team from 1988 to 1995 and that in the early 1990s. had the National League BSN in one season to 17 teams.
You've had the chance to prove it?
They were things that I wanted to introduce, as a division of the youth categories according to the regions.
For example, the guys from Ponce played only in its area and were competing with teams from other parts of the island only in the national playoffs.
Children now travel a lot and play games too, which is not necessary.
I can also see the benefits of mandatory certification and courses for coaches, umpires and the referee assistants.
It's nice to meet you.
What are you now?
Most listening to music, watching YouTube videos with music from my time, I'm enjoying grandchildren and sometimes I go to basketball games.
And, of course, I'm enjoying the company of his wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.

Starting a course that explores the "end of the world"
Each week, students will examine the apocalyptic themes like nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When Professor religion Stuart Charmé decided that this semester is going to do a tutorial on doomsday, knowing that it's irresistible lure: the end of the "long count" of the Mayan calendar, which has lose 21. in December, it struck many people as evidence that the end of the world is coming.
Charmé, however, had no idea what he was in a few more months of waiting: catastrophic hurricane Sandy, the budget gap, which some call a "debt of Armageddon", and the growing conflict in which Israel is involved, the place where, according to Christian teoretizujících about the end of the world begins to Apocalypse.
"I did not realize that this is gonna be nejapokalyptičtější semester, ever," said Charmé this week students Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey.
When one examines what is happening today in the world, as if we had 30 days, it's really a good time.
And keep in mind that bad means good for apokalypticky minded.
And it's not the only professor who offers courses on "end of the world" this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
Temple University organized by Assistant Professor Barry Vacker course "Resources, culture and the end of the world".
Each week, students will examine the apocalyptic themes like nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"Why, why do these thoughts with a time of expanding," he says, and both offer a hypothetical scenario that control certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, the war can break out.
This month, students analyze movies with apokalyptickými themes and examined how they differ from the examples from real life.
"I tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, believable and impossible, '' says Vacker.
In the main campus of the State University in Pennsylvania got together Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solariová, Assistant Professor of art history and anthropology to course with the simple name of the end of the world.
";" 2012 ", because we are always with the possibility to organize the course again in the event that the world will not end," said Restall.
Despite the "impending destruction" must study, students create projects and do the final exam.
At Penn State, the final exam will be held on the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not give the students an option other than work "until the evening of the anticipated end of the world", said Restall.
Courses have become very popular.
"He is in two hours," said Restall of its course for students with a high average, where a total of 35.
Weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester we were receiving the email queries whether it is still in place.
The students come to the course is one of the most interesting.
"It seems to me a fascinating to see what people are doing to make yourself comforted each other," said Rutgers University in Camden, a 23 years old student of Robinson, Bridgid field of religion and sociology of Haddonfield, New Jersey.
And, thus, apocalyptic, secular or religious beliefs is just a matter of comfort, or lack of it.
Wekesa, a freelance Will psychology and nursing student, said that he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've Never heard of an hour in which it could teach," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no vyzpovídaný student, let alone a Professor, said he believes in the end date of the 21st century. December.
"Our first project was on the Mayan predictions and vyvracíme it in some way," said Julie Zeglenová, 21letá student his senior year at the University Temple of the West Chester.
"The Mayans never nepředpověděli end of the world; It's just a key point in the calendar, "said Restall.
But it said that in Western culture there are apocalyptic anxiety that dates back a few centuries back, which people respond to changes in their environment predictions about the end of the world.
The heyday of these speculations has caused the internet.
"It doesn't mean the rest of the people," he said.
This is done in the vast majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a Professor of religion at the University of La Salle, which this year is a lecturer in the Philippines, when asked if he knows of any course on the "end of the world", he answered quickly.
"The Philippines is not end of the world," he wrote, and suggested an exception in the Supreme Office.
We have a reprieve from the Pope.
Restall said that over the years there was talk of many days of the last judgment, and said that if nothing happens. December, "people immediately think about the next date" or philosophize that 21. December is the start of a seven-year term, which expires at the end of the world.
Date taken lightly students and professors.
A few have said that they intend to go to the Festival "end of the world".
"I think I'll call a few friends, to laugh together," said 20-year-student communication Samira Ford.
