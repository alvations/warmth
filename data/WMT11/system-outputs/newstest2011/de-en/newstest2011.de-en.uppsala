What should they do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague are not aware of, nor the "Konditorei Voldemort."
The new Council members of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously some language barriers, have to overcome their alt-neuen colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and representation at all in the town to be able to understand.
The newspaper has Aktuálně.cz members of the new Council from ČSSD a little "abgeklopft," as they dominate the notorious Slang, which in recent years has established practice, in which the current coalition partners, in Prague at the helm.
The encoded vocabulary verflossenen in the era of Mayor Pavel Bém of the Prague political elite was introduced, is some of the most famous actors, situations and Causae borrowed.
Surprisingly, the new councils in relation to these new notions of something in the dark.
They say the least.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I have no idea."
"I am more a newcomer in the Prague policy," responded Lukáš Kaucký, the new Council Mr for culture, the test of the "Paten-Wortschatzes."
But the Council Mr Karel Březina, a political veteran, reacted to a similar way.
For example, the term "Gulf hole".
"This is the only expression of those who are here with me, I am now and again."
"Otherwise, I think often infiltrated by slang not much."
From the vocabulary, the newspaper Aktuálně.cz in this year "s June before the election, Congress of the ODS, pickte the editorial six terms, especially those that are notoriously with the Prague government.
The Social Democrats Voldemort the terms "should," "greatest Prague Gulf hole in the Konditorei," "go," "bull neck", "betrayal" and "verblechen the capital".
Three Prague President-in-Office gentlemen voted in favour of the test, the fourth - Mr Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised that his participation in the first interview since then, but not even the headphones.
The fifth President-in-Office Mr, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test in the first place.
"These things are, and I don't care how the Civic Democrats themselves develop it, I am not."
"For me, it is how we in the framework of our programmes to understand," he countered.
As already mentioned, Lukáš Kaucký in the aforementioned headline claim not recognised that the influential entrepreneurs and friend of Ex-Oberbürgermeisters Bém, Roman Janoušek the speech.
The term "Voldemort" says Kaucky absolutely nothing and the only concept, the test correctly erriet, was "the greatest Prague Gulf hole".
"It is the tunnel," says Kaucký Blanka, added to safety but added: "But I know that there is more in the newspaper."
And jokingly: "I am going to have to prove that a language course."
The "Gulf hole" will not only matador Karel Březina, but also the councillor for the Environment Lukáš Plachý Blanka entziffert right as a tunnel.
Both Social Democrats know but also, for whom the notion of Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find this figure is and what it means to go "in the Konditorei."
"I believe that that is, in some kind of Prague gastronomy", is to go operational Plachý pretty close to the conundrum hit solution, when we know that this is the headquarters of Janoušeks firms.
He claimed Březina in line with this knowledge, but rather from the newspaper to have been accessed, and that this would be their own vocabulary.
The test participants to judge by, it seems, with the Social Democrats in fact no similar eingebürgerten Slang.
"I have asked my colleagues, but it is clear that there are something like that for us is not really."
"We call on us, and we will also use the acronym, or moniker," says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - of his party of "casual" Hulda.
"At school I was (Birke Bříza), but I do not know whether to call my colleagues," Karel Březina his moniker tells us.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried and behold, it works.
Mr Weinert Council is for the party of the kind of "Opa" or less friendly to the 'old', the Representative, Miroslav poche before the elections through the machinations of party sponsorship come to our attention that some colleagues' Igráček "(famous Czech Lego-Figur).
Moniker are the only one that the Social Democrats in whose use of language.
Hulínský it may supposedly not if it calls ", but" Hulda Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname "Dr the rubber truncheons rights", supposedly to do with its title, that Petr Hulínský doctor iuris Bratislaver in the police academy.
The government wants to stop torture of "witches" and gave out a booklet
Women in Burkina Faso to be pigeon-holed, witches are usually some common social features.
They are more of the older generation, they find no work - for example, for health reasons, they are free, and have no children.
If one of these women to Hexe "will be", it will be strictly isolated, so that they are not dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are from this fate quite rare."
"Young and healthy women, this is because they help to the work and to bear children," describes a Orden sister the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a Spezialheim for more than a hundred women, have been rejected by their communities.
The local government has now decided against these abnormal "social action".
And there was a brochure for this reason, the "witch hunt" is designed to prevent.
There is, however, a sting in the tail.
"More than 70% of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," said the newspaper "derStandard" the dilemma of written information.
Accused of witchcraft to be, but also in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-jährige Ammy Hemmahová of three women and two men tortured to death - they übergossen with Petroleum and burned it.
On this incident, the server BBC reported.
The perpetrators are alleged, however, that the issue would only be a combination of unfortunate circumstances.
According to her version, which is oil, inflamed to ritual Salbungen will be used.
And after the group had attempted to "an evil spirit" from Mrs "worse".
The isolation of "witches" support the people here without regard to their education.
"The Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso:" Fresserinnen of human souls are used today as a threat, "he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso, at least, is trying to defuse the witch-hunt, the Gambia niche President in the past year, the President himself properly mitgemischt.
"President Yahya Jammeh revived after the death of his aunt a monstrous witch hunt, because it allegedly share of their death and had now try, including the president himself by black magic to kill people."
"He called Schamane from the near Guinea aid, accompanied by policemen, soldiers and the bodyguard of President indiscriminately treat detained men and women violently from The Gambia niche villages and abducted on the farm of the President in Kanilai brought", the organisation Amnesty International in its report.
On the farm from prison has been forced to a Absud from plants with halluzinogener effect to drink, but also colon and kidney problems.
Two of the arretierten people survived the residence on the farm.
It was on the basis of international pressure were almost a thousand prisoners released.
A tenant of Bakala: It fuels in the kiln, but nevertheless is paying higher rent
An older untersetzter man leaving the clients in the centre of the company's "RPG Byty Kohlebarons" Zdeněk Bakala, the greatest Privatbesitzers of rental housing in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm, in a file with three new rental contracts to three flats: On its own, and the homes of his daughters and his son, who had just served a prison sentence.
All three were in the context of the so-called "deregulation" just the rent increase.
Instead of 3,500 SKR month to rent the son of next year for a 2-Zimmer-Wohnung with kitchen in the second category, 4100 SKR fork out.
"And there are not even in the flat fluid hot water and heat must be a simple coal stove," if he angered the finger at the new rental contract to the son, to which he has signed a power.
"But what I signed," he said resignedly upset half and half.
The citizens association BytyOKD.cz the new Miet conditions as "incorrect and immoral", advised the tenants, the new contracts simply not to sign and until 7 December, at which it intends to publish a guide, as opposed to such agreements.
But the man, only to win.
"One says this, the other the", he is a finsteres face.
The region will be in Ostrava on large "laboratory".
After the New Year, that deregulation most rental homes in the Czech Republic, the tenant has not paid rent while.
Aktuálně.cz decided, therefore, that this "laboratory" to visit in person.
The RPG-Warteraum in Havířov is one of four in the region of Ostrava and nine o'clock in the morning, packed in this Tuesday.
Alongside the door the Bodyguards of a security agency and with her a call.
"Rent," 2011 is a special Tastfeld Touchscreen on.
Briefly angetippt spuckt the device and has been a numbers slip.
We have hardly the number '157 "entziffert piepst and in the large display at the ceiling in the waiting area.
There is half a second later in the series.
A little later, an older couple walks into the waiting room to the rent to ask, but the run, in the waiting room is apparently not the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems, repairs, insurance and the like.
From the middle of November to fly to the region in Ostrava the Kuverts with the new rental contracts most tenants out of a total of 44 000 homes of the portfolios of the RPG in the boxes.
The RPG Byty proposes them in the letters that a rental increase of approximately 15% and 38%.
The special office for the new rent in clients centre has opened 18 November.
"The action is little more than a week, that is to say, this is only the beginning," to respond to the women behind the counter for a moment of hesitation when the "client" out as a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakalas former miners' homes are a hot topic.
Before the elections, the Ostrava, Parliament Vice-President Lubomír Zaorálek of the ČSSD quite loudly taken up this issue, it is not surprising that today "s newspapers are full of them.
"Twenty years on, I want to give them a new floor."
"Not even ne besch. WC-Brille they were positioned," is the aforementioned man air.
Until now, the staff, particularly pensioners on counters, in order to see whether they really get the promised tenants moderation, the RPG promises to them if they Spezialangebot sign up in time.
The benefit of a half reduced February rent the other tenants, the new rental contract until 15 December to sign on the dotted line.
Until now, "counters" in Havířov but anything other than overstretched of questions.
"From yesterday's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 because here," officials estimate the counters.
RPG offers both on their websites, and wall blackboards individual Miet agreements, where it seems necessary.
If the rent parties but not at the new rent, they will be set by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but as information about the only possible and legitimate legal approach to understand," says RPG on its Web sites.
"There is nobody in the courts," says one of the staff of the RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the clients centre gives it at least partly right.
"I have more than 13,000 (kroner) pension of 5,000 remain me eating left, where should I have the money for a court dispute get it," he says.
Then the employees but uncertain.
'Time. "
"Mr Zaorálek tells them about the media, they should not sign, and so are the people, they still have to bear in mind.
The regulated rent ends in the largest part of the Czech Republic, New Year's 2011, and RPG Byty the rent increase, according to an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of the rent is not enough just to maintaining the Wohnfonds from," said Pavel Klimeš, the director of the housing portfolio of society and RPG Byty - particularly those of the disgruntled tenants criticised neglect of housing fund is, in the opinion of homeowners, the main reason for the rent increase.
While RPG in the years between 2005 and 2010, the rents collected from four billion to invest in their homes, in the four years from 2011 to 2014, there are 5.2 billion.
In the large format LCD-Display those from the ceiling, with the Polstersesseln in the waiting area of Havířov then there are always a few red news information.
"The rent increases in 2011 by 15% and less concern 31 200 homes, which means more than 90% of the homes by RPG."
"Always, that means a maximum 7,50 CZK per square metre, and is on the month" LCD-Monitor to read.
Only 400 homes from the portfolio of RPG the rent increased to 38 per cent.
"In these cases it is extremely small, the increase in rental prices of 19,66 CZK per square metre," argues RPG.
In 2600 housing remains the rent over the next year, at the same level.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation not rents soaring, but gradually within four and eight years ago.
What is more, the company imposes a further commitment: All revenue from the rent increase (see diagram) wants the company back into the homes, especially in the heat savings - in new windows and insulation.
But are these primarily benefit those people who sign agreements on the rent increase.
The architects, saw the office is also a nursery
The office buildings Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would have been here a Minikindergarten expect, with all that entails: Colourful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a Minispielplatz on the Außenterrasse.
The nursery has since last year, the staff of Arch.Design available.
The Projektierungs- Arch.Design office and architecture, from whose Ateliers a number of prominent Brünner bio-construction expected to come from the first drafts of the new buildings Avriopoint with the premises for his Firmen-Minikindergarten.
Wise in, for most of its 90 staff (Interior) are Babyboom-Alter and the company is concerned that the Projektantinnen and architect home as quickly as possible, returning to work.
Together with the possibility of a shortened to work, is the nursery another bonus that Arch.Design its employees in the concept of social programme has to offer.
A civil engineer and have the -architektinnen it easier to their demanding professional and child care to reconcile.
The Minikindergarten is an original idea of the staff (Interior) by Arch.Design and with the support of the management they succeeded financial assistance from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for its project to win.
The occupational Minikindergarten the operation programme of human resources and employment policy from the European Social Fund and from the state budget to fund the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding grants of 2, CZK 8 million) have the necessary facilities and equipment procured and for the period of 2 years is for qualified staff and for the operation.
The take-up of benefits (2 years) is society Arch.Design Minikindergarten to 3 more years at their own cost.
The preparation of this project took a full year, and the society economy rating in the application processing energetic aid.
The children are all qualified personnel, a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten children can visit moderate without age restrictions, even though most of them over three years old.
And since it is a Mini-Kindergarten, only 5 children to be present, however, is to change the course of the day, a number of children from each other.
The nursery farm is flexible to respond to the needs of the parents, the children of all the staff in relation to the use of the Kindergartens the same rights, without regard to the corporate hierarchy and their respective positions.
Although it is individual education and health care, is the programme content in Mini-Kindergarten however, comparable with the framework of the pre-school education.
The children are not only all them excellent teaching needed - of basic knowledge to Vorschulunterricht, by the way, they also learn English.
The classroom is not only with toys and creative Games, but also equipped with a computer, which is available to the children.
What is more, the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive corporate environment.
Parents can look at the children, and so is the stress during late pennies the children from a nearby nursery school.
Therefore parents who make use of their working time more productive.
It's no surprise that it is also the natural and loyal industrial relations.
Arch.Design included so under the Czech companies, to recruit new staff to offer clear Benefits, family friendly and through such programmes their recruitment marketing.
A bone House fascinates even after 100 years. If you look at the Interieure by Gaudi to
The roof is in the back of a prehistoric Echse, the stairs as the vertebral column of Dinosauriers and Balkone aufgerissene Fischmäuler are.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
Of the local residents, the house, with its organic forms the nickname "bone House."
Organic forms, wild colors, unusual use of stone and mosaic, Kachelsplittern to shed spectre facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all of these are typical features for the youth style of Antonio Gaudi.
The façade of the House is playing with dream zärtlichen liable lines, colors and Texturen of nature and living things.
Only on closer inspection we noted that everything of geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order dominated.
During the night, the whole facade still plastic, more dramatic and more particular Anleuchtung the glory of the colours.
The same dynamic lines and tortuous forms also dominate the interior of the House.
Wood creates ripple effects geformtes copied the Geländer Zierelemente, window frames, doors and even Gucklöcher and trade.
The House Batlló in the Eixample quarter of the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia No 43 was created by the refurbishment of the house, which dates from 1877, the architects Emilio Sala Cortese said.
The reconstruction took two years, and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialists Josep Batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a new building, but in the end it agreed to the idea of Gaudís on an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
The Casa Batlló Miet House noted, Antoni Gaudí, however, is not alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol together.
It has been on the drawing board for representative take away the Realitätenbesitzers of housing and also the use of Mosaiken in the facade was his idea.
In the design of the facade also worked, however, many other Bildner and artists.
The joint work on drafting the Casa Batlló was the start of a fruitful cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí.
It is also involved in the construction of Gaudís Jujol Casa Milá Park Güell in the House, where there are also other works, Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house of the local inhabitants of its organic forms for the moniker of 'bone House. "
Others described it as the specific Fensteröffnungsmechanismus due to the "yawning House."
It also says that at the top of the building is the sword of Saint George, the existence of Catalonia.
But also further bildhauerische elements symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí was in the house for the time unique central heating system with Entlüftungskanälen and typical Kaminen.
Their 45-Grad-Neigung already seems a little weird.
In his creative Gaudí consistently ignored all the time building regulations and did not influence this.
Before the start of construction - although he lifted the appropriate planning permission by the city but one of the claims made about the planned reconstruction were so vague that the city fathers two years later, in the completion as appalled by the result was that they were asked to help.
The Council House, among other things, also found that the building, with its pillars, even in the public sidewalk intervening.
Change, however, it was no longer quite the opposite - just 15 days after the call from the urban community, Josep Batlló an application for approval of the hire of the two highly pertinent floors of the House, and he was promptly given.
The homeowners themselves, in the lower floors.
In the gallery, in the second floor was a Gesellschaftssalon, on the third floor were the bedroom and private areas of the house.
The ground floor has been leased to a Juweliergeschäft.
The whole building is going through a set of stairs sechsstöckige the Dachterrasse.
The main elements of the transformation were all right corner and straight lines removed and replaced by bent and geschwungene walls.
Gaudí worked but with a modern approach to mutual combination of places.
The social part through the opening of the completely Salontüren and a larger society was chatting comfortably without vertraulicheren in talks at a certain level of intimacy.
The House, by Gaudís reconstruction but a new facade a very unusual roof and a further two floors.
Impression is also Gaudís game with the light, as well as the blue and white glasierten Kacheln with which the courtyard dressed, and the light courts.
The game of these two colours all the floors of the House gives maximum light.
He made it plain that the principle to better reflect the light, white and dark colours, the light from the sun, on the contrary, to absorb.
Casa Batlló the House in 2005, the World Heritage List, Unesco, included everyone can visit today.
The first floor is the geräumigste and prächtigste housing made available to the public.
The house owner decided it was only in the years to take this step and this on the occasion of the 150.Geburtstags of the famous designer.
When it was pointed out that this is a very profitable business, kept the surveys, so we assumed it to other common and Dachgeschossräume, including Dachterrasse.
The price for the visit of an is, however, no trifling matter, he is 16,50 euro, students, retired people, groups and holder of tourists cards get 20% reduction.
This figure dwarfs the prices to other Gaudí-Bauten in the city.
Who are the real atmosphere of the House with his Drachentürmchen acquaintance, should try to friendship with one of the inhabitants and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the proper beds Rost? Women are different than men Wënsch
Not the tollste bed frame, but the quality of the deck area - mattress and Rost make the good bed.
They must, however, ways to accommodate the specific user.
In choosing to play a role - many things the weight, size, the state of health and, last but not least, the gender of the Schläfers.
Just as important is the Interieur, in the mattress and Rost.
Typical example?
In a Wochenendhaus, which is not on a regular basis, it is heated Latexmatratzen not well suited for much longer, as they need to be "warm".
In addition, they are much more serious than usual Polyurethan-Matratzen.
And, it should be changed regularly.
If they do not have enough Entlüftungskanälchen the core and have to have a strong record, snarled up moisture, so it is not impossible that, under her mold.
In the election, also plays a role, of course, what we used to.
Anyone who has been a long time in the country, where very high with mattresses soft class, will be difficult to a low mattress with hard surface can get used to.
"Probably all an ice-hockey, which have come back from the NHL, have complained to me about the fact that they are no longer able to sleep properly."
"For their abgeschundenen shoulders, and hips will give out they need simply a soft layer from Visco-Schaum Foam (memory - a Formgedächtnis-Polymer)."
"This, I recommend including sugar sick people is a disorder of the nervous system, so that they the" information "from the ligaments and skin can receive bad," says Sylva Hadamcziková to cushion furniture.
That is why I have many Eishockeyspielern years ago, but also other customers these mattresses with Visco-Schaum Foam (memory).
"Today, it is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer the manufacturer Tempur, among other things, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And one does not need to be a famous an ice-hockey the benefits of Visco-Schaums learn to appreciate.
This "miracle" actually works quite simple.
The sparkling optimalisiert his toughness and form absorbierten in the heat, in other words, it is downright schmiegt on warm body.
Nowhere is it, passing in the night as it is not around after a major fight.
You simply sleep much better.
The sparkling viskoelastische also offers protection against Dekubitus (gangrene).
In the choice of Matratzengröße should be to body size, the length of the Fußsohlen still add some 21 to 34 cm.
Man as a woman, to the 180 cm big need as a 210 to 220 cm bed.
Each of the Schläfer should at least 90 cm is widely available is 180 inches.
In the case of, for example, Singles Einzelbetten are 120 and 140 cm appropriate.
The own comfort and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the rule of thumb for the ideal bed broad: "If you are on the back, there is enough room for the easy angewinkelten arms," advises mine Prokopová. Helena, the Zunftmeisterin the Polsterer Raumausstatter and for years the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture, devoted to this issue in schools presents.
In a Doppelbett needs every one of his own and his own mattress, but take care when buying products, so that the mattresses also are high.
Otherwise, there is no other option but to the Roste different amounts of assembling and that is not, by a long way, in every bed framework possible.
Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with the skeleton 15 cm, it should at least three centimetres on the form of class and the fine buffer.
"With the hand or the Hinsetzen the feathers, we cannot in any way," warns Helen Prokopová feel.
Every bed is a specific Rosttyp required.
Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and in a situation such as increased Siamzwillinge together have no place in the bedroom.
These mattresses will not open and the reference you cannot wash of what is already the practice.
And because you are in a single night between 0.2 and 0.75 ltrs sweat loses, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years ago, becoming a huge (and congested 17).
That is why experts are also advertising slogans in mattresses has a life span of up to 25 years, and even lifetime guarantee.
Every cause has its ifs and buts.
And that is why a practical advice of dealers: Mattresses of 120 and 140 cm breadth of the hygiene waschbaren abziehbaren, not shy, however, it is recommended that a Matratzenschoner, it is easy to use and can wash.
Even if today usually Matratzenbezüge with Rundumreißverschluss be produced, so it would be after the opening two halves gets (immensely important for the Waschvorgang and washing machines size!), is the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially alone, often as the unequal fight between David and Goliath.
They are in bed instead of a Rostes a solid record?
Get out of it.
Or a maximum of a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
The record, they should also be better equipped with ventilation holes (if not already in) and mattresses with the skeleton and 15 cm floor with so-called pocket the core and buffer.
Polyurethan-Matratzen are in such a situation.
For not verstellbare Lattenroste with 14 to 18 pen (Lamellen) are Latex- or Sandwichmatratzen (perhaps also appropriate combinations of Latex and Kokos), always pay is Roste with a larger Lattenanzahl, from 28 and more stroke play, with Lordosenstütze in Lendenwirbelbereich, and the possibility of the Lattenhärte to regulate.
At verstellbare Lamellenroste are no mattresses with the skeleton, because they do not respond to the ergonomische pretexts.
In addition to the suspension of stiff the pen will provide specific, flexible Schultermodule required.
This is a specific strengthen the pen, which allows the pen, or even to make einzudrücken verwinkeln that the one-off Einsinken Schläfers of the shoulder.
Especially for men with broad shoulders an important matter.
There are even Matratzenhersteller which have started, "Herrenmatratzen" soft zone in the shoulder area.
The ladies also thought - is fighting them these soft Hüftgegend in the zones.
For most demanding customers are punktelastische wing pen systems (Lattoflex Roste with points), or mixing with the so-called Multitorsionsfederung Kontakt-Pads burden.
The pressure will be distributed to a number of issues, causing the tension is reduced.
But, if you are on the right mattress and right Rost a bad (and big) Kopfkissen fülliges used the most benefits are lost.
Here, too, a rule of thumb: The Kopfkissen to the head, his top should only up to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles to relax.
Ideal is therefore a 50 x 60 cm big cushions, for example, the Scandinavians.
In the pages of this situation should Kopfkissen (along with the shoulder discharge area in Rost or the soft zone in the bed) the shoulder level.
Some have mattresses have our modern with the old (with hay full) Strohsäcken but common.
Increasingly modern manufacturers use natural materials, or at least their mixtures.
Also in mattresses means the new magic word "organic."
Instead of raw oil is used to manufacture Polyurethanschäumen frequency of natural oils figures - for example, Rizinus- and soya oil.
Soya is used by all the well-known manufacturers.
"Organic mattresses, in other words, the core of it is purely natural materials," says Petr Vašíček Tropico Plus by the company.
Natural substances, but they are also used in the manufacture of Matratzenbezügen - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
But you can also indulge in the capsules micro-supervisory sleeping in fresh woodland or Lavendelduft spread.
Here, too, there is a difference between a man and a woman.
While the men a "kühlender" Pflanzenextrakt from Birkenblättern Matratzenbezug is used in order to absorb the heat and cool the body can have the salary for women "wärmende" effect.
Extracts from red Paprikaschoten stimulate blood circulation to the weaker sex with the sleeping wohlig so warm.
And today's favorite?
Foam mattresses from cold (he has greater Poren with devastated Zellstruktur and, therefore, is breathing more active than usual Polyurethan trade, and a much more flexible).
The combination of various stiff (severity) by Kaltschäumen and Visco-Schäumen Mehr-Zonen-Matratzen arise who know exactly where head, hip and closely.
For a high-end mattress, though, has 7,000 SKR and more to fork out.
Gesundheitsmatratzen, but usually with a lower value added tax, but as a medical device.
The first Czech companies were Gumotex this advantage.
You see, in the bed and the Rost to save is not so easy.
Now and again there is a special offer of manufacturers and dealers, the two mattresses for the price of one.
It offers the brand Magniflex the mattress Duofreeze with the memory for 11.990 verstepptem Visco-Schaum CZK.
The second will be free to do so.
It was the evidence that the era of the Tempur viskoelastischen sparkling materials with open Zellstruktur and high density in almost kosmischem pace was launched.
No wonder they were but for NASA because the astronauts are taking off in the enormous excess strain.
Tempur will heat soft, cool environment cemented it in turn.
So it fits perfectly in the human body and distributed in an optimal way the physical pressure.
It is therefore not only ideal to prevent pressure fire, but generally the sleep increased comfort.
Viskoelastische sparkling substances will not only with mattresses, but also for other health products, such as used in specific Fußpolstern, the legs and the Gefäßen to provide relief.
Use local manufacturers, for example, the sparkling substances Eucatherm C Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human rights monitoring equipment at the Kids under control have
The fear for our own children, and so are considering growing ever more parents, they are to be monitored by GPS.
The system, which was invented for the tracing of cars, may just as well locate people, what would be most helpful in cases such as the trace recently unemployed disappearance of the nine year old Anička Janatková.
The device is currently about the size of a packet of cigarettes but soon it will not be higher than a wristwatch.
Many people, the case of the missing Anička into a funk, and so they are looking at ways to better protect their children.
For the price of an impact on their privacy.
"We are trying to say to all of that, there is no way around this is to pioneer, but that it is an effective way to reduce the likelihood that it will lead to tragedy," Petr Pilin of society Macro Weil, and one of the suppliers of GPS-Ortungsgeräten to the Czech market.
"I recognise that it is in the case of the abuse of such devices can be, for example, if there is someone in the pocket, but that he knows this, but so far we have had no such case has been made."
"Most customers buy it really is for security reasons," adds Pilin.
In his opinion, should the child but always know what purpose the "box" is and how they are being used in an emergency.
The Kinderpsychologin Dana Bočková notes, however, that one of the children, if there is such a thing, it may not have got rid of its easy.
"Even very small children show great creativity, when it comes to certain things intentionally to lose if they do not want to be controlled."
"Even the mobile phones, awoke with the parents initially high expectations, but they can be just as easy to create new surveillance equipment, such as this," says Mrs Bočková.
Their opinion is also questionable whether such a body in the event of an attack will actually help.
"In controlled planned abduction the kidnappers virtually always, whether the child in any electronics, which could be located it."
"Today, it is the mobile phone".
"If such monitoring equipment wider use, they also look as their sales certainly would be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
They conceded that similar equipment in a sudden attack by a paedophile be extremely helpful.
Roberta Čech RC monitoring of the company, according to the tracking services both for automobiles and for people to be able to offer the existence of such an appliance also be helpful if it will be destroyed immediately after the attack.
"This machine is that it is so, the current position in certain intervals demands."
"Even if it immediately would be destroyed, there is at least the final position of the person concerned."
"In more expensive equipment is even a tendency knife, in other words, if you are going on hinfällt and movement, the device sends out an immediate warning, indicating the position," said Mr Čech.
In his view, could similar services are also smart phones with navigation, one need only einzuspielen a particular piece of software.
The problem with the current positioning equipment is that it is either equipment in Streichholzschachtel-Größe, the supporters are similar or smaller mobile phones.
There is always the risk that they will lose.
Mr Pilin Macro Weil, according to the tests in the present devices, which look like ordinary digital clocks.
"This has the advantage that the possible attackers did not realise that it is a surveillance and tracking equipment.
"Or he realises that only after a certain time, a head start, what the police are doing," he added.
No matter which way the trend is towards Armbändern - or supporters, always, the same technology is used, as with the vehicle tracking.
The combination of positioning function with the help of the GPS-Systems (just as in the case of Ms in the car), and the functions of a mobile phone, which the current position demands.
The army has so many Zündschnüre that you keep in the Czech Republic could umwickeln but only two years.
The Czech army, 445 kilometres Zündschnüre be released, bought with explosives.
In the year before, the Ministry of Defence already 224 miles powder to the army camp.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces for ausgesorgt 225 years.
The only problem is the shelf-life of Zündschnüre - two, but no more than four years.
The army bought the Zündschnüre of the Company, including STV Group. For a mere 40 million kronor.
In its justification for the purchase of the huge quantity of powder DNES MF the General Staff said that the soldiers would be 60 kilometres a year to use the powder.
According to the research by Armeepyrotechnikern, MF DNES point raised by this data shows that the whole army every year a very intensive pyrotechnische training course - of all of the generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and cleaners.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and army General Vlastimil Picek is no exception.
Only in this way can the substantial annual consumption of sixty kilometres Zündschnüren reasonably justified.
This length to 25,000 Detonationen.
But would these army stocks for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts is that the training of any new professional soldiers two metres powder is quite sufficient, then the army by this Neueinkäufe - in the light of the increased needs of the pioneering special units - a reassuring supply for the above-mentioned 225 years.
It complained the fast deployment Brigade soldiers recently to the defense ministers Vondra, they have almost no cartridges for hand-held weapons register more so because of the lack of resources are severely restricted.
The underpants shortages.
"Me is not why they are such huge Zündschnüre buy."
But it is ultimately their decision, they are already know what they need to do that. "
"For us, the army is a good customer, the dealer and, as far as possible we want to come forward," says the marketing manager of STV Group Děcký Jan.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defence for the purchase of hundreds of miles of powder with the army had it for at least ten years, with the "ammunition" heckle him.
Jan Děcký of STV Group but talks only of a four-year duration of use and police and Armeepyrotechniker Zündschnüre only two years.
"In perfect storage are probably also mentioned possible" the four years, one of them, but wants to remain unnamed, not as a soldier accused of criticism of the army.
After the end of the long term must use any ammunition to be tested thoroughly whether they still are reliable and not the lives of soldiers at risk.
But these tests are not free of charge, but will cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantities of rebate for the 445 kilometres of powder.
"It cost us 60 per cent less than last year's supply of 244 miles," says spokesman Pejšek the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Just for comparison, the annual consumption of Zündschnüren Pyrotechnikern of the police, the ammunition from the second world war and the Soviet Army liquidate excess brother, several years almost 1,500 metres.
And the police have only ever ordered such quantities of ammunition to use it before the end of the long term can consume.
Already the safety of Pyrotechniker because, in addition, there is the possibility of a flexible purchases more modern and reliable Zündschnüre open.
The Ministry of Defence has already huge problems with the winding up of tens of thousands of tonnes of munitions from the times of the Warsaw Treaty, as the Czechoslovak zweihunderttausendköpfige People's Army on their campaign to the Rhine.
The Pyrotechnikern DNES MF raised, according to the Czech armed forces, expected in a couple of years ago, the same problem in the killing of hundreds of miles of old Zündschnüre today that it has bought as "good".
Up until now I have the contacts that I have won, thanks to the competition.
The victorious placement in competition "micro-businesspeople of the year" have Lukáš Pytloun sales helped the franchise to its hotels.
Winners of the past year, part of the competition "micro-businesspeople of the year was" Lukáš Pytloun in Liberec.
The history of his success looks like a film script.
Lukáš Pytloun went to.
Only abroad, he was aware that, in Liberec of good as at reasonable prices.
From the savings of its holidays work abroad, and with the help of bank credit erstand baufälliges he has a house with five homes.
Considering that he was a university student at the time, the sixth term, this was certainly a daunting.
"The then Preis-Qualität-Verhältnis angered me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first rekonstruierte apartment he rented in foreign workers.
He immediately put the profit back into the house, which he then, step by step, to pension with 54 beds umbaute.
Since then, it has been only seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec four pensions, two style fair restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of accommodation categories.
The komfortabelste of them was until recently the four star hotel 'Pytloun design hotel ".
This year was another first-class hotel added.
"In particular, we have a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé signed, we have sold our franchise concept and other stakeholders in the franchise of Pytloun-Hotels have been reported," says the entrepreneur number one last year.
"Large share of this licence sales at the behest of hotels had just the victory in the competition" entrepreneur of the year, "adds Mr Pytloun acknowledged.
The victory has him greater fame, popularity in Liberec and surrounding areas.
"People saw me on the street, often even after she congratulated me and I have to say that it did really well," he recalled.
I commend all those who really want to create something in this competition.
You also need to do to win every highlight is a good thing.
He says that it has the contacts and acquaintances benefits, which would otherwise not be there at all.
"With some people because of competition, which I have met, I still hold regular commercial relations."
With the success of the glory is, in his opinion, somewhat at any of its staff.
And as he has in the seventy.
"I note in them greater loyalty and pride to the fact that they are part of something, the general recognition".
I see that not only as a personal success, no, this is the result of the good work of all of us. "
"My name is just something in the fore," says Lukáš Pytloun modest.
I wish my successor a ruhigeres year, when we had it in Farmet
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his fixity Farmet has the worst behind it.
The price of the first rank of competition Vodafone company of the year last year, Karel Žďárský Farmet holders of the firms.
The jury then paid tribute to the effort, with whom he is from the small Werkzeugbau in Česká Skalice a company from the soil stampfte, the hundreds of million sales.
"I can say that this is not just for myself, but also encouraged all my staff and our self-confidence in the battle with the competition has encouraged," says of last year's winners.
At the start of the corporate history of Farmet was the effort to do something useful.
And then, the state of his father, Karel Žďárský as compensation for property seized by the Communists a small garage offered to lease, he was not long delayed, his career in the company, which by then he was employed, sausen and founded with a few friends of his father, one of their own company to produce Plastikwannen.
A short time later, they began to focus on vegetable oil squeeze.
Within 18 years ago, it is the largest manufacturer of automatic pressing plants across central Europe.
However, it is only because of the success in the aforementioned competition and whose Medialisierung it is also aware of Nicht-Fachöffentlichkeit happened.
"Not only that, the brand Farmet our customers are now much more, as well as our foreign partners, the situation began with a company will be able to work in their country has achieved the greatest success, greater value to Karel Žďárský," it says.
The past year has been at Farmet, however, not only marked by the euphoria of victory.
The recognition came from the financial results of the company in 2008 and part of 2009.
And 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tools construction-products.
At the time of the crisis, which is even less to the public, but above all just schüttelte companies, reached its peak, many firms have been forced to halt their investment projects and the purchase of new equipment and technology.
"This is a situation we could also, of course, cannot escape."
"The sales went to 40%, we have had to limit production and even resort to redundancies," said Karel Žďárský
A viable company must also sometimes such unpopular measures.
It was, however, the situation in order to get to grips with and the company in the black figures, although with lower profits than before the crisis.
In one the company was not prepared to make cuts - in terms of investment in research and development.
"The grant we built a research and training centre, bestärkten our presentation at international fairs and procured main prices for domestic exhibitions Žďárský," it says.
Everything indicates that we have overcome the crisis.
The sales are growing again, and with them, the number of new employees.
"The new winner, I wish you all the joy of victory - but in more calm," does Karel Žďárský.
An opinion poll, with nonsensical regulations clean
The survey by the "absurdity" of the year for the fourth time, is part of the entrepreneur competition.
There was some stupid legislation from the face of the earth.
The dubious winners of the next year the opinion poll "absurdity of the year" has the duty to create documents to authorities, the Online are available.
So, more than a third of not quite four thousand stimmabgebenden entrepreneurs.
So he asked for the social security administration a paper extract from the register, even if the officials had access by two Mausklicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this will change now.
"The Czech social security administration will, in the future, when controls of Sozialversicherungszahlern no extracts from the register for more," the spokeswoman from ČSSZ Jana Buraňová.
The purpose of the opinion poll "absurdity" of the year, it is all the rules and orders to look in, the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to meet and the absurd.
This is the fourth time this year as a part of a business competition, the tsch. Business newspaper (HN) and will be hosted in public.
If the past year of the three thousand people at the time of the vote, it was involved in this year of four thousand.
Not a surprise, because there are still a lot of legal obligations, which only serves to the business.
"For example, the number of income tax forms, to take a front row place in the world," said Karel Havlíček of the unification of small and medium-size businesses and industries driving the Czech Republic.
The simplification of the business in recent years, the proclaimed goal of all governments.
In comparison to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic, but little has been done.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic in terms of corporate conditions the league a 74., compared to the previous year to eight places worse placement.
The competition was absurdity of the year for the first time in years, and plays re-relaunched every year, according to the same scenario.
Each man is from April until the editorial final of the competition at the end of September, administrative and bureaucratic nonsense.
To register for the website address www.firmaroku.cz. Agusta-Dassault of the organisers of the competition after seven candidates for the anti price "and lets the public online on the websites www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita www.ihned.cz and vote.
It triumphs the absurdity, which receives the most votes.
For this year's poll, more than a hundred, or, more accurately, 105 senseless rules and orders.
The tips are not only employers, but also by professional organisations and journalists.
Among the nominated, "Fina lists" of competition, including provisions that maintenance vehicles on highways and roads have to pay tolls or that employers with 20 staff, two offices and two toilets vorrichten every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published in the pages of the competition.
In each case, the proclamation of the competition at the beginning of November on the Prague Wenceslas Square is part of a regular Happenings, which also figures in the political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-size companies and industries driving the Tsch. Republic and Petr Kužel, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of Tsch. Republic of the climax of the competition with the game.
"Where the state the entrepreneurs stifling, there can be no real recovery, therefore, it is my aim that every year at least thirty paragraph today to lift the unnecessary their operations more difficult," said Martin Kocourek, the minister of industry and trade.
The efforts, stupid orders from the world to create effective.
In 2007 the people most disrupted the entrepreneurs obligation on the ground, the Gewerbeamt their permanent factory three days in advance, to notify the intention with an exhibition to an exhibition or Kirmes want to drive.
This duty has been under a review of the industry law repealed.
The duty to the 2007, the second-largest number of votes received - the duty office, the work of employees in the business travel volume by up to 30 days to notify must, by law, it has been the so-called "Green Card" be abolished.
And - for all the good things.
The absurdity of the year 2009 was the regulation, it imposed, physiotherapists Sprechzimmer in a mirror, a fridge and two Personenwaagen have to be.
This regulation from the Ministry of Health has been somewhat alleviated this year - the fridge duty fell away.
A new category honors socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, education and sports projects
A new feature in this year's have been the fifth year of the competition in the economic newspaper (HN) is the category of "responsibility conscious company of 2010."
Basic idea of this competition, it is rational and fair enterprise.
"We want to support these companies, which are the consequences of your entrepreneurial activity on the environment are aware of and socially responsible to support initiatives," said Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone company Vodafon Ausrufer, and the guarantor of this competition, just as well as the competition "Rebel of the year".
This year "s first year, with this special category of the main competition Vodafon company firms spoke of the year, in which success is not the only long-term goal.
The history of each of them is extremely inspirativ and would provide enough material for a selfemployed article.
Even though they are in relation to the subject of their activities diametrically opposed to distinguish their efforts, however, have a common denominator of support and consideration.
Here it is, for example, because all human gehandicapte personal problems or the health of its own staff.
Among the 14 Fina lists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, also appeared in the Prague software company ET Netera to the emergence not formal sports teams among their staff, which will in many tournaments in a variety of sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the region of Pardubice is society Isolit-Bravo 17 years, the main sponsor of a Foundation Fund for gehandicapte children.
A paper factory from Poděbrady a health care to their disabled workers, which make up 70 per cent of its workforce, for which they are entitled "responsible company in the region, Central Bohemia," was celebrated in competition with Vodafone company of the year in this region, they finished third in the league.
In the Olomouc region won the accounting firm MiRyz soft, including a river and also to an average of 35 hours per week co-substantiated work reduced hours without proportionate cutting wages.
The jury also awarded honorierte in the title, the fact that the company mainly in Czech manufacturers buy, citizens' initiatives in their surroundings and demand for environmentally friendly principles.
"We are trying to do is to recycle as much as possible the consequences of our business and the administration for the environment to keep as low as possible," says their business leader Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT Enlogit nad Labem Ústí from the region, meanwhile, is on the health of its staff and that is why it has to all be rated Books ergonomische Tastaturen chair and bought, also promotes their employees work and corporate actions it carte ring used the services of a local garage will have to be protected.
"In addition, we support the Foundation" people in need, "the local Roma-Kommunität concrete aid," says Ondřej Suchý, the representative of the company.
Last but not least, is the activity of the cleaning company Praní a čištění "from Karlsbader region worth noting that their employees in the form of Extra-Bonussen to their pensions.
"We give our workers contributions to the restaurant, on the road, to increase their skills and for the holidays," says Josef Strapáč Czasch from the construction company from Bruntál Mährisch-Schlesischen, the winner in the region.
The responsible company of the year category were all automatically Kouroupito Fina lists of competition Vodafon company of the year, the questions of the enclosed questionnaire beantwortetet and at the latest by the 15.August zuschickten the organisers.
Please incomplete or wrong answers in the questionnaire by the organisers were excluded from the assessment.
"If the representatives of the competing firms the unanswered questions left in the competition, they were" responsible company of the Year "in the main competition, Vodafone company of the year, but they were not being so".
"A separate application only this competition is not possible, because he is only an underclass of the main competition company of the year," said Karel Goldman of the organising agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner soil Fund - arrests by the police in a public tender
In the building of the soil Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police in the last few days of arrests.
It was the European media entrepreneur and property dealer Luboš G. of the Detektiven in handcuffs.
This was supposed to be held to a particularly public competition handling Restitutionsansprüchen to manipulate that the competition offered land a specific stakeholders zufielen.
This should Luboš G. to have paid more than half a million.
"At this stage, I can only confirm that the police a person for the offence of fraudulent activity in a public competition is Antonie Zelená," said the head of the Public Prosecutor of the newspaper "Právo Pilsner," further details regarding she could not provide the ongoing investigation.
Twenty-four hours later, the business again 46-jährige released by the police.
How he was able to manipulate the public competition, we can, given the paucity of official information only speculate.
The speaker of the soil Fund Lubomír Černá led to the question of Právo, the police have the soil Pilsner fund actually arrests and this during a public competition.
"It was about a client and nothing to do with our staff," took it.
The public competition was Mrs Černá that the correct name 'call for tenders of demands for the transfer of land, in accordance with the law "and would be held in cases in which a number of applicants interested in the land bezeigen offered.
"These persons are in the context of a higher value of their through the transfer to begleichenden Restitutionsansprüche than the declared value of the property."
"In line with the offer of claims will be the order of the potential acquirer, then gives the soil fund the land on the person with the highest offer," said the spokeswoman of the fund.
Luboš G. were obviously information is available to anyone who had registered on the request, and as he himself was justified because he had bought a number of Restitutionsansprüchen, he offered a basic piece of interests that he was going to withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat compensation.
It would also be a sufficient explanation for why he his detention in such a large amount of money to be had.
Luboš G. had been in the past, very good contacts to the Pilsner land fund.
So he also played in the issue of the former leaders of the soil Fund Václav Sankota a role to which he was prosecuted because in Ersatzrestitutionen plots, which already location decisions on construction projects had been taken.
At the time, acquired Luboš G. from the soil Fund, for example, land for the construction of public roads that were destined to be more precise, on the site of the construction of the Zufahrtsmagistrale the industrial area Borské Pole was planned.
He later exchanged this very well with the government against a house directly in the historic centre of the city, the value of the land far exceeded.
At the town hall had to be taken with a heavy heart that works not by blocking of the land.
Housing budgets to rise by several hundred a month
Households must not only from January with higher costs for all forms of energy, but also with higher water and sewer charges, and district heating, and some grow the rent.
Families are so from January several hundred kroner a month need to learn more from the wallet than before.
Electricity is up by 4.6 per cent more expensive, gas by 2 per cent and more in some cities, it will be up to a tenth have to pay more for water supplies become more expensive and in some places the district heating supplies.
Only the electricity costs rise the housing budgets every year several hundred kronor.
Electricity prices were the main suppliers of all reduced to blame is the strong support the production of electricity from renewable sources, in particular from Fotovoltaikanlagen.
Gas is only moderately expensive, but this just then, when people most need to heat and the highest consumption.
There is, then, with a few thousand kronor a year.
While gas and electricity are more expensive in the Czech Republic, the prices for heating, vary from city to city.
In particular, more places are planning price increases.
So, for example, the budgets in Pardubice and Hradec Králové every month from January to heat up to 50 kronor pay more than 1,000 kronor per year pay families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague, in turn, threaten 9% higher water and sewer charges, and it is the case that the city infrastructure rent increases.
If the rent will not change, there are only 6.8 per cent.
The price in Prague is compared to the whole of the Czech Republic also, however, continue to be the lowest.
In Northern Bohemia, where the prices are already among the highest, to water and sewer fees by 7.4 per cent rise.
Huge Miet price increases, for example, in rented homes expected to be 140,000, which is known as the January disappearance of rent regulation.
So, for example, is planning the housing company CPI Byty Ústí nad Labem, 2,500 homes, the rent from January equal to one hundred per cent increase.
Anyone who does not agree with this rental increase, it is the courts to prosecute the company.
The regulated rents, which are today in nearly 300,000 homes should be paying next year, more than 10 percent increase.
Czech children appreciate with 'Fernet and rum, beer is out - it is simply too slowly
'Fernet, rum and vodka, this time, for once, a good whisky, the father from the Hausbar has stolen.
These are the drinks after enjoyed drunken Czech teenager below 15 most notbehandelt.
No exceptions are the children their hangovers ausschlafen repeatedly in the hospital.
This is from the experiences of doctors in similar cases in the arrival of the children's departments of clinics.
"Beer or wine are totally out of fashion, because it is simply too long before you get drunk".
"The current trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, chief doctor of the children in the resources department Hořovice Bohemian clinic.
"Whisky, if it succeeds, the father of a bottle to deprive Hausbar, and if not, then at least 'Fernet or vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage that it can interfere with juice, then he did not smell so strong," said the chief doctor.
The speaker of the school hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him right.
"Most often is' Fernet or rum."
"This is today's alcohol trend, particularly in primary schools.
"Sometimes it was also about slivovice of it at home," Mrs Jurinová led direction.
Chief doctor Pelikán according to three 10 or 14-year drinkers in the hospital admission for a long time no exception.
Before the clinic in Hořovice in which he has been working this year, he has been ten years in the Pädiatrie-Abteilung Motol of the hospital, where the ambulances angetrunkene ablieferten pupils from both near and far.
"The girls had to be" allergic four times.
"She started her career with 12 years ago, when it first time with 3.5 per mille alcohol in the blood and in combination with" Extase "was taken, described the doctor was" a very serious case.
"She was in the exhibition site in Holešovice on any dance party."
"The interesting thing is that it was her mother was not strange at all that their daughter came home 48 hours not surprised," the chief doctor.
It is precisely the lack of interest by parents or their incredible tolerance in with its own Sprösslingen infringed, is regarded as one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism of children.
A true addiction in the true sense of the word, according to experts, it is not for children.
"Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependency on alcohol and all related phenomenon to understand these children and this is not the case."
Among those who have repeatedly alcohol, is mostly a negative familiär-sozialer background, "says characteristic Pelikán chief doctor.
The spokesman for the hospital, according to Mrs Jurinová Motol by the middle of November, has around 40 drunken children in our department assigned medicine for children and young people.
However, only the cases with serious alcohol poisoning, a hospital stay was needed, in the statistics.
Drunken children, the ambulatory care of the parents or possibly brought home by the police are not registered.
In addition to the cases in which children just so a bottle of spirits in at a school desk austrinken there is, in the opinion of Mr Pelikán Amplituden three year period, to the 100% is good: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either because of poor testimony from pain or pleasure for the holiday."
"I have already Walpurgisnacht seven drunken children at once seen in the reception," stresses Dr Pelikán.
A betrunkenes child the night under medical supervision authorities, that is, paradoxically, better off, as a child, the next day, only with a nasty hangover.
Then the headaches in the morning, and the consequent Glukosemangel, it is in the hospital with an infusion of flüssigkeitsspendenden with glucose and nutrients to the body is missing.
"Clearly they are better off, because after the" fantastic "experience in the evening, raise them with good humour, something that without somewhere hurts."
"They are just a little confused as to where they are," admits Dr Pelikán the patients, and he sometimes goes at least the good mood by showing them the cost itemises the treatment will cost.
Because of the transport with the ambulances and the night in the acute beds are well and happy to a few tens of thousand kronor.
"Sometimes I have it as an educational tool, when I used to visit the children have calculated what their drunkenness has cost, and that it may well happen is that they look at the entire holiday on the need to work for money for a single such Fete to earn more", added Dr Pelikán.
In his view, the impact of health insurance but not to redress procedures in order to cure the trunkenen children necessary cost of the parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 in foreign hands for the first time in Spain.
Two slight fighter-planes L-159 of a total of five, the Czech Ministry of Defence against the Casa C-295M transport plane have been exchanged on Tuesday, are in the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer EADS Casa, take up residence.
It is the first time that this type of machinery in possession of a foreign army.
Abroad, they were so far only in exercises or Flugshows to see.
We are talking here about the flight, capable Zweisitzerversion L-159T1 by the Czech army.
The other three are einsitzige L-159 aircraft.
These are still the Aero Vodochody einkonserviert, the mediator Omnipol this business - the company, it has in the past week.
The aircraft when they physically from Vodochody expediert, is Jan Pejšek, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Defence is not yet known.
The einsitzigen L-159 fighter plane, in turn, have been singled out for the long term and this stored aircraft without further deposits and investment on the part of the portfolio of the Ministry.
"The doppelsitzigen L-159T1 in current state of affairs, and appearance were exchanged," said Pejšek Právo the newspaper.
He added that the army will not be without zweisitzige fighter-planes, as the Ministry of Defence in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody a 200-Millionen-Vertrag on the reorganization of four unnecessary L-159 those version signed to two seats.
A new aircraft, the army in July, the second it wants by the end of this year.
According to EADS Pejšek has committed fighter-planes in the equipment of one of NATO countries.
"The Treaty is clearly stated that the company EADS L-159 customers of the aircraft, and that this is the training of pilots of the NATO countries are supposed to serve.
"It is therefore up to the Abnehmers at the way he put it, has led to" Pejšek.
The business newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
Barter of five L-159 against a transport plane Casa and the shopping of other aircraft was 3.5 billion kroner in the last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek been approved.
The Ministry of Defence at the time was to buy a tender held, but it spoke directly to EADS.
The then defence office argued that this exchange will the future export the L-159 support abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machinery, of which they are only 24, and the rest used it wanted to sell.
The purchase of aircraft Casa is also a legal process.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence is at the European Court of Justice. The reason? It could have been the result of a European call for tenders aircraft to choose and not by raising a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken three aircraft Casa, the last to within 14 days at the Airport Kbely land.
Some finger and a ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer,
Men, whose finger is long, as the ring fingers are obviously a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is a surprising result of a study on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer, was published.
This is, in fact, with the levels of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, and that it can serve in men up to 60," said co-author of the study, the Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help to determine what men should undergo a Prostatakrebs-Test necessarily, especially if genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health problems, added Mrs Eeles.
In the period from 1994-2009 they followed that with their counterparts in Britain and more than 500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3,000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants in the study was the finger of the right hand is shorter than ring fingers.
For these men had the same likelihood of prostate cancer, and for 19% of the men, whose Ring- and finger the same period.
In men, whose finger longer than the ring finger was this risk, however, fell by 33 per cent and in men by 60 even by 87 percent.
The relationship between the length of the two mentioned above finger, which is already in the prenatal age, apparently reflects the different levels of sex hormones, which the child was exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone is a longer finger.
Earlier research found that the testosterone accelerated the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, leading Czech geneticists and a former chairman of the National Academy of Sciences, said that he did this study ČTK Lives, however, he is aware of the relationship between its length and the risk of cancer for "has not been proven."
The Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are blocked
In the same way as the biggest part of Europe is also the Czech Republic on Thursday morning in a snow blanket.
On the streets and crowding is mostly Winterdienstler were frozen snow, in many places the entire night in a corridor.
The motorway D5 between 89 and 90 kilometres Rozvadov is in the direction of some accidents involving lorries and cars because of blocked and the D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague "is".
It said the Dispatcher Novinky.CZ of the Central Auto-Moto-Klubs (ÚAMK).
In kilometres of 91, a lorry, two trucks, found 93 kilometres together, this accident there are injuries.
A few cars are in the gutter.
There are also problems of kilometres of 185 of the motorway D1 towards Prague.
Here are two lorries collided.
Drivers should 190 kilometres behind Brno in Brno on leave or travel miles and put on 182 Kývalka the ground.
Indeed, there are miles of traffic jams.
Also on the D11 an accident happens, and that is when the impossible to Prague.
In Prague is one of several centimetres thick blanket of snow and the temperature is minus seven degrees Celsius.
Autokolonnen Stadteil in the form, for example, the street Prosek Štěrboholská is completely blocked.
The safest form of transport there is, in any case, the metro.
The trams travel by delays, for example, on the line between Karl place and peace.
At 8 a.m., the Prague crisis unit.
On the railways and the airport, there are problems.
The Czech state railway had to cancel because Schneeverwehungen seven fast rail connections.
For example, there are problems on the route to Prague - Kralupy Beroun - or Prague.
Travellers should necessarily about the current situation.
The Airport Ruzyně since Wednesday night, 11 p.m. until 5 o'clock in the morning, closed.
Most roads in southern Moravia are only used with caution.
Vyškov in three secondary road completely unbefahrbar, in the vicinity of Brno, in places Schneeverwehungen and in the vicinity of Blansko it is forced on some of the higher roads Schneefräsen located.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are three roads still completely closed - Slavkov: Rousínov, Bohdalice Kučerov - and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here, too, you will need to use the snow clearance Schneefräsen.
When they can be used again until now not gauge.
Hodonín in the region is in the area of white Carpathian of caution.
On the streets, from nature conservation reasons only be achieved with inerten Streumitteln, is one of up to five centimetres thick snow cover, ČTK.
In the Czech Republic, fell from two to ten centimetres Neuschnee, most of all in Northern Bohemia - by 18 centimetres in places.
Mährisch-Schlesischen in the region fell up to 15 centimetres Neuschnee.
In the Czech Republic, but it is slow to schneien.
American soldiers have a new 'smart weapon. "
American troops are in Afghanistan for the first time a new "smart" weapon, which has so far only under its code name XM-25 is known.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon to the conflict with the Taliban, and the balance in their favor.
The new weapon is such a thing as a super accurate gun.
Their projectiles are by laser with an accuracy of only a few metres into the goal.
The specific shells of calibre of 25 mm, which were developed for this gun and high explosive bomb, function practically as small grenades.
The shells can be programmed, so that they are not only at the moment of impact on the target, but at any point in their ballistic railways can explode.
This means that they can be used against an enemy that is behind a barrier - a wall or in a trench.
From above, it is not usually protected, the murderous steel cluster rain from the top so it can easily take out.
According to Richard Audett, which is involved in the development of the XM-25 is the new fight gun Infanteriewaffe the first of the "intelligent" technologies to harness.
"The soldier is basically so: He reshape the objective and sends a laser beam from the distance, so it is a precise target point, after which he will make the increase, then he needs to just abzudrücken.
"Shall we say, has 543 metres measured."
"If you abdrückt, invites the weapon and shooting the Geschoss on the distance 543 metres plus or minus one, two or three metres.
400 jobs will be relocated
Fujitsu, the company moved its establishment in Bad Homburg after Frankfurt.
In July next year will be 400 employees their jobs by the previous office buildings in Bad Homburg on Marienbader place in the Astro Park.
Fujitsu, the Japanese company is shifting its establishment in Bad Homburg after Frankfurt.
As the computer giant and its maintenance specialist industries on Wednesday announced in July of next year, there will be 400 men and women to their jobs from the previous office buildings in Bad Homburg on Marienbader place in the Astro Park, this is a big office complex in the Lyons road in Frankfurt Niederrad part of the city.
A spokesperson for Fujitsu said, that in the medium term, there should be a further 100 jobs of the company, which will be housed in the region has so far been distributed.
The rental offer is very attractive, would also have been the open-plan offices in Astro Park the way the team better.
In Bad Homburg Fujitsu was only tenants.
The competent manager Bernd Wagner said, "with Frankfurt-Niederrad we have a central location with excellent infrastructure found".
The excellent link to the airport is just for a global companies such as Fujitsu is of great importance.
The new move a major company in the region called yesterday from the disappointment of the winners and the losers.
The Frankfurt Wirtschaftsdezernent Markus Frank (CDU), said it would be a "global player" has been won.
It was a "fantastic location commitment".
Fujitsu passe the location of the city, was an important boost for Niederrad.
The Bad Homburger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted the decision by Fujitsu.
The city early from the management on the Memorandum been informed.
"We have, of course, the company offered to our aid," said Korwisi.
The friendly contacts would not, however, the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property on Marienbader place can change.
Economic reasons have ultimately made all the difference.
Now there is a long, empty stage in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building is cooperative."
Fujitsu has so far used the house in the town hall square and the neighbouring 'small vertical "were with the other buildings at Marienbader place ten years ago, one of the most controversial projects the Kurstadt.
As a joint project of the city and a private Projektentwicklers arose between the railway station and a new Stadtentree Hall, both because of the massive development of previously partly as a car park land, as well as the size of the buildings for criticism.
In 2001, the investment advisory and credit rating companies Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, launch Amadeus, and when he was still with Siemens burden-intensive computer manufacturer Fujitsu the houses.
Fujitsu the buildings it was 2006 by the Frankfurter German real estate opportunities Group, together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund, and a year later won the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The nativist Fujitsu-Konuzern in Tokyo are called the third-biggest IT-Provider the world.
It is companies, for example, computer and server prepared and also makes the necessary service.
The establishment in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the biggest in Germany, however, is far more employees Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this site is Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
In the office buildings were Astro Park 7,000 square metres hired.
In the twenty years old complex - the name alludes to his sternförmigen outline - has, among other things, the Central Association Elektrotechnik- and electronics industries his seat.
Well-known Amazon's servers - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is getting increasingly in trouble.
The Internet service providers, Amazon has the platform of its servers.
There is perhaps political pressure following the publication of hundreds of classified Diplomaten-Depeschen.
Assange WikiLeaks founder, allegedly in England.
The revelation platform Wikileaks is in the United States is increasingly under fire.
Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now seeking an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent Senator Joe Lieberman, whereas other countries and businesses to boycott by Wikileaks.
Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and at the tracing lists of Interpol, after a newspaper report in the United Kingdom.
"Wikileaks of Amazon-Server."
"Freedom of speech in the land of the free", shared the Enthüllungs-Aktivisten by briefly news service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Wikileaks-Dokumente the Amazon from its servers.
Internet activists had at the time of the publication of the secret diplomatic diplomatic the Amazon Web services (AWS), concerned about the high level of access numbers on the documents.
Wikileaks said via Twitter to the step further: 'Fine, our dollars are spent to people in Europe. "
If Amazon such problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books".
Amazon have the use of its servers by Wikileaks, after staff stopped by Senator Joe Lieberman have made enquiries, the television channel CNN reported, citing the Office Liebermans.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Amazon had threatened to boycott British ", told the Guardian.
"I would have liked to see Amazon this measure is used to light the previous publications classified information by Wikileaks," said the senator.
Lieberman called meanwhile, the platform also in other countries use servers.
"Wikileaks' illegal, hideous and ruthless approach puts our national security at risk and under threat around the globe... life," in a statement by the party loose senator.
"No responsible companies, whether American or ausländisch Wikileaks should, in his efforts to help the stolen material."
Assange, the WikiLeaks founder about rape allegations by the authorities in Sweden, is on the wanted list of Interpol.
According to a report by the London newspaper, The Independent, "the 39-year-old Australian in the UK, the exact location is known as Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist, the investigations in Sweden is always intrigue of its opponents.
Kristinn Hrafnsson Wikileaks-Sprecher said in London that there had been threats.
"There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange".
Assange rightly therefore fear for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
The WikiLeaks founder, will therefore continue to be hiding.
Hrafnsson responded to comments from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, has asked that the person responsible for the Wikileaks-Enthüllungen charged with treason and executed.
In Canada said an adviser to the head of a government, Stephen Harper, obviously ironic on television, Assange should be killed "and" Obama could use a "drone."
Between the White House and Assange Verfassung while a battle.
The spokesman for the US President, Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had demanded, and if they had recently revealed espionage - demands to diplomats is responsible.
"I am not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a type with a website care," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country, is far more significant than its a web page."
The US government is the protection of their data banks fully to the test.
As a special envoy is the Vize-Direktor of the Centre for anti-terrorism measures, Russell Travers, has been appointed, told the White House.
Travers is responsible for this, "the necessary structural reforms", according to the disclosure reports, the message by Wikileaks had become necessary.
The White House also wants to review the way, as the entire government spread information and protection.
The US Government also announced that for the safety of dissidents and activists that they should by Wikileaks-Veröffentlichung in jeopardy.
"We have made every effort to communicate with them," said Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We stand ready to protect them, if that should be needed."
The Eis-Universität
"Gelato in the" University in Bologna Eiskonditoren times of year to be better prepared.
The three-day basic rate for future Gelatieri has the largest pool of recruits and visitors from around the world.
Why, in fact, the entire ice?
The Gelatiere and the Gelataio.
The Gelatiere, in German, is something old-fashioned the Eiskonditor the cream, following all the rules of the Italian Eismacherkunst ago.
The Gelataio is catching up with a Spachtel the ice cream from the Kühltheke, it highlights in the Waffel and then selling them.
For this to know, you do not have to Anzola Dell Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who still want to know more about the ice, which is not in the "Gelato-University" the Italian firm Carpigiani over.
The Eis-Universität, the manufacturers of Eismaschinen set up in 2003, so that the ice cream from their machines everywhere the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basic rate for future Gelatieri has the largest pool of recruits and visitors from around the world.
But there are also mehrtägige Spezialkurse around the Schokoladeneis and internships Eisdiele own in the House.
Some dreams in the Midlife-Crisis of a new career, other cars simply times on the treacherous ice its vague aspirations.
This time, there are 40 players from 19 countries on all continents, of Brazil on Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teachers from California, loves Slow-Food-Bewegung and wants to be in the country of the future, a European industrial Ice-Cream quality product.
Anke from Berlin, is a business adviser and after years in a nerve-racking eintüten their job.
Two young Egyptians dream of a Eisdiele in Cairo to open.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil and the quality of the ice cream in its bars improve - and the Canadian House, Mrs Julia is because their children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari declared the participants initially the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
What is crucial is not only good taste but also the seidige fluidity and good consistency.
Luciano forgets in its training but not the icing on the cake of the national and even südländischen excessive building: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and that is still a lot of romanticism in that."
The first step in the production seems quite simple.
Luciano dump the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a major Mixgerät with an electronic programme everything to 85 degrees heated and then cools to four degrees.
Then he turns off the engine, and out comes a pasteurised white base cream, Milcheissorten basis for all.
The teacher immediately bestürmt with questions: Can you ice cream only with natural substances without stabiliser?
How can one of their own Experimentierlust free rein?
Luciano warns that in the spirit of the time.
Those of ice cream "natural ingredients only" talk, perhaps still stabilisers is used, often a product of nature, for example, from the Guarbohne Guarkernmehl.
Of course you can hold even without a binding agent, only it must then be sold within a day, otherwise sackt it in, and the customer will bite on Eiskörnchen louder.
Certain variations of the reason crowds are allowed.
Exciting it will be with the flavourings.
For the taste of ice in different Maestro Luciano between the ingredients in the fruit department or in the sweets of supermarket buying.
In addition, there are powder and Pasten.
"The suppliers are you all are trying to foist onto dozens aromatised supplements."
"But you should just experiment."
Either the Fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or in ice cream from the white mass, and reason with eggs to yellow cream and cocoa powder as the basis for all sorts of Schokoladen-Verführungen.
Now the course participants in the Eismaschinen.
Luciano, they each of four different types of Vanille-, Schokolade- Mokka- Haselnuss-Eis, and produce - with or without eggs in the mass, with more or less Vanillearoma or other natural supplements.
The same experiment will also undergo Fruchteissorten.
More flavourings, more Frucht-Püree taste - is not necessarily better.
Haselnuss-Eis tastes not necessarily nut, if it contains the hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi-Eis, the working group, the more fruit used, less water and a little less stabiliser.
Only a balanced mix will highlight the taste of a gelato clear, says Luciano.
Eisherstellung is a purely mathematical exercise: Will Pfirsich-Püree used with a lot of sugar, the sugars in the basic recipe be reduced.
For Zitroneneis is an extra dose of sugar needed.
Luciano prefers a piece of equipment, with the sugar content of the fruit varieties (vine-growers measure determined the Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately tables which facilitate the benefits.
Ice to no longer require so much physical use as in the past.
Not only the equipment for the automatic restoration of basic mass helps.
There is also a device at the same time, the ready-made Eis-Mischung cremig beaten and to minus temperatures cooling.
Despite all the automated remain small glitches.
The Brazilian Gustavo late and its rate of colleagues from top to bottom with Fruchtpüree than it is the colossal hand blenders out of control.
"In every direction," says Maestro Luciano, "it is only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Controllers in Zwielicht
EFSA is the European Food Safety Authority is the experimental Genpflanzen vitiation industry.
This accusation now the group of experts expressed Testbiotech, the independent institute for the impact of the biotechnology industry.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have it well documented," said Christoph Testbiotech-Chef then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa-Expertengruppe for genetically modified crops, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa-Experte for years, are also under contract with the lobbyists Ilsi Association.
The will of companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer paid.
Kuiper have been instrumental in the Efsa-Prüfvorschriften worked for Genpflanzen and am in a clear conflict of interest, then criticised.
The EFSA regulations are (way with position papers by the same wording Ilsi and deceive so that the imprint of the industry, which is the authority in Italian Parma will be checked.
It is the second time that Testbiotech bemängle a conflict of interest.
It was a high-level Efsa-Managerin recently without restrictions or transitional period for the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta - and have changed sides.
The Central German radio (MDR) had recently personal links between kontrollierender authority and industry lobby, reveals what the Federal Environmental Office, as well as EU parliamentarians deconstitution has made.
The EFSA, however, can see no conflict of interest.
We will take every serious data back, even in the industry, as long as they are of the highest technical quality, it says in a statement.
For the experts, the EFSA work, demand it not that they have no contact with the industry.
But they would have to disclose it.
Kuiper, his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the US.
This calls himself as a neutral forum for experts in science, industry and politics - among other things, the risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying contract.
In the matter of independent experts and then criticise that genetically modified crops are currently without any feedingstuffs attempt in animals be allowed and that the response to environmental influences Genpflanzen not tested.
"We want to know what, for example, in the field of genetically modified maize power," says then.
Current practice is quite simply, isolated proteins, but not the whole Genpflanze to test how such an artificial no reliable results.
"If you take the risks, as they are to be then?" Asks then pointed.
It also provides Angelika Hilbeck so.
The academic research since 1994 in the genetic engineering and is currently in the Technical University of Zurich.
The industry in this area, as in the United States now in Europe is becoming more and more critical to influence or scientists to discredit.
There is therefore hardly researchers, corporations are intertwined.
For companies critical studies were in the rule was published.
"The industry has controlled the security research," claims Hilbeck.
The trail of stones
Uli Gsell has also what concerned that a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday night, he stood over Stuttgart station, the Tuba on the back.
It was Demo.
It was snowing.
The history is well known: In September were the dredger angerückt and had started a large chunk of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: Thousands demonstrated against S21 Tieferlegung, the appeal of the railway station.
The freeze when it came, was a big part of the wing in ruins.
Shattered in 6,000 to 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer produce a soft, rough stone, between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He has a couple of scraps.
"These stones are Reliquien."
"It should not be allowed to disappear."
He schwärmt: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earth in prison."
When he used a aufsägte Zigarettenqualm, the rat.
What he does with the headache will make it, he knows he is not there yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones, in a forest in Tübingen in a former Munitionsdepot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen Stein-Reich be built.
The 44-Jährige with old stones.
He has bought all of the demolition in Stuttgart fell.
"It would be a shame for Schotter gemahlen or in the landfill will disappear," he says in his office, a Holzbüdchen, which was once a Wachhäuschen.
They have insulted and threatened him, he explained, in September in the newspapers that he remains of the northern wing of the demolition company bought.
But he has spoken with the S-21-Gegnern, for days on end.
And he has told them that it now, however, nothing for the demolition.
And if it is, then it is the most sensible, but if the stones to be used.
Around 200 S-21-Gegner then took a serious Quader, on average, 80 kilos, little price 6,50 to 14 euros.
As memory, but some in the hope of him on a reconstruction to be able to return.
500 tonnes Rongen had bought 25 great truckloads.
About half are still being stored in the forest, the rest has been sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardener, Häuslebauer.
From wherever they are and have been, as weggeschleppt boot and supporters were able to carry.
The Stuttgart stones of contention have long turned in "Mäuerle" or limits of Kräuterbeeten.
"In fact, this stone nothing special," says Rongen.
"Would not be in the political component."
He is in his SUV, makes a tour by 20 hectares great kingdom.
He studied law and later broken off, biology, he has an interest in computers, and, after all, is stone dealer.
Honey-lover and stone.
40000 tonnes of stones being stored in it.
From across Germany karrt his treasures.
He says that he was the greatest Altsteinhändler of the Republic.
It slows down.
In the snow are skilful behauene sand stones.
"They were even in the Dresden Marienbrücke," he explained.
Elbsandstein, yellow and hot, he schwärmt.
"My favourite stone".
It is the way much of the forest.
It shows a bunch: Red limestone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe train station.
And on.
"Beautiful Travertin."
Once were the Stuttgart Neckarstadions Quader to the gallery.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart police Bureau, rötlicher stone is complemented with from the cathedral, St Blasien, Tuff Heilbronner from the hospital.
What kind of work and what kind of effort, the sweat.
If Rongen to think about how the stones by hand and drove past with simple bottles trains and horse carts were moved, he will very reverential.
"It would be a scandal if Schreddern something like that."
He is not rich have become immensely rich.
But 14 people, the stone dealer today, moreover, in the forest Steinmetze, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a Glasbläser and horticulturalists resident.
"We are working very hard, but it is a good one," says the Resteverwerter.
He must soon after Cologne.
There, too, there are obstacles to save.
Talents struggle for High-Potentials
There is a flourishing crush on Buffett.
16 students push for salmon roll, tomato soup and nurturing.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen have the machinery works and design students invited to the workshop.
In a kind of competition of ideas are they together with VW-Entwicklern on the car of the future is jargon - quite apart from Volkswagen.
In the contest for the brightest now many businesses Nahkampf and, as VW, in cooperation with the university.
Their mission: The most talented students as early as possible in the Hörsälen recruit before they enter the job market and of other pulled.
And because the university no data on the performance of their students, we tried to do the exceptional talents in practice projects to spot and keep.
On the second day of workshops to the Tu Braunschweig, the car company to the talent.
A young lady from the personnel department distributed ballpoint pen, a rubber gum and Mappen with VW-Logo.
They told the hopeful young talents of internship programs and students and show them jobs in the company.
Nico Selle of the Tu Braunschweig cared for the project with VW.
He sees the benefits to both sides: "The students are in contact with the industry, and gain experience."
"At the same time, students can discover more interesting candidates' n and think about who will be the staff in question."
Such cooperation, Selle, are not unusual.
New is that so offensive to the students gebuhlt will.
"Otherwise, the emphasis was more on the technical project Selle," it says.
The battle for the fresh graduates will be even harder.
In many industries, the firms no longer its staff from a large flock of candidates to choose.
But they must advertise, and, above all, highly skilled labour balzen.
Mainly graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German engineers in October about 40,000 remained VDI engineers are vacant.
And the so-called engineering gap, according VDI-Prognosen will be even greater.
For the audit and consultancy firm KPMG is novel Dykta on the talent hunt.
He organised elaborate Recruiting-events such as the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern with trails, in which the participants using GPS-Koordinaten have to find their way.
Eight promising students, wants to put the business in the next year, across the United States.
In addition, the participants KPMG-Filialen and the company.
Those who cannot, will be selected in two rounds in the run-up.
Only the crème de la crème of the many candidates flying into the United States.
The slashing and burning the high potential of the universities, the artillery Dykta according to continue to grow.
"We want to deal with the Race from the mass apart."
"Just a simple Segeltörn was too little."
For talent hunters Dykta the bill appears to be working.
"We have until now, with all the participants a similar action last year contact."
"Some are very close to completion and will soon apply on us," he says.
Apart from the direct Buhlen on campus, especially small and medium-sized enterprises also quite classic for professional heels and revealing clothing prowled on the measure.
"We are trying to achieve at a technical graduates measure."
"For example, the interaction of solar," reported Sitha Stübe, staff leader in solar technology manufacturers, Solar World.
The Bonn company employs some 1,500 staff in Germany.
Stübe know about the early-stage problem.
At the moment, on the corporate website 35 bodies put out to tender.
"It is very difficult to vakante positions to be filled."
"It costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way to contact on the Uni-Professoren.
Solar World cooperates with different universities, such as the university in free mountain.
"The professors give indications that we work placements or his thesis write."
Expensive advertising campaigns for solar experts are not needed.
The company is looking for other benefits to promote: Personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"This can often do not offer a large group," says Stübe chief of staff.
Money is no longer confined to the main role.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good career opportunities are other key factors.
Solar World showed in a study of the Great Place to Work Institute the 55th place among the 100 best employers of Germany.
The institute produced an annual list of best German employers.
It staff asked how satisfied they are with their work and their Jobumfeld and look at the conditions for the people.
Staff head Stübe hopes of the placement Jobsuchenden also in the plus points.
"I think that the candidates especially after external assessments on a potential employer look at," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Germans Employer branding academy advises companies with a long-term strategy to be a good reputation as an employer want to build.
He advises his clients to more authenticity.
And that means, under the Kriegler, particularly internal measures.
"The best way to make it more attractive as an employer, on their own staff," he says.
In industry jargon the internal Employer branding, so employers brands education within their own workforce.
"Satisfied staff are the best ambassadors."
If its people do well and they identify with the companies, they would naturally to friends and acquaintances for their employers.
"It is a game with a gang," said Kriegler.
Obama stop new drilling
US-Bundesstaats off the coast of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the next few years there will be no new oil drilling.
The government has a similar ban in Washington - and therefore definitively revoke its earlier plans.
Even before new drilling along the Atlantic coastline will remain for the time being.
This told Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban that for at least the next five years, is the explosion of Bohrplattform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the disaster, which claimed the lives of 11 workers and the world's biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had led to pressure from the opposition and the industry is its willingness to new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Advocates want the extent of US dependence on foreign oil.
Who was responsible for the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf, is still not finally resolved.
At the heart of the criticism of the British energy group BP, which is faced with billions of demands.
An investigation commissioned by Obama during the December 2008 to submit their results.
In October, Home Secretary Ken Salazar the Bohrstopp imposed after the explosion.
After various oil companies had immediately applications for new Bohrvorhaben.
With tighter control and stricter safety regulations to Obama and Salazar a new disaster.
At present, the competent authority, after numerous allegations of corruption, was in disrepute, radically reformed.
At the same time, Obama has announced that lucrative tax breaks for the oil and Gaskonzerne to close.
The industry warns now publicly that the output in the Gulf by a stricter regulation that would be substantially smaller than it is now.
"The government's plans are the biggest obstacle to the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a recent industry survey by consultant BDO - before the Bohrverbot of Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complained about the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows what will happen with the regulation that is going to change."
Investment in new projects would be postponed until further notice, at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burnt
The water in the river is ölbraun, it looks very much as petrol stations: Billion litres of oil spills have the natural in Ogoniland in Nigeria.
People live by theft, corruption and illegal Ölkochen.
Celestine Akpobari thinks it is a good thing.
"Consuming you do," reassured the Ökoaktivist the journalists: "You still enough oily slime before the lens."

Now is the lazy river waters entirely dead.

On the journey through the river basins Mangrovensümpfe criss-crossed the full extent of the devastation is apparent.

"What has occurred here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari gloomy: "We live in constant threat to his health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The settlement area of the Ogoni is a controversial battleground for decades, more than 60 years ago, the first Explorateure from Europe, are organised in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa the first resistance, here in 1993 to Shell-Konzern his cease production because it was too dangerous for the oil workers.
Today, the company is yet to return after Ogoniland denied: While from the whole of the delta region of the three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 Bohrquellen and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines every day, more than two million barrels of the black gold, are being pumped the oil fields in Ogoniland, the corporation is too unstable the situation.
Every few hundred metres sticking stählerne Gestelle as fanciful sculptures from the water: "Christbäumchen" the heads of the boreholes much to zärtlich.
They are up to 50 years old, most korrodiert to the core.
Always promoting good-quality such a Bohrkopf, says Akpobari rinne, then a constant stream of crude oil into the water.
More than two billion litres, experts estimate that in 50 years, has flowed into the ecosystem of the Delta: Year after year, as is the amount of oil in the wreck of the super tanker, "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the sea off Alaska became one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Who should pay for the continuing ultimate environmental catastrophe is to blame, it will be argued.
During the Shell-Konzern sabotage and the organised Öldiebstahl for more than 90% of the pollution, see environmentalists berstende Bohrköpfe and lecke pipelines as the main culprit.
In Nigeria, Shell safety standards to significantly lower than would otherwise have been in the world, the usual US-Wissenschaftler Richard Steiner the company in 2008, the rate of defects of the lines was "much higher than elsewhere."
In one place, which from a distance as an abandoned, ölverschmierte open-air garage looks, from the mangroves characters: They are cluster naked ölverschmiert and right up to the neck.
Under one of the many cellars, sometimes with tubes, sometimes random scattered on the site, have come to identify a fire: An illegal small refinery.
In the barrel of crude oil on the fire, it will be several hours long, heated, explains Michael, the leader of the group.
First seen petrol through the pipes in the Auffangtopf spits, later, at the end of the pipeline, kerosene and diesel.
So Michael and produce four employees on a daily basis by up to four barrels of diesel à 300 litres: "This brings us 34,000 Naira a" - around 22 dollars.
The delta residents take advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state of black Africa.
Nigeria has a single refinery.
The nearly 40 euro cents per litre ridiculously low price of diesel oil can still undercut the illegal Kocher: Because they get their raw materials free of charge.
It comes from "Bunkerern" that the pipeline network across Ogoniland on tap: This is the way to go in the country, according to experts in the entire Niger Delta at least 16 million litres of crude oil per day.
Only a tiny portion of the raw materials, however, will be between stored illegally veredelt fill: The lion's share of the organised criminal networks, which also includes politicians and high-level military tankers and in command on the world market.
The debate on whether the environmental disaster more to the particular population or the over-liberal production due to the activist Akpobari for purely academic.
"The oil companies were not as invaders, and they would have the livelihoods of the fishermen not as thoroughly destroyed, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal mills."
Now is the relationship of the Ogoni especially for Shell but so destroyed that only a withdrawal of the group in question would be: 'Maybe some other nationalities are, of course, as the Chinese and better. "
There is Michael nervous.
"High time for her to disappear," says the muskulöse Ölmann.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
The illegal Ölveredler of the special unit of the armed forces, they are caught not arrest, but a painful bribes.
The mainly from the country's north to soldiers - as all Nigerians, from the raw material.
"This damn stuff has our country in every respect to the dog," says Akpobari brought.
Detectives discover dangerous construction defects in A380-Triebwerken
The A380 has obviously a big security problem.
Investigators have notgelandeten machine in the investigation of a possible construction defects discovered at a "catastrophic failure".
The airline Qantas will now sue the engine manufacturers.
The passengers had at the beginning of November the notgelandeten Qantas-Airbus appears to be much more luck than previously known: The Australian aviation safety authority in their investigation was a major safety problem with the engines of some A380-Maschinen established - and now warns against the possibility of construction defects.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: A Ölschlauchverbindung he could fatigue cracks and leaks produce, it said in a statement published Thursday by the ATSB of the authority.
This could have been "a catastrophic failure".
Affected engines by fear GMO-derived A380-Reihe in 20 aircraft.

The Australian airline now has legal action against the manufacturer of turbines in the UK.
They filed a complaint in an explanatory statement, Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which he further legal action against the company.
Qantas-Chef Alan Joyce said that his airline will damages for the incident at the beginning of November.
The fire in the engine parts had been solved and that the wings were damaged.
Fear has been an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the incident the world must now up to 40 engines to be replaced.
The Australian investigators had said they would continue to carry out safety tests on the Superjumbos with the affected train stations.
The safety recommendation was the result of a collaboration with fear, ATSB-Sprecher Martin Dolan said.
The safety issue is sufficiently important to all those affected have been informed.
After an emergency evacuation of Qantas-Maschine the airline had their A380-Flotte kept on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines has about three of its eleven A380 temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa changed when a A380 as a precautionary measure, the train station.

Thousands of dead mate
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand the verschütteten miners thought that after several explosions declared dead in a mine.
Still, the bodies could not be recovered because of the security situation in Unglücksschacht none-too-stable further.
Less than two weeks ago, it was in the Pike River mine near the town of Greymouth to a violent explosion.
29 miners, aged between 17 and 62 years ago have been killed in days.
A probe into the Unglücksschacht was descending, but had been left there is no sign of survivors.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases, and other subsequent explosions were for security reasons, no rescue workers descending rise.
After the second violent explosions were the authorities and experts on the assumption that there is no chance of survival for the sidekick more.
The bodies have not been recovered.
Family and friends now commemorated with a memorial ceremony for the dead.
Ten thousand people have had radioactive sunshine in Greymouth on the southern island of New Zealand.
They were silent for two minutes.
In honor of the miners were verschütteten 29 tables, on which helmets, lamps and the names of the sidekick.
Also pictures and personal belongings, including clothes and Surfbretter here, found its place.
In front of the government buildings in the country flying the flags on halbmast.
New Zealand have hoped that the miners' from the depths of the earth "would come back to the surface, said the New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants of the ceremony.

Rescue workers started a fire in the heartland of the coal plant on the southern island of New Zealand to take it down.
As soon as the explosive gases, will drive started the fervent temperatures inside the mine herunterzukühlen, said police President Gary Knowles to journalists.
To hell, warriors.
Splatter fit for the art of cinema?
The director Nicolas Refn is testing, with its winding Kämpfer-Epos Walhalla "Rising" old Genre-Grenzen new.
To what audience may the Danish director Nicolas Refn winding than he could have imagined, "Rising Walhalla, revolved around"?
A captured Wikinger-Krieger with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) exempt themselves from his Peinigern and places with almost superhuman forces rushed to his opponents - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, it is because our hero like rough killing methods and his enemies to Gedärme from the vibrant physical, if he has a bad mood.
On the other hand, says Einauge, as he is called, indeed, the whole film about a word, and the other characters are on, at most, one or two sentences or shout a few painful death.
Otherwise, it will be silent and the gruselig beautiful hill landscape of Scotland geschwelgt the Wikingerwelt of about a thousand years, to the scene.
Ideal for adult Cineasten with interest for Existentialismus and very calm camera journeys.
Nice if a film has several target groups, it is a shame, if they are mutually exclusive.
Orchestrator winding Refn, since his wild and gestylten Drogendealer-Trilogie "Pusher" as a sort of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, refuses stoically his works, but with a little more humour the mainstream or something less brutality the Arthouse accessible.
Most art films friends are around the mass and the Gedärmen spritzenden brain to be deterred.
The Action-Fans at least we will die from boredom when Einauge from free interpretierbaren reasons with a force of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem; and an eternity in the doldrums and fog before the team is apparently in America, are still and silent.
No wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising" in Germany, no cinema lending, and now only on DVD.
This is particularly because of the magnificent images of a shame, but also because the prätentiösen until bluttriefenden facade hiding a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
In this film, it is not about the dialogues or a stringent action, it is all atmosphere, a film, attributed a fever dream.
And there is no means of escape for the viewer.
Refn hardly takes him a moment of relaxation and drawn images of him, with its icy and the dark Trance-artigen Sound track the throats very slowly, but above all with the incredible hatred of him from the heart of the characters badge.
Only a small boy, the blonder Einauge faithful to the side, does preserve something as innocent, all the others are driven by anger.
The vast majority of the one-eyed man hero, whose motives are never explained, but for enemies temporary allies and at some point will the Warriors from hell, to the Ambassador of the devil.
It means destruction, but perhaps only for the already verdorbenen.
Walhalla "Rising" is a more puzzling film, which we hate, and admire the angry, upset and surprise.
An eerie experience.
Mysterious Erdarbeiten
The International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country, however, refuses to comment on that - nor is it controls.
At about midnight on 5 to 6 September 2007 at least four Israeli F-15 Ι fighter-planes a mysteriöses, würfelförmiges building in Syria.
It is on the banks of the Euphrates, the next major city, 30 miles away, is Dair as-Saur.
Her name appears in documents to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), when it comes to the reactor, which Syria allegedly with help from North Korea in the Quader built hidden in a valley of the electricity.
According to a briefing of the US-Auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA at the end of April 2008 would be the under the name of the nearest town el-Kibar normal reactor have been well placed to produce plutonium, which can build nuclear weapons.
For other purposes, however, the technology is hardly in the fifties.
The CIA ran a video presentation with fuzzy satellite images.
They ignored by Computeranimation, where the components of the reactor before the destruction, of a verkleinerte copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyong nuclear centre.
Moreover, it presented photographs of the buildings in the vicinity, or even the indoor show.
The reactor was shortly before the beginning of the operation, it said, but not yet with Brennstäben peppers.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more than it was then, of course, the mystery with the time were more likely to be greater.
Former President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA before the attack is fairly sure that Syria had built a reactor in el-Kibar, but little evidence that it is in the country, "an active nuclear weapons programme.
Some intelligence officers in Europe are even more cautious and prefer to speak only of an "alleged reactor," even if the CIA-Präsentation for "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how certain he was a reactor, said to have a high UN-Diplomat only flat in the summer, the IAEA "has enough material to ask questions".
The rubble of the alleged "unused military building" the Syrians eager to one side and planierten the site thoroughly.
However, it took place in June 2008, a IAEA-Team under former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by people.
Moreover, the IAEA on a Member State commercial providers of satellite images from the period directly after the attack, which is likely to be more powerful than the CIA.
The recordings, however, are not on the market, because of the unknown mandator - perhaps Israel - they bought the exclusive.
The IAEA can therefore not independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that never run a secret nuclear programme or to have built a nuclear reactor.
The uranium has come from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus.
But it pointed out the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely.
Damascus since then refuses to discuss the issue - as well as on the satellite images.
In addition, the inspectors were denied a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the rubble of bombed-out building.
But Israel is sticking.
"We will not comment on", confirmed recently the time of the attack on the office of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position.
So the investigation of the case has been dragging on since June 2008 in vain and "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the agency," as a senior Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna for - there is, after all, a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the IAEA.
As key to making progress in the investigation, the IAEA apparently three more bodies, the "functional link" with the alleged reactor will be different than this - and still exist.
In doing so, the inspectors have not disclosed what facilities they are, or what they are or what they appear to be suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they will have to the IAEA and internally Marj as-Sultan Masyaf Iskandariayah, and that, in turn, are derived from nearby towns.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS advises) has identified these locations and a complex satellite images identified in Masyaf where it is most likely to be one of the suspicious objects.
It is probably in or adjacent to a military base, this is precisely what grounds Syria denied the IAEA access to the three locations.
It is in Vienna that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will vorgeschickt by the United States military installations auszuspähen.
Because the nuclear detectives were the result of a tip of the US intelligence services to discover the bodies.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos that, between the three locations and the Quader the Euphrates material was moved back and forth.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna, said that at least one of the facilities could "in connection with the fuel production".
"But there is no evidence of sensitive activities," uranium enrichment or reprocessing and processes which are required to build nuclear weapons.
Is the type of reactor with enriched uranium, which is not.
But where the uranium could have come from, and where it later the plutonium for the bomb should be separated, these central issues there are only plausible assumptions.
It is also unclear whether the valuable pieces of debris, could carry traces of the three places were stored.
As if the hundreds of truck loads of the disappeared, no one wants to have information on where the debris.
Only a few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, salt mine al-Tibni, the Syria 1998 to their suitability as a camp for radioactive waste has investigated, the IAEA as unlikely.
Robert Kelley, a former IAEA-Inspektor it was, in a recent analysis of satellite images on the venerable magazine Jane's Intelligence Review in contact with the reactor.
Footage from the orbiting but show that Syria in the three suspect sites Erdarbeiten and large container distant, after the IAEA access had requested.
This can hardly be a coincidence, but it has helped to dispel the suspicion.
Furthermore, it is said in diplomatic circles, have spent many months, the IAEA, in a plan for inspections to develop, it should allow Syria to preserve any military secrets - of the effort shows how much interest the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damascus bügelte this one too.
Still, Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago, to appease the reactor was destroyed, therefore, have no great urgency of the matter is, for example, US Ambassador Glyn Davies for a couple of months' special inspections of the game, one of the harshest means Vienna nuclear authority to control.
IAEA-Chef Yukiya Amano, these inspections should propose, has been of "an option, for which I am open in the future, however, is reluctant to talk about it.
It is a high risk in this way: On the one hand, it needs to ensure a majority of the board of governors of the IAEA, and several of the 35 countries represented there are anything other than eager for an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat to bear in mind: "What if they find nothing at all, in the end?"
In times of war and
For Angelina Jolie in the summer with the work of the still nameless stage debut has begun, there is trouble.
The script she has even written a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
Not much more we know about it - but even that is enough for alarm.
The myth persists that the woman, a Muslim, Verliebe during the Jugoslawien-Krieges in her Serb rapist.
Bosnian women's groups immediately protested in Sarajevo, after which some planned Drehtage in the short term, have been transferred to Hungary.
In the meantime, the film in Hungary and marginalised in the post production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female victims of war, wrote about the UN-Flüchtlingshilfswerk UNHCR of Jolie and asked for a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper, has now told the ambassador, Jolie is even UN-Flüchtlingshilfswerks.
Diplomatically, it is not, she has taken the women to a few weeks ago at a meeting in Hungary, which rejected the offer, though.
The meeting should take place in Bosnia, Hasecic.
Love stories in rape camps have not been, and Jolie attitude towards the victims - her enough on the script.
Her organisation has recommended the UN-Flüchtlingshilfswerk Jolie as ambassador, according to the Guardian, reported.
But what exactly has Jolie for scenes written?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture to read the script was, after some to-ing and fro-ing a Drehgenehmigung Sarajevo for granted, it is not clear, however, was not then why Jolie.
The young author even claimed that they do not follow the political intentions with the film, is said to be in a lot of trouble in the Jugoslawien-Konflikt incorporated wanted the terrible consequences of the war, and show to give a voice to all the parties involved.
The content, however, remains vague.
So a second Synopsis circulating on the film in the network, which then but rather different sounds: The lovers already knew from war to break out, and, when they are, a Bosnian Muslim, in a Serbian Camp abducted, where he works as a guard.
Which is considerably different sounds when the variant verknallt "rape victims in torturer."
That Jolie film actually starts before the war - that much is sure.
The pressure on them, as Jolie, was "unfair and is based on misleading information."
Now, they can only the hackers of Hollywood: Make peace by the script, like so many before it, is illegal to be put on the Web.

The predictions come true, if there is a migration wave comparable with those under the Ireland in the 1980s, suffered.
After a decade of boom, the great prosperity for the Irish, is now widely us again.
The economic crisis throws in particular the young, well-educated Irish, for which it has so far been only going up.
Jobverlust and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.

The demokatrische routine
The movement for democracy in Latin America will be stronger, as the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region is the influence of Brazil larger than that of the United States.
These results came the Latinobarómetro-Umfrage in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey will be carried out on a regular basis since 1995 and it shows that the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are in this year's poll in September and October, particularly in 's eye.
First, the good mood in Latin America
And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions.
In many Latin American countries on the Pacific coast, has greatly increased in the democratic movement (s table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy since 2002 to around 6% a year, the number of advocates of democracy from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
In Mexico, where the economy has been the sharp fall in the last year, the recovery is such a trend.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries of the region, are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average (s diagram 2).
Some 44% of the respondents stated that they will be satisfied with their country's democratic practice, which is as much as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (graph 3).
Some 34 percent trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values are those of last year, however, show a marked increase over 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago, Latin American economic crisis undermined the efforts for more democracy.
Also during the global economic crisis continued, perhaps, is the fact that the countries of Latin America experienced only a brief recession and a speedy recovery.
Furthermore, the poor by a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America this week, 2009, the poverty rate in Latin America, only slightly and is again this year by 32%.)
But from country to country, there is a strong mood differences (s graph 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread step forward thinking.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was much more tangible and violent crimes have increased, it is less the case.
For only the second time since the start of the survey, see many respondents in Latin America in the crime in their country is a bigger problem than in the diagram s unemployment (5).
Some 31% say that either they or a family member in the last year have been victims of a crime, but compared to 38% in the last year, are the values have fallen, reaching the lowest level since 1995.
The rising economic performance is reflected in the increase in support of the family and the market economy: Around 71% of respondents on regional said that the private sector is essential for development in 2007, there were 56% (s graph 6).
Some 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress their country, compared with 47% in the last year.
Interestingly, 62% of those polled in Venezuela this view maintained (and 80% are in favour of a private sector), though their leftist President, Hugo Chávez, many private enterprises nationalised.
Brazil has under 19% of the respondents (18% in the last year) the biggest force in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9%, compared with 11% in the past year).
The respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, on the other hand, see the most influential country in the United States, with a role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela.
An electoral defeat
No one had expected that the elections on 28 November in Haiti would be perfect.
But the facts, the fears of election workers who rushed to the aid of the beleaguered country.
Overcrowding in polls, several votes cast, election notes in Rinnstein, polling stations and intimidation were only a part of the problems.
Polling stations opened late with long hours.
Many Haitians, many of whom are displaced by the earthquake in January, have been wandering around in search of a choice.
Some finally gave in.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected top runner, as a result of an alleged fraud, the removal of the election results.
Across the country, there have been some violent protests.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, which is a very good choice "in many respects".
According to a cautious statement from observers of the Organisation of American States and the Caribbean Community "these irregularities, so serious it may be, the process is not necessarily unlawful".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, the supposedly the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jew Célestin, is obliged, will announce preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected run-off is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidate Michel Martelly Rap-Musiker Mirlande Manigat and the former First-Lady, have withdrawn their initial void complaint.
If Jew Célestin, with voters little or no support from the Wahlberhörde the winner of the run-off, said this could lead to problems.
Because of the cholera epidemic, and the fact that more than 1 million of the victims of the earthquake are still living in tents, was a low turnout.
On election day, many Haitians by poor organisation of the vote.
Shortly before the start of the election were approximately 250,000 cards to the election will be needed, not yet been distributed.
There is much at stake.
The donor countries consider a legitimate and recognised government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
In the middle is secretly
In the weeks after the sudden death of a man who was told Argentina's President, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy that their popularity rate by 20 points to over 50%. This is the highest value since its election in 2007.
If it does, however, in the next year to get re-elected, depends on whether the compromise is visibly trauernde Cristina Fernández and her late husband, her predecessor, Néstor Kirchner and political partner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who was also his wife, after the election, the economic policy, was often budgets, tax revenue, economic growth and inflation are not fully into account.
This allowed the presidential couple, the extra income to spend as they see fit.
On paper the Fernández-Regierung lost in the past year the majority in Congress.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October, leading to further Zerwürfnissen.
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling Peronisten were behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (in which a member of a different face, and others accused the government of corruption, not the Congress, the budget for 2011.
"I am not going to discuss it," the President.
The 2010 budget is now for the next year, allowing the President more opportunity to spend money as they see fit.
The economy is likely to be disputed: This year by up to 9%.
The official inflation rate, at 11.1% z.Z., but many private estimates - and wage demands of the unions, pushing the value to nearly 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the post in 2003, when Argentina was beset by economic crises, growth and poverty reduction to its key objectives, and not lowering inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, the private sector and säuberte singled out for bullying as the National Institute for Statistics and census INDEC, the official inflation statistics schönte.
Fernández now can we take?
It has private business and union leaders to talks.
According to official statements and wage increases over the next year to 18%.
The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products, has given a strong boost to the economy.
But the growth spurt the inflation undermined by a large devaluation in 2002.
Cristina Fernández would probably why Argentina financial economically back to the rest of the world to follow suit.
At the beginning of this year, the Government made an agreement with holders of the securities, the earlier restructuring of the country in 2001, had rejected.
Fernández now appears on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, which it owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have had a review by the IMF, as is usual elsewhere, always rejected.
But last month, the economy minister, Amado Boudou know that the fund is in the process of drafting a new national consumer price index "technical support". It looks as if this is the first step in cleansing the INDEC.
It is not known whether Mr Fernández after the end of their term even without the support of her husband will be politically active.
If so, it needs to get the support of the middle class, which has largely enough of Kirchnerism.
If the Argentinians in March from their summer holidays, is to return to the wave of Sympatie it was, fizzled.
If they want to win another election, it must decide whether to many political decisions her husband quietly lifted.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly a closer connection to the mainland.
What is Taiwan by its big brother across the Strait?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the electorate, to in the five districts of city mayors and city councils, and this is to choose a broad assessment of the President Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the development of cutting-edge business relations, einschl. a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbolic figure for relations with the mainland, and its policy has the relationship with the mother country for the first time since 1949, lasting changes.
Ma has the test, but only barely.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT), three of the five mayors, it received a majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has a greater independence for Taiwan, almost 50% of the votes, the KMT was 45%.
In a presidential election, it would have for Ma problems.
Since his election two years ago, the share of the votes of his party by approximately 8%.
For the first time, indeed, the DPP, coupled with the KMT in the city councils.
During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as convoys of lorries with Krawallmachern, Flaggen-schwenkende mass parades and only scantily clad dancers.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT held on the eve of the election, a speech at a KMT-Kandidaten
When he was a man out of the deal in the face of schoß was wounded and a lien and umstehender spectators were killed.
Bizarre wiser is not clear whether the shooter Lien kill or settle a dispute with the candidates.
Regardless of the attack, according Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the election and the DPP in a bad light, as the KMT has brought more votes.
China may have been the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland was not raised.
Instead, the candidates debated on plans to social housing and the creation of jobs.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence, and China "s military threat.
For this reason, the KMT their relations with the government in Beijing is not like to be in the forefront.
But this time, the DPP, also steered clear of the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
They reacted to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy without China cannot survive.
Ma, in turn, would not confirm that the majority of Taiwanese its China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy, Taiwan with economic incentives to attract in the community.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei for a summit to investment security and medical collaboration.
Certainly it also wants a political integration, but the most important thing first.
So it is better to wait until after the presidential elections in 2012.
The DPP has now reinvented.
Two years ago, she has been greatly weakened, the former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he was strongly for the complete independence.
But under Tais reign has developed a new generation of gemässigter politicians and the DPP is fighting for the votes of the professionals and the young.
Tsai of the DPP took place as a presidential candidate, Su Tseng-chang great approval under Chen.
Their party is doing everything to show that it is also in a position to build close relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning a think tank as a point of contact between the DPP and China. This, however, presupposes open-minded discussion.
Tsai said publicly that their party "will offer a" credible alternative to massage vorschneller rapprochement with China.
Chen seems very angry about this change.
From his cell, he said of the candidates, the DPP would have done better to Taiwan's independence.
He called for the pragmatists Su even to the presidential candidacy.
Chen also without interference is the DPP difficult to their possible candidate to choose.
The KMT will own analysis of their own.
Ma's values are bad, in spite of rapid economic growth; the KMT-Kandidaten wanted their election campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor.
According to the testimony of a KMT-Sprechers his Cabinet, he will, as well as the local facilities.
The strong presence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is a rapprochement only restricted.
At the same time, the majority of Taiwanese economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is a point of no return".

He will in the Billy Childs Emsemble with his Kammer-Jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his Oktett, whose Life-Ablum "pathways" a good example of a Bassisten as a democratic band leader.

Mosque in Temecula wins approval of the planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula five hours, often took place after a heated public hearing the unanimous approval by the local planning committee.
Critics accused the project, both terrorism and traffic jams.
But according to a statement from the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre of the local rules and will be an aesthetic catch-the-eye.
"The project is being supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, that makes me proud."
"It shows that justice prevails".
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"They are just very loud".
"In this valley live wonderful people."
The meeting began at 18: 00 and the discussions for and against the building of the centre, which lasted until almost midnight, the voices on both sides, according Press-Enterprise were fairly evenly distributed.
The debate was on the website of the newspaper to go.
"There is no America more," a comment.
"It is a different planet of the apes and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand".

Arsen-resistente microbe could new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere permit
The discovery of an alien variety of bacteria, among other things, of arsenic can opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists this unusual bacterium here on earth, in their view, it is a sign that a life without the previously deemed vital elements is possible.
"This body has two ways. '
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic."
"That makes it a very particular reason, even though there are almost a sort of 'alien' way of life is," said C.W. Paul Davies of Arizona State University and Co-Autor of the report on Thursday, in the Online-Ausgabe the journal Science.
So far, there have been six main elements as vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But the scientists figured out how to grow the bacterium in the Californian mono Lake even further, if it has replaced by arsenic.
"One wonders what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar Co-Autor of the report by the Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for life, as scientists außerirdischem life and his forms need to be able to see, in Anbar.
The study, which deals with microbes on Earth have been found.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report by the discovery Außerirdischen life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planet systems organisms, with the help of other elements biochemical processes can set in motion, and that the 'standard' elements that, in our opinion, is absolutely vital, not necessarily see are imposed," said Mr Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute held University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a first, because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures an element can be replaced by another," added Cockell.
The discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon Astrobiologischen Institute by NASA, which led the study, chose the mono Lake because of the high levels of arsenic.
As arsenic and phosphorus chemically same, that microbes that both are exposed, may be a factor in the other place.
"The toxicity of Arsens is based primarily on the fact that there is a similar situation such as phosphorus chemically".
"It is thus, an element of the organisms is difficult to distinguish from the other."
"But the difference is so large that arsenic different acts as phosphorus, enter our biochemisches system, where it covered almost everything," says Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 a rising arsenic concentration, it suited to and grew.
The microbe is growing in phosphorus better, but also that they can survive in arsenic, shows that a Arsen-basierte life form can happen, of course, either on the ground or on another planet or moon, on the arsenic more.
According to Jamie S. Foster, Dozentin for microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic, not new, but so far there has been no functioning example.
Arsenic was more common in the early Erdjahren, she says, it is for this reason that the science on the assumption that early life forms of it have been used.
"There is reason to believe that life may have developed different than the early Erdzeitalter," Forster in Wolfe-Simons, not a member of the research team.
The research, by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National health authorities.

The lion brüllt return to judicial authorisation of MGM-Umstrukturierung
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty MGM was finally given the green light for a new start.
A New-Yorker bankruptcy judges began on Thursday to prepare for the "offiziel Gläuberplan" the debt to the tune of $5 billion to repay and the 86-jährigen entertainment businesses to pave the way for new films and TV shows.
Thursday, according to the statements of the plan met the requirements of the US-Konkursrechts, so that the relaunch of MGM led by Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, founders of Spyglass entertainment, nothing stands in the way of the Barber and Birnbaum, a slimmed-down studio as chief executive officer.
Staff numbers will be over 400 to around 320 reduced.
For MGM Chapter 11, in fact, comes into force when JPMorgan Chase a proposed loan of $500 million to fund the new MGM-Produktionen has been completed.
At the moment, is leading a consortium of the investment bank, the $75 million, the company, which is funding up to the middle of December.
The restructuring of the studios began in May 2009, with the mandate to the investment bank Moelis & Co, the management of companies with interest payments of $300 million per year, in the solution to their financial problems.
In August, the CEO Harry Sloan replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, through his work with Krispy Kreme Doughnuts became known.
The efforts of Moelis & Cooper, the financial worries MGMs and more than 140 Gläuber auszubezahlen the studios, went on longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties at the end of 2009, to offer to buy the company.
But the auction drew only a few bidders and no one wanted to the creditors of the $2 billion required to pay.
In the spring of this year, and all started from the MGM-Team began with the restructuring plan, after months of debate and infighting at the end of October, the creditors have been signed.
If MGM bankruptcy in the next few weeks, has now officially given Moelis and Cooper for their work a bonus of several million dollars.
The proportion of Moelis & Co. already have received $1.2 million, to $9.5 million.
Cooper, which, for the management of the company has been paid $375.000 a month, a "success" received a bonus of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio just a film editor, and an annual plan drawn up with seven or eight films that were in the cinema at the start of 2012.
They also are planning two films after "The small Hobbit" with Warner Bros. Co-Produktion
The studio needs a separate bond between $265 million to $275 million for his financial share of these two films, will be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, about 18% of MGM-Darlehens funded the studios sought a merger with Lions Gate entertainment, whose largest shareholder is.
But the recent negotiations between the two companies has led to any outcome.

Unfortunately, however, it would also not be Mr Son Scarlett, the poor image that the Chinese of this city, commandos have to improve.
With legal, according to the critics.
Unlike the police, officials from the urban laws only by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in the province of Hubei beat a bystander to death, as this, with his mobile phone, as they filmed in a protest campaign against a dumping ground.
Last year was a training manual of Beijing officials stolen and posted on the Internet. This will describe how criminals without bloodshed can be beaten.
This year, suffered a Shanghai Wassermelonenhändler five officials after a Handgemenge with brain injuries.
A video game violence strotzendes that can be downloaded from the Internet, shows in China have trained officers in an attack on street traders.
"Guan Chen makes the government fear" lamentierte, the national newspaper China Daily last year, after further controversy about the tactics.
The newspaper called for a "thorough cleansing."
Sceptics are the current approach is clearly inadequate.
As the Distrik in October by the board were eight female recruits, a Editorial in the Beijing Evening News the question of whether the women had real tasks or only as optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to the board to have been women at the age of 18 to 22 with a good figure and "harmonious face trains".
They should be big - on average 1,5m or 5 feet, 2 1 / 2 customs.
The employment relationship ends by the age of 26 life year.
According to the officials, the activity for women over 25 to physically demanding.
"The most important is their image," a unbenannter district official with the almost government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates to get the job on the first of their appearance, such as size, weight, features, etc."
Then temperament and 'Home qualities ".
"Women are like Guan Chen put," he said and added that "but beyond that, they still have other duties".
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the city government of the southern, would not agree to this description
But that was in China sizes in advertisements for affects both sexes are not unusual.
The same is true for uniform features.
Whether with good looks, in China is controversial.
But people with disabilities or physical changes need not apply.
"Unfortunately, we could not use or Buckligen go," Mr Zheng.
"Their image would not be a good idea."
Liu Yi at the close of a monastery patroliert Baoguang-Platz, 22, has Apfelbäckchen reasons, and a mouth.
They empfindetes not as sexist that so much emphasis on her appearance.
"You will find that I see in this uniform sexy?" She wonders with ironischem moment.
Her colleague with the Grübchen, the 21-year Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their figures, the brief does not regret it, because they have more ambitious career plans than simply dealers through the alleys, in order to prosecute them in the business.
Each morning deals the some remarks with some 12 street hawkers who try, on foot or on bicycle, as many as possible of the rolls and Tofugerichte continuing to sell before they are hunted.
"Mr Wang to disappear, you would ask."
"We have said so often you!" A trader said. Xu Frl, who fled on foot and was his on a Fahrradkarre befestigten Nudelküche had temporarily left out in the cold.
According to the officials, the work rather than become monotonous hard work.
"It is almost the same thing every day," says Huang Jing, 20, in the distribution system.
"All routine."
One reason is that the female servants the goods of merchants not confiscate, as their male colleagues.
They can only criminals to threaten her male superiors to report.
This is to protect them from public hostility, officials in China have been subjected to often.
This year rioted outside hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, after the rumour circulated throughout Chengguan-Beamte, a dealer would have been killed.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan-Beamte were injured in the night of the incident, 14 were undermined government vehicles or set on fire.
Xindu remained of such violent incidents so far been spared.
But troubles are not be ruled out.
Just two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang-Platz the female officers this morning patroulierten, about 50 people gathered at a street corner.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle, contrary to the rules on the pavement, rather than in a garage been repaired.
The owner shouted screamed blue.
After 15-minütigem hesitation gave the officials with cruel point the way to their cars and drove with the motorcycle and his owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male some remarks, and he has remained in the back of his white name tag, in order to remain anonymous.
Like her colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - a strictly supporting role.
But they have not been trained, a clean image.
"Sometimes we go with words".
"Sometimes but also physically," says Mr Li in perspective.
"Most of the time, do people with the dispute."
Prosecutor will not denounce Senator Ensign
Prosecutors, the Ministry of Justice have Senator John Ensign acquitted of the charges which, in his case with a former Wahlhelferin and his attempt to her husband a lobbying to be filed against him, the lawyers of the senator on Wednesday.
The decision brought to an end the worst legislative success against Senator Ensign, Republican of Nevada, and up to the scandal, the nationwide headlines and was a drubbing of his career, he was seen as a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensigns office announced that he was on the sentence after the year-long investigation "delighted".
The ethics committee of the Senate, could, however, still a Disziplarstrafe impose.
Ensigns lawyers say that they have been informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign have been cancelled and that in this matter, no further charges.
The Ministry of Justice did not comment on the case.
The judgment was for many Ethik-Anwälte outside the Ministry of Justice as a surprise; they think there is sufficient evidence that the Lobbying-Verbot Ensign has ignored.
Interviews, emails and other documents, for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times have been revealed, has led to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of the election workers, helped to lucrative contracts for his silence on a dossier with Hamptons wife Cynthia to buy.
Cynthia Hampton was during an election campaign Ensigns as treasurer.
Ensign, contact some political friends to Hampton work. According to the documents and interrogations took for them to lobby the Hamptons.
Since Hampton recently in Ensigns election team was, it was a year, he was not lobbying for his former employers or accept the whole Senate.
According to a statement from Ethik-Experten breached the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton before the dossier, chummy, against the so-called Drehtür-Lobbykratie the ban.
In accordance with the published evidence, "it seems to be a conspiracy and breaching the Drehtür-Statuten," Stanley fire, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients in the sights of the government.
While the Justice Department formally rejected it, the reasons for the decision to announce the Ensign-Fall, said Mr. fire and other ethics lawyers, the department seems to be very cautious in rather political charges after a multitude of failures by the media followed with a great deal of interest, including the decision last year, the case against the former Senator Ted Stevens because of misconduct on the part of the public prosecutor.
Prosecutors "are obviously scared detention," said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the association, "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organisation, which aims to combat corruption in parliament and government circles in the United States), a group of lawyers, the various charges against Mr. Ensign brought before the courts.
"This means that, in general, high-profile government officials now assume that the law does not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, the main defenders of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had a telephone call on Monday, a prosecutor, and another the next day, where he was told that the department does not levy charges against his clients.
Mr. Ensigns defender had cooperated with prosecutors, in order to convince them that the senator as his office, in a statement on Wednesday, again repeated, "in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins refused, the legal arguments which he had presented to prosecutors, to explain.
"I think it is not in the details of the conversation between the Ministry of Justice, and I just want to go, and, we believe, to have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided that the investigation of a separate appeal by the group, after the payment of $96,000 of Mr. Ensigns parents to the Hamptons against the federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said that there was not enough evidence that anything other than the money was a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, which for a long time, the Senator was one of the firms, in which Mr. Hampton, thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign Lobbyisten-Arbeit took place.
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that, since the company has helped Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, a conversation with Mr. Hampton had him, in which he said that he, the Interior Ministry because of a cause "anklopfe."
Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and other customers for Nevada, and Allegiant Air, agreed to lunch and asked the transport minister, in a meeting in the name of the airline, to reconcile after Mr. Hampton for lobbying had stopped.
Last year, for the first time, information about this case, Medellín apologize to the public, Mr. Ensign was in his constituents and his position in the Senate, where he is in the ranking of Republicans in fourth place.
After many months, he no longer was struck two weeks ago, Mr. Ensign told reporters that he has a third term in the Senate, would like to see.
In an announcement that Mr. Ensign no longer the target of police inquiries, said his press spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, the senator hope that the Ethics Commission quickly follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and its investigations unit once.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to his hard work in the service of the people of Nevada to continue," she said.
Cheshire-Berufung power on Twitter closely
Tippten half a dozen of them in the row in the courtroom.
In the minutes of tact verschickten it on Twitter their reports about grey cent witness statements.
In the end, such as the defence, there were more than 140,000 Twitter-Meldungen on the process in order to rape and beds gekettete children in a house, the flare-up.
On Thursday, the closely followed process of Steven J. Hayes, was accused of three members of a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, to have killed an official end to the ruling on the death sentence, the panel has said.
But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already submitted applications to court to explain the grounds for appeal and the courts in years to come.
Most provocative one of the reasons is that the intense coverage of the process, but also by the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - to a "circus" atmosphere and such a widespread, instant penetration rebel details come, so that the jury was improperly influenced by public outrage.
This protest might encourage Appelationsgerichte to deal with the question of whether the new technologies necessary new rules in the court room.
"As I have seen during this process, I think that it really is a danger, when the arrival of new technologies in the courtroom every individual" s right to a fair trial, "said Thomas J. influenced Ullman, Mr. Hayes main defenders.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue House, rejected by the Supreme Court last week, applications by referendum, succinct and when he said that the new media would be "carefully monitored", and that there is no proof that the jury had been driven by passions.
But this was certainly not the last word on this matter.
For decades, about a court found that the reporting on notorious cases doubt on the fairness of the process.
In his historic decision by 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, a osteopaths from Cleveland, is to have his wife killed, and said in his ruling that it was because of the new media "Karnevalsatmosphäre in the courtroom".
Some believed that the television and the movie "On the flight" based on this crime.
Some lawyers say, court judgments, what Mr. Hayes veroordeling half a century later, the argument might be that new rules are necessary, and with the channels of communication from the courtroom at the time of the case, Dr Sheppard were unimaginable.
"There is a good reason, about the impact of the new media in trials, which will be followed by a general public to be concerned about," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut, according to his report, will they arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some Appelationsgerichte could be intrigued by the idea that restricting a prompt communication from the courtroom, could make the process fair.
The Twitter-Angelegenheit is just one of the many lawyers of Mr. Hayes, in order to discuss for years to come, and a condemnation of war.
The defenders argue, for example, that Mr. Hayes might have been already explanation, judge Blue not to allow them, the reactions of potential judges to test them by while the Jurorenauswahl grey cent scene photos showed.
Some of the judges said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and their Tüchter, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years, they would have been met with revulsion.
The defenders say they are also the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution into question, and argue that the judge wrongly a jury have exchanged views, a critic of the department, and that he was improperly exerted pressure on the ruling, as he had the unusual decision was made by the panel to free over the weekend.
The judges were not isolated.
But their arguments about the impact of the extensive coverage of the process is perhaps the greatest interest.
In a judgment, the challenge that they have tabled last month, made it clear that the case has dominated the news in Connecticut, and during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the American Senate candidate was discussed.
They argued that the new media constantly the flames of the emotions on the case would be reopened.
"Such a daily crush of Medienpiepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "has previously in New Haven and maybe even nationwide," not yet seen.
Their focus to the reporting by Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that the direct messages are rabble-rousing but more slowly than reports which are reimbursed, a technology hostile view is that the report on future processes verarme.
But some lawyers said, were often Appelationsgerichte with the argument, social and technological changes need the Adaptation through the courts.
Mr. Hayers lawyers step up this assertion.
In her appeal, she referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in 1966, in which the conviction of Dr Sheppard because of the reporting has been lifted and made it clear that the new media, new rules require.
"This case," they wrote, "Sheppard represents against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy what divides us?
After a campaign to Schimpfwörtern and negativity is little courtesy this week in Washington.
It is the sign of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion, before it was quickly back to the struggle of the parties in the capital, returning?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Barack Obama and leaders of Congress produced no breakthrough on the big issues to be dealt with during the so-called "lame duck" session of the sitting at the end of a period of government in which no decisions had to be made to look.
After all, that is what we hear, it was either a polite discussion between two sides still a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a partisan collection points.
The public meeting of the deficit commission of the president on Wednesday was equally civilized, despite the political differences between the members to continue.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months can give a kind of mutual respect, the ideological divide that still divides members of concealing.
It is not enough to say that it was a new era of cooperation arrived.
Both sides are now in a test phase, in one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise, while you tried to the limits of public opinion and the patience of the electorate, according to a new parties warfare.
This was the meeting on Tuesday and his assessment by the participants on a minimum requirements or accusations limited.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep, and that there is a rapid change of atmosphere that prevailed in the past two years, might expect.
Whether it comes to taxes, donations, health or pension is, the two sides are miles apart.
Lastly, the November election Washington, at least for a short period of time, to say the least.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official of the Bush administration, which is now in the "Ethics and Public Policy Center," is working.
"It is inevitable after elections.
Elections give partisan passions, to die.
And that is a good thing. "
On some issues, particularly on those who will be on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution. "
Bush's tax cuts, at the end of the year, and no one in favour of it.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or all of it, either temporarily or permanently.
It is a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that, it believes, the favoured tax cuts for the rich, support unemployed workers while they refuse.
After the meeting on Tuesday at the White House is of the optimism has grown that these issues during the "lame duck" session and, at the same time, some of the New START Treaty, cannot ratify.
But William Glaston of Brookings Insitution warns that a successful cooperation on pressing issues of the lame duck session "to a lasting cooperation of the parties must, if the new 112. Congress will convene in January.
Instead, he says, is a period of not more than once immensely more likely, perhaps even necessary.
"After the things that are done that need to be done in the short term, it will shift the psychology in confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many, the courtesy to real cooperation.
"I see a lot of what is happening from here until 2012, as Vorkampf, or shadow boxing, for the main event in 2012," he said.
The reasons have a great deal to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House, and to do it with the Teeparty-Wählern, which have been instrumental in their education.
How worried the Republican leaders also may be that they have too high pokern, they know that they must try to their promise to cut government spending and the healthcare reform, to be adhered to.
This party lines are already in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which is a tax reform and raising some taxes, as well as raising the retirement age and reduce government spending.
The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles are one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have, according to their own assessment, insisted that the deficit issue on the public agenda that they could no longer be ignored.
But they need within the Commission 14 of the 18 votes with its plan to official recommendation and they are very much, too, just in the proximity of this figure.
The biggest resistance is the elected representatives of the body, as in financial issues, today at least, little room for compromise or little sympathy.
Galston says two stages of the battle between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first campaign will next year in the form of party clashes take place, if the Republicans Obama in terms of the budget of the state, the taxes and the health system, challenging then followed by a period of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation.
What will this change?
Public opinion.
It has been proved that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation at an impasse, as it happened in 1995, then both sides must look carefully at the public reaction.
Whoever the losers being condemned will change tack and seek compromises.
This may, in fact, a more optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are now greater than it is in the middle of the 1990's, and they seem a more ideological gap between Obama and the Kongress-Republikanern at the time to be between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the defenders of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a much broader consequences in the 2012 election.
Such courtesy may have seen the greatest display of this week, will be welcomed by many Americans.
On both sides, but it will be a great deal more effort, a common denominator in the issues that the two still separated.
Portrayed as Moscow Durchgesickertes US-Dokument port of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and they are a part of the bribes and the protection money they einsammelt, the Kremlin. As reported in February, the U.S. Embassy in Russia in a memo.
Both police and the state security services, protection money, ransom high with their expensive standard of living in Moscow, so it is claimed.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also by organised criminal gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy, and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as a "vertical line of power" - takes its part of the money that the head to the top.
The memo, which under the name of the Ambassador John Beyrle, has been sent to Washington on Tuesday published by WikiLeaks on its web site.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Moscow's mayor Yuri Luzhkov still was, and it accuses him of corruption.
In October, he was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is little evidence that, in the meantime, it would have been sorted out.
Luzhkov, and his wife, Yelena Baturina, a prominent construction company has over the years, have repeatedly rejected allegations of corruption, and he has a number of libel actions against such accusations.
In September he told a Russian TV channel, when he was asked after a documentary, which suggests that he was corrupt: "It is crazy, it is a bad way, it is cloudy."
Like A huge number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. The polls.
But it is unusual that, as the report of the Ambassador, individuals mentioned, and it is unheard of that one diplomat from a foreign country.
"The direct link to the government of Moscow with the crime has led some to describe it as" disturbing "and come to the conclusion that the government is rather like a Kleptokrat as a government," according to the memo.
"Criminal elements" kryshna enjoy a "(a term from the world of criminals / the Mafia, which literally" roof "or protection means), who, on the police, state security service (FSB), the regulator (MVD) and the office of the public prosecutor, as well as through cover the whole of the Moscow government bureaucracy.
Professionals have dreilagige structure in the criminal world with Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
FSB and MVD, "the militia are on the second stage".
"Least follow the ordinären criminals and the criminal inspectors at the bottom."
"This is a inkompetentes system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap because the city offered no assistance".
The report goes on to say that the FSB money from the largest firms and from which the police small business people were arrested.
A source said, "is that Moscow's business owner to understand that it is best for the protection of the FSB and MVD to get (and not by organised crime), because they are not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law."
"That is why the protection by criminal gangs no longer be required as it once was."
The memo notes that, while the collection of the money is fully protected, which itself is very modest, even those who do not pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay their business to find very quickly - on the basis of one or other Vorwands.
Medvedev has spoken on several occasions, to combat corruption, but at the same time he said that he has made little progress.
The memo the message contains descriptions of men who with suitcases full of money, which probably were in the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption must be left to the bureaucrats Medvedev," said Georgy Satarov, Recalling, the director of a Moscow think-tank, in a recent interview.
"But it is a part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class, because a political class in Russia that no longer exists."
Without politicians, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Across the country, estimated by the corruption of Russia, will cost more than $300 billion a year.
The country is ranked 154 to a recent study on global perceptions of corruption by the non-governmental organisation Transparence International (countries are "the least corrupt" to "most corrupt" included).
The revelation of the Memos of the American embassy in Moscow, which happened late at night time, will certainly displeasure within the Russian government, though, as Moscow accused Luzhkov for the mistake can be for the Kremlin, it also could be a way to claim that it is the answer to problems.
In an interview with Larry King on CNN, that the WikiLeaks-Dokumente Putin claimed a fake could be, and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats him Batman and Robin Medvedev mentioned.
"The truth is that it is about our interaction is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we did not expect that to happen with this arrogance, with a kind of pressure and with such unethical way, you know."
Veterans, the Khmer Rouge forced to confront the past.
In a weak pointed betonierten class room with dirty and abblätternden walls, recalling the director of Anlong Veng High School to the man that he has built, in the Ta Mok, the Khmer Rouge leaders.
"Everyone here loves" Ta Mok.
"He was a good leader, and he has gone about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge reign, known as the "butchers," is the military commander in this remote former Rouge Rouge-Hochburg in the north west of Cambodia's popular, where he built bridges, hospitals and the infrastructure has developed and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, are long-time supporters in Anlong Veng challenged.
In April, allowed a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum the victims of public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed an object that children of former soldiers for the first time in the history of the Khmer Rouge are told.
And in July, a Community tribunal the UN and Cambodia for the first time, a former member of the Khmer Rouge, the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, sentenced to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, the fear among the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, hindered their efforts at reconciliation and reintegration into society of Cambodia.
"There is still fear in the opposition and former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Youk Chhang, director of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that researches the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It disrupts own families."
During the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, overwork or diseases.
When the Vietnamese invaded in 1979 and the pole Pot-Ied government then fled the remnants of the regime and its military to the Cambodian border to Thailand.
Widely-spread here until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered, the anxiety.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary the guerrilla war from its base in the West, the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok, the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, as a peace agreement supported by the United Nations in 1993, is one of the first democratic elections in the country, began large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters, the government, which is to cross the Kapitulationen of Ieng Sary in 1996 and 1998, Khieu Samphan Nuan Chea and led.
Pol Pot died in 1998, and a natural death, the Ta Mok, was not given in 1999 by government forces in the Dangrek Mountain were arrested.
He died in 2006 at the prison in Phnom Penh, where he was waiting for his trial.
As their benefactors they no longer protected, fled most former Khmer Rouge fighters in the exhausting poverty of rural Cambodia and many were nostalgic for the movement.
Even if a few elitist officials of the Khmer Rouge their local government posts, because they laid down their arms, but the ordinary soldiers poor, uneducated farmers.
"These people have only benefited very little of the capitulation," said Sok Leang by the Center for Justice and reconciliation across Cambodia in Anlong Veng, also, public forums,
"They are enshrined in the utopian Agrarideologie of the regime".
"They grew without any professional know."
Sor Lim, 55, who as a teenager in 1974 had joined the Rhmer Rouge, fought in the jungle to Anlang Veng, before he was defeated in 1998, a life as poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was a good thing," he said.
"TA Mok each has something to eat."
"But now, the life is difficult, because we need to look to ourselves."
The Khmer Rouge tribunal has also concerns out here.
At the beginning of next year, will be the court try Nuon Chea president Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to court.
The mission of the court, it is that the old leaders and those most responsible for atrocities are to be condemned, but it has not said whether it has these four cases, other acts will follow.
That has done little to fear in Anlong Veng, the works.
Current media speculation at In Chaem, 64 years, during the time of Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970's district leader in the province was Manteay Meanchey.
In 2007 it had a representative of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, told they have to build the dam Trapeang Thma steered a project in which thousands of forced labour probably died.
On a hot night, In Chaem of the work in the fields for her wooden house on a filthy streets outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun long shadow over the desiccated grass threw rejected In Chaem it, about their past when the Khmer Rouge.
The court should they vorladen, they would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia live in peace and stability," she said.
"There would be no prosecutions more would be in war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, in 1878 from the Khmer Rouge has fled, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be uncertain, would the court more suspects on trial, even though experts and historians to discuss this.
"Digging a hole and Cambodia must bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do in order to be able to go forward, Youk Chhang said the documentation center.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer-Zeiten means bring together the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put parts together, these broken, so that they can understand how everything."
The centre has created the first of the government, the object of the Khmer Rouge, the 75seitige "history of Democratic Cambodia."
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng than annex to the history books for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which is less than four sides on the Khmer Rouge.
As so often in Cambodia know the young people in Anlong Veng little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the links of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new object is helping students, is an important part of their history.
But his parents were sceptical when he came home with the book, to be read.
"My family rejects many parts of the book, and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people the court to be sentenced."
Such a resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Leang said Sok.
But the public forums, the object and the court and gain influence, "he said.
Still, the Khmer Rouge is a powerful attraction.
High in the Dangrek mountains Sträuchern überwucherter and leads a plastic waste verdreckter way to a Rechteck of black soot, covered with a pair of rusty Blechdach.
Pol Pot's body after his death in 1998, was on a pile of tyres have been burnt.
Sothea Nuom, 31 years, a Handyverkäuferin at the side of the road, said she does not know much about the man who was to have been burnt.
"But he has a strong spirit, and many of the people here are going to pray for him," she said.
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday later in the day and it wanted to to Pol Pot's final resting place, where they will take a more mature bush bananas - in the hope that he will bring her luck.
Belarus agrees not to collect weapons-grade uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide, the government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal has been in a joint statement after a meeting of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in additional articles of the security summit.
The US government had for years sought to convince Russia knows more highly enriched uranium, not to collect and last spring seemed to have reached a hurdle.
But officials of the US government told the Washington Post that, in the last two months, two secret agreements with Belarus has been made to 187 pounds of weapon-grade uranium from a Belarus research center.
The setting the stage for the agreement on Wednesday, the rest of the material to be removed, according to an official staff, because of the sensitivity of the matter, the anonymous, about £500.
The agreement seems to be one of the main findings of Obama's "nuclear security summit of 47 nations" from April, the Belarus had ruled out.
And it was, of course, good enough for the invitation of the former Soviet republic of the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited by the fact that they have a seat on the nuclear security summit (from 2012)."
"It shows me that it works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a group promoting nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, very important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised, in Prague in April 2009, within the space of four years to secure all vulnerable nuclear material.
Since then, the US government helped her six countries to get rid of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, the white Russian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never abandon their uranium.
"How to maintain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is capable of radically weapons, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our commodity... We will not derive any dirty bomb and we will sell it to anyone".
"We will use it solely for research purposes, and that is it."
Belarus approached yet just a few months ago, the United States, as it is interested in meeting anzeigte of an agreement.
The first port of call, the uranium Belarus in October, was particularly complicated, because the material is easily contaminated by radiation was, say officials.
It was loaded into a Spezialzug, of the more than 1,300 miles of a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, officials say.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and has been carried out by plane, according to the officials.
The US government will pay for this effort $14 million, with much of the money in the Belarusian research with low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was a carefully coordinated to build confidence," to the agreement, which was signed by Clinton led, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy, this is due to the global threat reduction.
The James Martin Center for Nichtweiterzugebende studies estimates that Belarus this year, at least 88 pounds waffenfähhigen uranium, and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus under the joint agreement will be in stores by the end of 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, first and foremost because of Lukashenko's harsh abuse of human rights.
But the statement on Wednesday suggested a possible rapprochement.
"The progress this global security issues, welcome heißend the United States of America and Belarus known that a greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus is a central theme in the improvement in bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," it said.
The Spanish government has no objections against CIA
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA with Taliban and al-Qaeda prisoners on Spanish territory to Guantanamo, as a telegram of the Ambassador of the U.S.A. in Madrid.
This reflects the Wikileaks enhüllten and the daily newspaper El País "(cable) support documents. It added that the former deputy leader, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, the Spanish Government should be informed," to show that foreign aeroplanes flying over Spain, appropriately monitored. "
In June 2006, after the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, where the aid menschenrechtsverachtenden practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, was discussed, the former American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
Deputy leader admitted that the report by the Council of Ministers have met on the sidelines "and Zapatero, Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega said Spain have no objection to the intelligence flights over the Spanish territory."
"They simply want to be informed," not "unprepared to be surprised," Aguirre told via cable.
The former foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, said the ambassador pointed out that the Spanish government is "not a great deal of attention to the issue, although the government may have little influence, as they have in the hands of the judges."
The prosecutor Vicente González was in January 2007, in turn, to understand the message that he is the judicial initiative, the declassification of documents, the Spanish intelligence central (CNI) and the defense minister about the CIA would not seek to block.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information," said the ambassador, for a meeting with the prosecutor.
Despite this, the United States on the 'apparent coordination between the Spanish state prosecutor, and the German prosecutors' more concerned than about the deklassifizierte information of CNI and the Department of Defense.
"That coordination between independent Untersuchern our efforts to discreet handling between governments complicated," Aguirre complained.
In a lunch meeting in March 2007, in which the ambassador of the United States, and the Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges incredibly heavily on their independence and it would do what they feel is appropriate" given instructions to his staff, he would have "blown rhetorical comments to avoid the tension to wane."
The ambassador expressed his concern for the way in which the PP in this matter.
"Despite their generally pro-American stance our experience tells us that the PP have no doubt will, an indication that the government of the United States, which Zapatero's actions as a possible human rights violations could be construed to have deliberately ignored or tolerated, capital, even if these revelations have a negative effect on the government of the United States could have an impact," he stresses.
The Kindsmörderin recognises that it is on the Internet about the "burdens" of motherhood.
The young woman said the child was dead, as this has been, and it had a blog: "Terrorist to Galician kind of"
Mónica Fernández is on the Internet, "Juanatey Muki."
Under this epithet from small to, it is with a Kusine and at least one friend contact, both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, in which she was born.

In March 2008, it is only at the Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I am here to work."
"When I told him that he found it good, but now it is, of course, what it means, of course, with the boys all day long to be alone and not to be free, to be able to do what it wants."
Later they said a communication that it has received just on the phone: "I would like to see you or me zurückkommst this month will give an address, to which you can send the boys."
She complains: "If he did not like that I have the boys in my mother, I would like to digress him when I come back."
In May, it is the return to their village: "This week I will go there, but I will only remain there until 19, because I am on 20 to a work must imagine if I do not want to lose."
She says that they are wasting their eldest, if all goes well.
"He is going to be, it has to be, that is, to me, and I will never in life on someone other than him again with my mother," a dubious intention, if you take into account their poor relationship.
In July, there is another Mail.
As it writes, it is assumed that the boy on 1 of the month and supposedly came to the island on 10 was assassinated, is dead.
"On the one hand, on the other hand, César is not satisfied".

The duty defender Carlos Maceda, said that she could not recall to the expiry of the facts, "and they do not have the intention to harm small."
But they had previously stood in the bathroom, César him and gets his body in a suitcase.
Defense and prosecutors have requested a psychiatric assessment.
Popular Party won four seats in the US Congress and the PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November could the PP in the city of Tarragona Lérida, and Barcelona have a crucial role to play
After the major Stimmen- and Members increase in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking forward to the general election - or not their expectations are more than positive because the number of votes that the party in the elections, is usually twice as high as that in the elections, in Catalonia.
So, the Catalan People's Party 610.473 votes in the parliamentary elections of 2008, while the figure in the regional elections in 2006 only 316.222.
Last Sunday the PPC reached 384.091 votes.
If these rising trend - result of the diversion of the vote share of the PSC and the capture of the electorate - should encourage the PP, analysts predict that the People's Party in the parliamentary elections the PPC from 8 to 12 members of Congress could also rise, while four (CiU it now has 10) before and the PSC at least 9 people (25).
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party would lose the ERC a Member of Parliament - at present, she has three - while ICV their members could keep or a will.
The election calendar should be retained, however, the next date with the local elections in May 2011, and then the People's Party (PP), the voice on the scales for the Socialist leadership to an end, and in four provincial capitals and with their majority come in the City Council, one of the municipalities with the largest budget: 661 million for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC cities Barcelona, of Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona in which the Socialists neither a majority still on its traditional allies (ERC and ICV) can draw is going to lose.
After the Republican debacle, it is not absurd that this party their representation in the local council emblematic, in which they should reach 5% of the vote is going to lose.
The PP recorded, however, an increase in their share of the vote in the four provincial capitals and could the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that the main role in Tarragonas turnaround to be able to play, where they were before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP government.
Lérida It is the PP just 500 votes behind the PSC, Àngel. The mayor Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the recent election campaign leaders met on several occasions.
In other important places, such as, for example, or Reus Castelldefels Badalona in the People "s Party, has been a significant growth.
Currently, the PP in 34 city administrations of Catalonia, and aims to represent the creation of lists in so many places as possible.
The Catalan cell worried Al Qaeda thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven of the policemen of the secret services, the police come and the Nigerians were arrested in Pakistan by Thailand from drones jihadis tables cell to different Al Qaida-Gruppen, including the Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (let) - the latter was author of the terrorist attacks in Mumbai in 2008, which had 106 deaths - with passports.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior, these investigations, is of great importance, so much so that it has insured with the "operation Kampai" of counterfeiting apparatus Al Qaidas been "weakened" in the world, and "thus their ability to act".
The researchers expect that, in the two years, in which the unit has been active in Catalonia thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were sent to a fake and then to the groups, from which the galaxy Al Qaeda, have been sent out, so that their "fighters" with impunity the boundaries of European and other Western countries have been able to cross.
The discovered cell is not the only one of the jihadist network, which has been active in Europe, which is why, in addition to the Thai investigation bodies other European police units to the searches. It is not inconceivable that, in the area of the EU in the coming days similar to the attacks, such as the last Tuesday in Barcelona was executed, will come from.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman Malik Asghar, Jabran, Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammed Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerians Babatunde Agunbiade have been arrested in Thailand and a further in the the Pakistani Muhammad Athar flounder and Zeeshan Ehsan flounder and the Thais Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung have been arrested.
They had come to Bangkok from those in Spain and other European countries to local cell.
The Catalan network - part of which was destroyed in the year 2009 - stole particularly tourists passports in accordance with the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front."
This means that the documents on the behalf of men aged 25 to 45 years and still be issued for a number of years had to be valid, they were not permitted to visa stamp.
In study circles is pointed out that until now no links between the Catalonia detainees and the attack in Mumbai, although the author of the attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba," was one of the recipients of the groups in Spain in Thailand then stolen and fake passports.
Nonetheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the attack in Catalonia from using a Geldtransfer-Unternehmens several thousand dollars had been sent out in the purchase of single purpose pre-paid cards for mobile phones had been "invested", later, by the members of the "commandos", that the lives of 106 people, has been used to an end.
The police have seized a lot of documentation.
By Ma's Party is calling for a postponement of the tax agreement
The chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday, Artur Ma's personally their conditions to support its term as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. This is no different from the already raised during the campaign and with the primacy of the economic recovery and the let of regionalist independence adventures as a finance agreement the regionalistische leaders at the height of his mandate to propose.
The president of the Catalan People's Party opposing with the security of Artur massage that its 18 members, which they won last Sunday - a paragraph, which is more than sufficient, in order to feel essential, because the candidate of the party CiU bürgerlich-regionalistischen is counting on at least one of the opposition parties to vote at his inauguration of the vote.
The future alliances, which delighted in the coming parliamentary elections in Congress want to depend on a possible entente with the PP. The talks, Ma's currently with the rest of the party leaders, however, are in Catalonia.
As the leader of the PPC, that calls for the support of the term "all discourse, the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia concern", as well as an agreement on the fiscal adjustment between the government and the autonomous region - as in the Basque country, and the leader of CiU even a referendum, at the back.
Two political leaders had in common is that they the exaggerated political apparatus of the regional administration streamlined and the duties and gift tax want to abolish.
With the details of the negotiations on the inauguration of Ma's deal from the PPC Jordi Cornet Dolors and Montserrat.
Ma's has already with Joaquim Nadal (PSC), a tough opposition announced - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he is with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The old nursing home that the deaths are not due to "lack of action" are
The owners of the old home in Olot does not preclude their carers of elderly people killed eleven
The leaders of the old nursing home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) yesterday a press conference, in which she revealed the damage the criminal acts - Joan Vila Dilmés of nurses, during his work at least eleven old people, for which he was responsible, was killed - the establishment had caused.
The director of the elderly home, Joan Sala, accompanied by his lawyer, in court, Joan Cañada on and announced, "La Caritat would like the responsible (for the deaths accuse)," but the "right and our liability force us the process and civil liability".
The establishment is not only a society to lose, because they see the criminal acts of the Pflegers not found in time, but there is now also a high amount of compensation to be paid by the legal representatives of the families of the victims will be calculated.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime in August 2009 and that further since then, he has been murdered.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - the former patients of the old nursing homes - because it was suspected that no doctor personally have investigated the dead, but the formalities because of their age and diseases have been handled by phone.
The head of La Caritat prominent this point, and has stated flatly that "lack of action any time the cause of the incidents may have been".
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "there was no evidence in the legal dispute for negligent acts a person other than the accused."
The "Angel of Death" getaufte 11 murders confessed to the other day and said that the first crime committed on 29 August 2009 and one and a half months later, the second old lady.
In this case he killed with an overdose of insulin, in contrast to the first crime in which he was a mixture of various sedatives.
The head of La Caritat said the access of staff to the drugs is difficult to control.
The insulin injections and cocktail of sedatives, the nurses in six of the nine crimes committed in patients with the death of her suffering.
But the results of the lab tests are to be seen whether Vila is lying and his first victims actually have a less gruesome death, or whether it is this from the inside, by offering them Bleichlauge ausbrannte verabreichte according to the confession, as he had done in three women, between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat listens to the testimony of the Pflegers no faith, not even say what the number of murders, which could be much more. This attitude is justified that Vila very different statements made in court, and that it would make no sense, his approach after eight successful murders suddenly change.
They say that they did it for that reason, and in order to raise awareness of the impact of the events of the judiciary.
Posturing of the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors yesterday reacted strongly to the threat by the President of the ECB, Trichet warned of "the markets should not underestimate our capacity to respond."
The risk premia the Euro-Peripheriländer increased dramatically and the shares of European banks by more than 5%.
We should, however, the possibility that the ECB and the euro may be difficult to get points, which led to concern not to be underestimated.
The events of yesterday are typical for an illiquid market to the extent that it breaks down is recovered, however, as a result of the closure of a short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investors, will not lose their fear.
A month ago, has called on the European Central Bank, to cancel our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen that the ECB tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and is likely to be still a number of times in the future, a climbdown.
The Federal Bank has called on the outcome of the plan to buy government debt, since these were ineffective, as well as the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures, and it should only be a einwöchiger permanent access to be maintained.
After the crisis in Ireland, we expect the current liquidity measures, "at least until March," extended and the quarterly contracts with unlimited access to the quarter end to ensure the liquidity will remain at least until June.
We also expect that the programme to purchase bonds continued to signal and a means to spend.
If created expectations are not met, the excellent response from the markets of yesterday back and if halstarrig insistence that we can take back our liquidity measures, only God help us!
Just as with the EZB-Sitzung in May, the bank confirmed that the purchase of government debt securities not to take into account and then collapsed, the markets could be a repeat of that story tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persevere.
In May showed the teeth and on Wednesday, she said, a lot of what they have to buy a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday was the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal pretty weak.
The state-owned asset management were only 500 million 5,28%, compared to 750 million 4,81% in the previous auction.
However, the interest rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points in the whole of the curve, and reflected a perception of change in the markets in the wake of Trichet's words.
In Ireland has been the numbers of Schuldenlochs of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is around 10 million in the short term, and possibly a further 15 000 estimated. There is, until February, private capital to get these banks or be nationalized.
Although Ireland has lost all its credibility after the problem with the stress tests, in July, had not seen the figures are acceptable as part of the rescue plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the Government must next Tuesday, the parliamentary approval for his new budget plan. As they still do not have the adequate support, Ireland is also continue to be a source of uncertainty.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has their discourse at the summit of the heads of state and government on 14 December moderate. There is political entity, and asked to show that, together, we have the same score.
The problem is that Germany, Wagner wants to play and the other countries of the Beethoven "s ninth symphony.
The Spanish Government said yesterday that the action plan adopted Friday by the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions, as in the case of financial institutions, reducing the public deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. The measures in the ears of investors as Vivaldis four seasons.
The dual effects Zapatero and Trichet explained why the Spanish stock market has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February was the reaction of the government and the Bank of Spain quickly and convincingly, and we benefit from the surprise result.
Today, there is a crucial auction of three-year bond, the benefits from the Trichet-Effekt will be, which is why we are in strong demand, all doubt on our ability to refinance eliminate it.
For Spain would be applying for a plan of self-sacrifice.
We would get liquidity that we do not need. The treasury has 40 billion euros, three times as much as in March. The rates are very expensive, and access to markets would be closed without notice.
However, our strategy should the slogan: "Now meet Caesar" s wife is not only the existence, but also of the false. "
Only courage that we create.

Triumph of Red Bull in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
The car with a software in real time to improve.
For Red Bull in 2004, in the world of Formula 1, is their history in this fine universe of speed of surprises and successes.
Initially, no one paid attention to the newcomer, and, despite its steeply rising background during the last few seasons, last November, all in the final lap for the victory for the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso.
Without the abilities of the German pilots and champion Sebastian Vettel or the performance of the engine by Renault to belittle want is the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens Red Bull in the hands, and that a winning team, to become a legend.
In reality, is a powerful software to simulate of trials, the German company in 2007 for purposes not have to do with motor racing, on the market.
This and PLM technology programme has called for the development of assembling chains in factories around the world, energy plants and precise instruments used.
The goal is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before this, in fact, is built so as to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM, the development of cameras from Canon, the Sukhoi aircraft and the most famous vehicles from Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, the head of the industrial section of Siemens, said that with the use of this software in the Formula 1 Red Bull - factory "in a few hours, almost in real time," the changes and improvements in the race and in the testing are identified and design.
Russwurm contends that in 1992, from the point of view of an average of 10 technicians working in a season no more than three or four improvements could introduce.
In Red Bulls team are currently 180 skilled young people. With highcapacity EDV-Anlagen they analyses and all sorts of changes to the cars.
The Siemens-Manager PLM-Software said, was all the components of the cars from Red Bull to analyse and improve, with the exception of the engine, is solely responsible for the Renault said.
The materials, fuel, the aircrafts' aerodynamics, and safety elements changed.
The changes can, thanks to advanced production facilities and Hightech-Autoklaven in less than 24 hours of the virtual reality of the Simulators into reality.
The only limit is this loony technical perfect, the $40 million, a Formula 1 racing - for his race team in a season allowed to spend.
Red Bull has its Hightech-Fabrik for the development and manufacture of its cars in a 50 km of London away from the ground.
There are two buildings in which visits, particularly journalists, is heavily restricted.
Everything that is happening is, Top Secret.
The workforce includes 580 people, including two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls true formula 1 - hero is doubt on the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the vast technological resources of Energy-Drink-Hersteller in the service of his participation on the tracks, to hide other players, their support and their invaluable visibility is zero.
The Technologichef of the station, Steve Nevey, said that five years ago, it was possible to say that the progress in the area of R & D for cars with 50 per cent for victory and earned the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values changed. The technology makes about 85% of success, while the contribution of the pilots on 15 per cent.
Nevey recognises that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by a computer, because they "are not voraussagbare gladiators".

Sabadell wants his rivals in three years ago, a million customers' steal '
The managing director of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than the other managers, and he believes that, in 2001, a tough year for the banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and has predicted the end of the debt War.
Still, he sees a collapse of interest margins, the banks with increases the fees and prices for loans try to balance.
Sabadell expected in three years ago, a million private customers recover - even to existing specialist.
Sabadell has found the way to the next three years, and that in a very difficult economic environment to survive.
The bank will introduce a new Dreijahresleitplan 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without the public support from the FROB, but moreover, the share of the market for a million private customers - 700 000 if the customer leaves, which the Bank is going to lose - to increase, and it is the great challenge for the Bank is, for now, they have their business customers to pay more attention to their retail customers.
This year, it has 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Its market share in retail is 3.5 per cent, while the business customers more than 10 per cent.
Another principle of the business plan, 2011-2013 is the increase in productivity, austerity, reducing costs. The challenges facing the bank so that it will be along with year end report.
Only a few banks are daring in these difficult times to publish targets and, as a result of the financial crisis the banks around the world, all the plans are in disarray.
Sabadell this year will set out their four years, and this was a complete master plan Optima initially interpreted to three years, but as a result of the state of the market, it was a financial year.
Customers who leave the savings banks, will be the main objective of the bank.
At a breakfast organised by the APIE said Guardiola, 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with a great deal of reach."
The manager believes that Spain would only "slow" out of the crisis.
Moreover, it would be "very difficult", in two or three years "to create work" - crucial to the survival of the banks.
Although he assumes that the war for liabilities - the interest rate margins - abate will be punished, the risk premia, the banks and building societies for their emissions by paying to maintain liquidity, as compensation for the dwindling profit margins have already been passed on to the price of loans.
"The liquidity and funding issues are structural in nature and they will put pressure on the credit."
"We do not have to cut down, but the Zinsdifferenziale are very high," Guardiola.
Banesto on Thursday were already ordering their Filialnetz from the award of long-term loans and the Zinsdifferenziale to increase (cf. Cinco Díaz of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also acknowledged, the banks, at the moment, "the charges Stategie to increase", but "within a competitive framework."
Sabadells master plan is based on an organic growth, even if the party, as always, corporate transactions.
It is not for nothing that he assures that, in Spain, "the bigger companies are needed."
"In the coming year will change everything," he assured.
He stressed that the need for capital, at the moment, "huge increase" and does not exclude the possibility that some of the Spanish financial institutions in red numbers are slipping.
He is of the opinion that the FROB Kaptitalaufstockungen in the money market.
Sabadell after he assured us that even a temporary closure of the markets could survive, he refuted the argument of a few bankers, already predict a new liquidity crisis.
He emphasised that nothing can be in circulation but, unlike the events in June, could be on short-term funding and thus Repogeschäfte intercept the crisis.
CECA includes a second wave of mergers in the Savings & amp; Loan
The Director General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday threw out the possibility that a wave of mergers of banks and building societies can and stressed the speed with which the sector will be restructured.
As the concentration of the Spanish savings banks began, there were a number of savings banks to participate in the first stage, retained the second round.
On the other hand, the General Director of the Spanish savings bank association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, this second round would not take place.
"I believe that the largest part of the merger is complete. The inclusion of Cajasol in the group Banca Cívica cannot be viewed as the second round, it was more about adjustments."
"The biggest part is finished. It may be that instead of siebzehen 13 or 14, but all the important processes are already completed, and it was of Banco de España, which has strong support from all the fuss."
In one of the association of business leaders and managers Aragoniens (ADEA) organized breakfast led Olavarrieta that the concentration of process "as quickly as possible, and that we need to be satisfied with the prompt the end, in earlier times, not now, in the context of the business plans with Banco de España has been set," he said.
"The transition from 45 savings banks on average 28 million assets to 17 with the 75 500 million is a historically unvergleichbarer process. The number of financial institutions was reduced by 62% and they are now very much bigger, and the Basel agreements we have fulfilled," he stressed.
Olavarrieta said, "there are a number of unabgebrachter opinions about the slowness of the process, the Unseriösität and absurdity" revealed, because "Banco de España warned us, due to be completed before the end of the year."
The Director General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain is one of the most rigorous "financial systems in Europe and perhaps the whole world" and added that those who have the anzweifeltenn this "without deeper knowledge" would do.
The managers said that we are in the current economic climate "no concerns" about the state of the financial institutions and the need to make a "very significant" concentration process have gone through, "as quickly as possible," will take place.
He also pointed to the fact that the Spanish banks the stress tests, in July, the ECB were very good.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has for the keeping of the euro, but at the same time, conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tension in the markets have a dual response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero new adaptation measures, starting with the tax reductions for small and micro enterprises, regulation of the temporary employment agencies or the lifting of the 426 euro support for the unemployed, no unemployment benefit, and the privatisation of 49% from AENA, the management of the airports Barajas and El Prat and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, supports the deputy leader, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former government of President Felipe González criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible, which envisage the current crisis.
How are these events to understand?
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is no mistakes of their public relations.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the redefinition of the euro.
Germany it is a fundamentally new perspective to shape our future, with the retention of the old traditions of a large part of his partner.
In the face of opposition in Europe is in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis spekuliern.
The first, a strong currency with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south will have to leave the euro area.
The second: The restoration of the German mark - although at the moment, sounds like science fiction, it is supported by a large part of the public opinion, around 50% of the population.
The third: A review of the euro, according to German proposals. This means: More macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of the countries that are the targets are invading; möglichereweise the default of a number of countries, as well as the extension of the costs of potential adjustments to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been for some time, which is why there are no excuses now.
First, in 2009, as both the IMF and the European Commission for the deficits created and the German government is a constitutional reform from the sleeves, in order to prevent it from 2016.
It was the first sign of the polarisation between what Germany was thought necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign the Central European country, and the decision to rescue of Greece, Mrs Merkel had also postponed.
At that time, it has been strongly criticised. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published opinion is totally opposed to a bailout of Greece.
Finally, Merkel last October in the days after, with a clear position, and it is calling for a reform of the agreement, the European Union, in order to allow for the bailout of a country, and at the same time, the private lenders to make part of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European because the Ireland crisis and following through on.
But her proposal, although slightly sweetened, has been approved in the next few months we will be in the reform of the European Union, which is to allow these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line not to cross, which it does.
It says all that - even if now unpopular measures must be taken, it is as of this date, the old workings of the euro, will no longer be available.
In 2013, the birth year of a new currency area, where zuwiderhandelnden countries be severely punished, it can be forced to declare themselves bankrupt and, in this case, the private sector must take a share of the costs.
Germany shows us that we have a strong growth path, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive foreign trade balance.
The other option, which is in debt and construction of huge holes in the balance of payments is based, just as they led Spain in times of boom, will simply not be tolerated.
The offer is clear.
And we do that, it would be wrong not to understand.
It is not simply a matter of the public deficit by 2013 runterzufahren to 3%.
The demands are much tougher.
And the worst thing we could do in these conditions, is to give us.
I hope that the present turbulence into more rest.
And that we have the opportunities that we need to be by early 2013.
It seems that, Zapatero has taken this so well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis that our own house in order to establish their way.
But Germany was red line is there, and it is not so, that this would change.
Among the possibilities is contemplating that we fully gestopften with little serious countries would have to leave the euro area, should not be ruled out.
In this case we could Germany still saying that it had warned us.
Sport and rule bypassing
Tricks such as Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will, a sanction.
The supposedly of two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) has instigated exclusion in the game on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League that caused much ink has been spilled about whether it is a unsportliche action or not acted and whether both players should be punished by UEFA.
As is well known, the two players lost a few minutes before the end of the game (her team had clearly won) and played several Fouls time, so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and, because the Real Madrid, his group would be the two players the statutory penalty for the next league match against Auxerre and without tickets to enter the next phase of the game.
Finally, punished the Disziplinarkommitee of UEFA, the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players with different sums of money.
The provocation of a yellow card in this or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this game - following rules.
Part of the debate about the images that have arisen case to the fact that a team of football clubs (Real Madrid and honour his anthem Edelmut and on other occasions, his players for similar incidents had punished play a major role in the process), and the drama by Mourinho, an episode more to its long history as a technician and provocative theatralischer has added.
In any case, the debate is about whether this is not explicitly by the statutes of banned behaviour contradicts the principles of sport, this means a rule, if these actions bypassing. In fact, is this approach to the statutes of the sport, but it seems to make sense.
On this issue, should the damage caused to the sporting spirit be investigated.
The sporting spirit defended the physical safety of the players, an aspect that has been put at risk by these actions not, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that, the zuwiderhandelnden players an unjustified benefit from the draw against a team that has not been done, too.
The paradox of the action of the players of the Real Madrid is that they do not correspond to what we normally under wrong game or rule bypassing understand, because the circumvention of the rule was not made in secret to avoid a sanction, but it should be as noticeable as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee.
The players waited and the sanctions to go.
Another question is what kind of advantage of the offender from the deliberate Fouls.
Here it should be emphasised that the rival either in a worse situation still has advantages for the feigned erheischt game, because the obvious result of this was that your own team with fewer players weiterspielen had to.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not, on these players.
The benefit is obvious, is that the players of the next phase of the Champions League game without a ticket that makes their participation in a future game could begin to threaten.
But it is a long-term, up to a certain extent, uncertain advantage, because at some point, leaving the team could get to the players, and with this approach, a sanction and go in the second round on the cards for cards with a card accumulation less than in the first round of departures.
So it is not clear whether it is a real advantage.
In the end, such practices are not against the sporting spirit, including strategic decisions, in order to escape from the rules a maximum benefit.
In this case, did not sanction the players handle (that would be a clear case of rule to bypass), they wanted to vote, when they will be.
They met a strategic decision, without a penalty or avoid it.
Although the border between inventiveness and regulatory environment blurred, I believe, is that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: Because two even exclusions, and because of the type of provoking Regelübertragung.
The damage done to the principles of the sport was caused by these actions, it is less of an ethical as aesthetic.
Supply offensive to a customer fishing for sectional Christmas dinner in Barcelona.
The dictatorship of the calendar, this year, a flood of reservations on days 16 and 17 December.
Workers paid celebration itself out - they are no more than 20 to 30 euros.
As the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also groups in the run-up to the dinner, the Gaststätten- and leisure industry emblematic oxygen, but as a result of the economic crisis to solve it, at a price of offensive the customer segment, which represents the large mass, almost all would recover, between 20 and 30 euros for a Mittag- spend or dinner, the surveyed companies and associations.
The accounting is a bit more complicated, the calendar (New Year falls on a Friday) all orders in the week commencing 13 December, with the result of an avalanche of bookings of dinner for two Spitzentager (16 and 17) and almost no orders in the week before that.
Since 2008, when the bad times, many firms have started the groups dinner, for budgetary reasons.
In that tradition, do not have to pay for many workers it from their own pockets.
As always, the economy is that there will be calls for the lowest prices, the chairman of the pubs body of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the umbrella organisation is not to predict until now, such as the holidays, this month, will look like.
"The people are considering 'dozens of times before they be set aside."
"They would like to, but they respect heavily on the prices," he said.
The business is going to go well, "the quality at good prices, with a good service," he adds, and reminds us that the customers saving in times of crisis, which is why prices to 25 euro most sought after.
In a survey in various central restaurants it turns out that the night of 17 December 2008 the supplier to collapse.
Soteras the group says that the demand for this Friday with the intention of trying to spend less than 30 euros would boom. The group has its Menüs with completely offered between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
In a group of other leading Andilana, 16 restaurants in the city has (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and other), the peculiarity of the calendar early bookings, even from the beginning of November.
"We have done the impossible for the previous year's prices with Menüs for every taste of 19,95 to 30 euro," he says.
Grup Alleanza Nazionale in the Attic, El Mussol QuQu, and a total of 23 local guides, you lose the optimism, not since the second quarter of the revenue bloom and good, even if few days focused prospects for this Christmas season looked.
Sources of the group also point out that of the 18 an active day with groups of friends, the Christmas vorfeiern, will be.
The six Gruppenmenüs was a Christmas menu for 30 euros, or more than Preishit. It has added to the impression that the customers are ready, 10 per cent more than in the previous year and in return wish more details, such as the cava.
Some firms see green shoots are why the employees will be invited again. This gives the impression that the groups eat are on the rise again.
The umbrella organisation Fecasarm (with mergers as the pub, equally and leisure class of Barcelona), the deputy chairman, Enric Gomà to the end of the tunnel, and you notice that the reservations generally "lively", despite the fact that customers make a "maximum".
The fun is in the celebration, however, has not gone down, regardless of who pays.
Pakistan's nuclear programme is causing grave concern in the United States.
Islamabad is nuclear weapons' faster than any other country, ".
Revelations by Wikileaks confirm relationships between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The website Wikileaks revealed content of the correspondence between the US embassy in Pakistan, and the US-Staatsabteilung confirms the enormous concerns of the Pakistani nuclear program, Washington.
On the fringes of the informative and hefty details to the documents on the content of the talks, and the mindset of the accredited American diplomats in Islamabad, reveal that the cooperation between the two countries in the area of nuclear security, but not the opposite, ', "and that is the unstable Asian country more nuclear weapons Rhytmus a faster" than any other country ".
In particular the nature of the Pakistani nuclear program, is that the weapons are not, but its individual parts stored in a possible attack their destruction to make it difficult for Washington - cause sleepless nights.
The following risks include the ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report ahead of the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones, said: "The close proximity of some nuclear facilities on the ravaged area by the Taliban, the probable Verstreuung of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material."
The large number of people, in the nuclear arsenals and missile programmes are implies, is no longer just the United States, but also by Russia as ausufernd reason and caution.
"Pakistan must strictly gläubiges personnel to guard nuclear plants, albeit because of the low level of education and cultural levels have extremist organisations more opportunities for people who are involved in nuclear and missile programmes, reklutieren to work," said the expert, Yuri Korolev by the Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with his American counterpart.
New to the Internet portal, revealed Julian Assanges documentation is that the cooperation between the United States and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation and the increased rate of Pakistan nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the message that the communication with Pakistan as a "frustrating," saying: "Often, there is no transparency; on frontline services, there are no answers, or they refused."
Another confirmed Peter Lavoy, officials of the state intelligence service for South Asia that "despite the economic disaster Pakistan nuclear weapons as quickly as any other country".
The Ambassador Patterson asked Washington during a visit of top army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, the "clear" that "Pakistan's army is its tacit support of terrorist groups overseas has to stop."
In the hunt for the head of Wikileaks
Obama appoints a high responsible for the anti-terrorism fight to prevent new revelations.
Interpol has a red warning to track and detect Assange.
Everything with Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated maze, in the bottom of the facts just difficult.
Yesterday Interpol had a "red alert" to "discover and persecution" of Assange.
It is, however, not to be a traditional order to arrest.
In addition, it is not new, it comes from the 20 November.
It also has nothing to do with the recent revelation of more than four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but also to do with the accusations of sexual abuse, which the Australians are in Sweden.
The lawyer also assured the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "the police knew where and how they have been in contact with Mr Assange."
Already on 20, the international police agency based in Lyon (France) at the request of Sweden the order, but it was up to yesterday after receiving authorisation by the Swedish authorities have not been announced.
As things are, the 188 Interpol countries are instructed, Assange to identify and locate, "to arrest and extradite him for the time being."
Although Interpol the arrest of a red warning affected individual cannot issue orders, many member countries, according to the organisation the red warning as a licence for a Arrestierung - the national police force must be carried out, particularly when they are on a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange presumably.
The move outraged Assanges lawyers gesten, published a letter in which they were informed that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is prepared by video conference to answer questions from the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange exit from Sweden, and from the state, a lawyer with the sagenumwobenen Pavlovich Lavrentiy Beria, security chief of Stalin, compared to the corresponding authorization.
"It is a race, not as a legal persecution" in the letter.
While the world is him, and his mother of Australia from the innocence of their son claimed - believes Assange to an unknown place, however, in silence.
On Monday he gave the head of the magazine Time, by Skype of a vague place for an interview during the conversation, he called for the resignation of the Secretary of State of the USA, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it was responsible for ordering North American diplomats, the UN, and therefore to spy on the United States has violated international agreements signed, they would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, condemned the request for his resignation as "ridiculous and absurd".
"I am not sure why we value to the views of a type with a website should be," he told the station, CNN reported.
Obama himself has a lot of people responsible for the anti-terrorism fight, Rusell Travers, with the prevention of new documents revelations.
The attempt by the spokesman of the Präsidenden Barack Obama, Assange less attention, is in contrast to the views of the conservative politicians and commentators in recent days.
The Congressman Peter King of January chaired the National Security COM Mitee of the House of Representatives, has called on the State Department to investigate the possibility of Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "in order to put their money to seize and everyone they supported or contributes to follow."
Tom Flanagan, adviser of the Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to his statement, Assange must be murdered "revoked".
"Obama should turn it into a target and a not so what use bemanntes or aircraft."
Anyone not apologising, Mike Huckabee, was baptistischer minister, a former governor of Arkansas and a possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was, always in the government leaked the information, he is guilty of treason and everything is eiine no execution is too lenient punishment," he told the station, Fox.
Puigcercós addiction, with a nod to the Carod close to peace in the ERC
The Republican leaders allowed the party a secret ballot on his continuation in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the full Assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for the umpteenth time, an internal rebellion in the ranks of the aftermath of the loss of 11 congressmen and half of the voters in the direction of unemployed ERC from the way to go.
The party chairman, is aware that his threat of resignation to the close of the former party leader, Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira is not enough, but he also knows that the influence of the sector is now so weakened as her mentor itself, and he did not have the same headaches will spread, like other former currents.
That is why the leaders of Esquerre with a nod to the new to win over critics in his position until the next local elections would secure.
For the early kündete yesterday that the more than 200 regional Council members of ERC is over its continued presence in office could secret.
With ballot papers, not with superior hand.
If the Carodisten the Präsidenen wanted to miss a bank, it could do this without fear of reprisals.
Indeed, the head of both the impression of divisions, as well as the subjugation to his person.
In various interviews he has confirmed that he would, with half of the vote plus one not feel confirmed, and he added without% values, "as a result, the Bulgarian style" would not be a good thing.
The Carod close to the president are demanding more than just the party office. An inadequate gesture, since Puigcercós the supreme body of Congress to control.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to further resignations, will be the chairman of an action plan from now until May.
For that, they expect in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation that the leadership on 18 to the vote in the Council is to be able to take part.
Their intention is to guarantee for Puigcercós. In return, this promise to the US Congress in the fall of 2011, with the party already top for a fact.
The leader of the ERC is of the opinion that the "Polyphonie" a pity stability, and it seeks to once and for all, the organisation to be able to bring their dirty linen, launder behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article the President-in-Office Conseller Josep Huguet, symptomatic signed in his blog.
In light of this, it is more than an ideologue Puigcercós the holders of Innovació it for a fact that the party chairman "in exchange for" a number of targets will be based.
He was one of five, two of which are in the forefront.
First, the "restructuring" of the board of directors, so that at least 90% of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carods environment.
The second could the great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC should the General Assembly principle as a functioning finally give up.
He thus verfechtet a reform of the statute, which allows the Congress with elected delegates.
By the end of the full Assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - is Puigcercós' team, which has been at the last two conferences fought, obsessively.
Indeed, on the bebenden Assembly in 2008, the party leadership with the review of the General Assembly, the principle of a Congress with the reform of the regulations should be concerned.
This deadline is out, because of the internal Aufruhe infogle the last few years, addressing the matter was not advisable.
Now, with the critical sectors on the lookout, could be the time to take up the matter once and for all.

Obama is in favor of the law in Twitter for undokumentierter student
"If you need for the adoption of the Dream Act - law are, then call your senators and is pushing for the passage of this bill," twitterte of the President of the United States, in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act, a law to legalise undokumentierter students with a message on his personal blog in the social network Twitter.
"If you need for the adoption of the Dream Act - law are, then call your senators and is pushing for the passage of this bill," twitterte Obama.
His brief communication contains a cyber link to a broader document, which calls on the public, with their senators unterzüglich to enter into contact with the vote of the law is imminent.
"With your voice, in which we are waiting for is the time to listen to you," he said.
The news has been widespread, after the 42 Republican senators androhten, all vote for each law, except to block the extension of the tax rebates from the time of Bush and the funding of the government would be extended.
Such a blockade in one of the 42 Republican senators signed letter was announced, could be on the vote of the Dream Act, law and other projects, such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons.
The Republicans on the blockade of the law and asked the Dream Act other projects, said the presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs that he trust that, once the tax issue is resolved, a timetable for the rest of the projects could be set up.
"I believe that we have a lot of time..."
"All we agree that the tax issue will have to be completed before the end of the year..."
"I believe that we can reach an agreement and then we will be able to plan the rest of the proceedings," he said.
The chairman of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, kündete on Tuesday, "it would be the vote to stop the debate" to apply for the Dream Act, a law that the initiative to legalise undokumentierter students from next Thursday could be voted on in the Senate, despite the fact that the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act, law or the law of the American dream would roughly 800 thousand young people who immigrated to the United States, as they were not yet 16 years old, during the last five years have lived in this country, and a higher education facility or in the army are enrolled.
But the supporters of the bill need 60 votes to pass the initiative, which is why they are on the votes of a handful of Republicans are needed time to organise. The organisations the champion of this project an intensive involvement in the passage of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, said one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, he would vote against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced his support of the law.
It is therefore imperative that the defenders of the Dream Act several Republicans on their hand, if other Democrats should decide to turn our backs on the initiative.
The most umworbenen Republicans are from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, the mandate of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans, who have in the past supported the Dream Act, Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson in Texas, but they said that it no longer on another occasion.
Another Republican who voted for the bill, John McCain, has its position has not yet been established.
Although the House of Representatives, has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate before the biggest obstacles.
Literature with his finger in the wound
The second round of 'The mood of the language was a walk, in which the participants were strong for the narrative
"It has to do with the sex in the language I do understand, but... The finger in the wound? What will be expected of me?" Asked the writer, Luisa Valenzuela, the second round of Los placeres de la lengua 'should open, a cycle, the Spanish-speaking literature and celebrated on this occasion, be subtitled her question used (at another event was the round table the sex in the language, she said).
The finger in a sore... "brings difficulties for us," the Argentine Schriftstellein spuckte fresh the audience, which is mainly made up of young people comprising on the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL), Marisol Shultz moderierten to this table, where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text, she dedicated and Gonzalo Celorio the Shultz later as a great narrative marked Luisa told in the first person, and is a champion, the search is on to find out what a "wound" and from doctor to doctor, it was no answer, but references to the guidance of its narrative.
The Infektologen co-decision-maker they convinced: "Patience is not my strength, perhaps it is my wound."
At the end, after a frustrating draw closer to the clinical trauma theorists, it is in the middle of the track, and the breath raubte but said that wound is not a scientific term, enthült the Psychoanalytiker the secret: "The wound is that really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the narrative sighs easier and that they are "closing the wound only learned that this is truly an open and does not exist." But she is convinced that the mood in the language of their traps and mingle.
Valenzuela, the writer, and played with both.
The Nicaraguans Sergio Ramírez asked a entzückende narrative, which he called 'praise of invention, and the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but is discovered.
With allusions to the magical realism he tells of a famous sorceress who the clouds, far gereiste men, or the back of a girl lost virtue restored, and the narrative, made a U-turn and told of America, the great novel of the start to his own doctors, and he cites Bernal Díaz del Castillo, of the abundance of the Eroberen told stories of criticism.
Cervantes, "all of us (the writer) invited spottete the sham witnesses who described in the true stories, but in other ways the story of America's never been told - with imagination, even the sense of shame has been lost."
However, he points out, "it is the fool and liar, the best things imagine," and there are coming closer to reality and lie closer to each other, which we do not know to which side of the narrative is where the fictitious literature reached the top.
In fact, he is calling it the 'tradition of Cervantes'.
"He inherited, we have to be what they are."
As Mayra Montero in the series was the writer commented, and praised the variety of interpretations to which the invitation of FIl to the table, 'The finger in the wound "contributed.
The Kubanerin Puertorikanerin and dedicated their contribution of the large wound of social violence that afflicts their country - such as the whole of Latin America - as a result of the fighting for control of the drug trade.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs, a tacit, not deliberate commitment there," she said, after they had highlighted that literary communication and commitment is between the author and the readers, as with a "chemical reaction".
The evening, the Spanish poet Luis García, whose contribution Montero also "this finger of the dedicated writer in the wound" hevorhob of the writer.
He noted that in a fast-moving world, the intellectual habits and control of the awareness of dogmatism and forget that "behind every confirmation of a small no, and that behind every denial a small yes."
"To be in the possession of our ideas and the reality of the situation, we need to be moderate, and moderate means often, the fingers in the wounds, and to those who harass, which is much more comfortable, if they are in the form of caricatures, in black and white, prefabricated ideas without nuances of thinking, and the powerful, which prefer that the world in black and white, of categorizing said he and invited to rediscover the meaning of the letter.
Romano is fighting his first title
Rubén Omar Romano is looking at three defeats in Endspielen back that he has the experience and downs in his career, but he has played three important games.
The duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the final are also two different, their respective coaches pre-determined styles and contradictions of this meeting is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano is looking at three defeats in Endspielen back that he has the experience and downs in his career, but he has had three key games, and so far he has done well, and that is why this opportunity is of particular importance for him.
The Argentines, with the coin the second champion overworked, it is a step behind the victors of expectations and, amazingly, he fought successive Endspiele with the same team.
The santistische strategist, the first end game as coach of the 'Torneo Apertura 2002, when del Morelia in the driving seat, with which he has had against Toluca 4-2 with a great defeat; later, it was in the' Clausura '2003 he achieved the crucial duel he lost against Rayados to 3-1.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010 "in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén has had a setback, because the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of the game was tied, but at the time he came forward and got to 3-1 two ways to take the title, but ultimately misguided three of his players the 11 steps and opposing the game into a 4-3.
Rubén already had two Endspiele with the Diablos Rojos and Monterrey, his major rivals lost. This is why he would not be prosecuted by the accident and the evil sorcerer lift in order to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, even though he said that for him the most important thing is the game itself.
"I want to be champion, I would like to, it is not statistics break for a club that for my affection, I hingebe, and so will the title come to see me, but what happened before, is the most important thing," commented the tax man, when we asked him about the lost Endspiele.
The last end game is still very much in our minds, he has been assured, he learned a lot from it, and to have said: "The only lesson that we can draw from this is that, until the referee not the end of the act, can we not celebrate in the line that we are prepared, that the players, too, because the last time we were with two Elfmetern already prepared to depart, and I believe that this is a lesson not until the game is over, there is no cause for celebration."
To know that this series be decided by shootout, concerned it could not, because he trusts his players: "You never want to get in the shootout, we would like to finish in the regular game time, but sometimes there is no alternative, and you have to be prepared in the previous tour, we were prepared, but unfortunately, we were the fate of a bad game, sometimes as a result of the intense desire of nervousness, or that the title already in the hands of the left us something for the final, and we hope that this time it will not happen."
Romanso it is in power, not just the second to be a champion for the first time, and the glory, the cost to the title.

The hotel owner, José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourists have been on the lack of prevention and the lack of Instandhaltungsarbeitung on the part of the city.
"The community has to assume their responsibilities and avoid that happening again, as they are doing this? Well, by a preventive maintenance, in retrospect, rather than repair," he said.

The new single is no unanimity

However, the announcement by Wednesday, more than a surprise.
We have to say that this measure, at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebecer police service on 29 October last year despite the presence of Robert Dutils not in the slightest.

He is of the opinion that the Quebec the examination control the same power as Commissioners, which could give it would allow the people to the statement.
The formation of the unity is not the only project in the drawers Charest the government.
The Quebec Ottawa will also demand that the penal code in order to better at this type of crime to be stopped.

A Dupont partly reprimanded
The Quebecer radio presenter, Mr Dupont said in the Canadian boards for broadcasting standards (CCNR) because of his controversial statements on social care and Haitians, as well as for its ausfälligen way of talking about a partial setback.
The CCNR believes, M. Dupont and his CHOI 98,1 FM-Team had the right to their own opinion, but it would have certain statements "inaccurate information on the social care and unjustified negative portrayals of the Haitians and also ungehobelte speech in such a way that the commercials broadcast during the day is not adequate."
The supervisory board also had finally concluded that a discussion about suicide, contains the names of two people who have committed suicide, is against the code of Rundfunkübertragung.
The CCNR had a number of complaints relating to the during of in the period between 2008 and 2010, broadcast comments made broadcasts.
The first was made available as a result of a complaint of "frontline commun of personnes assistées sociales du Quebec".
The activist organisation had complained that the figures quoted in the programme were inaccurate.
The hosts should be solid and misleading information.
On the issue of suicide had a moderator, Mr Dupont said that the suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the board members had the conclusion that the message conveyed was that suicide is not a solution to the crisis of life should be considered.
"The majority of the oversight council to take into account the uncertainty of the effects of the" Dupont le Midi "a sensitive topic in families, fairer and more appropriate manner" had raised.
So it was with no censure against his person.
The last point of contention concerned the claims, which referred to the earthquake in Haiti.
Jean-René Dufort Stéphane Dupont and media had an effective argument that we have a range of reactions.
The CHOI-Moderator had said, not for the benefit of the Haiti-Hilfe to have donated that, because we do not know with certainty whether those who need it, really would receive the donations.
The supervisory board is of the opinion that these comments were not abusive nature, but their cumulative effect of an unwarranted negative picture of the Haitians.
"I have already received my three-day suspension penalty abgebüßt in this matter."
"My acts is jungfräulich for a year and a half," said the presenter.
In all decisions denounces the supervisory board the spread of a ungehobelten way.
In all cases the CHOI-FM Rundfunkansager "beyond its obligations".
The consequences for the radio stations, which among other things, his decisions during the prime time unique within a period of three days, had intended to inform, is negligible.

Personally, I am looking for the fight continues, as for those who fight, the soil, it mixed fight arts competitions, do not like, are scarce in North America. "
Recently had his mark as a security officer, as well as workers in the firm employed his rivals UPS complained of bad news in which he taught, in the between 23 and 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland, most of the World Cup the amateurs two gold medals from the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) won.

450 million in contracts without tendering
By mutual agreement, Hydro-Québec project planning firms 450 million dollars in contracts for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert approved.
Amid this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium, consisting of the firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM Axor and that the most important part of the project, which is led to a total of 295 million dollars without tendering has received.
This consortium called "Énergie gérance" was 2004 as a corollary of the decision by Hydro-Québec, the private sector is their responsibility, this important hydroelectric project to the tune of a $5 billion dollar's formed.
"The consortium at the beginning of 2005 ergatterte Énergie gérance" the lucrative contract without a public tender had been made.
For the Parti Québécois is resorting to business consortia a serious ethical problem that the risk of Wettbewerbsverdrändung, as well as a price increase.
"This is a new way to a conspiracy and discredited the competition."
"This means that rather than fix games rather than secret way now carrying out" in an open way, yesterday said Sylvain Simard, a member of the PQ, at the press conference.
Simard was early in the morning, the question before the National Assembly that raised him because it seems hard to understand how the interests of the public in this way can be served.
Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted in the afternoon, they vehemently deny, that this treaty is a stitch-up.
"I am sticking to my line, they lashed out," confirmed by the PQ was "dishonest" and "lack of rigour".
She said that it was "the very least that the PQ, sorry.
The model of the consortium is common practice throughout the world.
It is usually at a time of such temporary alliance that two or more companies their expertise on a commandment to a tender for a complex project.
"East Main" the project has a high level of complexity in relation to the scale of his work.
The construction techniques is in progress and is expected to be drawn up until 2012.
However, the contract has been awarded to a competition that had to take place; it had been negotiations.
In addition, the model of the consortium in Quebec, with relatively simple projects no longer an exception.
As the newspaper Le Devoir "last week, has pointed out, this is in the area of Bauingenieur- and advisory professionals applied model of the consortium are the subject of government investigations.
A brief overflying the Quebecer companies register, it allows us to appoint more than 200 consortia of consistent, some of which appear to be permanent.
In this way, Dessau, for example, the company is working in partnership with the majority of its key competitors, Cima +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult count.
Any link, and there are several dozen, leads to one and the same person, which is legal in Dessau.
The consortium which "Énergie gérance", Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Baie James a special workforce is dynamic and that this fact Hydro-Québec since the 1970s, in particular way pays to account".
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement the nose has rümpfen on the fact that the contract for the project led to the deal has been agreed.
"If you have an invitation, and there are only a few applicants are your prices soaring."
"You have two options: Either you do the people who are in this Mart and say: We will give you a satisfactory agreement to negotiate a good price."
"The idea, however, is that it is not the price is crucial, but the expertise of the people," said Laporte.
The consortium "Énergie gérance" approved contract is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were from either the Hydro-Québec or SEBJ Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert approved for the project.
After reviewing was the newspaper Le Devoir "more than 100 Ingenieurs- and consultant contracts, the companies or their branches, including, in particular, resources laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010 were awarded.
SNC-Lavalin had 22 contracts are gerafft Génivar, had 16, 14 and 10, Dessau Tecsult here without their participation in "Énergie gérance" constructions.
All these agreements have been negotiated.
It is estimated the total of 783 344 $449, including the Treaty with "Énergie gérance" about 295 131 564 $.
Sylvain Simard had indicated that the four companies, which the consortium of form (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM) and the Axor "Parti libéral du Quebec well known."
Normandeau Secretary, had let slip that the PQ is equally with the firms that it was "funded" clarified before it, that it was their leaders.
Barometers verantworungsbewußten consumption - The "green" label is not heartening
Green, but openly sceptical.
The Quebecer consumer has little confidence to the key players of sustainable growth, however, does little to rival brands or eco-fee labels, which are supposed to manage his campaign.
A pity, even though it is in a media universe swimming, where information in favour of responsible consumption only so far: The barometer responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to complain about a lack of the brake recognizable as his commitment as the first reading showed, which was held yesterday.
Although the use of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, have pursued Quebecer however, appear to those who try to sell it little credit.
Quebecer, two thirds of the population, are, in fact, the environmental commitment of the firms nor to believe such as green companies advertising, tells the responsible Consumer Centre at the University of Sherbrooke fancy yardstick.
Another fact: Half of consumers is casting doubt on the credibility of the official attached to the supposedly fair products certificates, but also of the credibility of the products and brands, and disposing of the closet, so the scoreboard.
Along the same lines, the rhetoric of the politicians on the issue of only 14.6% of Quebecer people seriously.
The information about responsible consumption seems, however, important to stimulate this consumer segment, which is currently only a third of the approximately Quebecer consumers.
Indeed dämpften void and of dubious nature of the information the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is after the higher price of the products the second, from the barometer identified brakes.
In addition, a third of the Quebecer of the performance of the green products and services that they have to put in the effort, with mistrust.
According to a another communication had already over half of consumers have changed their habits in 2010, and the bulk of the brand and forth, one or more of the products of their conviction.
According to Eurobarometer they had also to 61% of purchases dealers in their neighbourhood and buying food to be grown in their region.
Green and responsible - the index of environmental friendly consumption this year had a 64 in the maximum value of 100 - Homo consumus of the Quebec loves, as King of recycling, who is trying to present its left traces in the environment, and to reduce the protection of animals.
But the social and ecological consciousness seems nevertheless to his car, so the scoreboard: Just 28% of Quebecer have indicated that, in the year 2010 to use public transport or the Mitfahrzentrale prefers to their ecological interest to demonstrate.
The walking and cycling were also 39,1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey supported the stereotypes.
State loan for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebecer government, the Société Angus and the companies parallèle was asked financially to the takeover of the cinema complex eXcentris, to participate in a cooperation agreement, but only in the form of a competitive loan.
The developers society Angus and the company parallèle, a donation to the tune of $7 million from the acquisition of Daniel Langlois Kultusministerium which cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent had hoped to restore this function to its actual cineastischen that do not seem to get what they asked for.
While the government has accepted that in this case, but on their own terms.
Instead of the expected donation offers the Quebecer government rather a loan in less than initially expected, which is a viable solution to create favourable conditions could, at least in the view of the state from the scaremongers entnehmbaren sources.
The first plan of action and a question after 12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, which was again Bittgesuch overall, since the revised downwards.
The proposal, along with an action plan has already been made by the President of the "Société de développement of entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola St-Pierre, minister, which is in charge of the Act eXcentris.
Several days ago, he had to give her a recent technical report.
The proposal, however, was the SODEC of the Cabinet on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until December 31 to respond this time.
In any case, it seems that the premise of the state donation really been pushed to the side.
Let us remember that the Quebecer owners community of cinema and cinema complex against a direct state investment to support the adoption of eXcentris had revolted by making the argument, the Culture Minister, have issued no financial help for real estate projects there, which he does not have other cinema.
Several other market participants, however, the segment charged in contrast, substantial economic aid.
Cinema chief Daniel Langlois had the self-financed design of the cinema over ten years with great difficulty, the authors cinema in the premises of its cinema complex, with the exception of the treasury could justify.
The lack of cinema, the independent films show, it is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew his client on board.
Société Angus, as well as the companies with Christian parallèle Yaccarini at the top, in turn a privately financed Campagne, of which it is a sum 700 000 $hope to purchase.
Since early 2009 continues only one continued to screen films in eXcentris, Le parallèle to show.
The aim of the prospective purchasers, it is that the three cinemas on 27 February of next year, with the spectacle of a very fine film by Xavier Beauvois "The hommes et des Dieux 'open up.
Christian Yaccarini but the newspaper Le Devoir "not removed, and it ignores what he and his group of the revised downwards proposals to keep them.
Mystery of komplexgeschüttelten Canada lifted
The new American diplomatic cables by Wikileaks were spread to reveal the secret about what the United Nations under the inferiority complex of the Canadians to the Americans think they are, but with the same blow the superiority the latter to Canada.
Consequently, the American diplomats surprised that the Canadian voters to the ballot not the kanadisch-amerikanischen relations in the country, and they believe that the visit by President Obama, would have helped the Conservative government, its budget from 2009.
The four new communications between the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which have been circulated to the public yesterday, still offer more juicy details than the substantive content, in which it has a very bad outcome.
A carved from 22 September 2008, in other words, the period in which the federal Wahlkampage claimed in full swing, it was reported, the point at which the United Nations to the operations of their political leaders are discussing.
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, the American Ambassador in Ottawa used.
Mr Wilkins statement offers different opportunities in this situation.
"The Canadians almost innewohnender inferiority complex, possibly led the Canadian, political leaders are more likely to do so, on the internal issues of everyday life, as the United States in this election the buck (as in 1988, when the campaign on free trade)", as he describes.
The United Nations, and, thus, end, he concludes, "the proverbial Goliath of this election: Omnipresent, but potentially to threatening to to talk about him."
The ambassador, understands the "deafening silence" the less, given that the two countries have close political and economic ties.
"Logically," he should be assessed, "the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leaders to drive such a crucial relationship, the voters at the polls as a key factor in the end."
The other expression of this sense of importance is read on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, business sources in Ottawa, sent communication, which President Barack Obama, on his first visit to Ottawa to prepare.
"Their trip will help in the continuation of the government in a confidence vote on the federal budget at the beginning of February, with the Canada its first deficit after more than a decade, will announce the result of a recovery programme in the $30 to $40 billion in Breese," was born.
Nowhere, he had said that the government had to postpone parliamentary session before Christmas, in order to prevent Parliament from the coalition would be overthrown and the conditional the opposition parties on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another, in January 2008, and carved from the ambassador wrote communication Wilkins agreed by Washington is becoming increasingly negative image that the broadcast on CBC, dramatic series from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about programmes such as Border, little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little subtle innuendo to Maher Arar, "or even the" No-Fly-List contributions for the purposes of the CIA interrogations conducted by Muskelprotze could see.
Other communication reported in detail about how Hillary Clinton remarked in its French counterpart, Bernard Kouchner, in their first bilateral meeting then asked whether Europe was ready, some of the detainees from Guantanamo Bay.
Mr Kouchner will have answered yes to the question, but on the basis of an individual 'case to case "decision.
Àm the end of the meeting, which he has described as "a piece of paper the Secretary of State in terms of Omar Khadr was handed over to a 15-year Muslims Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State, has agreed that the Act again by and watch".
Finally, we note that the mood on the website Wikileaks heated.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper set very close advisers, was on CBC said that those responsible for this massive leak "should be killed".
He was here to Mike Huckabee speaking from the United States.
World will continue to plan for the renewal of the lighting
The UN yesterday in Cancun a plan to regenerate the lighting of households, commerce and industry in 100 countries, with a view to achieving a reduction of greenhouse gas (CFC's) suggested that almost a third of the additional reduction is the equivalent of that must be implemented by 2020, in order to stabilize the earth's climate.
This ambitious plan adopted his position on the steps of the specific major projects, which it hopes to implement the UN in Cancun, in the absence of compelling reduction commitments to compensate for the developed countries.
After yesterday's plan would the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the lighting of the earth's CFC be avoided if the white glowing pears, which has a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, from fluoreszierende or, better still, by light-emitting diodes (LED) were to be replaced.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen, the last year the large Abgasemittenten such as the United States, China, Europe, and others, including Canada, to voluntary reduction plans to the global CFCs emissions of 53 Gt Gt to 49 should be downsized.
By this account, you would have to withdraw, but still 5 Gt from now until 2020 climate increase of 2 degrees Celsius to stabilise to prevent this out of control.
In the know fervent pears hole 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and produce the remaining 5% of the light.
With the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reduced energy consumption by 75%, with the new LED bulbs, reduced the need for energy is once again at twice that.
Keep the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen, on average, between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those that the producer Philips this week has put them on the market, the company has also taken part in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white ardent pear, with a hint of the savings of the Auswechselungsplanes over 100 countries, is to be applied.
In addition to the fact that iese entirely new light bulbs very little heat, they can rule with a resistance work.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reserves, because they contain mercury and that it must therefore as hazardous waste dump, which, in the developing countries is not always possible, except the producers are an adoption centre.
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, however, not the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit far more mercury of the white glowing pears wasted to generate electricity.
In the United States alone that coal-fired power stations are 25,000 tons of mercury each year.
The report sets out in detail the profits, which each country thanks to this international program would generate.
Indonesia, for example, would be a billion dollars a year in buying electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means save the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power stations, whose spiritual Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast expected criticism of the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, the "immediate" the publication of the results of the presidential election in the Ivory Coast, directly after the deadline.

On Wednesday, many calls from all over the world, according the CEI will become, at long last, but the name of the victors of the second round of elections, under which the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and Alassane Ouattara which opponents say.
The Gbagbo camp expects but with the cancellation of "fraudulent" votes in the north by the Constitutional Council, which the Ex-Rebellenlager the Forces Nouvelles (FN) during the September 2002 abortive coup.
Pascal Affi N 'Guessan, the head of the presidential campaign from the Ivory Coast, was confirmed that on the part of the FN's practice manoeuvres on the intimidation of voters in the north of the country the President's supporters had discouraged to go out and vote.
The whole of the election could be declared invalid, if the complaints lodged by Gbagbo to be taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
The Gbagbo-Kontrahenten, however, are now of the opinion that the highest court in the country, since it was not neutral by Paul Yao N 'Dré, a politically connected closely with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, the man of the north, any link to the Ex-Rebellen denies that the delay in announcing the election results as "unacceptable" and Gbagbo asked to respect, even if he is not gone so far as to call for the victory.
His Bündnisparter, Gbagbo blockiere the publication of the results, because he knew that he had lost a complaint; and to submit to the Constitutional Court, after the Electoral Commission have prevented to publish the results, seie illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday, for the crowning glory of the association and reconciliation process of a country, which over the years has been divided into two parts.
The United Nations had, on Wednesday, the politicians of the Ivory Coast, has warned that it might in the case of any riots responsible for these to be kept.

"Making noise," they said, 'roots, loud and clear and without constantly "the words' fundamental human rights," "virginity" and "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to ensure that the Iranian regime to embarrass the very sensitive about its image.
"This is all the more, since you ask, the Iranians not to do that."
Because 'silence solves nothing, "the debate over experiments on unauffälligem ways, the Iranians are" master in Ausweichmanövern. "
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners a "normal", Iranian tactics: "Hostage-taking for the purposes of political blackmail".
He announces, Clotilde Reiss's release from jail on 16 August (which should come to the days where they could take refuge in the French Embassy) "demand the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros bail).
And he can say, the Elysée antizipiere further hostage-taking, "a phenomenon that will become even more acute."
The Iranians could be "in the near future, one of the other approximately 1,800 French citizens arrest living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is above 12 days has been released from prison, but he will continue to be held in Iran.
The information was in circulation: The Iranians Majid Kakavand, whose extradition to the United States as a result of the illegal trade with empfindlichem electronics materials to Iran, is calling for a ruling by a judge in Paris, has been released from custody.
The American Embassy is, as with many other observers, questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the material provided to the nuclear programme, is the release of Majid Khakavand a bad news.
France has a horse trading in the process?
The release of the Iranian, against one of the French?
During a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assured that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised" by the decision of the judge, but have also tried, this is it.
"There was a heated exchange between the French Bureau and the French Justice Minister Michèle Alliot-Marie been" (currently), but "the French government can not change the judicial decision," he says.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand "tough" to continue under the supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée-Berater elects a telephone number, and again, then informed the American diplomat, the Iranians "is currently in the chair of the Iranian embassy buildings in Paris."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran spare the Elysée his efforts not to use the statements and the media "organised" flight tests to make us believe that the Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential role".
The Americans are watching this activity is not without irony, and note that the manipulation of bears fruit, as a number of articles in the press the official French version.
A telegram on 25 August 2009 datierendes underutilization of "the media" lightning the French authorities.
"So much is based on what you can," Mr Assad, wonders the Paris message.
"Despite their statements Lobpreis the French authorities to secretly, that they have only a vague idea what the Syrians really have done."
The document deals with the reasons, then, to the Elysée to this fiction.
The intense communication efforts "aimed at Sarkozy's policies of opening to Syria," analyzed to confirm it.
Launched in 2008, a policy that was "of many critics of the vote in France and abroad as premature and undeserved has been carried out".
"The Syrian role aufbauschend" Paris "Syria is trying to show what they can achieve, laud by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "discord between Syria and Iran to sow '.
The American Embassy know from good source.
On 11 August had François Richier to her: "Of course we do not know whether the Syrians what also have always done".
"In spite of everything, but we are grateful to them."
"This should at least cause confusion on the part of the Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss, on 16 May 2010 to France.

In a statement, he thanked the president of Brazil, the Senegal and Syria, for their "active role" in favour of the release of our compatriot.
No Internet gambling for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will be a law, known as "the Aschenbrödel", which the young would be banned after midnight Online-Games to play, by giving them access, so worsening government responsible.
A draft law, which is to call upon Online-Spiele-Betreiber young people under the age of 16 after midnight access to these Games to bar will be presented in December, the House of Representatives Education and families ago, government ministries.
"Many children play these Games all night long, and then have problems with learning in school, and thus a normal life by day."
"We are of the opinion that the law is necessary for their health, and to ensure their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, with this draft legislation betrauter Ministerialbeauftragter of the French news agency Agence France Presse.
The Online-Games are then again 6 o'clock in the morning.
The manufacturers companies would have a year long time to prepare for the application of the law, he clarified.
Fasser the government as well, the producers each day to ask for access to these Games are scaling back the time limit those young people whose parents ask, added the person responsible.
He will, as well as those individuals who want it, free programmes available, which will make it possible to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "wired" countries, and the newspapers on a regular basis by various associated events with more intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion in global Online-Game-Wettbewerben.
In November, South Korea with 58 other nations four gold medals in the World Cyber Games.
World Cup: The FIFA appoints the 2018-2022 Ausrichterland
In a state of great excitement because of suspicions of corruption, which appoints the executive committee of the FIFA on Thursday the Ausrichterländer of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, a highly political election, in which the rangeln for influence, as well as the lobbying the technical criteria to push into the background.
One thing is certain: The spending 2018 FIFA the King discipline in Europe, its traditional stronghold, (the four candidates: England, Russia, Spanien-Portugal, Netherlands and Belgium).
The 2022 will then be somewhat exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be the first on the African continent in the 2010 new territories (Qatar, Australia) to be able to win, or its branch in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea) to follow.
The list of people to be part of the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch leader, Beckham, Zidane, Cruyff) is a measure of economic and political use of the World Cup.
The machinations behind the scenes to threaten until the last minute.
Difficult otherwise, a hierarchy of the candidates.
After the evaluation report of FIFA, the English, offer spanisch-portugiesische (2018) and American (2022) acts bessseren arguments than that of its competitors.
But these considerations for the 22 members of the Exekutifkommitees the time of the election is not so important.
The Sunday Times that with the finding of the suspension of two members of the Exekutifkommitees (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the revelations, might as well have the opportunities for their own country, cradle of football, can ruin that only once the World Cup was allowed to fight, 1966.
The BBC had again been the ground on Monday, giving it a broadcast own had three senior members of the Kommitees, Ricardo Teixeira and Issa Hayatou, Nicolas Leoz is under fire.
Reason enough, FIFΑ to annoy and the English authorities to embarrass in the first place, with David Cameron in recent weeks an intensive lobbying.
The head of the government is hoping for a repeat of his predecessor Tony Blair successful chess train, in 2005 for London, the organisation of the 2012 Olympic Games had achieved.
This intensive use would be enough to allow the image of England before the Kommitee upgrade again?
Nothing is less safe, because the duo Spanien-Portugal there is no shortage of assets, with its already finished stadiums, his expertise (World Cup in Spain, 82, 92 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial downside of the two countries could dampen its ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about solvency of Spain and Portugal are the chances of Russia, which despite its flaws in the dossier (stadiums, hotels and transport) has become the influential outsiders, to rise.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided that the treaty candidly suggestion to the Bezichtigungen the English press "an unfair competition in the run-up to the vote" on the part of the Kommiteemitglieder.
"One bewirft it with dirt, trying to compromise," Putin lashed out.
For 2022, the United States, encouraged by the experience of 1994, the logical favorite.
First economic world power, the seat of the FIFA-Hauptsponsoren, the country seems a long list of advantages to Japan and South Korea, which separately a very good project.
But these new nominations seem premature for two countries which co-organised the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: The long-awaited approval for the World Cup, FIFA 2026 for China, the Asian chance in 2022 lapses.
With Australia and Qatar, with the Aufwartung futuristischer stadiums had pulled out all the stops, the FIFA its expansion into new areas, however, these two countries a greater risk for certainty.
Australia may as well as Japan and South Korea under the European countries akquittierten weakness in television (due to the time shift), the sensitive nerve FIFA.
Second mandate: Offenkundigkeit
De Gaulle had clipped really.
Mitterrand had stutze believe that he was.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed not the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than that.
A mandate in the Elysée, the next.
The current head of state will, therefore, be a candidate in 2012.
But the Offenkundigkeit Mysteriums is the side of the presidential function, not look good.
So he has to pretend that the doubts now.
In one sense, as well as in the other.
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac, a third mandate is not excluded, without even to believe that.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy has assured in any serious by his decision "some time in the autumn of 2011".
On Tuesday evening that he was in the Elysée before the UMP-Parlamentariern the prospect of "two mandates" would therefore, had let slip a little Fieberhaftigkeit widespread.
This was the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The President was simply to point out that the constitution in 2008, the number of people on only two, five-year terms.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he is the presidential election, at such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You still with me in the worst case, seven and a half years, or, at best," he told them in July 2009.
In May 2010, a new, "does not believe that I am not thinking about the stage after that."
His words of yesteryear does not make him more about the candidate than the previous day, but also no less.
They should comment, then from a double reason.
The acceleration of the candidacy Wettlaufes with the PS on one side.
But it is not the start of the competition, with Ségolène Royal, Nicolas Sarkozy, to reveal to itself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, the many members of the PS early than to challenge a red card.
The bad polls on the other side.
For the first time, voters would the rights a candidacy of François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% to 44%, according to the survey of BVA-L 'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion with the UMP," responded immediately and the environment of the Prime Minister.
"If it is a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin with shares.
"He will always believe that they can win," corrected Alain Juppé, who is with the Offenkundigkeit has resigned.
Euro: The ECB is forced to maintain their buying of government securities
The final assembly of the Governing Council of the ECB in the past year, should provide an opportunity to chart how opportunities emerging from the crisis, or at least the Order of a large number of unconventional measures of monetary policy, to announce the end of the year to come to its conclusion.
The crisis of European sovereign debt, the European Central Bank in Frankfurt will undoubtedly not do more than the current tense situation in the European bond markets ambitions, not exacerbating them--is.
The political cost would be far too high.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde had yesterday during a press conference held by the ECB, active role in solving the state's budget debt of Europe.
It has not dared to say whether she thought that the central bank could do more, for example, by stimulating its programme of buying of government bonds.
"I reserve my reasons for my European trading partners (...)."
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, the day before at his confirmation hearing in Brussels by the Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament's not very eloquent about his plans, but rather simply to point out that the programme of purchases of government bonds on the secondary market, "'and that we would be allowed to continue in the Assembly on Thursday" will see, such as the decisions to be taken ".
Only certainty: The ECB will make its main interest rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the bond purchases of Treasury chamber of the European Central Bank last week doubled to around 1,35 billion euros.
And, according to some traders leaks yesterday new purchases Irish and Portuguese state papers have made.
Overall, the central banks of the euro system since May 2010 purchases of $67 billion.
Among the dealers, the anticipation of a Weiterverfolgens of the purchase rate never in doubt (see page 29).
The economists already expect a remarkable change of policy.
If the bond deals of more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB, will be that the latter or the unrestricted cash reserves to freigiebige way to create, and that is over a period of a week to three months.
The economists are already today be taken, and that this measure will extend for a few months yet.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB to alter her programme of substantial way".
"Otherwise, it would take the risk of new strains in the short term," to provoke thought Michael Schubert, economist of Commerzbank.
"One for the course of the first quarter of 2011, provided for progressive exit seems likely," "anticipates, for its part, economist Norbert Bräms in SCA meetings.
Oppenheim.
In the area of their interventions in the market, the public debt, "the ECB should such a purchase volume of bonds maintain that the sluggish market rallies," adds Norbert Bräms.
In view of the importance of the exposure of European banks to the markets of public debt in the euro zone, the central bank had no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"They need at any price to the Steller the lack of investors into the market, and so act of premature enthusiasm about the returns paid to the most vulnerable states to prevent" bezeugte yesterday an important bonds holders.
Because if interest rates to soar, would be prevented from the states even more to reduce its debt, or even to stabilise.
That is the price for the protection of the euro.
The Berlusconi government is in Italy to cover
For Italy after a worrying weeks early, the situation yesterday with the decline of Eckzinsen to 10 years a little more relaxed.
A return to the deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the finance ministers from the region have had Giulio Tremonti the situation as "unentzifferbar" and qualify it with a "weekend" unvorhersagbaren have to listen to what to expect, but was denied by the person immediately.
On Tuesday at least, the gap with the German interest rates, to its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of contracts to cover the bankruptcy risk are on 263 points, which caused a certain Kopflosigkeit in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi was in the Council of Ministers, pointed out that the discrepancy of Spain to the German interest rates 400 basis points.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, was, however, as "seriously concerned" by the "market turmoil" and the possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the eurozone, such as Greece or Ireland is not."
"The bad news is that Italy, like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, the economist on the Hudson Institute.
In plain English, that may be part of the problem is Absenz of economic growth and the attendant, schwindsüchtigen tax receipts, the government put at risk to its financing needs no longer be able to cover.
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 2012 of 1.4% in years... although the Senate is expected to consider this budget with 1.3% and 2% ahead.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculated that the budget deficit next year, 4.3% of GDP (as opposed to the governments of the projected 3.9%) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the uproar about a new budget, which collectively after the holidays to a sum of EUR 7 billion could be used.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says accountant Olli Rehn.
For the time being, given Italy the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts, which are already regulated, we have been saying for a long time," assured Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, the IMF is charged with Italy.
"At the moment there is no problem, either short-term or long-term view, since Italy, despite its high levels of debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011, A. that R.) lower Stabilisationsfortschritte than of other countries are required", observed Pier Carlo Padoan, Chef-Volkswirt the OECD.
There remains the question of the political Unstetigkeit.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi is a motion of censure, the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the preferred facing elections at the end of March, could be organised.
It is, therefore, a little window period for a decision in a severe crisis.
Europeans are thinking about the development of anti-crisis measures after
Christine Lagarde, it was still yesterday in a press conference in Paris, stressing: "I believe that it is still on Sunday afternoon, as well as in the evening proved that the Europeans think clearly, they are ready and committed to their currency, as well as their territory to defend."
Although perfect relatively - the withdrawal yesterday recorded in the interest-rate feet of European government bonds was grist to the mill of governments and the ECB.
However, the start of a normalization can still be no question.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it would note on the debt of Portugal, perhaps the most effective target of speculators, lower today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, particularly on the banking systems," it is the view of the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
"Above all, given the political time is much slower than the markets."
The European countries that are both this gap, as well as the risk that it is well aware, intensify the discussions are aimed at strengthening the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal discussions between the most directly affected finance ministers and in a wider sense, with their counterparts from the G20 is progressing well.
And this is in regard to the meetings of euro Groupe and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is today.
The plan is the fate of the unconventional measures aimed at stiffening of the countries of the euro zone in the crosshairs of the markets (see below).
What the EU-Stabilitätsfonds, whose executive director, Klaus Regling, said on Tuesday its Asien-Tour Singapour investors started in the Far East on the developments on the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of his visit is not explicit Fundraising, he certainly this to the ground.
The first part of the EU-Stabilitätsfonds Werpapierausgaben are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an American representative to the Reuters news agency, the United States supported a possible increase in the more direct involvement of the IMF mobilized Fund.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first series, are preparing for their part, structural reforms, particularly in the area of organised labour market.
Reforms to the austerity measures, however, are expected to show an effect in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid a different road than Greece and Ireland, have done.
Both the one, and the other is at any price to avoid international assistance before they seek to have its own budget, corrective and on much-needed structural reforms have decided that they have confidence in the long term.
European investors, in turn, have the options available to the normalisation process of markets from government bonds to speed up the process.
Axel Weber, on 24 November in transit in Paris, was created as a first, the idea was that if the 750 from Europe and the International Monetary Fund would be mobilized billion euro is not enough, then the Union would not hesitate to once again in their own pockets.
The economists of Barclays Capital, the market of European government debt, on adjacent player, an extension of up to 100 billion euros would be enough, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
This means: The European mechanism exists launched financial stabilisation, which currently stands at 60 billion euros.
An RAC, the attention has all the opportunities in European capitals to be investigated.
Above all, if the market conditions worsen.

In Picardy Schulverkehr was lifted Thursday.

The police "urges the drivers to the highest caution on the roads and the adjustment of its driving."
The Directorate General for Civil aviation (DGAC) urged the airlines to 25% of their Thursday by the Paris airport Roissy and 10% of the flights out of Orly to start up because of the expected heavy snow.
The DGAB recommends that the airline passengers to contact their airline.

Grand Paris Métro: First financial vignettes
Since the debate about the modernisation of the transport industry, on the Ile de France is in full swing, it rains billion.
At least in the discussions.
We call this in particular the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris in the memory, the Société du Grand Paris, is being built.
At the start of construction - the SGP to get under way, the state is a Kapitaldotation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical system, it is the sum of the SGP then that would allow the markets, a part of the financial sum on her double.
Today, it is the first projections.
The supplementary budget from 2010, this morning looked at by the finance committee of the National Assembly, contains the measures, the first part of that money.
It is about two things: The creation of a special tax to Erschließund and higher taxation of the offices on the Ile-de France.
The former, just remove Article 15 of the draft law, "for the benefit of the public corporation Société du Grand Paris."
This is quantified: "The product of these tax amounts to 117 million euros per year".
Zweitere is an overhaul of the existing corporate taxation: "In order to modernise that directs it to increase product and this increase of Société du Grand Paris on to future generations".
How much would it make?
A mystery.
That sum is not included in the text.
Of the 4 billion is a long way off.
"It is said that the fiscal resources to the 4 billion euro of Kapitaldotation to be added by the government, which will be found and the Société du Grand Paris, and that is for the project to be done", the explanatory statement.
The SGP will take place this system is not offensive.
"For the moment, in which revenue has been recorded (the two taxes, R.), can we put on for three years, and then from the 4 billion windfall", it is claimed.
"That will be taken in the budget and gradually withdrawn."
The SGP is estimated that, starting in 2013, it will be 4 billion for the budget to make a note of 2014.
This measure, which promised 4 billion will be able to look for a long time yet, is in danger of a very eventful, parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Rachsüchtige hackers and emsige spies
The dossier, WikiLeaks has a twofold significance.
On one hand, it is turning itself as the obvious scandal, a scandal, just a scandal in the Sinner hypocrisy is the Beziehunge between the countries, the public and the press.
On the other hand, it has announced major changes at international level, and is a taste of the future, which is dominated by regression.
But we are going after the series.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that all of a secret service has produced acts (of any nation) exclusively from newspaper cuttings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi's throw nothing more than what you have months anyway, in every other Journal to read (apart from those whose owners Berlusconi is), and the appalling karikaturierte Kabarettkünstlern Gaddafi's profile has been offered fuel for their Sketche a long time.
The principle of the secret dossier only are already well-known news, is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you go into a library, esotherischen publications, you will see that every station (on the grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau Templer, or the Rosenkreuzler) accurately repeating what has already been written in previous works.
This is not, therefore, that the author occult texts to publish any research (yet, therefore, that he did not know where to find news about the Nicht-Existierende would be), but because those who devote themselves to the Okkultismus nothing different than they already know and what they have learned.
This is also the success of mechanism of Dan Brown.
As well as the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or restricted spirit) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise he could be whatever, editor of Libération, for example), the only true, which he recognizes.
The Top-Secret information on Berlusconi, which the American Embassy in Rome, the Staatsdezernat had sent were the same as those who already Newsweek published the previous week.
So why was such a fuss about the revelations, this dossier?
On one side is that every educated person already know, which is that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War, and since then the Government can call each other or a plane, in order to make for dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of a few small representativity tasks in espionage centres have turned.
Any viewers by investigating films knows this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that we should act, to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact that it is open to the public, violated the task to reiterate the hypocrisy and serves to American diplomacy in a bad light.
In second place: The idea that a business-as-usual hackers most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world, can tap into the substantial blow to the prestige of the Staatsdezernats.
In addition, the scandal less the victims, rather than the 'Executioner "in trouble.
But we are giving the profound nature of what happened.
Formerly, to Orwell's time, it was all the power of a Big Brother pool, every gesture controlled his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy since then would have to be absolutely true can highlight, where every move, thanks to the phone can check every transaction, made a visit to the hotel, the elected motorway, and so on; the citizens would total victims of hard power.
However, if you look to see what is happening today that even the secret Krypten of power no longer can escape the control of a Hackers so, the Kontrollgang to unilaterally zirkelförmig to be addressed and will be.
The power to control everyone, but everyone, or at least of the hacker - chosen as the avenger of the citizen - can experience the secrets of power.
But how can a power, which is no longer able to maintain their own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel said that a real secret an open secret (and a mere secrecy can never be unveiled); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi's and Merkel's basically a secret free of Geheimis, because it exposes the public sphere; but in the styles of WikiLeaks reveal that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means any power strip.
Wikileaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What are the consequences of this injury to be such a huge power has been done?
It is obvious that the states in future no more information be reserved Online - that would be one of the street corner angeklebten Aushang.
But it is equally obvious that the current state of technology, it is to be hoped, in confidential reports on phone to keep secret.
Nothing is easier than finding out whether and when a head of state in a plane move and has been in contact with one of his colleagues.
How could in future private and only for certain ears of certain relationships?
I know very well that my forecast to be in the moment and Roman prison sounds like science fiction, but I am forced to present me with the government agents to secret way preoccupied to uncontrollable march routes moving, their messages anywhere else than in the mere memory in order, and in addition, the few written information they received in the footwear (verbergend.
The information would be in single copy are stored in locked drawers: Basically, the espionage attempt by Watergate less success, as WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology nowadays like a cancer progresses, backwards.
A century after the wireless Telegraf had revolutionized the communication, the Internet, with a reconstructed Telegrafen (telephone) wire.
The (analogue) video tapes had the film allows them tape for a film auszukundschaften band from the back forward spulen and reveal all the secrets of the installation while the (digital) CDs, now nothing more than to jump from chapter to chapter Makroportionen, in other words.
With the high-speed trains, one travelling within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this by plane, including switching three and a half hours.
So it is extraordinary that policy and communications technology in cars and horse to come back.
A final observation.
In previous times the press tried to understand what sort of secrets between the messages were forged.
Currently, there are the messages that confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France is its financial promises
A year after the Copenhagen treaty, it is time to comply with the financial promises (also quickly resolved "fast start" finance) or premature to investigate by developing countries, which have been implemented.
The rough French are already vulnerable to blandishments.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, the developing countries committed to $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has 7.2 billion euros over three years, promised France 1.26 billion euros (420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU has pulled out all the stops for its partners from the fact their efforts to persuade about Fast-Start-Finanzierungen: Detailgetreuer approach report of its Member States, press conference that large events, as well as the distribution of brochures.
The operation is a remarkable transparency and precisely for its estimated value: The developing countries and the society would like to see all the developed countries do the same for the same level of precision.
The EU announced that in 2010 to 2.2 billion euros, which they released to the right path to Respektbezollung their commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
If you look into the details, however, things are a little more complicated.
This money should be according to the Copenhagen Treaty "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional use was introduced, to the detriment of the public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the Commission had proposed a harmonisation have certain members states, including France, the process deadlocked.
Today everyone chooses the benchmark, which he regarded as the best.
The European Commission, for example, as a benchmark for those of the year for 2009: The international funding will be retained, and in the context of the funding "Fast-Start" 150 million over three years.
Other countries have similar standards, either in terms of the year, or about conditions at the level of public aid.
In return, France was of the opinion that the funding "of all new projects" of 2010 were "new and additional".
In other words, there are no references in the spending of the previous year, or at a global level of public aid.
In practical terms, the total amount of the French support of developing countries remain stable (or decrease) - France claims that his commitment to the "new and additional" funding.
Another key factor is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is no rule, and everyone chooses his Rechenmodus.
Some, such as France, are lent €1 as being equivalent to 1 donated €.
Obviously, this is hard to justify that the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investment (often linked to emissions control technology projects on effektivster based) can be justified, it is misleading to present the euro, known as the equivalent for a donated euro captured... also should only the cost of the loan for the capital donor country and commitment are counted (i.e. the equivalent of the interest rate).
But France has not in the sense that, as the following comment: "Respected" his commitment of 420 million euros, making 91.5% loans (389,8 million euros), and 8.5% donates) 36.1 million euro) - see also the document, in order to persuade yourself.
France is the only land the EU that loans to a great extent.
Germany 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands, or Slovakia (among other things) to 100% of its commitments with donations.
In other words, if the overwhelming majority of the European Union to fulfil their obligations to €1, France spends just 10 cents and understands including a comparable effort.
Beautiful Hokuspokus!
All in all, operates France in its Fast-Start-Finanzierung with a double fraud: A part of the action with a Weiterentwicklkung on time and partly with the reality of financial support.
France, manages to believe that there are 420 million "new and additional" million, in line with his promise and has spent it saves 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as it appears that it was the arbitrage Bercy, which has carried out a double negative effect) could entail; even internally (why the other members states with the donations, if there is enough to lend?), and then to the negotiations, as the emerging countries are not completely fooled...
The chapter of the premature funding only a small matter in a relatively short period, compared to the entirety of discussions about the climate.
But it could drop too many in the vast machine of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
As it always had, it is essential that his lesson from this first year of premature funding to learn.
First and foremost, France could be a change in its accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, and to do so in a spirit of respect for his obligations and compensatory justice with the other countries in the European Union.
But above all France could the discussions on the subject of a dispute of long-term financing to move forward (another key topic), and at the moment: You can escape the question of 'Verrechenbarkeit "the recording kind of its loans or not.
France could alter its position, just ahead of the curve in terms of the contentious issues, as it is in other areas.
The hope is based on the new Environment Minister Kosciusko-Morizet, which will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement on the Fast-Start of France and his vision of "Verrechenbarkeit" as well as the use of loan would inherently the international trust to raise the necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - of children's pesticides
A child of 10 years ago, on the day 81 different chemical substances, this Wednesday by the association Générations futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations) published study.
The association, said that its results "given the small number of samples analyzed no statistically significant value, but to illustrate the nature of the problems," had between July and September, which is usually within four, from an approximately 10-year child food consumed the meals plus a meal in the supermarkets in Oise bought and Paris.
This typical meals - including the formal recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day, has been just as Naschereien of laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The author of the balance sheet is stunning: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as possibly or likely to cause cancer and five as safe karziogen klassifizierte, as well as 37 substances with Endokrinin-Störfaktor, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
"Even if in the virtually all of the cases the legal limits for each chemical, individually had substance will not exceed one person's, this survey is very good that the reality in which the consumer may be carcinogenic chemicals or substances with Endokrinin-Störfaktor is suspended, it is worrying," said the association.
For breakfast contain only the butter and tea with milk have already been more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three sure provability as carcinogenic, as well as more than 20, which may affect the hormonal system.
Brazil imported apple, as between meal for the study, there are traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, in lunch included, where traces of a study in the EU are strictly banned Insektizids said.
In addition, the Hacksteak, the tuna from the Pandora, even the Baguette and chewing gum of pesticides and other chemicals tableau.
In the tap water, the analyses the presence of nitrates and Chloroform to the fore.
At the dinner was the salmon steak with 34 identified, chemical residues in the "richest", and even of putting the meal in the microwave used plastic plate was not free.
The final finite risk of this "harmful" cocktail "for the consumers will probably undervalued," according to the study.
The "Alliance eEurope Ecologie-Les Verts" (EE-LV), for its part, has "given the urgency of the situation," and proposed a moratorium on the use of pesticides, "the increase in diseases of civilisation".
In July a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) regard to the presence of residues 365 different pesticides in fruit and vegetables identified identified in Europe are consumed, including 76 in cereals.
