What should they do the SSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "Konditorei."
The new Ratsherrs of capital from the ranks of the SSD will obviously need to overcome certain language barriers to their alt-neu colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and the city representation even able to understand.
The newspaper Aktuáln.Cz members of the new Council from the SSD times a little "abgeklopft," as they dominate the notorious slang that has become common practice in recent years, in which the current coalition partners have been at the helm in Prague.
The encoded vocabulary in the elapsed era of Mayor Pavel Bém was introduced by the Prague political elite, some of the best-known actors, situations and Causae.
Surprisingly, showed that the new councils in relation to these new notions somewhat in the dark.
They claim that at least.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I am more a newcomer in the Prague policy," responded Luká Kaucký, the new town councillor for culture, on the test of "Paten-Wortschatzes."
But the town councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran, responded in a similar way.
As an example of the term "golf hole."
"This is the only expression of which you present me here, I occasionally use."
"Otherwise, I do not think much of slang."
For the vocabulary, the daily newspaper Aktuáln.Cz in this year's June had published before the election Congress of the ODS, pickte editors six concepts, it turned out, especially those notoriously associated with the Prague government.
The Social Democrats should the terms "Voldemort," "greatest Prague golf hole ',' go in the Konditorei ',' bull nacken ',' betrayal of the capital" and "verblechen" define.
Three Prague Ratsherrs agreed the test on the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - first promised his participation at the meeting, then less than the listeners.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, the test was rejected from the outset.
"These things are not mind and how the Civic Democrats talk among themselves about it, I am not passing judgement."
"For me is important, as we understand in the context of our programmes," he countered.
As indicated, would have been Luká Kaucký in the abovementioned headline allegedly not realised that the influential businessman and friend of the Ex-Oberbürgermeister Bém, Roman Janouek of the speech.
The term "Voldemort," Kaucky says nothing at all and the only word that he was at the test correctly, erriet "the greatest Prague golf hole."
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, to safety but added: "But I know that more from the newspaper."
And jokingly: "I will probably need to show a language course."
The "golf hole" will not only of matador Karel Březina, but also from the town councillor for the Environment Luká Plachý right as a tunnel Blanka entziffert.
Both Social Democrats also know for whom the term Voldemort and Luká Plachý idea even where to find this figure and thereby also what it means, "to go in the Konditorei."
"I think it is to go into any Prague catering industry" is pretty Plachý close to the solution to the problem, if you know that this is the seat of Janoueks firms.
In accordance with Březina but he claimed that this knowledge to have drawn from the newspaper rather than for him this vocabulary would own.
According to the Testteilnehmern judging by, it seems really under the Social Democrats no similar popular slang.
"I asked my colleagues, but obviously there is something we are really not."
"We call upon us by name, occasionally we use acronym or colorful names," says the chairman of the Prague SSD Petr Hulínský - from his party peers casual 'Hulda'.
"I was in the school Bíza (Birke) mentioned, but I do not know whether my colleagues so call" tells us Karel Březina his nickname of.
The newspaper Deník Aktuáln.Cz has tried out the name and behold, it works.
Weinert councillor for the party peers friendly "one's grandfather" or less friendly to the "old" Representative Miroslav Poche before the elections by machinations in the party sponsorship drew attention from some colleagues "Igráek" (famous Czech do figure) mentioned.
Colorful names are the only the Social Democrats in the intra-Party parlance permit.
Hulínský, it may not be alleged if it "Hulda," but Deník Aktuáln.Cz registered yet another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname of "doctor Gummiknüppel-Rechte" was supposed to do that Petr Hulínský its title Doctor juris has acquired in the Bratislaver police academy.
The government wants the torture of " witches have ' stop and gave a brochure, it turned out
Women in Burkina Faso are being branded witches, usually some common social features.
They include more of the older generation, they find no work - for example for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
If one of these women is becoming a witch ," they will be strictly isolated, so that the rest of the village cannot be dangerous.
"Men are affected by this fate quite rare."
"Remains too young and healthy women are spared this, because they help the work and bear children," an investiture nurse describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a Spezialheim care for more than 100 women who were expelled from their communities.
Now, the local government decided against these abnormal "social action" to proceed.
And it was a brochure out of this reason, "tracking" to prevent.
However, the thing has a downside.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read" instructed the newspaper "derStandard" towards the dilemma of the written enlightenment.
The witchcraft accusations but also in other African countries commonplace.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, was the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová of three women and two men were tortured to death, they fanned them with kerosene and burned simply.
Reported this incident, including the server BBC.
However, the perpetrators claimed that the matter would only have been a coincidence unfortunate circumstances.
Oil is your version, which will be used for ritual Salbungen inflamed.
And, after the group tried, "an evil spirit" of the woman "exorcise."
The isolation of "witches have" support the people here regardless of their education.
"The Standard quoted on this a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso:" fresser the inside of human souls before as today a danger, " he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso at least endeavoured to defuse the witch-hunt, the gambia American president in the last year the President himself properly mitgemischt.
"President Yahya Jammeh sparked a monstrous witch-hunt after the death of his aunt, since these alleged share of their death had and would now try to also kill the President himself by black magic."
"To this end, he called Schamane to help from the Middle Guinea, accompanied by policemen, soldiers and the bodyguard of President indiscriminately arrested women and men violently kidnapped from gambia villages and brought to the farm of the President in Kanilai," led the organisation Amnesty International in its report.
On the farm, the imprisoned people were forced to drink a Absud with halluzinogener effect from plants, but also bowel and Nierenprobleme reaction.
Two of the arretiert people survived the stay on the farm is not.
It was only because of international pressure were almost a thousand prisoners released.
A tenant of Bakala: it fuels in the stove - still pays higher rent
An elderly untersetzter man leaves just the client centre of society RPG Byty of the "Kohlebarons" Zdenk Bakala, the largest Privatbesitzers of rental housing in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm of a commemorative envelope with three new leases on three homes: on their own and the homes of his daughters and his son, who has just served a prison sentence.
All three were in the framework of the so-called 'deregulation' has just increased the rent.
Instead of 3.500 kronor monthly miete is the son next year for a 2 room home with kitchen fork out £3.3bn 4100 kronor in the second category.
"There are less than fluid in the flat hot water and heat must be in a simple coal," he angrily tippt a finger at the new lease of the son, whose signature he a power.
"But what - signed and I," he says upset half and half resigned.
The Citizens' Association BytyOKD.Cz, the new rental conditions as "incorrect and immoral" advises the tenants, the new contracts are not easy to sign and until 7 December to wait, in which it intends to publish a guidebook, as it fights against such contracts.
But the man is dismissive.
"One says this, the other," he makes a grim face.
The region of Ostrava is so great "deregulation laboratory."
After the New Year is this deregulation most rental housing in the Czech Republic before, whose tenants pay has not yet been a market-based rent.
Aktuáln.Cz therefore decided this "laboratory" personal visit.
The RPG-Warteraum Havíov is one of four in the region of Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning packed on this Tuesday.
Right beside the door Bodyguards a security agency and in her a aufruf machine.
"Rent 2011" stands a special Tastfeld on the touch screen.
In a nutshell touched upon by and already spuckt the device with a numerical list.
We have almost the number "157" entziffert and already piepst them on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting period.
Half a second later in the series.
A little later enters an older couple waiting period, in order to ask for the rent, but the onslaught in the waiting area is apparently not the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - Reparaturanträge, Versicherungsangelegenheiten and similar.
From the middle of November fly in the region Ostrava Kuverts with the new leases most tenants of a total of 44.000 homes of the portfolio of RPG in the mailboxes.
The RPG Byty beats them in the letter a rent increase of around 15 to 38 percent.
The specific date for the new rent in the client centre is opened since 18 November.
"The action runs a little over a week, which means that is only the beginning" answer the ladies behind the counter for a moment of hesitation, as the "client" emerging as a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakalas former Bergarbeiterwohnungen are a sensitive issue.
Before the elections had Parliament's Vice-President originating from Ostrava Lubomír Zaorálek of the SSD quite loudly taken up this issue, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of them.
"Twenty years, I want a new floor by them."
"It is not times ne besch. WC-Brille they could change" makes the aforementioned man air.
Until now, according to the staff face all pensioners on the counter in order to convince themselves whether they really get the promised tenants' moderation, which promises them RPG if they have the specific requirement to sign in time.
In the enjoyment of a half reduced February miete should come the other tenants, the new lease sign until 15 December.
Until now, "deregulation" in Havíov but everything else, as overloaded of enquiries.
"From yesterday's 360 clients were only around 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 because here" appreciate the schalter beamtins.
RPG offers both on their websites, as well as Wandtafeln individual rental agreements where necessary.
If the rental parties but did not agree to the new rent, they will be set by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach to understand," declared RPG on its websites.
"Here nobody goes to court," says one of the staff of RPG Byty and a man on the street before the client centre gives her at least partly right.
"I have 13 (kronor) pension, of which I left for lunch 5.000, where I should get the money for a legal dispute," he says.
Then the employee is uncertain.
"See time."
"Mr Zaorálek tells them about the media, they should not sign and so people prefer to wait and see" them to bear in mind.
The regulated rent ends in the largest part of the Czech Republic to New Year's 2011 and RPG Byty, the rent hike an economic necessity.
"The existing level of rent is not enough times to the maintenance of the housing funds from" argues Pavel Klime, the director of the Wohnungs-Portfolios society RPG Byty and - just the angry tenants criticise neglect of the housing fund, according to the homeowners of the main reason for the rent hike.
While RPG in the years between 2005 and 2010 from one's rent four billion could be invested in the houses in the four years from 2011 until 2014, it should be 5.2 billion.
In the broadsheet LCD-Display on the ceiling of the polster sessels in the waiting area of Havíov in the meantime, there are always a few red shining information.
"The rental increases by 15% in 2011 and less concern 31.200 homes, which means more than 90% of the homes of RPG."
"Time and means that no more than 7,50 CZK per square metre and month" is to read on the LCD-Monitor.
Only 400 homes from the portfolio of RPG increased the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases is increasing extreme lower rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square metre," argues RPG.
In 2600 housing remains the rent at the same level in the next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation rents not erratic drives up, but staged within four and eight years.
What is more, the company another obligation: all revenue from the rental increase (see graph) wants to keep putting the company back into the homes, especially in Wärmeersparnisse - in new windows and insulation.
However, this should primarily benefit those people who sign the agreements on the rent hike.
The architects saw a - the office includes a kindergarten
The office buildings in Brno Avriopoint Arch is the new headquarters of the company; design.
But who would have been expecting a mini nursery, with all it entails: colourful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground at the foreign terrasse.
This nursery is the staff of Arch since last year. Design available.
The Projektierungs and architectural office Arch. Design, which Ateliers a number of prominent Brünner works come from the first drafts of the new buildings Avriopoint with the premises for his Firmen-Minikindergarten.
In wise foresight, because most of its 90 employees (the inside) are in the babyboom age and the company is keen that the project of counterterrorism offices and architects' both men and women to return to their jobs as soon as possible.
Together with the opportunity to work shorter, is another bonus of kindergarten, the Arch. Design its employees in the concept of their social programme has to offer.
The Bauingenieurins and architects' internally, so it is easier to their demanding profession and to bring the child care under one roof.
The mini nursery is an original idea of the staff (the inside) of Arch. Design and with the support of the management succeeded grants of the European Union and the ministry of labour and social affairs to win for their project.
The occupational mini nursery through the operational programme of human resources and employment policy from funds from the European Social Fund and financed from the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (grants amounting to 2.8 million CZK) could be obtained the necessary facilities and equipment, and for the duration of 2 years for qualified staff and provided for the operation.
After the utilisation of funds (2 years), and design committed Arch society, the mini nursery 3 more years will continue to operate at their own expense.
The preparations for a whole year took this project, with the society economy rating actively aiding the application procedures.
In order for the child cares operating qualified staff, a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the nursery school children can visit without age excessive restrictions, although most of them are more than three years old.
And because it is a mini kindergarten, at the same time must be present only 5 children, but the day alternate each other on several children.
The nursery business is flexible in tune with the needs of parents, children of all staff in relation to the use of the kindergarten the same rights - without any regard for the corporate hierarchy and their respective position.
Although there are individual education and care, the content in the mini kindergarten is comparable with the framework programme of pre-school education.
The children are not just above all will give them excellent teaching offered - from basic knowledge to pre-school education, by the way they still learn English.
The classroom is not just with toys and creative games, but also equipped with a computer available to the children.
What is more, the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive corporate environment.
The parents can at any time a glance at the children and deletes the stress in the late collection of children from a remote kindergarten.
The parents therefore use their working time more productive.
Small wonder, then, that is also, of course, and loyal labour relations are emerging.
Arch. Design included among the Czech companies a in the recruitment of new staff clearly benefits " offer family-friendly and through such programmes marketing encourage their staff.
A bone house fascinates even after 100 years. If you look at the Interieure of Gaudi
The roof is like a prehistoric Echse, the back stairs, such as the vertebral column of dinosaurs and behind Fischmäuler.
This is the Casa Batlló by the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local residents got the house with his organic forms the nickname of "bone house."
Organ forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, Kachelsplittern and Mosaiks, which covered posture facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of the youth style of Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the house plays with fantastically lines, lack paints and Texturen remind the nature and creatures.
It was only on closer inspection, we noticed that everything will be dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
During the night, the whole facade still of plastic, dramatic and the special Anleuchtung reinforced the glory of the paint still.
The same energetic lines and tortuous forms dominate the interior of the house.
Wave type of shaped wood copied the window frames, support, Zierelemente doors, even Gucklöcher and.
The House Batlló in the quarter Eixample in the busy shopping road Passeig de Grácia No 43 was created by the refurbishment of a house from the year 1877, the architects Emilio Sala Cortese said.
The reconstruction two years took and completed 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialists, Josep Batlló, originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but he ultimately voted Gaudís the idea of an unusual and even cheaper restructuring.
The rental house Casa Batlló was an architect, Antoni Gaudí, however, is not alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol together.
The Dekorations created for the representative apartment on which ruler of the Realitätenbesitzers and the use of Mosaiks in the facade was his idea.
At the design of the facade but also many other Bildner and artists.
The joint work on the drafts of the Casa Batlló was the start of a fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
This Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís House Casa Milá in Güell Park, where other works are by Antoni Gaudí.
Not long after its completion was the home of the local inhabitants of its organic forms for the nicknames for "bone house."
Others called it the special window opening mechanism for the "yawning home."
It also says the top of the building is the sword of sacred Georg, presented the Patron of Catalonia.
But also other bildhauer elements symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí was an architect of the House a unique central heating system for the time with Entlüftungskanälen and typical Kamins.
Something bizarre is its 45 degrees inclination already.
In his creation Gaudí consistently ignored all former building codes and in no way anyone could be led astray by these.
Before start, he was one of the city proper permission but he made claims about the planned reconstruction were so vague that the city fathers in the completion of two years later were so appalled by the result that they remedy demanded.
The Ratsherrs were also among other things, that the construction with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk.
With regard to changes, however, there was no longer quite the opposite - just 15 days after the relevant invitation of urban neighbourhoods asked Josep Batlló a request for approval of the property of the two maximum situated floors of the House - and it has given him promptly.
The homeowners themselves pulled into the lower floors one.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor was a company showroom, on the third floor were the bedroom and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor has been leased to a juwelier business.
The entire sechsstöckig building undergoes a ladder up to the dachte race.
The basic elements of the restructuring were all right corner and just lines removed and replaced by bent and waved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern approach to the mutual combination of spaces.
The social part is quite connect through the opening of the Salontüren and so could comfortably chatting, without a larger society in vertraulich more talks will have to give up on a certain intimacy.
The House received by Gaudís conversion except a new facade is also a rather unusual roof and two other floors.
It is also impressive Gaudís game with the light and the blue and white glasiert Kachels with which the courtyard is dressed and Lichthofs.
The game of those two colours gives all floors of the House a maximum amount of light.
In doing so he became simply the principle to turn that white light reflects better than dark colors, the sunlight on the contrary to absorb.
The House Casa Batlló, the 2005 was included in the welterbe list of Unesco, everyone can now visit.
In the first floor is accessible to the public geräumigste and prächtigste home.
The homeowners decided only in the year to this step and the cause of the famous Creator 150 birth day.
When we found that this is a very lucrative business reserved the inspections to be extended even further joint and the Dachgeschossräume, including the dachte race.
The price for the inspection of the monument is no trifling matter, he stands at 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards get 20 per cent reduction.
This amount exceeds the entry price to other gaudí estates in the city.
Who the real atmosphere of the House, with its drache door mchen wants to learn should try friendship with one of the house dwellers to close and him visit at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rost? Women have other aspirations than men
It is not the tollste bed frame, but the quality of the surface - mattress and make good bed.
However, this must complement each other in harmony, in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
Many things during the selection play a role - the weight, size, health and not least the sex of the Schläfer.
Equally important is the Interieur, in which mattress and belittle.
A typical example?
In a weekend house in which will not be heated on a regular basis, Latexmatratzen are not good, because they need a lot longer, "warm."
In addition, they are clearly more difficult than usual Polyurethan-Matratzen.
Finally, they should be turned on a regular basis.
If they do not have enough Entlüftungskanälchen in the core and still lie on a solid record humidity, the movement: it is not excluded that stems from its mold.
In the election, of course, also plays a role in which it is used.
Anyone who takes longer time abroad, where very high Matratzes with soft layer are normal, hard to get used to a low mattress with hard surfaces can.
"Benefit all ice-hockey player returned from the NHL have complained to me that they cannot sleep more right here."
"For their abgeschundenen shoulders, they simply need Fersen and Hüften a soft layer of Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam, a Formgedächtnis-Polymer)."
"I commend this including sugar sick people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they" information "from the joints and the skin can receive bad," said Sylva Hadamcziková, which specialises in polster möbel.
That is why I have years ago many ice-hockey players, but also other customers this Matratzes with Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam) concerned.
"Today, this is not a problem any more, because such Matratzes offer, among other things the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian firm Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And we should not necessarily be a famous ice-hockey player, in order to appreciate the benefits of the Visco-Schaums.
This "miracle" works really quite simple.
The foam optimalisiert his toughness and form in accordance with the absorbed heat, or in other words, he is downright schmiegt on warm body.
There's nowhere in the night shifts are not around, such as after a heavy battle.
We simply sleeping much better.
The viskoelastische foam also provides protection against Dekubitus (fire).
In the election of the matratze size to body size, we should still include the length of the football sohles, i.e. approximately 21 to 34 inches.
Men like Mrs of the 180 cm wide, need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the Schläfer should at least 90 cm width available together then 180 cm.
In single beds, for example, in Singles, 120 to 140 cm are appropriate.
I comfort side and also for any visitors.
Otherwise the following thumb for the ideal bed band: "If it is on the back, should still enough room for the easy angewinkelt poor," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the zunft model of Polsterer and Raumausstatter, who for many years the issue of healthy sleep and devotes the ergonomics of furniture and this issue presents technical schools.
Everyone needs a separate in a double bed and his own mattress, but be careful with the purchase, so that the Matratzes are equally high.
Other than that, nothing else other than the Rosts assembling in different levels, and that is long impossible in each bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with stroke skelett 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should cover the formal class and the fine cushion.
"In the hand or in the Hinsetzen you can feel the feathers in any case," warns Helena Prokopová.
Every mattress requires a special Rosttyp.
Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and document how together increased Siamzwillinge in the bedroom to find nothing.
These Matratzes are not strip and you cannot wash the reference, which is already commonplace.
And since we are in a single night between 0.2 to 0,75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years slowly to a huge (and clogged sieve).
This is also why experts Werbeslogans reject Matratzes a lifespan of up to 25 years, even lifelong guarantee promise.
Every cause has its if and buts.
And so a practical advice from the dealers: in Matratzes of 120 or 140 cm diameter should be the hygiene of the waschbar, not shy away from abziehbaren salary, nevertheless, it is recommended to use a Matratzenschoner, you can easily drain and wash.
Although today are produced in the rule with Rundumreißverschluss, Matratzenbezüge so that you get two sides after the opening (immensely important for the washing process and the waschmaschine size!) seems the manipulation with larger Matratzes, especially alone said, often as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath.
Do they in bed instead of a Rostes a solid record?
So!
Or, at most for a bed for unpopular guests and for a single night.
Even so, they should install the record would rather Lüftungslöchern (if already not included) and mattresses with stroke skelett and 15 cm minimum level with so-called pocket stroke nucleus and fine cushion use.
Polyurethan-Matratzen belong on such a document is not.
For not verstellbar latte rosts with 14 to 18 stroke play (Lamellen) Latex or sand emphasis mattresses suitable (possibly combinations of Latex and Kokos), always pay Roste with a major latte number, then 28 and more stroke play, with Lordosenstütze in the lende vertebral area and the ability to regulate the latte härte.
At verstellbar Lamellenroste does not include Matratzes with relevant skelett, because they do not respond to the ergonomische pretexts.
In addition to the suspension of the Steife stroke play will be offered special flexible shoulder modules.
This is a particular stroke play, enabling the stroke play einzudrücken or even verwinkeln so that they allow the occasional Einsinken of the shoulder of the Schläfer.
For men with broad shoulders an important matter.
There are even matratze manufacturers, which have started with "Beatles' mattresses" soft zones to use for the shoulder area.
It is thought also to the ladies - they might these soft zones in the Hüftgegend.
For demanding customers are scoring burden large guidance systems (Lattoflex) or Roste with scoring burden Kontakt-Pads with so-called Multitorsionsfederung certain.
The pressure will be distributed at several points, which reduces the tension.
However, if you're on the right mattress and correct a bad (too big and fülliges) head bed used to get the most benefits will be lost.
Here too a thumb: the head bed should be based on the head, its leaders should only go to the shoulders, so that the Schultermuskeln can relax.
Ideal seems a 50 x 60 cm big cushions, as for example the Scandinavians may.
In the situation should head bed (along with the shoulder discharge zone in or the soft zone in the mattress) offset the shoulder level.
Something our modern Matratzes with the former (with hay filled) Strohsäcken but common.
Modern manufacturers increasingly use natural materials, or at least their mixtures.
Even Matratzes is the new magic word 'bio'.
Instead of Erdölrohstoffen used for the manufacture of Polyurethanschäumen increasingly naturell oils - for example Rizinus and soya oil.
Soy is used by all the well-known manufacturers.
"Bio says in Matratzes, her heart is pure natural materials," said Petr Vaíek of the company Tropico Plus.
Naturstoffe but are also used in the manufacture of Matratzenbezügen, was one of the first Aloe Vera.
We can but also kapseln, spreading fresh wood or Lavendelduft in the sleep, Mr. President.
Here too it makes a difference between man and woman.
While the men a "cooling in the existing" plant extract from birke sheets will be used so that the matratze relationship can absorb the heat and cool the body, the salary for women "current mend" impact.
Extracts from Red Paprikaschotes blood circulation suggest the weaker sex is wohlig hot during the sleep, Mr. President.
And the current favorites?
Mattresses from cold foam may (he has more Pores with devastated cell structure and is therefore breathing more active than normal Polyurethan and much more flexible).
The combination of the various Steife (toughness) arise from Kaltschäumen and Visco-Schäumen Mehr-Zonen-Matratzen who know exactly where located head, hip and Fersen.
For a quality mattress, but 7.000 Crowns and more to fork out £3.3bn.
Health mattresses but are usually burdened with lower value-added tax, because they are considered to be medical aid.
As the first Czech companies this advantage Gumotex has been given.
You can see on the bed and on to save is not so easy.
Every now and again there are special offers from manufacturers and distributors, the two mattresses on the price of an offer.
Indeed, the brand offers the mattress Duofreeze Magniflex verstepptem Visco-Schaum Memory for 11.990 CZK.
The second will get one free.
It was the material Tempur, the era of viskoelastischen foam with open cell structure and high density began in almost cosmic speed.
Small wonder, then, they have been developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed at the landing huge excess loads.
Tempur is in heat soft, cool milieu entrenched it again.
It fits perfectly in the human body and distributed in an optimal manner the physical pressure.
It is therefore not only ideal for the prevention of printing brandy, but increased general sleeping comfort.
Viskoelastische foam but not only Matratzes but also in other health products, such as special Fußpolstern used to facilitate give the legs and the equipment.
Local manufacturers use, for example, the foam Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want to Menschen-Überwachungsgeräte, in order to have the kids under control
The fear for one's children is growing more and more parents consider putting via GPS to monitor.
The system, originally invented to searching for cars, is equally good people, which would also be helpful in such cases, such as recently in the mysterious disappearance of nine-year-old Anika Janatková.
The device is currently about as big as a cigarette packet but soon there should be no bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people, the case of the missing Anika in fear and funk, and they keep the ways to better protect their children.
Even for the price of a deterioration of their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that it issue around being spied on by under any circumstances, but an effective means to reduce the likelihood that it comes on top of the tragedy," leads Petr Pilin of the society Macro because one of the suppliers of GPS-Ortungsgeräten on the Czech market.
"I admit that it is in the unique to the abuse of such devices can, for example, if someone is Waterloo. in the pocket, without that it knows, but we have had no such case has been made."
"Most customers buy it really for security reasons," adds Pilin to add.
In his opinion, the child but always know what purpose the "box" and how they are being used in the event of an emergency.
The child psychologin Dana Boková, however, indicates that a child, if such a thing may not bear its simple emptied.
"Even very small children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately lose certain things, if they do not want to be controlled."
"Even from the mobile phones set initially great expectations with the parents, but they are just as easy as this new surveillance equipment," says Ms. Boková.
In your opinion, is also controversial, if such a body will actually help in the event of an attack.
"The kidnappers on planned kidnappings controlled virtually always, whether the child any electronics with which it could be located."
"Today is the mobile phone."
"If such monitoring equipment wider use, they would also seek them, because their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police," says psychologist.
But she acknowledges that similar devices in a sudden attack by a paedophile may be helpful.
Roberta ech of the society RC monitoring, according to the tracking services both for automobiles, as well as for people offering, can the existence of this kind of equipment to help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The machine can adjust to the fact that it is reclaiming the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it were destroyed immediately, is at least the last position of the person available."
"With more expensive equipment is actually a neigung knife integrated, which means that if you hinfällt and bewegungslos breaks, the device immediately sends a warning under indication of the position," claimed Mr. ech.
In his opinion, similar services could also smart mobile phones with navigation perform, you need only einzuspielen a special software.
The problem of the current positioning tools is that these either equipment in streichholzschachtel size, the supporters are similar or smaller mobile phones.
As always there is the risk that they will lose.
Mr. Pilin of the Macro because, according to test it in the present devices look like normal Digitaluhrs.
"This has the advantage that the possible aggressor must realise that not even a surveillance and navigation gear.
"Or he can see the first after a certain time, which gives the police a time advantage," he adds.
No matter what direction the development - towards tags or supporters, always using the same technology as the vehicle tracking.
So the combination of radar function with the help of the GPS-Systems (as in Ms. in the car) and the function of a mobile phone, which operates the current position.
The army has so many Zündschnurs that you could umwickeln the whole Czech Republic keep you but only two years
The Czech army has 445 kilometers Zündschnüre bought with weapons.
In the year before, the Defense Ministry had 224 kilometers Zündschnur supplied to the army camp.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have ausgesorgt for 225 years.
The problem is just the durability of the Zündschnur - two, at most, but four years.
The army bought the Zündschnur from the company STV Group, others for paltry 40 million kronor.
In his justification for the purchase of these huge amount Zündschnur said the General Staff MF DNES, the soldiers would annually consume about 60 kilometres Zündschnur.
According to the research of Armeepyrotechnikern, according to the MF DNES emerges from this indication that the whole army annual an extremely intensive pyrotechnical training should, by all the generals and officers of the army command, to the Sekretärins and cleaning women.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded.
Only in this way could be considerable annual consumption of 60 kilometres Zündschnüren reasonably justified.
This length corresponds 25.000 Detonationen.
But even this army stocks would be sufficient for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts is still, for training every new professional soldier two meters Zündschnur quite sufficient, then the army by these Neueinkaufs, also from the point of view of the increased demand of pioneer and special teams - a reassuring stockpile for the above-mentioned created 225 years.
It complained soldiers of the rapid deployment brigade recently in the Defence Minister Vondra, they would have almost no look for hand-held weapons more so that Schießübungen the lack of resources are limited due to strong.
From the same shortage demure.
"I am not a why they are buying such huge Zündschnüre."
But it is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer, we as traders want concessions to as much as possible," says the sales manager of STV Group Jan Dcký.
Jan Pejek, the spokesman of the defence ministry justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometres Zündschnur, so that the army would, at least for ten years with this "ammunition" rangers covers.
Jan Dcký of the STV Group, however, only talks about a four-year span of the Zündschnur and the police and Armeepyrotechniker even just two years ago.
"With perfect storage are probably also the four mentioned years possible," admits one of them, but wants to remain unnamed, as a soldier not accused the criticism of the army.
After the expiry of the utility of validity any ammunition must be tested thoroughly, whether it is reliable and does not endanger the lives of soldiers.
However, these tests are not in vain, but costs further money.
Another argument of the Defense Department is the quantitative rebate for 445 kilometers Zündschnur.
"It cost us 60% less than any year's supply of 244 miles," Pejek spokesman us shares the position of the buyers of the defence ministry.
Only for comparison: the annual consumption of Zündschnüren of Pyrotechnikern of the police, the ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Army, liquidate exceeds some years barely 1.500 metres.
And the police always ordered such quantities of these weapons, which they still can consume before the expiry of the period of utility.
It is wonderful for the safety of the Pyrotechniker, is also keeping the possibility to flexible purchases more advanced and therefore reliable Zündschnurs open.
The Defense Ministry has already huge problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Treaty, as the two hundred thousand members Czechoslovak People's Army on its campaign was on the Rhine.
According to the Pyrotechnikern, MF DNES, expects the Czech armed forces in a few years, the same problem in the killing of hundreds of kilometres of old Zündschnurs, which they now so has bought "favourable."
To this day I have located the contacts, which I won thanks to the competition
The victorious placement in the competition "small entrepreneurs of the year," Luká Pytloun helped his hotel in the sale of the franchise.
Winners of the last year of the competition "small entrepreneurs of the year," Luká Pytloun was carried out by Liberec.
The story of his success seems like a film scenario.
Luká Pytloun went willingly.
He was aware only abroad, that carried out by Liberec lacks good excess accommodation at reasonable prices.
For the savings of its holiday work abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he erstand a dilapidated house with five homes.
Bearing in mind that he then university student in the sixth semester was, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The former price quality ratio angered me and so I tried to do something about it," says Luká Pytloun.
The first storey vermietete it to foreign workers.
According to the entire profit he immediately reinvested back into the house, which he then step for step towards retirement umbaute with 54 beds.
Since then, it managed in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity carried out by Liberec four pensions, two style just restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of more than 300 beds to open all accommodation categories.
The komfortabelste of them was until recently the four five-star Hotel Pytloun design hotel ."
This year was another first-class hotel to add.
"We have just voted u Tisé a contract with a hotel in Ostrov signed, we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties have already reported on the Pytloun-Hotels franchise," says the entrepreneur Number One last year.
"A large proportion of the licence sales at the behest of hotels had just the victory in the competition" entrepreneur of the year ," Mr. Pytloun adds.
The victory gave him greater fame, popularity tabled in carried out by Liberec and environment.
"The people saw me on the street, often they congratulated me after the event, and I must say that did well," he remembers.
I recommend everyone who really want to create something to participate in this competition.
It does not equal to win any visible is good.
He says that he still from the contacts and acquaintances benefits, which otherwise would not come at all.
"With some people I met, thanks to the competition, I still regular business relations."
The fame associated with the success also proposes his opinion, a little at each of its staff down.
And since he has 70.
"I notice them greater loyalty and pride that they are a little part of the general recognition."
I see this really not only as a personal success, no, this is the result of the good work of us all."
"My name is just something in the fore," says Luká Pytloun modest.
Do I wish an easier year than we had in Farmet
The euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his single-mindedness has Farmet the worst behind.
According to the price of the first rank of the competition Vodafone company of the year in the past year, Karel árský, Farmet contrary to company owners.
The jury then commemorated the effort with which he eská Skalice from the small Werkzeugbau stampfte a company from the ground, the hundreds of millions of sales power.
"I can say that this recognition not only myself but also encouraged all my staff and our self-confidence has reinforced in the battle with the competition," says the previous winners.
The starting point of the corporate history of Farmet the effort to do something useful.
And when then his father Karel árský the state as compensation for the property confiscated by the communists offered a small garage to rent, he did not hesitate for a long time, left his career in the company, in which he was employed until then free-fall and founded with a few friends of his father, a separate company for the manufacture of plastic wannes.
A short time later, they began to focus on vegetable oil.
Within 18 years, they are the largest manufacturer of automatic Presses across central Europe.
But only by the success in this competition and its median idealization, she happened into the consciousness of non fachöffentlichkeit.
"Not only that our customers the brand Farmet is now clearly more intense exercise, our foreign partners began the fact will be able to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in her country to attach greater value," says Karel árský.
The last year, when Farmet was not only in the sign of euphoria.
The commemoration was from the economic results of the company in 2008 and a part of 2009.
Indeed, 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of raw bauprodukten.
The crisis, which was then still less the citizens, but above all companies, just reached its peak, many firms have been forced to suspend their investment projects and the purchase of new facilities and technologies to limit.
"This situation, of course, we could not escape."
"The turnover went about 40% back, we had to restrict the production and even resort to layoffs," said Karel árský
A viable businesses must sometimes such unpopular measures.
However, it managed to get to grips with the situation and to keep the company in the black figures, although with lower profits than before the crisis.
When the company was not prepared to make cuts - investment in research and development.
"For the grant, we entered a research and training centre, we bestärkten our presentation at international trade fairs and procured main prices in domestic exhibitions," says árský.
Everything indicates that we have overcome the crisis.
The turnover grow again and with them the number of new employees.
"According to the new winner, I wish you much joy of victory - but more calm" leaves Karel árský gear.
An opinion poll removing with nonsensical rules
The poll by the "absurdity of the year" for the fourth time part of the business competition.
Some nonsensical rules already managed to create from the world.
On the dubious winner of the next vintage of the poll "absurdity of the Year" has the duty to create documents to authorities available online.
Thus decided more than a third of not quite four thousand voting abgebe under the Swedish entrepreneurs.
For example, the social security administration demanded a paper auszug from the trade register, even if it had the official can be accessed by two click of a mouse.
Thanks to the poll, this is now changing.
"The Czech social security administration will in future control of Sozialversicherungszahlern do not require any more extracts from the register," led the SSZ spokeswoman Jana Buraová.
Sense and purpose of the poll "absurdity of the year," it is under the microscope all rules and orders to comply with the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and lift the nonsensical.
This year, this is the fourth time part of a business competition, by the tsch. Economic newspaper (HN) will be held and enjoys growing popularity in the public.
If in the last year of the three thousand people participated in the vote this year, there were already four thousand.
No surprise, because there is still a lot of legal obligations, the one and only serve to hamper business activity.
"As regards, for example, the number of Einkommenssteuerformulare, we take a front rank in the world a" noted Karel Havlíek of the association of small and medium-sized businesses and commercial driving the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity in recent years, the stated aim of all governments.
Compared to the world the situation has hardly improved in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank is taking the Czech Republic in relation to the rank of a business conditions, compared with the previous year a worse place at eight places.
The competition absurdity of the year was declared for the first time in the year and plays every year after the same scenario.
Everyone can from April to print the competition at the end of September, notify administrative and bureaucratic nonsense.
With regard to the notification serves the website address www.europa.eu.int. Firmaroku.cz. after that seeks the organisers of the competition seven candidates for the "war on prices" and leaves the public is invited online on the websites. firmaroku.cz/ absurdita and www.europa.eu.int. ihned.cz vote.
It takes the one absurdity, that gets the most votes.
At the year's poll were already more than a hundred, or more precisely 105 senseless rules and orders registered.
The tips come not only from employers but also by professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "year lists" of the competition, including provisions, for example, that maintenance vehicles on highways and rapid road tolls to pay or that employers with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets must vorrichten every two years.
The list of the year's "Seven" is published on the sides of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition respectively in early November at the Prague's Wenceslas Square is part of a Happenings, in which regular people participate in the political and public life.
For example, in this year were Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-sized businesses and commercial driving Tsch. Republic, and Petr Kuel, the president of the Tsch Chamber of Commerce. Republic at the height of the competition with the game.
"Where the state raises the entrepreneurs stick between the legs, there can be no real economic recovery, so it is my goal every year to lift at least thirty paragraphs, today's entrepreneurs still unnecessarily complicate their dealings," Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The efforts to create nonsensical orders from the world, show effect.
In 2007 rankled people most entrepreneurs imposed duty, the Gewerbeamt in the place of its permanent company three days in advance must notify the intention with an exhibition subject to an exhibition or Kirmes drive to want.
This obligation has been lifted the force of a Gewerbegesetzes series.
The duty, which in 2007 received the second-largest number of votes - the duty, the Labour Office missions of employees in the amount to be reported to 30 days must - was by the law on them so-called "green card" abolished.
And, all good things are three:
At the absurdity of the year, the regulation was elected in 2009, physiotherapists, boosted in the rooftop room with a mirror, a refrigerator and two Personenwaagen.
The health ministry, this regulation has been somewhat alleviated this year - fell on refrigerators requirement.
A new category honors socially responsible firms
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's already fifth year of competition in the economic newspaper (HN) is the category ', responsible company by the year 2010."
The basic idea of this competition is to promote sound and fair operation.
"We want to support such firms, the consequences are aware of your entrepreneurial activity on the environment and socially responsible initiatives support," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone company Vodafon, the Ausrufer and guarantor of this competition, just as well as the competition "rebel of the year."
For the year's first vintage of this particular underclass of the main competition Vodafon company of the year came forward companies for which the success is not the only long-term goal.
The history of each of them is very inspirativ and would provide enough material for a self-employed article.
Although they are in relation to the subject of their work to distinguish their efforts yet a common denominator - support and consideration.
This is the case for gehandicapte people, since about personal problems or the health of its own staff.
Among the 14 year lists across the Czech Republic, for example, there the Prague software company Netera, which the emergence not formally promotes sports teams among their staff, who then participating in many tournaments in a variety of sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo society, which has already spent seventeen years main sponsor of a trust fund for gehandicapte children.
Even a paper factory from Podbrady exemplary cares about their health disabled workers, which make up 70 percent of its workforce, for which it with the title ," responsible company in the region, Central Bohemia" acknowledged; in competition Vodafone company of the year, they finished the third place in the context of this region.
The victory in the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz soft, including a fluid and also on average 35 hours per week reduced working hours and this without relative wages.
The jury in the front ceremony also honorierte the fact that the company goes mainly in Czech manufacturers, citizens' initiatives supported in their surroundings and operates on environmentally friendly principles.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible about the consequences of our business and administration to minimise for the environment," says its CEO Milue Ryznarová.
According to the responsible Enlogit IT companies from the region of Ústí nad Labem, in turn, is located on the health of its staff, and therefore they all central books purchased ergonomische chair and Tastaturen, also encourages them in their employees teleworking and corporate actions, they used Cartering-Dienstleistungen, which are offered by a local sheltered workshop.
"We also support the foundation" people in distress ," the local Roma-Kommunität concrete aid," says Ondej Suchý, the representative of the company.
Last but not least, the activity of cleaning company "Praní a itní" from the Karlsbad region worth noting their employees in the form of Extra-Bonussen contributes to their pensions.
"We give our employees contributions to the restaurant for the distances, to increase their skills and for the holidays," says Josef Strapá from the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the mährisch Silesian region.
Category, responsible company of the year were automatically all district year lists of competition Vodafon company registered in the year, the issues of the beantwortetet registration showed questionnaire and by no later than the organisers until 15 August zuschickten.
Wrong or incomplete full answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the organisers from the assessment.
"If the representatives of the competing firms the unanswered questions, they were from the competition," responsible company of the Year "excluded in the main competition Vodafone company of the year, they were so but not disqualifying."
"A separate application only this competition is not possible, since he merely an underclass of the main competition company of the year," said Karel Goldman of the organising agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Soil Fund - arrests of police in a public tender
In the building of the land fund in Pilsen took the anti-corruption police in recent days arrests.
It was the local media entrepreneur and property dealer Lubo G. Detektivs in handcuffs.
This was allegedly attempted a just underway public competition on the handling of ways claims to manipulate so that the competition offered land a specific model zufielen.
This is Lubo G. paid half a million.
"At this stage, I can only confirm that the police a person being persecuted for the offence of fraudulent practices in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner prosecutor's office of the newspaper "Právo," further details in relation to the ongoing investigations, they could not provide.
Twenty-four hours later, the 46 year-old businessman was released by the police.
In what way he could manipulate the public competition, we can speculate on only in the face of the scarce official information.
The spokeswoman of the land fund Lubomír erná led to the related issue of Právo, the police have in the Pilsner subsidiary body of the land fund actual arrests made and this during a public competition.
"It was a client and not one of our staff," she konkretisierte.
The public competition had Mrs erná, according to the correct designation "call for tenders of claims on the transfer of land under the land law" and would take place in cases in which several applicants interest in the offered land bezeigen.
"These persons offer within the framework of the request a higher value of their through the transfer to awaiting disbursement ways rights than the land value."
"In accordance with the offered claims will set the order of the potential acquirer, then gives the land fund land on the person with the highest offer," said the spokeswoman of the fund.
Lubo G. were obvious information available to anyone who had registered on the invitation, and because he was even eligible person, since he has had bought a number of ways claims, he offered a property interest that he is withdrawing from the competition.
Obviously against a fat compensation.
It would also be a sufficient explanation for why he his arrest such a large sum was.
Lubo G. was already in the past too good contacts with the Pilsner land fund.
For example, he also played in the issue of the former head of the land fund Vaclav Sankota a role, which was prosecuted because he issued in Ersatzrestitutionen land, which already location decisions had been taken to construction.
At the time Lubo G. acquired the land fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, to the point where the construction of the magistrale pole Borské for the industrial area was planned.
He later exchanged this very favourable directly with the government against a house in the historic centre of the city a the far exceeded the value of the land.
The town hall had to reluctantly small works not to jeopardise by blocking the land.
The housing costs of households increase by a few hundred monthly
From January, the budgets must not only count with higher costs for all forms of energy, but also with higher water and sewage charges and for district heating and some grow rents.
Families are so from January several hundred kronor a month must learn from the wallet than previously.
Electricity is expensive by 4.6 percent, gas by 2 percent and more in some cities will be up to a tenth more to pay for water supplies and in some places, the district heating supplies too expensive.
Costs alone the electricity over-inflated housing budgets annually a few hundred kronor.
The electricity prices were from all the main suppliers reduced debt is therefore the clear support of electricity from renewable sources, notably for photographic voltaik plants.
Gas is only moderately expensive, but then exactly when people need to heat up the most and the highest consumption.
Here, again, with several hundred kronor per year can be expected.
While electricity and gas across the Czech Republic, the prices for district heating different from city to city.
Above all, more places are planning price rises.
This means that, for example, the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové on a monthly basis from January for district heating up to 50 kronor pay more than 1.000 kronor per year pay families in carried out by Liberec.
According to the residents of Prague, in turn, threaten 9% higher water and sewage charges and this in the event that the city increased infrastructure miete.
When the rent does not change, there are only 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague is compared to the whole of the Czech Republic but also continue to be the lowest.
In the northern böhme, where prices already are among the highest, water and sewage charges should increase by 7,4%.
Huge rental price increases are for example in 140.000 Mietwohnungen expected in January, the so-called rent regulation.
Plans for example the housing companies CPI Byty Ústí nad Labem owns 2.500 homes, rents from January to increase equal to 100%.
Anyone who is not in agreement with this increase in rent, the company wants to court.
The regulated rents are still paying nearly 300.000 homes, next year should rise by more than 10 percent.
Czech children appreciate with Fernet and rum, beer is out - simply has to slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, exceptionally, sometimes a good whisky, the father has stolen from the Hausbar.
These are the drinks, according to which enjoyed drunken Czech teenagers under 15 must be the most notbehandelt.
No exceptions are children, their hangovers repeatedly have ausschlafen in the hospital.
This emerges from the experience of the doctors facing similar cases in the inclusion of the Kinderabteilungen of clinics.
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion, because it simply takes too long to be drunk."
"The current trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Ludk Pelikán, the chief surgeon of the paediatric department Hoovice in the Central Bohemian clinic.
"Whisky, if it succeeds, the father a bottle from the Hausbar, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage that it can be blended with Juice, then he smacks not so strong," said the chief doctor.
The spokeswoman of the Fakultätskrankenhauses Motol Eva Jurinová gives him right.
"Usually involves Fernet or rum."
"This is the current alcohol trend, notably at primary schools."
"Occasionally, there was slivovice one walks from home," Mrs Jurinová.
Pelikán chief doctor, thirteen or fourteen years of drinkers in the hospital stock long no anomaly.
Before the clinic in Hoovice, in which he has been working since this year, he was ten years in the pädiatrie department of the hospital Motol act, where ambulances angetrunken students from the Middle and produced effect.
"A girl had to be four times are."
"Your career she began 12 years ago, when it is the first time with 3.5 mg alcohol in the blood and even in combination with" Extase "was the crunch provides," described the doctor a particularly difficult case.
"It was in the exhibition site in Holeovice on any dance party."
"The interesting thing was that her mother not strange was that her daughter 48 hours was not home," wonders why the chief surgeon.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance in use with one's offspring is one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism from children.
In order to have a real addiction in the true sense of the word experts say, children are not.
"Under alcoholism is a longstanding chronic dependence on alcohol, together with all related phenomenon to understand and that is not the case with these children."
In those enjoying the repeated alcohol is mostly a negative familiär social background characteristic," said Pelikán chief doctor.
The spokeswoman of the hospital Motol, according to Ms. Jurinová, by the middle of November approximately 40 drunken children hospitalised in the local department for children and youth medicine.
However, only the cases with severe alcohol poisoning, which required a hospital a go in the statistics.
Drunk children after ambulatory care of parents or possibly by the police to be brought home, will not be registered.
Apart from the cases in which children just by a austrinken bottle of spirits in the school bank after opinion of Mr. Pelikán three seasonal Amplitudes, on the 100%: Walpurgisnacht New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either from distress because of the poor testimony or from joy at the holidays."
"In the Walpurgisnacht, I have also been seven drunken children experienced in the reception," stresses Dr Pelikán.
A drunken child spends the night under medical supervision, paradoxically, is better off than a child in the next day only has to contend with a nasty hangover.
The headaches in the morning, then the may and the glucose deficiency can be in the hospital with a liquid donation built by the Infusion with glucose and nährst open the organism lack drive.
"They are clearly better off, because after the 'beautiful' experience in the evening, prick them with good humour, without somewhere hurts."
"They are only somewhat confused about where they are," Pelikán doctor admits, referring the patients sometimes spoil the good humour, at least by listing by showing them the costs, which will cost them the treatment.
Because the transportation with the ambulances and the night in an emergency bed well and like to make a few tens of thousands of kronor.
"Every now and again I did used as educational resources if I directly have calculated the children on the trip, which has cost their drunkenness, and that it can happen that they even look at the whole holiday on to work for the money for a single such Fete deserve," Dr Pelikán added.
In his opinion, however, the insurance funds are not attacking after Regressverfahren, which costs necessary to cure the intoxicated children demand from the parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain
Two easy warplanes L-159 of a total of five, the Czech Defense Ministry has exchanged against the transport plane Casa C-295M on Tuesday flew in the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS sets.
It is the first time that machines of this type in possession of a foreign army.
Abroad, they were only in manoeuvres or air shows to see.
It concerns the airline capable two-seats version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The other three planes are einsitzige L-159.
These are still einkonserviert in the Aero Vodochody, the mediator of this business - the company Omnipol - they last week accepted.
When they expediert the aircraft physical Vodochody, Jan Pejek, according to the spokesman of the Defense Department is still not known.
The einsitzigen fighter plane L-159, in turn, have been excluded from long-term stored aircraft and this without further deposits and investments on the part of the department of the ministry.
"The double seats L-159T1 were exchanged in the current situation and appearance," said Pejek of the newspaper Právo.
He added that the army will not have to manage without zweisitzige fighter aircraft as the Defense Department in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody a 200 million contract on the conversion of four superfluous L-159 on two-seats version signed.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second it will take until the end of this year.
According to Pejek EADS has committed warplanes in the equipment to enforce one of the NATO countries.
"In the Treaty is clearly pointed out that the company EADS buyer of aircraft L-159, and that the NATO countries for the training of pilots are supposed to serve.
"It is therefore up to the buyer, in what way he realized the matter," led Pejek.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The barter of five L-159 against a transport plane Casa and the purchase of further aircraft for 3.5 billion kronor was in the last year approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Defense Ministry had tendered for purchase any tendering process, but spoke EADS directly.
The former Defence Office argued that this exchange will support the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, which they used only 24, they wanted to sell the rest.
The purchase of the aircraft Casa should also have a judicial aftermath.
The European Commission sued the Czech defence ministry at the European Court of Justice. The reason? it could have been the aircraft because of the whole European tender to choose and not by raising a single manufacturer.
The army has already adopted three planes, the last to within 14 days on the Airport Kbely land.
A long finger and ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose finger long than the ring finger, are clearly a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is a surprising result of a study on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer was published.
This is the mirror of the male hormone testosterone are linked.
"Our results show that the relative length of fingers as a simple test can be used for the risk of prostate cancer, and this roll-call in men by 60," said coauthor of the study, Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University in Warwick.
The finger could help to determine what men are necessarily should undergo a prostatakrebs test, especially when genetic risks or other risk factors are in place, such as family health burden, Mrs Eeles added.
In the period between 1994 and 2009 followed it with their colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3.000 healthy men.
With more than half of the participants in the study was the finger of the right hand is shorter than the ring finger.
For these men was seen the same probability of prostate cancer, such as for 19% of those men whose ring and finger were equally long.
In men, whose finger was longer than the ring finger, but this risk was reduced by 33% in men by 60 even at 87%.
The ratio of the length of the two aforementioned fingers, which are already forming in the prenatal age, apparently reflects the different mirror of Geschlechtshormonen, which the child was exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a long finger.
Previous research showed that the testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Vaclav Paes, leading Czech geneticists and former chairman of the National Academy of Sciences, TK said, he was this study fugitive known, yet he consider the relationship between the length and the cancer has not so far been "completely proven."
The Czech Republic in the snow - D1, D5 blocked
Just as the largest part of Europe is also the Czech Republic on Thursday morning under a snow cover.
In the streets and Gehwegen is mostly frozen snow, were the Winterdienstler in many places the whole night on axis.

It is there that are forming interminable traffic jams.
Another accident happened on the D11 and the same arrived to Prague.
In Prague itself is a several centimeters thick snow cover and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Autokolonnen, for example, in the Stadteil Prosek, also trboholská the road is completely blocked.
There is the safest means of transport in any case the Metro.
The tramways drive with delays, for example on the line between Charles Square and Peace Square.
In order to eight o'clock in the morning meets the Prague crisis unit.
Even with the railways and at the airfield there are problems.
The Czech government had to because Schneeverwehungs seven schnellzug compounds.
Problems there is, for example on the route Prague - Kralupy or Prague - Beroun.
The travellers should necessarily informed about the current situation.
The Airport Ruzyn since Wednesday 11 o'clock at night until 5 o'clock in the morning closed.
Most roads in southern mähres navigable only with increased caution.
In order to Vykov three secondary roads completely unbefahrbar in the vicinity of Brno, sometimes Schneeverwehungen and in the vicinity of Blansko is forced to some higher Schneefräsen use of location roads.
One of the hardest-hit areas is Výkov.
That is where three roads still completely blocked: Rousínov - Slavkov Bohdalice - Kuerov and aratice - Mileovice.
Here too there will Schneefräsen for snow clearance must use.
When they will again be navigable is until now not estimate.
In the Hodonín region is in the field of White karpaten caution.
On the roads, the natural protection reasons can only be distributed with inerten cluster products, is an up to five centimetres thick snow cover, TK.
In the Czech Republic fell from two to ten centimeters Neuschnee, most in northern Bohemia - sometimes by 18 centimetres.
In the mährisch Silesian region fell up to 15 centimetres Neuschnee.

American soldiers have a new "smart gun."
The American troops in Afghanistan for the first time a new "smart" weapon, which previously only known under its code name XM-25.
The generals hope that these new automatic weapon influenced the local conflict with the Taliban and the balance of power shifts to their advantage.
The new weapon is something like a super identify gun.
Your Projektils by lasers with a soundness of just a few meters drawn into the goal.
The specific shells of calibre 25 mm, which were developed for this rifle and hochexplosiven explosives contained function practically as small shells.
The shells can be programmed so that they not only at the impact on the goal, but at any point of their ballistic trajectories can explode.
In other words, you can use them against an enemy, behind a barrier, a wall or hidden in the front.
From above, it is usually not protected, the murderous steel cluster rains from above so it can easily except battle.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new helicopter gun the first infantry weapon, "smart" technologies to harness.
"The soldier is basically: he seeking the goal and sends a laser beam from the removal of certain, as he wins a precise visier point, after which he corrected; corner, then he needs only abzudrücken.
"Let us say, it has measured 543 metres."
"If you abdrückt, invites the weapon and shooting know the distance 543 meters plus minus one, two or three metres.
400 jobs will be relocated
The company Fujitsu relocated its branch in Bad Homburg after Frankfurt.
In July next year will be 400 employees their jobs from the previous office buildings at the Marie bader place in Bad Homburg move in the Astro park.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocated its branch in Bad Homburg after Frankfurt.
As the computers and their maintenance specialist industry giant said on Wednesday in July next year 400 women and men their jobs from the previous office buildings at the Marie bader place in Bad Homburg move in the Astro park, which is a large office complex in the Lyons street in Frankfurt Borough of Niederrad.
A spokeswoman of Fujitsu explained medium-term there should further 100 jobs are housed, the corporation are distributed so far in the region.
This rental offer was very attractive, also would make the open-plan offices in Astro Park in the functioning of the staff better contrary to.
Even in Bad Homburg Fujitsu was only tenants.
The competent director Bernd Wagner said, "with Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent links with the airport was just for a global companies such as Fujitsu of great importance.
The new move of an important businesses within the region called yesterday joy for the winners and disappointment for the losers.
The Frankfurt Wirtschaftsdezernent Markus Frank (CDU) said, so that a "global player" again was won.
This was a "great location creed."
Fujitsu bring to the city, the location is an important boost for Niederrad.
The Bad Homburger Mayor Michael Korwisi (the Greens) regretted the decision by Fujitsu.
The city was soon informed about the intention of the management.
"We have offered our help, of course, the company," said Korwisi.
However, the friendly contacts had nothing to do with the difficulties of the computer manufacturers with the landlord of the property at the Marie bader place can change.
In the end, could have tipped the balance decisively economic reasons.
The challenge now is to prevent a long short subject in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building cooperative."
The Fujitsu previously used home on the Square and the adjoining "small vertical" were with the other buildings at the Marie bader place ten years ago on the controversial construction of the Kurstadt.
As a joint project of the city and a private project entwicklers has created a new urban entree between station and City Hall, both because of the massive development of previously largely land used as a parking lot, as well as for criticism was the size of the building.
2001 related investment consultancy and credit rating firms Feri, the software manufacturers for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and then with Siemens connected computer manufacturers Fujitsu houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu was in 2006 by the Frankfurt German Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe, together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund acquired and a year later to the Spanish of Falcon Real Estate Investments SA sold in Madrid.
The Fujitsu-Konuzern agency in Tokyo describes itself as the third largest IT-Provider in the world.
It represents companies for example computers and servers ready and makes the necessary service.
The establishment in the Rhine Main region is one of the largest in Germany, much more, however, Fujitsu counts employees in Munich.
For Bad Homburg prefers the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Niederrad one to the other subsidiaries at this site Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
To this end were in the office building Astro Park hired 7.000 square metre.
In the 20 years old complex - the name plays on his sternförmig basic footprint - among other things, the Central Association electrical engineering and electronics industries his seat.
Amazon servers - threats against Assange
Wikileaks machine increasingly in trouble.
The Internet service providers Amazon has banished the investigative platform from its servers.
Perhaps behind this political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret Diplomaten-Depeschen.
Wikileaks-Gründer Assange is supposedly in England.
The investigative platform Wikileaks machine in the United States is increasingly under fire.
The track down lost access to their previous American servers and seek an Internet heimat in Europe now.
The prominent Senator Joe Lieberman called, however, other countries and companies to boycott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks-Gründer Julian Assange, who is on the wanted list of Interpol, will reside after a newspaper report in Britain.
"Wikileaks supplanted by amazon server."
"Free speech in the land of the free" shared the Enthüllungs-Aktivisten per short messaging service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before the Internet companies Amazon had banned the Wikileaks-Dokumente from its servers.
The track down had in the publication of secret diplomatic diplomatic cables on the Amazon Web Service (AWS) returned to the high pay to be able to cope with the documents.
Wikileaks said by Twitter to the step further: "Prima - our dollars are now spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon have such problem with the freedom of speech, "they should stop to sell books."
Amazon have halted the use of its servers by Wikileaks after staff employed by Senator Joe Lieberman enquiries had told the television channel CNN, citing the office Liebermans.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Amazon had threatened with a boycott, told the British Guardian.
"I would have liked that Amazon is taking this measure previously classified information by WikiLeaks in light of the previous publications," said the senator.
Avigdor Lieberman, meanwhile called on the platform also to deny the use on servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks ' illegal, outrageous and reckless action puts our national security at risk and vulnerable around the globe life," was in a communication from the parteilos senator.
"No responsible companies, whether American or foreign - WikiLeaks should help in his efforts to disseminate stolen material."
Wikileaks-Gründer Assange about rape suspects sought by the authorities in Sweden, is on the wanted list of Interpol.
According to a report by the London newspaper The Independent " follows the 39 year-old Australians in Britain at the precise place Scotland Yard is known.
The Internet activist investigations in Sweden always described as a set-up of its opponents.
Kristinn Wikileaks-Sprecher Hrafnsson said in London, there had been threats.
"There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange."
That is why fear Assange labeled for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The Wikileaks-Gründer will therefore continue to keep hidden.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America was the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks-Enthüllungen should be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada said an adviser of leader Stephen Harper - obviously ironic - on television, Assange should "be killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Today between the White House and Assange meanwhile a tennis match.
The spokesman of the American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asked if they recently leaked Spionage-Aufforderungen is responsible for diplomats.
"I am not quite sure why we look at the opinion of a types with a website" Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than its a website."
The American government is the protection of their databases fully to the test.
As a special envoy is the deputy director of the Centre for antiterrorism measures, Russell Travers, has been appointed, told the White House.
Travers is responsible for "necessary structural reforms" to develop after the disclosure of the embassy reports by Wikileaks have become necessary.
The White House also wants to examine the ways, as the entire government information exchange and protects.
The US government also announced that provide for the safety of dissidents and most active to want to let them through the Wikileaks-Veröffentlichung in jeopardy.
"We have done everything to enter into contact with them," said außenamt spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We stand ready to protect them if it should be necessary."
The Eis-Universität
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna Eiskonditoren be prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic rate for future Gelatieri has the largest pool of recruits and visitors from all over the world.
Why is actually the whole ice?
From the Gelatiere and the Gelataio.
The Gelatiere German somewhat archaic Eiskonditor, represents the cream after all the rules of the Italian Eisma royal art ago.
The Gelataio old with a Spachtel ice cream from the freezer counter, deletes them in the Waffel and then sells them.
In order to know that we must not after Anzola dell'Emilia drive in the province of Bologna.
But who would like to know more about ice, which is not in the "gelato university" the Italian firm Carpigiani over.
The Eis-Universität, the manufacturer of Eismaschines set up in 2003, so that the ice cream from his machines everywhere the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basic rate for future Gelatieri has the largest pool of recruits and visitors from all over the world.
But there are also started Spezialkurss around lost their Schokoladeneis and internships in the domestic Eisdiele.
Some dreams in the midlife crisis of a new career, others simply dare repeat the treacherous ice of their vague aspirations.
This time, it is 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil on Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teachers from California, loves the Slovenian food movement and will in future in the country of industrial Ice-Cream to offer a European quality product.
Anke from Berlin is corporate adviser and wants after years in a nerve-wracking job eintüten a little discretion.
Two young Egyptians dream to open a Eisdiele in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil would improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian housewife Yulia, because Italian ice cream love their children.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari told the participants initially the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream.
The key is not only good taste, but also the seidig fluidity and good consistency.
Luciano forgets his training but not the icing on the cake of national and even südländischen superstructure: ' By Gelato is simply the best - and then is still plenty of romanticism."
The first step towards the manufacture seems quite simple.
Luciano repeals the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a large Mixgerät with an electronic programme everything at 85 degrees heated and then immediately to four degrees cooler.
Then he turns on the machine a Hahn, and a white basic lotions, it became clear basis for all milk eiss varieties.
Bestürmt as the teacher with questions: can you ice cream only produce with natural substances without stabilizer?
How can you own experimental free course?
Luciano warns the Zeitgeist mislead.
Who of ice cream "only" speech from natural ingredients, has possibly yet stabilisers used - usually a natural product, such as Guarkernmehl from the Guarbohne.
Of course you can ice also produce without stabilizer, it should only be sold within a day, otherwise sackt together, and the client bites on loud Eiskörnchen.
Certain variations on the basic chips are allowed.
It will be more exciting with the flavours.
For the taste in ice Maestro Luciano distinguishes the ingredients in the fruit department or buy in the sweets in the supermarket.
In addition there are bullets and Pasten.
"The suppliers will all try you dozens of aromatic additions try to foist on."
"But you should simply experimenting."
Either in the Fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or just on the ice cream from the white basic chips with eggs on the yellow cream and cocoa powder on the basis for all potential Schokoladen-Verführungen.
Now we can change players in the Eismaschines.
Luciano leaves them each four different types of vanille, chocolate, Mokka and Haselnuss-Eis produce - with or without eggs in the basic material, with more or less whatsoever aroma or other natural additives.
According to the same experiment will be subjected to the fruit eiss varieties.
More flavourings, more fruit puree, taste is not necessarily better.
Haselnuss-Eis tastes not necessarily nut palm, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi-Eis is the working group, and used more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mix will highlight the taste of a Gelato clear from says Luciano.
Eisherstellung is a purely mathematical exercise: if used peach puree with a lot of sugar, the sugar share must be reduced in the basic recipe.
For Zitroneneis an extra oats sugar is needed.
Luciano prefers a device chaplain, with whom he the sugar content of fruit varieties certain (winemakers measure so that the Oechsle grape must).
Fortunately facilitate charts the calculation.
Ice requires no longer so much physical use as before.
It is not only helps the device for the automatic production of basic chips.
There is also a device in which the finished Eis-Mischung at the same time cremig will be beaten and chilled to freezing temperatures.
All automation despite remain small mishaps are not enough.
The Brazilians Gustavo late and its stock price colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree than him outsized hand blenders control.
"In every course," says Luciano Maestro, "it is only a matter of time before something happens."
Checkers in the Zwielicht
The European Food Safety Authority Efsa is from the experimental industry infiltrated with Genpflanzen.
Thus, this accusation now formulated the expert group testing biotech as independent institute for the impact assessment of the biotechnology understands.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well documented," said Testbiotech-Chef Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the EFSA expertengruppe for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and for years a further EFSA expert are also in the Ilsi lobby organization under contract.
The corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer paid.
Kuiper worked on the Efsa-Prüfvorschriften for Genpflanzen authoritative and am thus in a clear conflict of interest, criticised Then.
The EFSA rules are selling as word equal with position papers of the Ilsi and deceive so that the imprint of the industry, the real authority in the Italian Parma should be controlled.
It is already the second time that test biotech bemängle an interest collision.
This is a senior EFSA managerin recently without conditions or transitional period for the Swiss agricultural company Syngenta - and thus have switched sides.
Even the Central German radio (MDR) had recently unveiled personnel links between EU authority and industrial lobby, which the Environmental Office, as well as sympathetic.
However, the Efsa can see no conflict of interest.
It will take on all the serious data back to this industry, as long as they are of high technical quality, says in a statement.
From the experts who work for Efsa, we do not demand that they have no contact with the industry.
You should disclose but this.
Kuiper gives his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States a.
This describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from academia, industry and politics - including on the risk assessment of biotechnology without lobbying mission.
In the matter criticize independent experts such as Then that genetically modified crops currently without any feeding experiments in animals be allowed, and the reaction of Genpflanzen shall not be tested on environmental influences.
"We want to know what for example makes genetically modified maize on the field," says Then.
Derzeitige practice is only isolated proteins, but not to test the whole Genpflanze, what am no reliable results.
"If the risks are not looking, how is it possible to find them?" asks Then accusatory.
It also includes Angelika Hilbeck.
The scientist researched in the engineering since 1994 and is currently at the technical university Zurich active.
The industry experiments in this area as in the United States now in Europe increasingly to influence or to discredit critical scientists.
There is therefore hardly researchers who were not intertwined with corporations.
For business critical studies were not published in the rule.
"The industry controls the security research," Hilbeck claimed.
The trail of stones
Uli Gsell which concerned, a total of around 400 kilograms.
On Monday evening he stood from Stuttgart station, the Tuba on the back.
It was Demo.
It snowed heavily.
The story is well-known: the excavators were angerückt in September and had started to cut a big slice of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands marched against S21, the station's multi-billion deep erlegung.
When it came to freeze, a large part of the wing in ruins.
Zerbrochen 6.000, 7.000 pieces.
Crailsheimer mussel shell, a soft rough stone between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He has a couple of scraps guaranteed.
"These stones are Reliquien."
"You cannot disappear."
He schwärmt: "A cheap and poor Stein, simple and detention."
When he a aufsägte, was the rat after cigarette smoke.
What he will do with the headache, he still do not know.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell.
The trail leads the Stuttgart stones in a forest in Tübingen on a former munitions deposits of the French army, where Manuel Rongen has built his empire.
The 44 year-old person with old stones.
He has bought all fell in the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame, they would Schotter or disappear in the hole," he says in his office, a Holzbüdchen, which was once a guard häuschen.
Beschimpft and threatened to have him, he tells than in September in the newspapers that he bought the remnants of the northern wing of the demolition contractors have.
But he talked with the S-21-Gegnern for days.
And he told them that he now nothing for the demolition could.
And if it is now, then it is surely the right thing when the stones were reused.
About 200 S-21-Gegner then took an average 80 kilos heavy Quader with unit prices 6,50 to 14 euros.
As the memory, some but also in the hope it to be able to return a reconstruction.
500 tonnes had bought Rongen, 25 major Lkw-Ladungs.
About half is still in the forest, the rest is long sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardener, Häuslebauer.
From everywhere they arrived and had weggeschleppt, which could bear boot space and supporters.
The Stuttgart stones of contention have long turned into "Mäuerle" or limits of Kräuterbeeten.
"This stone is actually nothing special," says Rongen.
"If not the political component."
He is rising in his SUV makes a tour through his 20 hectares great empire.
Law, he has studied and discontinued later biology, then he cares for computers and eventually stone dealers have become.
And Stone lovers.
40000 tonnes of stones he eclipses.
For the whole Germany karrt his treasures together.
He says he is the biggest Altsteinhändler of the Republic.
He slows down.
In the snow are skillful fitting sand stones.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marie Bridge," he told me.
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, he schwärmt.
"My favourite stone."
It is the way high through the forest.
It shows a bunch: red sand stone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe station.
And further.
"Schöner Travertin."
The Quader once belonged to the gallery of the Stuttgart Neckarstadien.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart police headquarters, rötlich stone is complemented with from the cathedral of St. Blasien, Tuff from Heilbronner hospital.
What work the effort, which sweat.
If Rongen remembers how the stones earlier by hand and with simple Flaschenzugs and karren were moved, he is quite reverential.
"It would be a scandal if we were a little schreddern."
Reich is he not become immensely rich even less.
But 14 people today the stone dealers, also above the forest Steinmetze, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a Glasbläser and a horticulturalists settled.
"We are working hard, but it is satisfactory," says the residual those who exploit.
He must soon after Cologne.
There are stones there to save.
Have cleverly campaign High-Potentials
There is a lively crush at the buffet.
Sixteen students push for salmon something, tomato soup and trick.
The Technical University brown schweig and the car manufacturers Volkswagen invited the engineering and Designstudenten at a workshop.
In a kind of contest of ideas, they should together with VW-Entwicklern fachsimpeln on the car of the future - and incidentally Volkswagen acquaintance.
In the scramble for the brightest minds are now many companies in the Nahkampf and, as VW, in cooperation with the universities.
Your mission: the smartest graduates to recruit as early as possible in the hearing rooms, before they come on the labour market and are being courted by others.
And because the university does not publish data on the performance of their students, trying to Ausnahmetalente into practical projects and to tie.
On second day of the workshop of the TU brown schweig car company enlisting the talents.
A young lady from the personnel department distributed ballpoint pen, rubber gum and Mappen with VW-Logo.
It tells the hopeful Jungtalenten of training programmes and student jobs and show them ways in the company.
Nico Selle of the TU brown schweig cared for the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
"VW can learn at the same time students, interesting candidates closer and consider who would come as a staff in question."
Such cooperation, as Selle, are not unusual.
What is new is that gebuhlt will be so offensive about the students.
"Otherwise the emphasis was more on the technical project," says Selle.
The battle for fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many industries, the companies can't their employees to choose more from a large crowd of applicants.
But they need to advertise and particularly balzen high skilled workforce.
Above all graduates from the Ingenieurdisziplinen are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German engineers VDI remained in October about 40.000 engineering unfilled.
And the so-called engineering gap will be even greater, according to VDI-Prognosen.
For the economic inspection and consultancy firm, and KPMG Dykta story have cleverly hunting.
He organised elaborate Recruiting-events such as the kpmg race, a kind of modern do with trails, in which the participants on the basis of GPS-Koordinaten must find their way.
Eight promising students wants the company next year send across the United States.
Incidentally, can look at the participants kpmg branches and learn the business.
Who should decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of many candidates flying into the United States.
At the cut and sting at the High Potentials of universities are growing every day, the artillery, according to Dykta.
"We want to withdraw from the deluge us with the Race."
"We were only a simple Segeltörn little."
For Dykta have cleverly hunters the bill seems to be working.
"We have to date with all the participants of a similar action last year contact."
"Some are nearing completion and will soon want to compete with us," he says.
In addition to the direct Buhle on campus go above all small and medium-sized enterprises also quite classic in professional fairs on the Pirsch.
"We try graduates to achieve technical messes."
"Some of the Inter-Parliamentary solar," reported Sitha Stübe staff head in solar technology manufacturer solar world.
The Bonn company employs around 1.500 workers in Germany.
Stübe knows about the recruitment problems.
There are currently on the corporate website for 35 posts advertised.
"It is very difficult to fill vacant positions."
"It costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is the contact on the Uni-Professors.
Solar world is cooperating with various universities, such as the university in free mountain.
"The professors give indications that we should do internships or write his thesis."
Expensive advertising campaigns are not needed in the solar specialists.
To this end, the company is trying with other benefits to promote: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"That often cannot offer a big company," says Staff head Stübe.
Money plays in the longer the main role.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good career opportunities are other key factors.
Solar world came in a study of the Great Place to Work Institute the 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The institute compiles an annual list of German employers.
It interviewed staff as satisfied they are with their work and their Jobumfeld and look at the framework conditions for the workers.
Staff head Stübe looking also used in the Jobsuchendes of the placement.
"I think that applicants particularly look at external assessments about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer branding Academy advises companies with a long-term strategy to build a good reputation as employers want.
He advises his clients to more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all internal measures.
"The best way, as an employer to attractive leads on the own staff," he says.
In industry jargon branding, the domestic Employer means employer brand education within their own workforce.
"Happy employees are the best ambassadors."
If you do its people well, and they identify with the company, then they would quite alone with friends and acquaintances canvass for her employer.
"This is like a game with band," says Kriegler.
Obama blocking new drilling
Before the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drilling in the coming years.
The government in Washington has enacted a ban - and thus their previous plans finally revoked.
Also new drilling off the Atlantic coast remain banned for the time being.
This told Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, at least to apply for the next five years, is the explosion of the Bohrplattform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the accident, the 11 workers dead and resulted in the US major environmental disaster, President Barack Obama on pressure from the opposition and the industry signaled its readiness, new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico should be permitted.
Advocates want to ensure that the US dependency on oil supplies from abroad.
Who bears the responsibility for the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf, is still not finalised.
At the heart of the criticism of the British energy company BP is faced with billions in claims.
A commission of inquiry on behalf of Obama should present their results in the course of the December.
In October of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the Bohrstopp imposed after the explosion.
In the end had various oil companies immediately applications for new Bohrvorhaben.
With tighter controls and stricter safety regulations, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a fresh disaster.
At the moment the competent control authority after numerous corruption charges was in disrepute, fundamentally reformed.
At the same time, Obama announced lucrative tax schlupflochs to close for the oil and Gaskonzerne.
The industry now publicly warns that the output in the Gulf by a tighter regulation would be significantly lower than previously.
"The government's plans are the biggest obstacle for the growth of the oil and gas industry" is the result of a recent industry survey by the consultancy firm BDO - even before the Bohrverbot on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also lamented the uncertainty in the industry: "Nobody knows what exactly is with the regulation will change."
Investment in new projects would until further notice postponed - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is spent
The water in the rivers is ölbraun, it smells like at the petrol station: billion litres of spillage of crude oil have destroyed nature in Ogoniland in Nigeria.
The people of theft, corruption and illegal Ölkochen.
Celestine Akpobari says it well.
"Plagt not away" reassured the green activist journalists: "You will get in front of the lens oily slime enough today."
The 37-year-old Nigerians has followed the attempt, one by watenden boy on the chest in the water with him around Schlieres abzulichten: in the regenbogenfarbenen water are being is sapping the scene almost beautiful.
The fact that tops brown crude oil below the surface, is not to be seen.
In the past, they have collected buckets and wise shrimps, tells Esther Badom on the shores of the Bodo-Jetty-Flusses.
In the meantime is the lazy river waters completely dead.
Before five years from a geborsten pipeline loads of crude oil in the vast wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby city Bodo must row now six hours in order to get into fish containing waters: the Ogoniland situated in the heart of the Niger Delta is regarded as one of the worst verpesteten regions of the world.
On the journey through the mangrove sumpfs criss-crossed by rivers is striking the extent of the devastation.
Instead of murky water brown unsavory brew was wühlt the engine boat, who appears in his hand into the water, prefers ölig finger, it has emerged.
The roots of the mangrove bäumchen as black Lakritzstangen from the soil, sad isolated trees to hang their Wedel.
Vogelschwärme, as they are usual in wetlands, looking in vain: as soon as the external border is spreading in the silent as a filling station fragrance end eerily calm from former paradise.
"What happens is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari sinister: "We live in constant danger for the health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The residential area of the Ogoni is a for decades contested battleground: here, the first Explorateure from Europe in more than 60 years ago, a here organized in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa initial resistance, the shell company here had to stop its production in 1993, because it was too dangerous for its Ölarbeiter.
Even today, the company denied the return to Ogoniland: while the entire delta region of the triple the size of Switzerland, with more than 5.000 Bohrquellen and 7.000 kilometres donated daily more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped in Ogoniland, the oil fields, are lying idle at the corporation is unstable situation.
All the few hundred metres steel Gestells as bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christian bäumchen" the heads of the boreholes sunk too lack mentioned.
They are up to 50 years old, most shook korrodiert.
It is always such a Bohrkopf apart, says Akpobari, then rinne a constant stream of crude oil into the water.
More than two billion litres, according to expert estimate in 50 years were spilled into the ecosystem of the Delta: year on year, the quantity of oil, as they are in the wreck of the super tanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago into the sea off Alaska, one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Who is to blame for the ongoing Öko-GAU about the dispute.
While the shell company sabotage and organized Öldiebstahl for more than 90 percent of the pollution responsible, environmentalists see berstend Bohrkopfs and leakage pipelines as the main culprit.
Shell attach in Nigeria much lower safety standards than usual in the world, the US-Wissenschaftler Richard Steiner accused the corporation 2008: alone, the rate of defects in the pipes "that is several times higher than elsewhere."
At a place from afar as an abandoned, ölverschmiert garage looks under skies are appearing in the Mangroves figures: they are cluster naked and ölverschmiert up to our necks.
Under one of the many barrels, partly associated with flasks, partly arbitrary scattered on the site to identify flackert a fire: an illegal small refinery.
The barrel of crude oil on the fire several hours heated, said Michael, the head of the group.
First of all, gets petrol through the pipes in the detention facility, in the end tröpfelt eventually headed kerosene and diesel, it has emerged.
Thus produce Michael and four staff on a daily basis to four Fässer diesel à 300 litres: "This brings us 34.000 Naira a ' - around 22 dollars.
The delta residents use the chronic fuel shortages in the Africa's largest oil state.
Nigeria only has a single refinery.
According to the barely 40 euro cents per litre ridiculously low diesel prices can still offer the illegal Kocher: because their raw materials are getting it for free.
It comes from "Bunkerern," the pipeline network across Ogoniland tap: in this way to go to the country, according to experts in the entire Niger Delta daily lost at least 16 million litres of crude oil.
Only a tiny part of the provisional zwischengelagerten raw material is illegal: according to the lion's share fill organised criminal networks, including politicians and senior military officers should belong in tankers, and command it on the world market.
The debate whether the environmental disaster rather activities is due to the population or the lax production methods, the Akpobari activist considers purely academic.
"If the oil companies are not perceived as invaders and if they had the livelihood of the fishermen not as thoroughly destroyed, there would be neither sabotage or theft and illegal refineries."
Meanwhile, it is the relationship of the Ogoni above all to Shell but so destroyed that only a withdrawal of the corporation into question would be: "Perhaps other nationalities, such as the Chinese and better out of this mess."
Since Michael nervous.
"It is high time that it disappears," says the muskulös Ölmann.
"Every minute, the soldiers can come."
If the illegal Ölveredler caught by the special unit of the armed forces face no arrest, but a painful bribe.
Even the soldiers mainly originating from the land of sisters - want - like all Nigerians, benefit from the raw material.
"Our country this damned stuff brought in every respect to the dog," says Akpobari.
Investigators discover hazardous construction defects in A380 Triebwerken
The A380 has obviously a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction defects in the investigation of a notgelandeten machine to a "catastrophic train case" could result.
The Qantas airline now wants to sue the engine manufacturers.
The passengers of the notgelandeten Qantas-Airbus at the beginning of November had apparently much more luck than familiar: the Australian air safety authority has a major safety problem in their investigations in the engines of some A380 machines detected - and now warns of a possible construction defects.
The potential defect could have serious consequences: it could Ermüdungsrisse with a Ölschlauchverbindung and leakages produce," they said in a statement published in this Thursday's authority ATSB.
This would have "a catastrophic train incident" can lead.
They are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce whose 20 aircraft A380 series.
This is the Qantas-Airbus, who had to notlanden in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
They submitted a claim in an Australian Federal Court in Sydney a allowing further legal action against the company.
Qantas-Chef Alan Joyce said his airline will receive compensation for the incident demand at the beginning of November.
The fire in the engine parts had abated and the Tragfläches damaged.
Rolls-Royce whose made a Ölbrand as the cause for the damage.
After the incident must now worldwide to 40 design engines to be replaced.
The Australian researchers announced to carry out further safety tests on the Superjumbos, which are equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce whose said ATSB-Sprecher Martin Dolan.
The security problem is deemed sufficiently important to inform all stakeholders.
After the Qantas-Maschine of an emergency evacuation had the airline its A380 fleet kept for weeks on the ground.
Singapore Airlines left about three of its eleven A380 temporarily on the ground.
The Lufthansa changed in a year as a precautionary measure, the train station.
The doppelstöckige line is the world's largest passenger plane.
Land further snowfall solves transport chaos
Germany entirely in white: overnight almost fallen snow throughout the country.
Chaos on many roads, trains and flights.
In car accidents at least three people lost their lives.
The winter frostet Germany: in icy temperatures is almost zugeschneit the whole republic in the night on the Thursday - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east are partially 15 centimetre thick snow deckes.
On several motorways and many roads are severely restricted the movement.
On the A7 in Flensburg was the winter service in the permanent deployment, has been with the permanent new aufwehenden snow but not finished.
In addition fegten fierce Bös on the Baltic coast.
The Federal Office for shipping and Hydrographie (BSH) expected on the Baltic coast Schleswig-Holsteins from morning to storm flood with water levels by 1.2 meters on the normal subject.
In Saxony, the Schneeverwehungs resulted in major problems on the motorways and federal roads.
According to the meteorological centre Meteomedia was affecting Switzerland therefore alert trendy purple - the highest level ever.
Partly there 30 centimeters Neuschnee fell, fresh and strong winds were responsible for Verwehungs.
It is there that remained in the night stuck several trucks and cars.
The police authorities in Saxony-Anhalt notified major disruption on the roads.
On the A2 led snow and wind on stalled traffic and congestion.
In Thuringia were affected by the snow, the A4 and A9.
According to Deutsche Bahn in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and significant disruptions in the north in Bavaria.
Snow on the rails, fallen trees on the track or destroyed upper lines and guidelines are the main problems.
In Saxony, the long-distance transport from Leipzig had to be stopped after Nuremberg.
In thüringisch, a us volume of activity had to stop his trip to Munich.
The 165 passengers were firemen and Rettungshelfern provided on the train with Wolldeckes food and drink.
Schneewinde fegten on the streets.
At major German airports, the Schneewinde lead to numerous flight cuts.
In Munich, according to a spokesman for the Flugauskunft-Zentrale have already reported some cancellations.
In Frankfurt am Main were already 40 flights have been cancelled, according to a Fraport-Sprecherin.
The winter service is in the permanent deployment.
It is true that are only a few stranded passengers at the airport, they are still less than 400 field beds ready.
On many roads, it was already on Wednesday evening to accidents.
The night was a lorry driver in the crash with a train at a railway crossing in Ostholstein died.
The driver was slightly injured.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg happened because snow covered roads to a similar accident: here again was covered a lorry at a railway crossing, because the car remained.
The driver was killed.
Four passengers injured in the train, the line of Bayreuth after Nuremberg was therefore until blocked in the early hours.
In addition, a 30 year-old woman died after she with her car in construction ape temple had passed very quickly on slippery roads.
Good news meteorologists but: it is true that the snow will still be loose and pulverig, and therefore already with an easy Bös.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic is plagued by rapid and stürmend winds.
However, it remains very cold - local example to minus 15 degrees.
German bank seeks a buyer for their twin towers
The German bank wants to separate itself from its flagship: according to a newspaper report seeks monetary house buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euro could bring the property.
The German bank has just made its corporate headquarters nicely: the twin towers in Frankfurt banking neighbourhoods have been modernised; now the bankers were allowed back to their old jobs.
But now wants the financial group's cost for the renovation apparently get - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rise buildings, such as the "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, citing a spokesman.
Reasons for the planned sale called the speaker does not.
"We always consider whether it makes more sense to even possess or sell real estate, and then zurückzumieten," he said.
This is Germany's biggest credit institute his headquarters already after a short time again.
The bank had the twin tower until the middle of 2007 for 272 million euros adopted by the investors of a domestic fund and then refurbished expensive.
The energy conversion devoured the information after around 200 million euros.
A sale would bring a lot of money in the bank.
Industry experts are appreciate the value of the now in "green towers" according to the newspaper dubbed towers at around 500 million euros.
Whether the building again be sold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor, is still open, said the spokesman.
Thousands mourn dead mates
More than 10.000 people thought the buried miners in New Zealand after several explosions in a mine were declared dead.
Still, the bodies could not be recovered because the security situation is precarious in further damaged schacht.
Barely two weeks ago, it was in the Pike River mine near the town of grey to come up with a fierce explosion.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 years were buried under days.
A probe had been left in the schacht, but had discovered no trace of survivors.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and further subsequent explosions could not rescue forces for security reasons rise.
After the second fierce blasts were the authorities and experts assumed that there will be no survival diminished for mates.
The bodies could not be recovered so far.
Now flash relatives and friends with a memorial ceremony for the dead.
Ten thousand people gathered in bright sunshine in grey gathered at the New Zealand southern island.
They were silent for two minutes.
A Tribute to the buried miners were 29 tables set on which helmets, lamps and see the names of the mates were.
There are also pictures and personal belongings, including clothes and Surfbretter found a niche here.
Before the government buildings in the country flying flags at half-mast.
New Zealand have hoped that the miners "from the depths of the earth" would come back to the surface, the New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said to the participants of the ceremony.
"But they never came home."
He could not conclude with the death of his son, as long as he does not whose corpse saw, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the hole.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims measures several foreign diplomats to the ceremony part.
In the first explosion on 19 November were miners had been buried in British and South African origin.
Rescue workers started a fire inside the coal mine in the southern island of New Zealand to delete.
As soon as the explosive gases are ousted, will be started, the herunterzukühlen hot temperatures inside the mine, said Police Minister Gary Knowles to journalists.
With regard to the hell warrior!
The art cinemas Splatter assimilate?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn lotet with his combatant saga "Walhalla Rising," new from old the genetic borders.
The Danish director at which audience may Nicolas Winding Refn thought when he "Walhalla Rising," revolved around?
A captured wikinger warriors with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) freed itself from its Peinigers and sets with almost superhuman forces order as his opponents - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero like rough killing methods used and its enemies before the Gedärms snaps from the alive if he bad mood.
On the other hand says Einauge as he is called, in fact, the whole film on any word, and the other characters are at most times on one or two sentences or a few painful Todesschreis.
Otherwise kept quiet and gruselig beautiful hill landscape of Scotland have feasted upon the wikinger world of about a thousand years provides the backdrop.
More ideal for adult Cineasten with interest of Existentialismus and very quiet camera journeys.
Fine, if a film has several target groups, only a pity if they are mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn has been in force for his wild and gestylt drogendealer trilogie 'Pusher' as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoical refuses to acknowledge his works with a little more humour the mainstream or a little less brutality to make the Arthouse available.
Most Kunstkino-Freunde are likely from around spritzend brain mass and the Gedärms be deterred.
The Action-Fans will then be able to die from boredom, if Einauge from free interpretierbaren reasons with a bunch of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and Waterloo. an eternity in slack and fog before the team apparently arrives in America and remain silent.
Little wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising," has found no cinema in cinemas in Germany and is now only appeared on DVD.
This is particularly because of the magnificent images of a shame, but also because behind the grandiose until blood triefend facade hiding a sometimes exciting piece of cinema, which has earned a little attention.
In this film is not about dialogue or a coherent plot, it is all atmosphere, a film had fever dream.
And for which there is no escape for the spectators.
Refn he might barely a moment of relaxation and undertakes him with his icy images and the sinister Trance-artigen sound track very slowly, but above all with the unspeakable hatred of him has anti-American from the hearts of the characters.
Only a small blonde boy, the Einauge faithful to the side, retains something like innocence, all others are driven by rage.
Most of the one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained, but for enemies and temporary allies sometime on the warrior from hell, possibly on the ambassador of the devil himself.
It means destruction, but perhaps only for the already Verdorbenen.
"Walhalla Rising," is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire the Ärgers, Aufregen and next.
An experience.
Puzzle Erdarbeiten
The International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country does, however, to comment - still leaves it controls.
As an antidote to midnight of 5 to 6 September 2007 will jump at least four Israeli F-15 i warplanes a mysterious, würfelförmiges building in Syria.
It is on the shores of the Tigris; the next major city, 30 miles away, is Dair as-Saur.
Your name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), when it comes to the reactor, which Syria allegedly with help from North Korea has built in the Quader, hidden in a valley of the stream.
According to a briefing of the US-Auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA by the end of April 2008 would be under the name of the near village el-Kibar familiar reactor have been well suited to produce plutonium, which could be employed to build nuclear weapons.
For other purposes hardly worth the technology from the fifties.
The CIA has led a video presentation with vague satellite imagery.
Per computer they ignored a animation where the components of the reactor should be have been before the destruction of a smaller copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyong nuclear center is.
They also presented photographs showing the building from the vicinity or even the interior space.
The reactor was briefly stood before the operation, it was said, but not yet been drawn up with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is hardly more well-known than then, were the mystery even wider with the passage of time.
Former US President George W. Bush has recently unveiled in his memoir that the CIA was fairly safe before the attack that Syria has built a reactor in el-Kibar, but hardly evidence saw that in the country, "an active nuclear weapons program" existed.
Some intelligence officers in Europe are still prefer more cautious and speak only of a "alleged reactor," even if they CIA-Präsentation find "plausible."
You lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
What is needed, how safe it is to have a reactor, replied only bland a high UN-Diplomat in the summer, the IAEA was "enough material to ask questions."
According to the rubble of the alleged "ungenutzten Militärgebäudes" the Syrians eager to one side and thoroughly planierten the terrain.
However, there was an IAEA team in June 2008 under the former chief inspector Olli hein in el-Kibar traces of uranium had been produced by people.
The IAEA also received commercial providers on a Member State satellite images directly from the time after the attack, which should be more meaningful than the CIA.
However, these recordings do not have to get on the market because of the unknown purchaser - perhaps Israel - she has bought exclusive.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot independently verify their authenticity.
Syria has always declared, never pursued a secret nuclear program or a reactor built.
The uranium come from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus.
But it rejected the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely back.
Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss - as on the satellite imagery.
In addition, it denied the inspectors access to a second inspection in el-Kibar and the rubble of the bombed-out buildings.
But Israel says iron.
"We will never comment on the ', recently reiterated to the time of the attack incumbent Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, the official position.
The investigation of the case thus dragging on since June 2008 inconclusive, "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority," as a senior Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna - after all, a serious breach of the NPT in the area, about which the IAEA monitoring.
As a key to progress in the Enlightenment, the IAEA appears to be three more bodies, "functional contact with the alleged reactor" should - and unlike those still exist.
In this context, the inspectors have not revealed what the assets are, nor what role they have or what they can appear to be suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they will be on the IAEA internal as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah called, in turn, derived from nearby towns.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these locations and at satellite images tracked down a building complex in Masyaf, where it is most likely is one of the suspicious objects.
It is probably in or adjacent to a military base - exactly with this justification denied Syria the IAEA access to the three places.
In Vienna, it says, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will be vorgeschickt by the United States, auszuspähen at military installations.
Because the Nukleardetektive were carefully through a tip from the US on the facilities have become.
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the Quader on the Euphrates material out and was transported.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could "in connection with the fuel production."
But there is "no evidence of sensitive activities," i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes which are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with uranium is not enriched.
But where the uranium could have come from and where we draw from this later should be separated plutonium for the bomb on these central issues if anything, there are plausible assumptions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could pose a valuable clues in the three places were stored.
When would the hundreds Lastwagenladungen disappeared from the ground, nobody wants to have information about where the rubble remained.
The only a few kilometres from el-Kibar located on the other side of the Tigris al-Tibni salt mine, which Syria in 1998 on their suitability as a camp has investigated for radioactive waste, the IAEA is unlikely.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley she was recently in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review with the reactor in mid-afternoon.
Photographs from orbit show, however, that Syria to the three suspicious places Erdarbeiten and large containers removed after the IAEA access had requested.
This cannot be coincidence, but has hardly helped to dispel the suspicion.
In addition, it says in diplomatic circles, the IAEA have spent many months to develop a plan for inspections there, Syria should allow to maintain any military secrets - just the tape shows how great is the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damascus bügelte this proposal.
Although Western diplomats in Vienna soothed even a year ago, the reactor was destroyed, so the matter did not have any urgency, brings about US Ambassador Glyn Davies for a few months ago so-called special inspections into the game, one of the harshest means that has the Vienna nuclear authority to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano should propose these inspections, has already " an option for which I am open in the future ', even though he hesitates.
There is a high risk in this way: first, it needs for a majority in the Board of Governors of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries represented are anything but eager for an escalation.
Secondly, as a diplomat to consider: "What if they find nothing in the end?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie in the summer with the work of their still anonymous government debüt has begun, there is anger.
She has even written the script, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
We know much more about not - but it is sufficient for unrest.
There is the rumor, the woman, a Muslim woman, verliebe during the Yugoslav war in her Serb rapist.
Bosnian women's groups immediately protested, and some Drehtags planned in Sarajevo were transferred in the short term to Hungary.
In the meantime, the film marginalised in Hungary and in the postal production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote about the UN-Flüchtlingshilfswerk UNHCR, Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, has reported a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is even ambassador of UN-Flüchtlingshilfswerk.
It is not Diplomatisch - she has the women weeks before a meeting in Hungary offered what but refused.
The meeting should take place in Bosnia, so Hasecic.
Liebesgeschichten in Vergewaltigungscamps, it was not given, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims would not be betraying her enough about the script.
Your organisation has recommended, according to the UN-Flüchtlingshilfswerk to dismiss Jolie as ambassador, reported the Guardian.
But what exactly Jolie wrote for scenes?
The Bosnian Culture Ministry, which was to read their script, after some to-ing and fro-ing issued a permit for Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie then not yet came.
The young author even claimed to have no political intentions with their film was incorporated into the Yugoslav conflict with much difficulty, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all interested parties.
As for the content, however, it remains vague.
Still, a second Synopsis has been circulating for film in the network, which sounds quite different: the lovers knew before war broke out and meet again, a Bosnian Muslim woman when she is kidnapped at a Serb camp, where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different than the variant "rape victims verknallt torturer."
The fact that Jolie film actually starts before the war - so much is safe.
The pressure on them, as Jolie is "unfair and based on misinformation."
She can now probably just give the hackers of Hollywood peace: in dismissing the script, like so many before illegal online.
Nothing like away here
This evening is finally again right around for the Irish.
No trace of sadness.
To this end, the home team dominates his guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States too much.
The fans johlen in delight in pushing loud music, it with the feet.
The bebt Bailey-Pub in the southern Irish Cork, because the players Tischtennisbälle on a three metre ' throw in beer pot - and meetings.
"Beer pong" refers to the bizarre spectacle, to win there are 500 euro victorious premium plus airline tickets to Las Vegas for the Bierpong-Weltmeisterschaften in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the low-key computer, which is not really fits together.
Yet tried the 26 people to divert from the nagging question what the future will bring.
In his plan is not playing card in Las Vegas, he will be in January Bewerbungsgespräche lead in New Zealand.
"I an uneasy," he says.
"It is so far away from home and I still have no work."
After all: his girlfriend in Auckland already waiting for him, "she had zuck their Wunschjob and event managerin, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and smile.
Because of poor prospects at home have already been two of Tanners three Geschwistern sought their fortune abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social arbeiterin in Sydney, his brother Colin, now a point as IT-Berater in London.
The boys go: as with the Tanners it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish will leave the country shortly, say experts of the Economic and Sozialforschungsinstituts ESRI in Dublin ahead.
Until 2015 they expect even with 200.000 immigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants have a fierce loss.
Bewahrheiten forecasts a migration west comparable with that under which Ireland has suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of recovery for the Irish brought great prosperity, is now again wide.
The economic crisis unsettled especially the young, well-educated Irish, for which it has only uphill.
Jobverlust and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed money there was in abundance.
Meanwhile, however, three out of ten women and men under 30 without work.
In the Irish Times abound Leserbriefe young emigrants who complain: "Everything is in Ireland crashed."
"There should be a revolt against politicians and bankers - but who can goes away and so that our country will lose a whole generation."
"The last thing we do ask the light."
Leanne studentin Caulfield, President of the Irish student union, bringing a bleak future, because the government only window dressing and the young people no longer provides a future prospects.
"You reduce wages, but they have no strategy as new jobs are to be created," says 20 people.
They watched as their colleagues from an unpaid internship on another.
Their biggest concern, she says, either, even migrate in four years to have.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
It try men such as Stephen McLarnon positive to occupy the subject.
McLarnon organized the "working abroad exhibition," a fair, an all-round service on work abroad offers.
"For entrants is the work abroad but a great opportunity to make the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.

The message is clear: work abroad is not a Galeerendienst, but also brings freedom and fun.
As it is, that's something to build elsewhere, white Seán O'Donovan for half a year.
Because of the 29 year-old engineer in Ireland had nothing more to do, now he is working with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany.
In Genselkirchen withdrawing just a fashion house high.
In January, it continues to Hanover or Berlin, for the next project.
His home O'Donovan now provides only rare, because it makes Extraschichten the credit for being able to abbezahlen his house back home.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says, as he for a long time for the first time tramples on the threshold of his home.
"I deserve money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I almost never do."
He laughs a little embarrassed and through ausgekühlt areas.
The small house is in a nice neighborhood with leafy front gardens in the Einfahrts park large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan the home bought for 380.000 euros for four years - 100% credit financed.
"It was crazy times, it was easy money without many questions," he says.
Did he fear that it could go wrong with the credit?
O'Donovan thought for a while, hot tea after and says: "I have no children, I must feed and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start new."
The civil engineers may regret not he currently often hears.
"No one should starve - our situation is nowhere near as dramatic as in former times here on the island," he says.
"A while working abroad, which is not the worst, what can happen - maybe we feel by first as Irish."
Then he laughs and tells of his father in the last major economic crisis has gone to England.
"After seven years, he was back and life went in Ireland further, very simple."
Cian Tanner like this idea.
The future open and just look how it runs with the life elsewhere.
A few years of work in London, he has also been behind and why it should not run well in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend?
There is one thing but still worry about accompanying him in these days: the celebration on his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears that it could degenerate into a lebewohl party.
"The not too many emotions," says he and drink a big Schluck of his beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds scary."
"We prefer to call it a Weggehparty, very loose, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The demokatrische routine
The democracy movement in Latin America will be stronger, such as the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region is the influence of Brazil larger than the United States.
These results came the Latinobarómetro-Umfrage, which conducted in 18 countries and exclusive was published in The Economist.
Since 1995, this survey will be carried out on a regular basis and demonstrates the freedom of change in this region.
Two facts fall in this year's survey in September and October particularly in's eye.
First, the good mood in Latin America
And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions.
In many countries, the democratic movement in the South American Pacific coast has increased sharply (Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy since 2002 is growing by approximately 6% per year, increased the number of democracy activists by 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy since the sharp fall in the last year recovered, is to see such a trend.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the world's two most populous countries in the region are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average (graph 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents said that they are satisfied with the democratic practices of their country. That as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (graph 3).
Approximately 34% trust the Congress of its country and 45% of their government. Both values are equivalent to those of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Before a decade undermined Latin America's economic crises efforts for more democracy.
It also continued during the global economic crisis is probably due to the fact that the Latin American countries experienced only a brief recession, and have recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were absorbed by a stronger social network.
(According to reports by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week rose in 2009, the poverty rate in Latin America only slightly and has again fallen by 32% this year.)
But from country to country there are strong Stimmungsunterschiede (graph 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread progress thinking reflect that.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
It was only the second time since polling began to see many respondents in Latin America in the crime in their country a greater problem than unemployment (graph 5).
Approximately 31% say that either themselves or a family member in the past year victim of a crime was. But compared to 38% last year fell the values and thus achieve the lowest since 1995.
The rising economic performance is reflected in the greater support from the private sector and the market economy is mirroring: approximately 71% of respondents trans-regional that the private sector is essential for the development in 2007, there were 56% (graph 6).
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents maintain this view in Venezuela (and 80% are for a private sector), even though her leftist president, Hugo Chávez, many private companies nationalized.
Brazil has loudly 19% of respondents (18% last year) the greatest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year).
The respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, however, see the most influential country in the US, and this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua from Venezuela.
An election weak
Nobody had expected that the elections on 28 November in Haiti would be perfect.
But the facts exceeded the fears of the polling officials who rushed to help the beleaguered country, far from it.
Overcrowding Wahlurnen multiple votes, electoral notes in the Rinnstein destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only a part of the problems.
Wahllokale opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom became displaced by the January earthquake were built against mountain slopes in search of a choice.
Finally, some gave quite.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected leader, demanded on the basis of an alleged fraud the lifting of the election results.
In the whole country was partly violent protests.
However, Edmond called Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, the election "as quite good in many issues."
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organisation of American States and the Caribbean Community "make these irregularities, so serious they may be, the process is not necessarily void."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, the alleged the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate is committed Jew Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected runoff is scheduled for January.

Secretly in the middle
In the weeks after the sudden death of your husband told Argentina's President Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy, their popularity rate by 20 points to more than 50% upwards. This is the highest value since her election in 2007.
Whether her this, however, carries a re-election next year depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández kompromissbereiter than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Nestor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Nestor Kirchner, who also directed the economic policy after the election of his wife, often budgets on tax revenues, the economic growth and inflation are not fully incorporated.
This allowed the presidential couple, the extra revenue to spend as they see fit.
In the paper last year Mr. government lost the majority in Congress.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further clashes.
Some dissidents from the ranks of the ruling Peronisten rallying behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (in which a parliamentarian another hit in the face and others lying to the government of corruption), the Congress failed to adopt the budget for 2011.
"I will not discuss" the President.
The budget for 2010 now also applies to the next year, which the President has more opportunity to spend as they see fit.
The economy runs hot: it is likely this year to grow up to 9%.
The official inflation rate is for Z. at 11,1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the unions - drive the value of almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was racked by economic crises, said its main objectives for growth and poverty reduction, and not the inflation reduction.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, schikanierte the private sector and the national institute for statistics and census säuberte INDEC, then schönte the official inflation statistics.
Fernandez can now follow a path?
It has the private economy and trade union leaders called for talks.
And, according to official statements are supposed to wage increases next year will be limited to 18%.
The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given a strong boost to the economy.
But the inflation undermined the growth spurt by a great devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps would like to Cristina Fernández for this reason Argentina financial back to join the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government took an agreement with the former restructuring of the country had rejected in 2001.
Fernandez seems now to an agreement with the lenders to push from the Paris Club, which it owes approximately 6,7 Dollar billion.
The Kirchners had a review by the IMF, as elsewhere usual always rejected.
But in the last month, the economy minister Amado Boudou announced that the fund in the preparation of a new national consumer price index "technical assistance" it looks as this would be the first step towards the cleansing of the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernandez after their term even without the support from her husband will be politically active.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which has largely enough of Kirchnerism.
If the Argentinians in March to return from their summer holidays, the wave of Sympatie, it has been shown to be fizzled.
If they want to win another election, they must decide whether they many political decisions to lift her husband's quietly.
Schwacher applause for China
Taiwan's voters are coming slowly to a closer connection to the mainland.
What is stopping Taiwan from his big brother across the Straits?
On 27 November made more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of all voters in the five Stadtbezirken to elect mayors and councillors. This is as a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou welcomed.
By building cutting-edge business relations, einschl. a partial free trade agreement, Ma even a symbolic figure for relations with the mainland. His policy has the relationship with the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949 sustainable change.
Ma insisted the test, but only barely.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) three of the five mayors, they did not receive a majority of votes.
Instead, received the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates a greater independence of Taiwan, almost 50% of the votes, the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election would have meant this for Ma problems.
Since his election two years ago, the share of his party has fallen by approximately 8%.
For the first time the DPP even pulled together with the KMT in the councillors a.
During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as Lastwagenkonvois with Flaggen-schwenkende Massenumzüge and rarely are.
There was even the obligatory mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT felt on the eve of the election with a speech at a KMT-Kandidaten
When he shot a man from the crowd face. Lien was wounded and killed a umstehend spectator.
Most bizarre wiser is not clear whether the shooter Lien kill or wanted to settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless of the attack, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, affected the election and the DPP in a bad light brought what the KMT has brought more votes.
China was perhaps the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, the relationship has not been addressed to the mainland.
Instead, the candidates discussed here plans to social housing and the creation of jobs.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat.
This is why the KMT its relations with the government in Beijing is not like in the foreground.
But this time the DPP, the anti-Chinese sentiments to stir up too.
They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy can not survive without China.
Ma, in turn, would confirm that the majority of Taiwanese supported its China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy, Taiwan attract with economic incentives in the community.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei for a summit to prepare investment security and medical cooperation.
It also wants to see the political integration. But first things first.
It therefore prefer waiting until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has now reinvented.
Before two years ago it was severely weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui-bian was convicted of corruption in the prison.
During his presidency from 2000 until 2008 he vehemently for the absolute independence a.
But under Tais reign has developed a new generation of gemässigter politicians and the DPP is fighting for the votes of professionals and young people.
Tsai was held as a presidential candidate of the DPP great approval, as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Your party does everything in order to show that it is capable of building close relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning a of think tank as a contact point between the DPP and China, but this requires an unbiased discussions ahead.
Tsai said publicly that their party will offer a "trustworthy alternative" to Ma's hasty rapprochement with China.
Chen seems very angry about this change.
From his cell, he said, the candidates of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan independence.
He urged the pragmatists Su even to renounce the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen's interference does the DPP difficult to choose their potential candidate.
The KMT will undergo must own self-analysis.
Ma's values are poor, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT-Kandidaten wanted to conduct their campaigns without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem unemployment and the increasing gap between rich and poor.
According to testimony, he will be a KMT-Sprechers cabinet and revamp the local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan supports only limited a rapprochement.
At the same time, the majority of Taiwanese see the economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is no turning back."

Trombone Shorty, a pirate of some favorite from New Orleans and more frequent guest in HBOs "Treme" was an excellent Zeitgenössischer to jazz in the category in which otherwise rather Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber Alben are to be found.
The Secret Darcy James Societ of the wild Steampunk-Musikers Argue received in the category of large group deserved attention. It upsetting against the Billy Childs Emsemble with his Chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his Oktett, whose Life-Ablum "Merseyside pathways" a good example of a Bassist than democratic gang leaders.

Mosque in Temecula wins the approval of the planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula took place after a lengthy, often heated public hearing the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee.
Critics accused the project, both terrorism and to promote traffic jams.
But according to a statement by the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious center is in line with local rules and will be an aesthetic profile fishing.
"The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Baha'is, and many others," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic center of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"When Americans makes me proud."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"They are just very noisy."
"Wonderful people in this valley."
The meeting started at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the centre lasted almost until midnight, with the voices on both sides, according to pressing enterprise were pretty evenly distributed.
The debate was to continue on the website of the newspaper.
"There is no America more" was a comment.
"It is a different planet of the Apes' and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."

Arsen-resistente microbe could new life forms on Earth or elsewhere permit
The discovery of a foreign variety of bacteria, including arsenic can live, opens up new possibilities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists this unusual bacterium discovered here on earth, their view, it is a sign that a life without the hitherto considered as vital elements is possible.
"This organism has two options."
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic."
"That makes it something very special, although it is almost a kind of 'fremde ' way of life," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University and Co-Autor of the report on Thursday appears in the online edition of the journal Science.
So far six main elements considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But as the scientists figured out is growing the bacterium in the Californian mono Lake even further if phosphorus replaced by arsenic.
"One wonders what else is possible," said the report's Co-Autor Ariel D. of Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for outside earthly life, since scientists life and must recognize its forms of Anbar.
The study addresses microbes have been found on the planet.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details were announced about the discovery was cause for widespread speculation on the Internet that the report of the discovery could act außerirdischen life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other Planetensystemen organisms with the help of other elements biochemical processes can set in motion, and that the 'Standardelemente ', which, in our view, are absolutely vital, are not necessarily fixed prescribed," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University in the United Kingdom from Milton Keynes.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a new thing, because it shows that in an element of fundamental biochemical processes and structures can be replaced by another," added Cockell to add.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from the Astrobiologischen Institute of NASA, who led the study, chose the mono Lake because of the high Arsengehalts.
Since arsenic and phosphorus chemical equal, they thought that microbes that are both suspended, possibly an element can be replaced by the other.
"The toxicity of the Arsens above all is that it is chemically similar phosphorus."
"It is difficult, the organisms to distinguish an element from the other."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic pans unlike phosphorus. It ends up in our biochemisches system, where there have been virtually everything verschmiert ', said of Anbar.
The researchers used the bacterium GFAJ-1 rising arsenic concentration. It wanted and grew.
The microbe grows in phosphorus better, but that they also can survive in arsenic, shows that an arsenic standard form can happen, of course, either on earth or another planet or moon on the arsenic occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, believe in microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic, not new; but so far there was no functioning example.
Arsenic came more frequently in the early Erdjahren, she says, so the science assumed that early life forms have used it.
"The reason for the assumption that life may have developed differently than in the early geologically important," so Forster not sat in Wolfe-Simons research team.
The research were from NASA, the Energy Department and supported the national health authorities.

A New-Yorker bankruptcy judge began on Thursday offiziel the 'prepare' Gläuberplan to repay the debt to the tune of $5 billion and the 86 year-old entertainment companies to pave the way for new films and TV shows.
The plan, in accordance with the statements Thursday met the requirements of the US-Konkursrecht, so that the relaunch of MGM under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass entertainment, nothing more stands in the way.

In the spring of this year started everything from scratch, as the MGM-Team began with the restructuring plan after months of debate and infighting at the end of October was finally signed by the creditors.
If MGM formally in the next few weeks the bankruptcy has survived, preserved Moelis and Cooper for her work a bonus amounting to several millions of dollars.
The proportion of Moelis & company, which is already 1,2 Dollar million received amounts to 9,5 Dollar million
Cooper, who are paid a monthly 375.000 Dollar for the leadership of the company has received a "success bonus" of $4 million
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to resume production at MGM, and this year brought only a movie, it turned out the studio and produced an annual plan with seven or eight movies, beginning in 2012.
They also plan two films after " the small Hobbit ' in Co-Produktion with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond between 265 Dollar million to 275 Dollar million for its financial share in these two films, under the aegis of Peter Jackson should arise.
The investor Carl Icahn, who has funded approximately 18% of the MGM-Darlehens sought a merger of the studio with Lions Gate entertainment, he is its largest shareholder.

One reason is that the female officials the goods of merchants not as their male colleagues should confiscate.
You delinquents can only threaten them to notify their male superiors.
This is intended to protect them from public harassment that those officials are often exposed in China.
Hundreds of residents rioted outside in this year, Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, after the rumour stock-market boom, Chengguan-Beamte would have killed a trader.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan-Beamte were injured in the late-night incident, 14 government vehicles were upset or burned.
Xindu of these Gewaltausschreitungen have so far been spared.
But unrest are not to be excluded.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang-Platz, in which the female officials this morning, patroulierten gathered about 50 people on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle, contrary to the rules on the pavement, rather than in a garage was repaired.
The owner cried raised a hue and cry.
After 15 minütigem hesitation gave the officials with grim faces the way to their vehicles and drove with the motorcycle and his owner continues.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male Streife, stayed back. It was his white name tag in order to remain anonymous.
As their female colleagues play the coordinators - men over 40 - a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"We are sometimes verbally."
"Sometimes but also physical," said Mr. Li sober.
"The majority of the time people start with the dispute."
Prosecutor will not accuse Ensign Senator
Prosecutors of the Justice Department have Senator John Ensign acquitted of the charges after his Affaire with a former election worker and his attempt to gain a lobbying husband, have been levied against him, gave the lawyers of the senator known on Wednesday.
This decision ended the most serious legal accusation against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, which made for headlines nationwide and a damper on his career, he was seen as a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensigns office announced that he was on the verdict after the year-long investigation "delighted."
But the ethics committee of the Senate could still impose a Disziplarstrafe.
After the statement by Ensigns lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign hired and that no further charges are available in this matter.
The Justice Ministry did not want to comment on the case.
The judgment was for many Ethik-Anwälte outside the Justice Ministry a surprise. In your opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign the lobbying ban has flouted.
Interviews, emails and other documents for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times revealed were prompted to suspect that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of its election workers helped to lucrative contracts for his silence on a Affaire to buy with Hamptons wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was Ensigns during an election campaign working as a treasurer.
Ensign took contact with some political friends to give Hampton work; according to the documents and Verhören he took for them after the hiring Hamptons lobbying.
Since Hampton recently was in Ensigns election team, it was he was allowed a year no lobbying for his former employer or accept the entire Senate.
According to ethics experts in the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton were chummy before the Affaire against the so-called ban on the Drehtür-Lobbykratie.
According to the published evidence "is apparently a consultation and the violation of the Drehtür-Statuten" Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who has specialised in the defence of clients who are in the sights of the government.
While the Justice Ministry official refused, the reasons for the decision to announce in the Ensign-Fall, said Mr. Brand and other Ethikanwälten, the department notes very cautious in the Aufnehmen political charges after a variety of defeats were followed with great interest by the media, including the decision in the last year, the indictment against former Senator Ted Stevens because of misconduct on the part of the public prosecutor decided to drop.
Prosecutors "are obvious specter confinement," said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organisation whose objective is the fight against corruption in parliament and government circles of the United States), a group of lawyers, the various charges against Mr. Ensign has brought before the courts.
"This basically means that high-level officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, principal defenders of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview, on Monday, he received a telephone call from a prosecutor and another at the next day, in which he was told that no complaints against his client, the ministry will impose.
Mr. Ensigns defenders had cooperated with the prosecutors in order to convince them that the senator, as his office in a statement on Wednesday again repeated, "acted in accordance with the law" did.
Mr. Coggins refused, the legal arguments that he had raised about the prosecutors to explain in more detail.
"I am not well in the negotiating details between the Ministry of Justice and me to go with it, but so much is said:" we believe the right decision, " he said.
Last month the federal election commission decided that the investigation to stop by the group for a separate complaint, after which a payment of 96.000 Dollar by Mr. Ensigns parents have violated federal election law in the Hamptons.
The electoral commission said it was not enough evidence that the money is anything but was a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, the long time the senator supported, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign Lobbyisten-Arbeit.
An Email from December 2008 proves that, after the company Mr. Hampton has been promoted as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, a conversation with Mr. Hampton had, in which he announced that he was at the Interior Ministry for a cause "anklopfe."
Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air agreed to lunch and asked the transport ministers to agree on a meeting in the name of the airline, after that Mr. Hampton had been recruited to lobbying.
As the last year for the first time information came to the public on this affair," Mr. Ensign for his constituents and gave his position in the Senate, where he had been in the ranking of Republicans in fourth place.
After he no longer noticed many months ago, told Mr. Ensign two weeks ago of reporters that he would like to see a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign no longer be the target of police investigations, said his press spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, the senator hope that the Ethics Committee very quickly follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and closing its investigation.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to his hard work to continue in the service of the people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire Twitter draws attention
A half-dozen of them tippten in the riots in the courtroom.
The last-minute verschickten them on Twitter their reports on gruesome testimonies.
In the end, the defense, there were more than 140.000 Twitter-Meldungen on trial for rape and beds gekettete children in a house, the flare-up.
On Thursday the closely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was indicted, three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, killed an official end to find if the judgment on the death sentence, the jury pronounced falls.
But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already enquires in court, explain the reasons for an appeal and employing the courts for years.
One of the provozierend most reasons is that it through the intensive reporting on the process, including through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporter - a "circus atmosphere" and a widespread immediately penetration aufrührerischer details came, so that the jury in an improper manner had been influenced by the public outrage.
This objection could lead the Appelationsgerichte to deal with the question whether the new technologies will need new rules in the courtroom.
"As I have seen during this process, I believe that it is really a danger, if the arrival of the new technologies, the right of every individual in the courtroom influenced to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes main defenders.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue from the Supreme Chamber Court, rejected the requests last week by ruling succinct back when he said that the New Media "carefully controlled" would, and that there is no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But it was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades Gerichtseinsprüche have noted that the reporting on notorious cases doubt on the fairness of a trial.
In his historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States the ruling against Dr Sam Sheppard, a osteopaths from Cleveland, which is supposed to have killed his wife, lifted and said in his ruling that because the new media a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" would have been.
Some people believes that the TV show and the movie "on the run" based on this crime.
Some lawyers say, Gerichtseinsprüche, which Mr. Hayes conviction be seen half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules are necessary for the channels from the courtroom at the time of the case, Dr Sheppard were unimaginable to regulate.
"There is a good reason, about the impact of new media in processes, which will be followed by a broad public to be concerned," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut, but his report, they arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said, some Appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction immediately communications from the courtroom, it turned out, could make the processes of fair play.
The Twitter affair is just one of many who set out by Mr. Hayes lawyers to discuss for years and thus delay a condemnation.
For example, the defenders also say that Mr. Hayes could be already have been vorverurteilt as a judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential Jurors by giving them showed gruesome Tatortfotos during the juror selection.
Some have said the Jurors photographs of the victims, Jennifer hawke petit 48 years, and their Tüchter, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, they would have met with disgust.
The defenders say that they were also questioning the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judges had mistakenly exchanged a jury, which has been a critic of the prosecutor, and that he had exerted undue pressure on the ruling, as he had taken the unusual decision to ask the jury free over the weekend.
The Jurors were not isolated.
But their arguments about the impact of the detailed reporting about the process prefers perhaps the greatest interest.
In a judgment anfechtung have submitted it last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and during the election campaign for the office of the governor and was discussed by the candidates for the US Senate.
They argued that the New Media continually had rekindled the flames of the emotions on the case.
"Such a daily crush of media piepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," wrote the lawyers, "it has been previously in New Haven and perhaps even not seen nationwide."
Your emphasis on reporting by Twitter is controversial.
Some journalists have said in interviews that the assertion that these direct messages are rabble-rousing but as reports, which will be reimbursed at a slower rate, a technikfeindlicher look is the verarme reporting on future processes.
But some lawyers said, Appelationsgerichte would often faced with the argument, social and technological changes requires the Adaptation through the courts.
Mr. Hayers lawyers reinforce this assertion.
In her appeal, she referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which the condemnation of Dr Sheppard was lifted because the reporting and made it clear that the New Media new rules require.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Civility can connect the division?
After a campaign of dirty words and negativity this week erupted little civility in Washington.
It is the sign of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion, before quickly returning to fight the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and Congressional leaders brought no breakthrough on the big issues during the so-called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a government session, in which no decisions will be taken more had to employ.
After all, what we hear, it was not a polite debate between two different parties to govern even a consideration of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partisan Punktesammelns.
The public meeting of the deficit commission the president on Wednesday was equally civilized, despite the political differences that still exist between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months arise leaves a mutual respect, the ideological gulf separating the members still veiled.
This is hardly enough to claim that it is a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a testing phase, in which a voice from the other signs of cooperation and compromise, while even tried the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters weigh after a renewed partisan warfare.
This was why the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants limited to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep, and that a rapid change in the atmosphere which prevailed in the past two years, could be expected.
Whether it involves taxes, donations, health or Anwartschaften, the two sides are miles apart.
Lastly, the November election Washington, at least for a short time bribed.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, now for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center" works.
"It is inevitable after elections.
Elections appear partisan passions die again.
And that is good."
In some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the "lame duck session" Republicans and Democrats hardly any other choice than to find a solution. "
Bush's tax cuts end up at the end of the year, and no one advocates.
Both sides want to find a way to some or even all receive, whether temporarily or permanently.
It is also necessary to expect a compromise on the increased unemployment money, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that it believes the preferred tax cuts for the rich, while unemployed workers refuse a support.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House has increased the optimism that these issues during the "lame duck session" to reach an agreement and at the same time the new Start treaty can be ratified.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent issues of the lame duck session " not compelling must lead to a lasting cooperation between the parties, if the new 112. Congress will convene in January.
Instead, he says, is a phase of failure for huge likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that need to be done, done, will turn these short-term psychology in confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also sceptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - the politeness leads to real cooperation.
"I see many things from now on until 2012 happens, as Vorkampf, or shadow boxing, for the main event from 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have a lot with the presentation of the new Republican majority to do in the White House and with the Teeparty-Wählern were conducive to their education.
As the Republican leaders also expressed concern may be that they vie to high, they know that they must try to reduce their promises, the expenditure of the government and the health care reform to set aside to adhere to.
This party lines are already in the first reactions on the recommendations of the deficit commission clearly what a tax reform and the state of some taxes and raising the retirement age and include the planting of government spending.
The stellvertretends chairman Alan Simpson and Bowles Erskine an inherited the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, so pressed to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need within the Commission 14 of the 18 votes in order to make its plan for the official recommendation, and they are fighting very well to come only in the proximity of this figure.
The biggest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the body, as in financial matters, at least today, little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston says two stages in the battle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress ahead.
The first fight next year will take place in the form of Parteizusammenstößen, when the Republicans Obama on the state budget, taxes and challenging the health care system, then followed by a period of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is shown that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still hopes that the two parties to work together.
If confrontation in a blind alley, as happened in 1995, then we must respect both parties carefully on the public reaction.
Whoever is doomed to lose, will change the course and must seek compromise.
This may in fact be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are now greater than in the middle of the 1990s, and they seem to have a greater ideological divide between Obama and the Kongress-Republikanern to be at the same time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time see the activists of both parties in 2010 as a mere prelude to a consequence far broader election in 2012.
So it may be the courtesy display this week will be welcomed by many Americans.
But on both sides, it will require much more effort to find a common denominator in the issues that the two still separated.
Durchgesickertes US-Dokument Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city lies in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and they are a part of the bribes and protection money that they einsammelt on the Kremlin. This reported in February, the US Embassy in Russia in a memo.
Both police and the state security service blackmail high protection money, so that they can keep their expensive living in Moscow, it says.
They collect money not only from legitimate business, but also by organized criminal gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as a "vertical authority" - takes its part of the money that the head to the top.
The memo under the name of the Ambassador John Beyrle was sent to Washington, was on Tuesday by Wikileaks published on its website.
The memo was based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov still Moscow's mayor was, and it accused him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence that had been cleaned up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, a well-known construction company owns over years makes rejected again and again, and he won numerous libel actions against such accusations.
He told a Russian TV channel in September, when he was asked after a documentation, which suggests that he was corrupt: "It is crazy, it is dirty, it is dirty."
An unbelievably large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. The surveys show.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the report of the ambassador, individual persons, and it is heard that this is happening through a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct link with the government in Moscow with the crime has meant that some of them as" disrupted "and come to the conclusion that the government is acting as a Kleptokrat rather than a government," the memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a" kryshna " (a term from the world of criminals and the mafia, which literally" roof " or protection means) on the police, the State Security (FSB), the service supervisor (MVD) and extends to the office of the prosecutor, as well as by the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a dreilagige structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is paramount."
"FSB MVD and the militia stand on the second stage."
"Finally follow the perfectly ordinary criminals and criminal inspectors at the bottom."
"This is an incompetent system, where criminal groups fill a gap in some areas, because the city offers no help."
The report says further that the FSB money received by the biggest companies and the police small businessmen have been arrested.
A source says, "said that Moscow shopkeepers to understand that it is best to protect the MVD and FSB to get (and not by the organized crime), because they are not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, the protection by criminal gangs no longer asked as before."
The memo noted that while the collection of the money is fully protected even very modest no; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
The do not pay, find their business very quickly closed - on the basis of one or other pretext.
Medvedev has talked several times to combat corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men with suitcases, which were presumably full with money, go in the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption must Medvedev rely on the bureaucrats," said named Georgy, who Satarov, director of by a Moscow experts recently in an interview.
"But it is part of this tape."
"It is not a part of the political class, because a political class no longer exists in Russia."
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, as he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, as estimated by the corruption is costing Russia, more than 300 Dollar billion per year.
The country ranks below 154, a recent study on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organisation Transparence International (countries of "least corrupt" to "most corrupt" listed).
The revelation of the Memos of the American Embassy, which after Moscow time late in the evening, happened will certainly disapproved trigger within the Russian government, though, because Luzhkov can be blamed for the mistakes of Moscow, the Kremlin can also be an opportunity to claim that the problems.
In an interview with Larry King on CNN stated Putin that the WikiLeaks-Dokumente might be a forgery and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats him Batman and Medvedev Robin mentioned.
"The truth is that it involves our interaction, which is an important factor is the internal policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we had not expected that this would happen with such arrogance with such a pressure and so unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confrontation with the past
In a weak brake betoniert class area with dirty and abblätternd walls, reminds the director of the Anlong Veng High School in the man it has built in the subsequent Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he cared about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years.
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butchers" remains the commander in this remote former Khmer Rouge hochburg popular in the north-west of Cambodia, where he hospitals and bridges built, the infrastructure has developed and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge towards the government, are longtime supporters challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed the victims the public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government circulated a school book for the first time children of former soldiers told the story of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July condemned a Community Tribunal of the United Nations and Cambodia for the first time a former member of the Khmer Rouge, as the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, was sentenced to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, the fear among the Khmer Rouge grew Alnlong veterans Vengs, complicating their efforts at reconciliation and reintegration into the society of Cambodia.
"There is still disagreement and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that researches the regime.
"It was the life under the Khmer Rouge glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It is dividing even families."
During the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or they died from disease, overwork or starvation.
When the Vietnamese invaded and 1979 overthrew the Pol Pot-Ied government, fled the remnants of the regime and its military to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
Here it until December 1998, when the last movement surrender unrest.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary guerrilla war from its base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok withdrew the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the middle of the 1990s, when a peace agreement promoted by the United Nations in 1993 led to the first democratic elections in the country, began large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters, with the government, resulting in the Kapitulationen of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998 led.
Pol Pot died in 1998, a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not given, was in 1999 by government forces arrested Mountains in the Dangrek.
He died in 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh, where he was awaiting his trial.
When their benefactors they no longer protected, fled most former Khmer Rouge fighters in the grinding poverty of the rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even if a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts, because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers.
"These people have benefited only very little of the capitulation," said Sok Leang from the Centre for justice and reconciliation throughout Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng, public forums
"They are enshrined in the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They are growing up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years, 1974, joined the Rhmer Rouge as a teenager, had fought in the jungle at Anlang Veng before he 1998 Lower left a life to lead as poor rice farmers.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok has everyone something to eat."
"But now, life is difficult, because we have to care for ourselves."
The current Khmer Rouge tribunal has also fomenting here concerns.
At the beginning of next year, the court will try, Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge ministers to put before the courts.
The mandate of the court, the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities to condemn, but it has not said whether it over these four cases will pursue further action.
This has contributed little to alleviate the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation on the Chaem, 64 years concentrated during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970's, district chief in the province of Manteay Meanchey have been.
In 2007, it was representative of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia told they have the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damms led a project in which thousands of forced labourers probably died.
At a hot evening came in the Chaem of the work in the fields with their wooden house on a dirty street outside of Anlong Veng back.
When the sun long shadow on the dried grass threw in the Chaem to discuss their past with the Khmer Rouge.
If the court vorladen them, so they would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia is living in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no prosecutions more is war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, in 1878 fled from the Khmer Rouge, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be uncertain, would accuse the court more suspects, although experts and historians discuss.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to be able to go forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means to collect the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty, this broken parts together, so that we can understand how everything."
The centre has created the first school paper approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, 75 pages "history of Democratic Kampuchea."
It circulated the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history textbook for the High School of the Education Ministry, less than four pages contains about the Khmer Rouge.
How often in Cambodia know the young people in Anlong Veng little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps the student to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people will be condemned by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school paper, and the court gain after and for influence," he said.
Still owns the Khmer Rouge here a powerful attraction.
Mountains in the Dangrek likely leads a Strauchs is rampant and with plastic waste verdreckter route to a Rechteck of black soot covered with a rusty tin ceiling.
Pol Pot's body was here after his death in 1998 have been burned on a Reifenhaufen.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years, a phone verkäuferin the roadside, said she does not know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people are here to pray to him," she said.
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday and later in the day, they wanted to Pol Pot's final resting place to go where they will take a bush mature bananas - in the hope that it brings her luck.
Belarus agrees not continue to collect weapons-grade uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to global security of nuclear material, the government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that it no longer will collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal has been in a joint statement after a meeting of the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarussian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov announced in an additional article of the Sicherheitsgipfels.
The US government had been trying for years to persuade Belarus, not to collect more highly enriched uranium and appeared last spring reached a hurdle.
But officials of the US government told the Washington Post, that in the last two months, two secret agreements have been reached with Belarus, 187 pounds weapons-grade uranium to remove from a White Russian research centre.
This was the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material, according to an official staff, which remains anonymous because of the sensitivity of the issue, approximately 500 pounds.
The agreement seems one of the most important results of Obama's "nuclear security summit of 47 nations" to be in April ruled Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough at the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012 to secure.
"I was thrilled by the fact that they have a seat in the nuclear security summit (from 2012) want."
"This proves that it works for me," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership Global Security, a group for the promotion of nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement " a very significant, important step ' of Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009, within four years to secure all vulnerable nuclear material.
Since then, the US government helped six countries, its highly enriched uranium to disappear.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuklearem security summit, the Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up their uranium.
"How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamental weapons-grade, and less enriched uranium," said Lukashenko at the time.
"This is our raw material... we will not make it a dirty bombs and we will sell it to anyone."
"We use it solely for research purposes, that is all."
Belarus still approached a few months ago the United States than interest anzeigte meeting an agreement.
The first attempt to remove the uranium in Belarus in October, was particularly complicated, because the material was irradiated, perhaps, say officials.
It was loaded in a Spezialzug of more than 1.300 miles on a Russian factory for storage and disposal, say officials.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the officials by plane.
The US government will pay for these travails dollars 14 million, with a large part of the money in the Belarussian research goes with low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was very carefully coordinated and concerted confidence" to the agreement, which was signed by Clinton led, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Energy Department, which operates in the global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Nichtweiterzugebende Studies estimates that Belarus this year at least 88 pounds waffenfähhigen uranium, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus wants, according to the joint agreement dissolve his camp until 2012.
The relations between Belarus and the United States were strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harschen disregard for human rights.
But the statement on Wednesday suggested a possible rapprochement.
"According to the progress of this global security issues welcome liable to cancel out the United States of America and Belarus know that an increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she says.
No objections from the Spanish government against CIA
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaida-Gefangenen on Spanish territory after Guantanamo, as from a telegram from the ambassador, S.A. emerges in Madrid.
This reflects the enhüllten of Wikileaks and the daily newspaper El País " (cable) passed on documents, but it adds that the former deputy leader María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, the Spanish Government should be informed," to prove that foreign planes flying over Spain, will be monitored properly. "
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, where the aid to human rights practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, has been indicted, discussed the former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The deputy leader admitted that the report of the Council, "Zapatero met on the sidelines" and reiterated that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain had no objections to the Geheimdienstflüge on Spanish territory."
"You simply want to be informed," not "unprepared to be surprised," reported Aguirre cable.
Even the former foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, the ambassador pointed out that the Spanish government "wants to give this matter does not pay great attention, even though the government had little influence, because they would be in the hands of the judges."
The prosecutor Vicente Gonzalez was in turn in January 2007 to understand the message that he is the judicial initiative, the declassification of documents from the Spanish intelligence headquarters (CNI) and the defense minister to request about the CIA would not block.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information," said the ambassador after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, it was not the United States on the "apparent coordination between the Spanish state prosecutor and the German prosecutors" more than the CNI and the Defense Department about the deklassifizierte information.
"This coordination between independent Untersuchern our efforts will complicate to discreet handling between governments," laments Aguirre.
At a lunch in March 2007, in which the ambassador of the United States and the Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba participated, describes the latter that "although the Spanish judges are considered incredibly strong on their independence and do what they deem appropriate," he indicated his staff was "blown to avoid rhetorical comments to let the tension wane."
The ambassador also expressed its concern about the approach of the PP in this matter.
"Despite their generally proamerikanischen attitude our experience shows that the PP will not doubt from an indication that the government of the United States Zapatero's acts as a possible human rights violations could be interpreted, tolerated or have deliberately ignored capital, even if these revelations will have a negative impact on the government of the United States could," he stresses.

Popular Party won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November could the PP in the cities Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona play a crucial role
After the major voices and fellow gains in the last regional elections executes the PP their sights already on the parliamentary elections, early or not; your expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes, the party achieved in these elections is usually twice as high as in the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan Popular Party received 610.473 votes in the parliamentary elections of 2008, while this paragraph in the regional elections in 2006 only 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384.091 votes.
If this rising trend - a result of the diversion of the share of PSC and the pegging of the electorate of the PP, should continue, analysts predict the PP in the parliamentary elections, the PPC could rise by 8 to 12 Congressmen who are, while also CiU four (it now has 10) win and the PSC at least 9 Members (25) would lose.
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party would lose a Member of the ERC - currently has three, while ICV keep their members or a win.
If the electoral calendar will be maintained, however, the next date with the local elections in May 2011. Even then can the People's Party (PP) to be the voice of the scales to put an end to the socialist hegemony, and in four Provinzhauptstädten and with their majority in the council, one of the municipalities with the largest budget: 661 million for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists or reach a majority on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV) can fall back on, will lose.
After the Republican debacle, it is not absurd that this party their representation in the council, in which they reach 5% of the votes should lose.
The PP, however, recorded an increase in their share in the four Provinzhauptstädten and could lead to the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that the key role to play in Tarragonas turnaround to be able to where it had before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, along with the PP governed.
En Lérida lies the PP just 500 votes behind the PSC, Àngel Ros, the mayor maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
Even in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus gained a significant increase of the People's Party.
The PP is currently represented in 34 municipalities of Catalonia and seeks the creation of lists in so many places as possible.
The Catalan cell was Al Qaeda thousands of passports
Besides the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three other in Thailand
The seven of the policemen of the police intelligence department detainees Pakistanis and Nigerians constituted the Thailand managed dschihadistische cell, the different Al Qaeda groups, including the Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam " (LTTE) and" Laschkar e-Taiba " (let) - the latter was the writer of the attacks in Mumbai, the 2008 106 deaths - with passports.
The Spanish interior minister attributes great importance to this investigation, which so far is that he assured, with the "operation Kampai" is the counterfeiting apparatus Al Qaidas world "weakened" and "thus their ability to act."
The researchers estimate that in the two years in which the cell has been active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where these fake and then to the groups, from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda composed, sent, so that their "fighters" with the borders of European and other Western countries have been able to cross.
The uncovered cell is not the only one of the jihadist network, which has been active in Europe, which is why except the Thai investigative bodies other European police units involved in the investigation. It is not to say that on the territory of the EU in the next few days to similar attacks such as that was carried out in Barcelona on Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun Atiqur Rehman Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerians Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) was in Thailand conducted a further, in which the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar of flounder and Zeeshan Ehsan of flounder, as well as the Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung Thai countries were arrested.
They were from Bangkok in Spain and other European countries established cell led.
The Catalan network - a part of it was destroyed in 2009 - stole especially tourists passports, according to the specifications of the so-called ' international Islamic front."
This means that the documents in the name of men aged 25 to 45 years to be issued, and even several years had to be valid; they were not permitted to Visastempel exhibit.
In investigating circles stresses that until now no links between the Catalonia detainees and the attack in Mumbai could be proven, although the author of this attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba" was a recipient groups in Spain stolen and then falsified passports in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the assassination of Catalonia from several thousand dollars via a geldtransfer company had been sent in the purchase of Prepaid-Karten for mobile phones "invested" were later by the members of the "Kommandos," which caused the lives of 106 people an end, have been used.
The police has seized an extensive documentation.
PP Ma's calls for postponement of the tax agreement
Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, the chairman of the PPC, yesterday the opportunity Artur Ma's personal their conditions to support his new post as prime minister to submit the Generalitat. These do not differ from the already during the election campaign and the primacy of the economic recovery and the regionalist Unabhängigkeitsabenteuern as a financial compensation agreement, the leaders will propose at the height of his mandate, summarise.
The leader of the Catalan Popular Party opposing Mas with the security of Artur awarded her the 18 MEPs, which they won on Sunday - a paragraph, which is more than enough to feel indispensable because the candidate of the Civic regionalistischen CiU party is dependent on that at least one of the opposition parties in the vote contains the voice in his new post.
The future alliances regionalists during the next parliamentary elections in Congress intend to depend on a possible entente with the PP. The talks, Mas is currently conducting with the other party leaders, however, revolve around Catalonia.
As far as the leader of the PPC, this calls for the support of the new post "all discourses, which affect the sovereignty and independence for Catalonia" and an agreement on the financial compensation between the state and the autonomous region, like in the Basque Country - and the leader of CiU even wants to submit to a referendum, to be employed at the back.
Both political leaders is common, that they exaggerated political apparatus of the regional administration leaner and want to abolish death duties and gift tax.
With the details of the negotiations on the new post of Ma's deal on the part of the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already spoken with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - which announced a tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV hit) today, he will be with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana) meet.
The elderly nursing home confirmed that the deaths were not due to "lack of action"
The owners of the old people's home in Olot does not preclude their carers on 11 elderly people killed
Officials of the elderly nursing home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference in which she highlighted what damage the criminal acts Joan Vila Dilmés - the carers during his work at least 11 old people, for which he was responsible, was killed, had caused the institution.
The head of the elderly care home, Joan Sala, came with his lawyer, Joan Cañada, court and announced, "La Caritat would like to thank the people responsible (for the deaths) accuse," but "the right and our liability oblige us to make the process and the civil liability" to be adopted.
The institution must not only accept a social prestige lost, because they are the criminal activities of the carers had not discovered in time, but now also pay a high compensation sum of the legal representatives of the families of the victims will be calculated.
Joan Vila Dilmé acknowledged that the first crime originates in August 2009 and that he had murdered since then further.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight Körpern former patients of the elderly nursing home - because he suspected that no doctor examined the dead personally, but the formalities for age and disease have been handled by telephone.
The head of La Caritat prominent writers have expressed this point flatly and declared that "lack of action in no time the reason might have been for the incidents."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that it "in the legal dispute is no evidence for negligent acts were a different person than the defendant."
The already as "Angel" Getaufte confessed the day before 11 killings and said the first crimes committed on 29 August 2009 and one and a half months later to have killed the second old lady.
In this case he killed with an overdose of insulin, in contrast to the first crime, in which he is a mixture of various sedatives had.
The head of La Caritat, said the staff access to the drugs is difficult to control.
The insulin injections and the sedative middle cocktail suspended the carers in six of the nine crimes a to liberate the patients with the death of their suffering.
But the results of laboratory tests will point out whether Vila is lying and for its first victims actually chose a less cruel death, or whether he ausbrannte them from the inside by offering bleich lauge forecast was, as it had done, according to confession in three women he murdered between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat listens to the statements of the carers no faith, not even as regards the number of confessed murders, which could be more perfectly. This attitude is justified that Vila very different statements made in court and that it make no sense, his approach after eight successful murders suddenly change.
They say they were for this reason and investigating the scope of these incidents of justice available.
The European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors reacted yesterday sharp on the threat of ECB President Trichet warned that "the markets should not underestimate our capacity."
The risk premia have risen dramatically in the Euro-Peripheriländer and the shares of European banks by more than 5%.
However, we should have the possibility that the ECB can deceive themselves and the euro has appreciated hardly points, which led to concern, not underestimate.
The events of yesterday are typical for an illiquid market in the deal, in which he collapses recovers, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investors will still not long lose his fear.
Today, the European Central Bank demanded a month on us to reverse our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen, according to which the ECB tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably still many times in the future, must make a U-turn.
The Bundesbank called for the lifting of the plan for the purchase of government debt, because they are ineffective, and the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures - only a week's indefinite access, it should be maintained.
After the Ireland crisis, we expect that the current liquidity measures "at least until March" extended and the quarterly tenders with unlimited access on quarterly of the year in order to guarantee the liquidity will be maintained until at least June.
We also expect that the programme for the purchase of bonds continued and will spend a reinforcing signal.
If the managed expectations are not met, the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday back and if halstarrig insistence that we withdraw our liquidity measures, can only God help us!
As with the EZB-Sitzung in May, in which the bank confirmed the purchase of government debt securities not to take into account and then collapsed, the markets could repeat this history tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and tenacious.
In May, it showed the teeth and on Wednesday, she said to have bought a lot, by which they provoked a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday was the auction of one-year government permits in Portugal pretty weak.
The state asset management were only 500 million at 5,28%, compared with 750 million 4,81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, fell 30 basis points interest rates in Portugal in the whole curve and thus reflected a perceptual change the markets after the words Trichet's reflect that.
In Ireland were the figures of the debt hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland published.
The amount is approximately 10.000 million short-term and possible further 15.000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after failing to recognize the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures are acceptable in the context of the rescue plan and help to reduce the uncertainty.
However, the government Tuesday must receive parliamentary approval for his new budget, but the fact that they still do not have sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has its discourse in relation to the summit of Heads of State and the government of moderate shaped on 14 December where it needed political unity in order to show that we shared the same score to play.
The problem is that Germany Wagner wants to play and the other countries which Beethoven's ninth symphony.
The Spanish government minister hovered above yesterday's action plan should be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, reduction of the deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures in the ears of investors such as Vivaldis sound four seasons.
The dual effect Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market has increased by 4,5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February was the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank quickly and convincingly, and we benefit from the surprise result.
Today there is an authoritative auction of a three-year bond will reap the benefits from the trichet effect; that is why we put on a strong demand, which remove all doubt about our debt-restructuring capacity.
For Spain would be the application of an aid plan a self-sacrifice.
We get liquidity, which we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion available, three times as much as in March. the interest rates are very expensive and would get access to the markets closed.
Nevertheless, our strategy should comply with the motto "Caesar's wife:" now counts not only his, but also of appearances. "
Only courage that we create!

Red Bull triumphs with a secret weapon by Siemens
The car will be improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull 2004 encroached into the world of F1 is their history in the elite universe shaped the speed of surprises and successes.
The newcomer at the beginning, no one paid attention and, despite its steep ratings rising record set during the last season in the final sprint last November, all on the victory of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso.
Without the capabilities of the German pilot and Weltmeisters Sebastian Vettel or performance is to belittle the engine from Renault want is the "secret weapon," the multinational Siemens Red Bull in the hands, and thus created a winning team, has become to the legend.
In reality is a powerful software to simulate processes, which the German company in 2007 for purposes that do not have to do with motor racing brought on the market.
This describe as a PLM computer program was for the development of Monday chains in factories around the world, Energiewerken and precise tools.
Intention is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before this will actually be built so as to avoid mistakes and unnecessary costs.
PLM, the development of the cameras by Canon, the aircraft from Sukhoi and the most famous commercial vehicles from Nissan easier.
Winning Russwurm, head of the industrial unit of Siemens, said that with the use of this software in the F1 - factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time," the changes and improvements on the race and are found in the tests, design and can carry out.
Russwurm notes that in 1992 in the Rennstalls average ten technicians working in a season to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements here.
In Red Bull's team now employs 180 highly qualified young people; they lead with powerful EDV-Anlages analyses and all possible changes to the cars through.
The Siemens manager said that the PLM-Software is in the situation, all components of the Red Bull cars to analyze and improve, with the exception of the engine, which exclusively Renault declared responsible.
The materials, the fuel for dynamics and safety elements to be changed.
The changes can thanks to advanced production facilities and Hightech-Autoklaven within less than 24 hours of the virtual reality of the Simulator will be transferred to the reality.
The only border, which is set to this crazy technically perfect, 40 million dollars, a Formula 1 - team must spend on his race in a season.
Red Bull has its high-tech factory for the development and production of its cars in a 50 kilometers away from the ground built by London.
There are two buildings where visits - especially journalists - are severely limited.
Everything is happening is Top Secret.
The workforce includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's real Formula 1 - hero is zweifelslos the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the vast technological resources, the Energy drink manufacturers in the service of his participation on the race tracks, there are other players whose support invaluable and whose fame is nil.
The Technologichef of the plant, Steve Nevey, stresses that you could still say five years ago that the progress in the field of R & D for cars contributed to the victory with 50 per cent and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values changed. The technology makes 85% of success, while the contribution of pilots is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computers, because they "are not voraussagbare gladiators."

The North American business group is discussing this and accepts the exclusive loading equipment (with interactive products) in Europe will look the same all shops.

Saba dell wants to its rival in three years a million customers 'klauen '
The caretaker board member of Banco saba dell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers; he believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but a new liquidity crisis initially rejects and predicts the end of the Schuldenkriegs.
Nevertheless, he sees a collapse of the banks with interest margins ahead to offset increases the fees and prices for loans to try.
Saba dell expected in three years a million retail customers - a remaining specialist.
Saba dell has found the way to exploit the next three years, and so in a very difficult economic environment to survive.
In 2011, the bank will introduce a new three-year flagship plan.
The goal is not only to survive without public aid to claim from the FROB, but also the market share for a million retail customers - 700.000 if the customers, the bank will lose - to increase. This is the great challenge facing this bank, because until now it has its business customers more attention than their private customer.
This year it has 250.000 private customers and 50.000 companies extract.
Your market share in retail is at 3.5 percent, while the business customers constitute more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is the increase of productivity, i.e. Austerität cost reductions. The challenges faced by the bank so that, they will present along with annual Summary.
Only a few banks dare in these difficult times set targets and to publish as a result of the financial crisis worldwide all plans of the banks are disrupted.
Saba dell this year its guiding plan established four years ago Optima conclude. This was designed initially for three years, but as a result of the market situation, it was extended for a business year.
The customers will leave the savings banks are the main objective of the bank.
At a breakfast organised by the APIE Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with great scope."
The manager expects Spain would only "slow" out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" in two or three years "work to create" - essential for the survival of the banks.
Even if he assumes that the war for liabilities - the interest margins punished - will wane, raise risk premia, banks and thrifts must pay for their emissions to the maintenance of liquidity, as compensation for declining profit margins already shifted to the price for loans.
"The issues liquidity and funding are structural in nature and they will exert pressure on the loans."
"We have not marginalised Hahn, but the Zinsdifferenziale are very high," Guardiola admitted.
Banesto was on Thursday ordering its subsidiary network to restrict the allocation of long-term loans and to increase the Zinsdifferenziale (cf. Cinco Díaz report on 22 and 27 November).
The manager also acknowledged a currently pursued the banks of the Stategie, "to increase the fees," but "within a framework characterised by competition."
Saba dells flagship plan is based on an organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate business.
It is not for nothing that he assured that in Spain "larger companies are necessary."
"In the coming year will change everything," he assured.
He stressed that the need for capital is currently "huge increases" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions are slipping into red figures.
He is of the opinion that the FROB could replace with Kaptitalaufstockungen the money market.
After he assured that saba dell also could survive a temporary closure of the markets, he refuted the argument of some bankers, who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing can be put into circulation, but in contrast to the events in June, could be short-term funding beyond Repogeschäfte reach and so that the crisis.
CECA includes a second merger wave of savings banks
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday dismissed the possibility that it could come to a merger wave of savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry will be restructured.
When the concentration process began the Spanish savings banks, insisted several savings banks in the first phase not to participate. They won the second round.
However assured the Director-General of the Spanish Savings and Loan Association (CECA), Jose Antonio Olavarrieta, this second round would not take place.
"I believe that the biggest part of the merger is completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the group Banca Cívica could not be regarded as the second round, it was rather adjustments."
"The biggest part is finished; it may be that we instead of siebzehen 13 or 14, but all important processes are already completed. You were of Banco de España has supported all transactions heavily controlled."
In one of the association of business leaders and managers Aragoniens (ADEA) organized breakfast led Olavarrieta from the concentration process "was completed as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely expiry in former times, not now, in the context of business plans has been established with Banco de España," he stressed.
"The transition from 45 thrifts with average 28.000 million asset was on 17 with ever 75.500 million is a historic incomparable process; the number has been reduced by 62% of financial institutions, and they are now very much larger, thereby fulfilling the Basel agreements we have," he stressed.
Olavarrieta said, "there are a number of unabgebrachter opinions about the slowness of the process, the Unseriösität and absurdity" revealed because "Banco de España exhorted us on schedule to be completed before the end of the year."
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday that Spain is one of the rigorous most financial systems in Europe and "perhaps" the whole world was and added that those who anzweifeltenn this " priorities without deeper knowledge.
The manager said that we are in the current economic upturn "no worries" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks have a "very significant" concentration process "as quickly as possible" will be completed.
He also recalled that the Spanish bank stress tests, which the ECB conducted in July, were very good.
Zapatero and the red line in Germany
Berlin has opted for the of, keeping the euro, but at the same time conditions set for the entire European Union.
The tension on the markets have sparked a dual response of the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero new adaptation measures presented, ranging from tax rebates for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary employment companies or the lifting of the 426 million support for the unemployed, not unemployment benefits, referring to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the state lottery.
On the other hand supports the Deputy Head, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former government Minister Felipe González criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible, evokes have to the current crisis.
How are these events to understand?
It is anticipated that Merkel's position no errors of their publicity.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
It takes Germany a fundamental new perspective on the shape of our future, with the maintenance of the ancient traditions of a large part of its partners.
Given the resistance in Europe begins in Germany on three possible ways to spekuliern from the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south should leave the euro area.
The second: the reintroduction of the German mark - although that is currently more sounds like science fiction - supported by a majority of the public opinion, around 50% of the population.
The third point: a transformation of the euro, according to German proposals. This means: more macro-economic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of countries which overstep the specifications; möglicher as the default of certain countries, as well as the extension of the costs of potential adjustment measures on the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been looming for some time; that is why there is now no excuses.
First of all, 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission incentives for deficits and the German government is a constitutional reform drew from the sleeves in order to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of the divergence between what Germany saw fit (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second signal suspended the Central European country, as Merkel the decision on the rescue of Greece by delaying painful.
It was then that the strong criticism; but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published opinion were totally against a rescue of Greece.
Merkel is finally in the last Oktobertags again with a clear position; it calls for a reform of the agreements between the European Union in order to facilitate the rescue of a country and at the same time to commit the private lender to bear a part of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European because they Ireland crisis and propelled everything the following.
But her proposal, albeit slightly sweetened, has been adopted; in the next few months, we will be in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures from 2013 should participate.
Germany has drawn a red line, which is not to exceed it intends.
It says all that - even if now unpopular measures must be taken - from this date the old functioning of the euro will no longer exist.
2013 will be the birth year of a new monetary area in which the offender countries be punished harshly, can be forced to declare itself insolvent and in this case the private sector must take a share of the cost.
Germany shows us that we must take a tough growth with high saving and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external balances.
The other alternative on debt and construction based with huge holes in the balance of payments, as it from Spain was cited in boom times, will simply not be tolerated.
The offer is clear.
And we would do wrong to not understand it.
It is not just about the public deficit to three percent by the year 2013 runterzufahren.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst, what we could do under these conditions is to cheat ourselves.
I hope that the current turmoil to move into more calm.
And that we have the opportunities that are available to us, until spring 2013 will use.
It seems that Zapatero has interpreted, and its dual announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) suggests that despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis to create order in your own home, is preparing its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not seem that it would change anything.
Among the options taken into account is that the euro area packed with little serious countries would have to leave, not be ruled out.
In this case, Germany could still tell us, it warned us.
Sport and regulatory tax evasion
Tricks like Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax of show inventiveness, but not the desire to circumvent a sanction.
The alleged by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) exclusion in the game of 23 November against the Ajax in the Champions League meant that has been shed a lot of ink about whether it is an unsporting act or not acted and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, lost two players for a few minutes of the game of the year (her team had already clearly won) time and played several Fouls, so that the referee them showed the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would cite his group, the two players the prescribed sanction against the Auxerre meet in the next league game and so without cards enter into the next room for phase.
Finally, the UEFA punished the disciplinary kommitee, José Mourinho, the coach of the club with two games and the participating players with different sums of money.
The provocation of a yellow card in this or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football.
It is so widespread that they form part of the ethos - the unwritten but followed rules in this sport -.
Part of the debate about the portrayed event is due to the fact that a team of the football club Real Madrid (the find and honor claims in its national anthem and on other occasions punished for similar incidents had his players) played the main role, and the drama by Mourinho an episode more on his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician has added.
In any case revolves around the debate about whether this is not explicitly prohibited behaviour by the statutes contradicts the principles of the sport, which is to say, whether these actions constitute a regulatory evasion. Indeed, this approach will abide by the statutes of the sport, but seem to circumvent its meaning.
In this matter should damage caused to the sporting spirit to be investigated.
The sporting spirit defended the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect which was not jeopardized by these acts, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the offender players an unwarranted benefit from the team, and this did not happen.
The paradox of the plot of the players of Real Madrid is that they do not correspond to what we normally understand under false game or regulatory evasion, because the circumvention of the rule was not secretly completed in order to avoid a sanction, but it should be as visible as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee.
The players waited and the sanction happily attended.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offender from the deliberate Fouls.
This should be stressed that the rival neither was put in a disadvantageous position still benefits were erheischt for the played game, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue to play with a few players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, then the club lacks these players.
The benefit is obvious that the players the next ground phase of the Champions League without cards, which could threaten their participation in a future game begin.
But it is a long-term, to a certain extent uncertain advantage, because the team could also leave at some point. Moreover received the players with this approach, a sanction and go in the second card cycle on where they are because card acquisition disappeared with a card less than in the first cycle.
In this way, it is not clear whether it is really an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices are directed not against the sporting spirit, which includes strategic decisions, in order to derive from the rules a maximum benefit.
In this case, the players did not want any sanction deal (that would be really a clear case of regulatory evasion), they wanted to elect more when they undergo this.
They met a strategic decision to duck without a penalty or to flee before her.
Although it is blurring the line between inventiveness and regulatory environment, I believe that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: because it involved two Selbstausschlüsse and because of the nature of the provoked regulatory transfer.
The damage inflicted on the principles of sport through these actions was less ethical rather than aesthetic nature.
Supply offensive to the customer fishing for Gruppen-Weihnachtsabendessen in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar leaves this year an avalanche of reservations fall on days 16 and 17 December.
The employees themselves paid celebrations are spreading. They do not want more than 20 to 30 million to spend.
As the Turrón and the Christmas Lottery in the runup to Christmas again block dinner, the hotel and leisure industry to bring oxygen. But as a result of the economic crisis, they solve a price offensive from the customer segment, which represents the large mass: almost all want to between 20 and 30 million to spend for a lunch or dinner, confirm the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations.
In order for the accounting is a bit more complicated, the calendar (New Year's Eve falls on a Friday) all orders fall within the week on 13 December, with the result of an avalanche of reservations for dinner in two Spitzentager (16 and 17) and almost no orders in the week before that.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped the group dinner for budgetary reasons.
In order to abandon this tradition to have to pay for many workers those from their own pockets.
Whatever is the economy, it asks for rock-bottom prices, the chairman of the Gaststättengremiums of Barcelona confirms Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the Apparel dares until now do not predict how the holidays will look into this month.
"The people consider tens times before they get."
"You would like to run out, but they respect heavily on prices," he stresses.
The business will be good to go, "the quality offer with a good service at good prices," he adds, and we are reminded that the customers save in crisis, why prices at 25 euros are most in demand.
In a survey in various central restaurants turns out that the evening of 17 December leads to the collapse of the providers.
The group Soteras says the questions for this Friday with the intention, less than 30 euros to spend would boom. The group has its Menüs with complete offered between 25 and 35 euro adapted to the economic cycle.
In any other leading group Andilana, which maintains 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the oddity of the calendar to early reservations, even from the beginning of November, conducted.
"We have squared the year-on-year prices with Menüs for every taste of 19.95 to 30 euros to maintain," he says.
In AN Grup, El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 local guides, you will not lose the optimism after blooming revenue again since the second quarter and well, albeit in a few days ago could receive viewed concentrated prospects for the Christmas season.
Sources of the corporate group stress that the 18th a more active day with friends groups, the Christmas vorfeiern.
Among the six Gruppenmenüs was a Christmas menü for 30 euros or more than Preishit added; one has the impression that the customers are ready, 10 percent more than in the previous year to spend and want in exchange for more details, such as Cava.
Even in some firms see green shoots grow into why the employees will be invited again. This gives the impression that the group eat again on the upswing.
The umbrella organisation Fecasarm (with mergers such as the Kneipen- restaurant and leisure association of Barcelona), trusted deputy chairman, Enric Gomà, to see the end of the tunnel and noticed that the reservations generally "lively," although customers "a maximum out propose."
However, the fun at the celebration was not decreased, regardless of who pays.
The Pakistani nuclear program aroused great concern in the US
Islamabad is nuclear weapons "faster than any other country ago."
Revelations of Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The website Wikileaks is revealing the content of the correspondence between the North American embassy in Pakistan and the US Treasury department confirms the enormous concern about the Pakistani nuclear program Washington.
In the margins of the informative and juice details, the documents on the content of the talks and the mindset of the accredited American diplomats in Islamabad, offer these reveal that the cooperation between the two countries in terms of nuclear safety is not strengthened, but on the contrary "diminishes" and that the unstable Asian country more nuclear weapons "to a faster Rhytmus than any other country produces."
In particular, the nature of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not met, but its individual components are stored in order to hinder their destruction in a possible attack - cause Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks counts the ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Petersen, in a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities on the area attacked by the Taliban, probably Verstreuung of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transportation of nuclear materials."
The large passenger numbers are implied in the nuclear arsenal and missile program, is no longer only by the United States, but also by Russia as a megalomaniac and reason to be cautious, considered.
"Pakistan must strictly observant staff to guard nuclear installations; as a result of the low educational and cultural levels have extremist organisations more opportunities people who participate in nuclear or ballistic missile programs, to reklutieren," said the expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
A new feature of the website Assanges by Julian reveals documentation is that the cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in terms of nuclear proliferation wanes and the increased pace, producing nuclear weapons in Pakistan.
In May of an office of the message that the communication with Pakistan as "frustrating" describes explains: "Often there is no transparency; we get no answers on assistance or they are rejected."
In another announcement confirmed Peter Lavoy, official of the state intelligence service for South Asia, that "despite the economic disaster Pakistan nuclear weapons as quickly as any other country produced."
The ambassador Petersen asks Washington during a visit of the prime Heeresleiters, General Ashfaq Kayani, the responsible "clarify" that "Pakistan's army its tacit excess support of terrorist groups to stop."
On the hunt for Wikileaks boss
Obama will appoint a senior person responsible for the antiterrorism campaign on the prevention of new revelations.
Interpol is a red warning to persecution and location of Assange.
Everything with WikiLeaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, connected, constitutes a complicated maze in which the facts only difficult to investigate.
Yesterday Interpol a "red warning" to "locate and persecution" of Assange.
However, it is not a traditional orders to arrest.
In addition, it is not new, it comes from the 20 November.
It has nothing to do with the recent revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States to do, but with the allegations of sexual abuse, which the Australians must face in Sweden.
It also assured the lawyer of the founder of WikiLeaks, Mark Stephens, "the police knew where and how they contact with Mr. Assange could absorb."
As early as 20 gave the international police agency located in Lyon (France) at the request of Sweden orders, but until yesterday after receipt of the power it has not been announced by the Swedish authorities.
That is how things stand. The 188 Interpol countries are instructed to identify Assange and, presumably, "to provisionally arrest him and hand them over."
Although Interpol for the arrest of a person hit by a red warning may not see many member countries according to the organisation of the red warning as a licence for a Arrestierung - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreements, as the case of Sweden and England, where Assange probably finds himself.
The action empörte Assanges lawyers, the gestures published a letter in which it about it that the 39 year-old founder of Wikileaks is prepared by video conference to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange sought the departure from Sweden and the prosecutor with the Pavlovich Beria shrouded Lavrentiy, security chief of Stalin, compared to the corresponding approval was given.
"This is like a hunting, not as a legal persecution," will be charged in the letter.
While the world it seeks, and his mother of Australia from the innocence of their son, Assange clings to an unknown location, but not silent.
On Monday he was the head of the magazine Time via Skype from an unspecified location in an interview. In the conversation, he requested the resignation of US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proved that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the United Nations and therefore against the United States to sign international agreements infringed, they should resign," he said.
His opinion was yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, condemned the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd."
"I am not sure why we value on the opinion of a guy with a website should," he told CNN.
Obama himself has a highly responsible for the antiterrorism campaign, Rusell Travers, charged with the prevention of new Dokumentenenthüllungen.
The attempt by the spokesman of the side that those responsible for Barack Obama, Assange to pay less attention, is contrary to the views, the conservative politicians and commentators proclaim in these days.
The Congressman Peter King, from January the chair of the House of Representatives in national security kommitee, has asked the State Department to investigate the possibility to put Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organisations, "in order to seize their money, and everyone who supported or contributes to follow."
Tom Flanagan, adviser to the Canadian President Stephen Harper, has gone even further, and he had to his statement, Assange must "be murdered" revoked.
"Obama should transform him into a target and a not manned aircraft or so what use."
Anyone who does not apologized, was Mike Huckabee, baptistischer minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Who else was in the government information leaked, he is the treason and everything that is not an execution is eiine mild punishment," he told the broadcaster Fox.
Puigcercós addiction with a nod to the Carod close the social peace in the ERC
The Republican leaders allowed the party a secret vote on his continuation in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the Vollversammlungsprinzips.
Joan Puigcercós a recipe seems to have found, for the umpteenth time of internal turmoil in the ranks after the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes from landmark unemployed ERC from the way to go.
The party chairman is aware that his resignation threat the close of the former party leader, Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira not enough; but he also knows that the influence of this sector is now so weakened as her mentor himself and he is not the same headaches in store for us, as other former currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra trying to win with a nod to the new critics what his position until the next municipal elections would secure.
Kündete for the start yesterday that more than 200 regional members of ERC about his stay in office could express secret.
With ballot papers, not with gehobener hands.
If the Carodisten wanted to miss the Präsidenen a fine, they could do this without needing to fear repression.
Indeed, would the head both the impression of divisions, as well as the avoid subjection to his person.
In several interviews, he confirmed he would deal with half the votes plus a not vindicated, and he added without giving any percentage levels, a result "in the Bulgarian style" would not be good.
The Carod close outlooks call from the President more than just the party to provide office. An inadequate gesture, since Puigcercós the supreme body of the congresses controlled.
But because they do not possess a sufficient majority to push for resignations, they will board a course plan from now until May agree.
To this end, they expect in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation that the leadership on 18 will submit to the Council to vote can participate.
It is your intention to guarantee for Puigcercós. In return to this promise, the congress in the autumn 2011, which already holds the leader for a fact.
The leader of the ERC is of the view that the "Polyphonie" a pity the stability and he aspires to for all time to bring the organisation in a position to wash their dirty linen behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article, the current Conseller Josep Huguet wrote in his blog, symptomatic.
In light of this, this is an ideologue Puigcercós, the owner of Innovació considered it for a fact that the party chairman "in exchange for various objectives" will be based.
He was five, and two of them in the foreground.
Firstly, the "restructuring" of the board, so that this represents at least 90 percent of party members, that means the inclusion of new faces from Carods environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet proposes ERC should the full assembly principle as a functioning scrapped.
In so doing, he verfechtet a reform of the statute, which should make it possible to hold conferences with elected delegates.
From the end of the Vollversammlungsmodells - an exception in the Spanish party system - is Puigcercós ' team, which has been in the last two congresses fought like mad.
Indeed, in the bebend assembly of 2008 the party leadership with the review of the Vollversammlungsprinzips at a congress, which should deal with the reform of the statutes, instructed.
This date is still, as infogle of the internal Aufruhe of the last few years tackling this matter was not advisable.
Now, without which the critical sectors are on the lookout time could be return to this matter and to conclude for ever.

Obama is campaigning on Twitter for the law to benefit undokumentierter students
"If you for the adoption of the dream Act - thousands, then ruf your senators and urge the adoption of this law" twitterte the President of the United States in the popular social network.
The President Barack Obama supported today the nationwide mobilization to support the dream Act - thousands to legalise undokumentierter students with a message on his personal blog in the social network Twitter.
"If you for the adoption of the dream Act - thousands, then ruf your senators and urge the adoption of this law," twitterte Obama.
His short statement contains a cyber left to a more comprehensive document, which calls on the public to contact unterzüglich with their senators, because the vote of the law imminent.
"With your vote, in which we wait is the time to listen to you," he stresses.
The news was disseminated after the 42 Republican senators androhten to block all voice for every law except the extension of the tax rebate from the times of Bush and the financing of the government would be extended.
Such a blockade at one of the 42 Republican senators signed letter was announced, could affect the vote of the dream Act - thousands and other projects, such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against nuclear proliferation.
Over the blockade of the Republicans of the law dream Act and other projects surveyed, said the presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs, he trust that, once the tax issue is resolved, could be set a timetable for other projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax issue must be completed before the end of the year..."
"I believe that we can make an agreement at any time, and then we can plan the expiry of the rest," he said.
The chairman of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, kündete on Tuesday, "he would vote to end debate" request, so that the dream Act - law with which the initiative to legalise undokumentierter students could be voted on in the Senate from next Thursday, although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the dream Act - thousands or the law of the American dream would roughly 800.000 young people, immigrated to the United States, as they do not yet have a sixteen years old were during the last five years have lived in this country, and a higher educational institution or are registered in the army, legalize.
But the supporters of the bill need 60 votes for the adoption of the initiative, which is why they Republicans are dependent on the votes of a handful. Currently organise the organisations of the advocates of this project an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, of which the majority support the dream Act, have 58 seats.
One of them, however, the Senator Ben Nelson said from Nebraska, he would vote against and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support of the law.
That is why the defenders of the dream must get Act several Republicans on their side, if other Democrats choose should turn our backs on the initiative.
Among the most pulled Republicans include the Maine Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator George Lemieux from Florida, the mandate of the Senator Mel Martínez took.
Other Republicans in the past supported the dream Act, are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they said it in a different opportunity not to support any more.
Another Republican who voted for the bill, John McCain, has not yet determined its attitude.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the dream Act in the Senate faces the biggest obstacles.
Lay the finger in the wound with literature
The second round of the mood of the language ' was a walkover for the narrative in which the participants made strong
"This with the sex in the language I can understand, but... the finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, the second round of Los placeres de la lengua ' should open a cycle of the Spanish-speaking literature celebrated and their question on this occasion the subtitles used (on a different event was devoted in the language of the roundtable sex, she said).
The finger in the wound... "brings us into trouble," spuckte the Argentine Schriftstellein sweet the audience to join suspended mainly from young people at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) met this moderate Marisol Shultz attend roundtable in which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text they Gonzalo Celorio, and the Shultz later characterized as a great narrative. Luisa told in first person and is the champion, who is on the lookout to know what a "wound" and from doctor to doctor, from which they no answer, but receives citations for the guidance of their narrative.
According to the Infektologen leaves them convinced: "Patience is not my strength, which is perhaps my wound."
In conclusion, after a frustrating rapprochement with the clinical trauma theorists, her raubte in the middle of the swing the breath, and her but says that wound is not a scientific concept, enthült the Psychoanalytiker the secret: "The wound is truly open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character in the narrative sighs of relief and includes they "only learned of the wound, that this really is open and does not exist," but she is convinced that the mood of the language and their traps mingle.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguans Sergio Ramírez asked a delightful narrative before he 'Lob the invention ' called and which do not mention the finger in the wound, but discovered.
With allusions to the magical realism, he tells of a famous sorceress touching the clouds, well travelled men back brought or restored the lost virtue of a girl; the narrative made a U-turn and reported by America, the great novel from the outset not lacked its own Chronist, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, the abundance of criticised stories told by the Eroberen.
"Cervantes us all (the writer), spot the false witness in the emerged as a true presented stories, but in other ways, the history of America would never have been told - with imagination, could manage, even the embarrassment was lost."
However, he stresses," madmen and liar, imagine the things best ', and there are nearing reality and lie to each other, where we do not know which side the narrative is where the fictitious literature reached the summit.
He calls the actual 'Tradition Cervantes'.
"We have inherited from him, which will be told."
When Mayra Montero in the series, the writer commented on and praised the diversity of interpretations, to which the invitation of the FIl on the round table 'the finger in the wound' had contributed.
The Kubanerin and Puertorikanerin devoted its contribution of the great wound of societal violence affecting their country - as the whole of Latin America - as a result of fighting the drug trade.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs a tacit, not deliberate commitment contained," she said, after she had stressed that literature communications and engagement between the author and the readers how to build a "chemical reaction."
According to the evening decided the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also "this finger of committed writers hevorhob in the wound of the writer."
He said that the intellectual habits in a fast-moving world, and the control of the awareness of dogmatism. Rather mean, and forget "that a small no behind any confirmation and behind every denial a small yes."
"If we owned our idea and the reality we have to be clarified: and Nuancieren often meant to lay the finger in the wound and harass those who, if they feel much more comfortable in the form of cartoons in black and white, prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also to harass the powerful prefer the world in black and white said he and invited a rediscover the spirit of the letter.
Romano is fighting for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks at three defeat in Endspiels back, he has Aufs and Abs experienced in his career, but he played three crucial games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey also are in the final two different, different styles imposed by their respective coaches towards, and their meeting marked by differences is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks at three defeat in Endspiels back, he has Aufs and Abs experienced in his career, but he has three crucial games had, and he has so far kept well why this opportunity is of particular importance for him.
The Argentines has played with the medal for the second champion, he has remained a step behind the victors and amazingly, he fought successive Endspiels with the same team.
The santistische strategist reached the first final as a coach in the 'Torneo Apertura 2002 ' than del Morelia had the reins in the hand with which he against Toluca learned a great defeat with 4-2; later, in the 'Clausura 2003 ' he reached the decisive match, which he also lost against Rayados with 3-1.
Back in with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010 ', in which it against Los Diablos, played Rubén again had to share a setback because the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros equalised after 210 Spielminuten, but he came to the penalty kick with 3-1 forward and got two options, accepting his title, but ultimately missed three of his players and the game 11 steps on a 4-3.
Rubén already had two Endspiele with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival, lost; that is why he would not again be pursued by the disaster and rid themselves of the bad attention in order to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirmed that the most important thing for him, the game itself.
"I would like to be champion, I would like to break no statistics for a club, for my affection, I am hingebe, and therefore the title will come to me, but what previously happened, is the most important thing," commented the helmsman when they questioned him about the lost Endspiels.
The last endgame he is still strong in the recall, he assured to have learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from this is that until the referee is not the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players, because the last time we were with two Elfmetern already prepared early, and I think that is a lesson until the game is not finished, there is no cause for celebration."
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shoot-out, concerned him not because he trusted his players: "You never want to arrive at the penalty shoot-out, we would like to finish in the regular playing time, but sometimes there is no alternative, and we must be prepared, we were prepared in the previous Tournee, but unfortunately gave us the fate a bad game, sometimes as a result of nervousness or the fierce desire to keep the title already in the hands, which left us something for this endgame, and we hope that it will not happen this time."
It is in Romanso power, not just its second champion and costs for the first time the glory with the title.

The clandestine immigration could easily be prosecuted
The bill of the Conservatives, according to the government, the problem should regulate the ships laden with clandestine immigrants, is likely to be scrapping after the three opposition parties have announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I am thinking strongly against the charter."
"I think with a party you shackles laid at the foot," said Michael Ignatieff, leader of the Liberals, after the expiry of the weekly caucus meeting before the assembled Members.
The liberals claimed that the bill, which allows each of a Seeschiff identified for the transportation of illegal immigrants next person up to a year to injure as proposed the Canadian legal and custodial constitution.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Québécois, as suggested, not being able to support the bill, as he would like to turn against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all the opposition parties against it are, so we will wait to see what the government is doing," said M. Duceppe.

The new entity will take place no unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a new frame unity on the fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest many observers continue to call for the creation of a public committee of inquiry on this issue.
Robert Dutil, minister of public security, claimed this idea come not from yesterday: Quebec had already last January, the New York Department of Investigation consulted on this issue.
The metropolis has at its disposal for fastest on a standing unit against corruption.
However, the announcement by Wednesday, more than just a surprise.
We must say that this measure on the occasion of the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebecer police service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutils has not been discussed in the slightest.
It lacked not due to the fact that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and a member of the Parti Québécois, this announcement in terms of public safety as a "gezaubertes rabbit from the hat 'and' coping in a table of the year cobbled solution" to qualify.
Minister Dutil had turn appealed to those who fear that the political power too much influence on the challenging agenda for the future unity have.
"You will see the result if we will announce it," he was to confirm.
"We realise this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the implementation of a public poll.
"The more M. Charest insisted to prevent the formation of this committee of inquiry want, the more people like you and I think that he has something to hide," he said.
"The only means to be able to form a committee of inquiry, the resignation of Jean Charest" said in turn Yves bois, lecturer in ethics and political systems of the ENA (staatl. high school for the training of senior administrators).
In order to emerge from this impasse, proposing the Quebec, to give a specific mandate from the financial auditing control, so that those on corruption and collusion appropriate inquiries can.
"You should be able to extend the mandate of the audit control," as he decided.
He also takes the view that the Quebec of audit control give the same power as members could, which would allow her to commit people to the statement.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project Charest in the drawers of the government.
The Quebec will also ask Ottawa to amend the penal code in order better to be prepared for this type of crime.
This demand comes from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, the Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier has informed that the case law is not clear in this type of prosecution.
Vic Toews, minister for public security confirmed, for its part, his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, committed currently with certain this dossier offending update apart.

450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec mutual understanding Projektplanungsfirmen 450 million dollars in contracts approved for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, the main portion of the project pipeline, has received a sum of 295 million dollars without tender.
This consortium, known as "Énergie gérance" was in 2004 as a corollary of the decision by Hydro-Québec, the private sector for their accountability, this important hydroelectric project a sum amounting to 5 billion dollars to entrust formed.
At the beginning of 2005 ergatterte the consortium "Énergie gérance" the lucrative contract, without that there had been a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois is resorting to Unternehmenskonsortien a serious ethical problem, which evokes the risk of Wettbewerbsverdrändung and a price increase.
"This is a new way of a stitch-up and distorted the competition."
"This means that rather than fix games rather than secret way now conducts in open form," said yesterday Sylvain Simard, a delegate of the PQ, at the press conference.
In the early morning Simard raised the issue before the National Assembly, because it seems to him hard to understand how the interest of the public can be served in this way.
Resource minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted in the afternoon by they vehemently deny, that it is a stitch-up in this treaty would have acted.
"I am sticking to my faithful" by supporting strengthened, they lashed out at the PQ was proceeded "dishonest" and lacked toughness. "
She said it "is the least" that the PQ apologize.
The model of the consortium is worldwide standard practice.
It is usually such a temporary alliance that two or more companies allowed their expertise on a commandment to concentrate on a tender for a complex project.
The project " East main ' a high komplexität level indicates about his Arbeitsausmaßes.
This is underway and construction techniques should be established by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without a competition had can take place; it had already negotiations.
It also represents the model of the consortium in Quebec even relatively simple projects by no means an exception.
As the newspaper 'Le Devoir' last week noted that in the field of civil engineers and Beratungswesens applied model of the consortium are the subject of Regierungsermittlungen.
A brief overflying the Quebecer Unternehmensregisters allows more than 200 consortia to appoint, some of which seem to be steady duration.
In this way works, for example, the company Dessau in partnership with the majority of its key competitors, CIMA, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or even Roche and Tecsult count together.
Any link, and there are several dozen leads to a and the same legal person back to Dessau.
As far as the consortium "Énergie gérance ', Minister Normandeau stressed that" the territory of the Baie James is subject to a special Arbeitskräftedynamik and Hydro-Québec this fact since the 1970s, taking into account pays special way. "
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ) has issued a statement that the nose has right now on the fact that the treaty was approved after agreement on the project pipeline.
"If you makes a tender, and there are only a few candidates, your prices soar."
"So you have two options: either you nimmst the people who find themselves in this Mart and saying: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea is, however, that it is not the price is crucial, but the expertise of the people," confirmed Laporte.
This consortium "Énergie gérance" approved contract is part of a long list of contracts on more than 50.000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were either Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ approved for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After reviewing the newspaper 'Le Devoir' more than 100 Ingenieurs and advisory contracts, the companies or their branches, including, in particular Ressourcenlabors, between 2002 and March 2010 have been awarded.
SNC-Lavalin had 22 contracts, Génivar received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without here their participation in "gérance" count Énergie.
All these treaties have been negotiated.
In total they amount to 449.783.344 dollars, including the treaty with "Énergie gérance" about 295.131.564 dollars.
Sylvain Simard had indicated that the four companies, which form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the "Parti libéral du Quebec well-known."
Minister Normandeau had let slip the PQ is equally associated with the firms they "finance" before she clarified that it is acting contrary to their leaders.
Barometers verantworungsbewußten consumption - the "green" label is not confidence-inspiring
Green, but clearly skeptical.
The Quebecer consumer has little confidence the main protagonists of sustainable growth, but neither the marked brands or the Öko-Kennzeichnungen should steer his election.
It is a shame, while swimming in a media universe, where information only in favor of a responsible more consumption: the barometer responsible consumption has to complain about a lack of credible information, a failure as a brake makes his commitment displayed as the first reading showed, which was held yesterday.
Although they use of the so-called social friendly products have driven in the year 2010, the Quebecer still seem those who try to sell them to pay little credit.
Two thirds of the Quebecer population is in fact the environment-friendly companies to pay as little faith as the green corporate advertising, so does the responsible Consumer Centre of the University administered brooke sophisticated measuring instrument.
Another record: half of consumers doubts the credibility of the official alleged fair products accompanying certificates, but also the credibility of the products and brands as environmentally aware as the barometer.
Following the same pattern is the discourse of the politicians on this issue of only 14,6% of Quebecer population seriously.
The information about responsible consumption seems nevertheless important to stimulate this Konsumsegments, which is currently approximately only one-third of Quebecer users crowded.
In fact dämpften emptiness and dubious nature of the information the zeal of 46% of consumers.
After the higher price of the product, this is the second obstacle identified by the barometer.
In addition, a third of the Quebecer of the specified performance of green products and services that they are trying to put in the hand, leery of.
According to a different communication had already more than half of consumers have changed their habits in 2010 and predominantly the brand of or several products defected to express their conviction.
According to barometers, they were also 61% preferred purchases with dealers in their districts, and the purchase of food grown favours in their region.
Green and responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had this year a 64 reached the maximum value of 100 - the Homo consumus of Quebec, it loves to present itself as the king of recycling, which is trying to reduce left traces in the environment by he cares about animal welfare.
But the social and ecological consciousness still seems to stop his car, so the barometer: just 28% of the Quebecer have indicated that in the year 2010 public transportation or the Mitfahrzentrale preferred to have in order to demonstrate their ecological interest.
The walking and cycling were also 39,1% of the participants of this comprehensive behavioral survey supports the stereotypes.
Bond for the takeover of eXcentris
The Quebecer government of Société Angus, as well as the company Parallèle invited financially to participate in the adoption of the eXcentris Kinokomplexes agreed to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive loan.
The entwickler company Angus, as well as the company Parallèle a donation amounting to seven million dollars from the Ministry for the adoption of Daniel Langlois belonging Kinokomplexes eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint laurent had hoped to bring this back its real cineastischen function to entrust doesn't seem to get what they demanded.
The government has accepted to involve itself in this matter, but on their own terms.
Instead of the expected donation offers the Quebecer Government rather a loan in less than the initial hoped-for level, a viable solution to create favorable conditions could, at least according to the entnehmbaren sources from the state-owned scaremongers.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million are already last spring by the Quebec rejected further request was for the renewed sum excessive downwards.
One proposal, along with an action plan has been the President of the "Société de développement des entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, sent to St-Pierre Minister, who chairs the eXcentris act.
Before several days, he had an send last factual report.
The counter-proposal of the cabinet was sent to SODEC, however, on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have time until 31 December to respond to this.
In any case, it seems the premise of the state donation really been pushed to the side.
Let us remember that the Quebecer ownership community cinemas and cinema complexes against a direct public investment had revolted to support the takeover of eXcentris by making the argument, the Culture Minister have no financial help for real estate projects there, he did not have other cinemas to send.
Several other market participants, however, the segment by contrast substantial economic aid one.
Cinema chief Daniel Langlois had after the self-financed construction of the cinema over ten years under great difficulty the authors' cinemas presented in the premises of his Kinokomplexes, which could justify the exception from the public purse.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films, in Montreal more than obvious, and eXcentris knew to keep his clients in the bar.
The Société Angus and the company with Christian Yaccarini Parallèle at the top, taxes in turn a privately funded Campagne, of which they are a sum 700.000 dollars hope to stimulate the purchase.
Since the spring of 2009 goes only a single screen so that continues to show films in eXcentris, Le Parallèle.
The aim of the future acquirer, the three Kinosäle on 27 February next year with the spectacle of a very fine film by Xavier Beauvois " I hommes et des dieux ' to reopen.
Christian Yaccarini, however, the newspaper 'Le Devoir' not recalled and ignore what he and his group of the revised downwards proposals to keep them.
Mystery of the komplexgeschüttelten Canada lifted
The new American Diplomatenleitungen, which have been disseminated by WikiLeaks, reveal the mystery about what the United Nations under the inferiority complex of Canadians feel toward the Americans; but they put the the latter superiority with the same blow against Canada open.
Consequently, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voters to the ballot, not the kanadisch American relations in the spirit, and they believe that the visit by President Obama would have helped the Conservative government, their Budget of 2009 to enforce!
The four new communications between the US Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which have been disseminated yesterday publicly offer even more juicy details than the mere substantive content, in which it has a very bad outcome.
A previous link on 22 September 2008, i.e. in the period in which the federal Wahlkampage was in full swing, reported from what point the United Nations is not more of the operations involve discussed by their political bosses.
With regard to the great surprise of David Wilkins of Ottawa deployed American ambassador.
Mr. Wilkins offers various channels of this situation.
"One of the Canadians almost inherent inferiority complex conditional leads possibly the Canadian political leaders far more on internal disputes of everyday life to talk as the United States in this election the buck (as in 1988, when the campaign on the free trade) ," as he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, are thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially threatening to speak of him."
The ambassador understands these "deafening silence" especially since the two countries harbour intensive political and economic relations.
"Logically" excommunicated him, "should the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party leader to drive such processes relationship of voters in the poll as a key factor in the sense."
The other expression of this sense of importance reads on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, business sources in Ottawa, sent communication, President Barack Obama on his first visit in Ottawa to prepare.
"Your trip will help the continuation of the government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget in early February to ensure, in the Canada its first deficit after more than a decade will announce the result of a recovery programme is created in the level of 30 to 40 billion dollars," describes Breese.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had the parliamentary session before Christmas must be postponed in order to prevent that Parliament would be toppled by the coalition and the conditional continuation of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed Belebungsprogramms.
Another, from January 2008 dating of the year and written communication from the Wilkins ambassador in Washington agreed the race by the growing image that the dramatic series broadcast on development, spread by the United States.
The ambassador is worried about programmes such as Border, little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the 'No-Fly-List' or Abführungen for the purpose of interrogation analysis by the CIA Muskelprotze watch.
Yet another communication reported at length about how Hillary Clinton remarked in their French counterparts Bernard Kouchner during their first bilateral meeting asked whether Europe is ready to include certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr. Kouchner is expected to answer the question yes, but on the basis of an individual " case to Fall"-Entscheidung.
Àm at the end of the meeting, as described, "he has the Secretary of State distributed a paper in terms of Omar Khadr, a 15-year Muslims Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised the files again."
Do we finally that the sensibilities on the website WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close standing adviser, explained on development that the people responsible for this massive leak should be "killed."
He was here on Mike Huckabee just cites from the United States.
Global plan for the renewal of the lighting
The UN has a plan yesterday in Cancún for the renewal of the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries in terms of achieving a reduction of greenhouse gas (CFC) proposed, almost a third of the additional reduction, which must be implemented in order to stabilise the Earth's climate until 2020.
This ambitious plan takes his position in the step of specific major projects a the UN hopes to implement in Cancun for the absence of compelling reduction commitments to compensate for the industrial countries.
After the yesterday raised plan would be the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of CFCs emitted as a result of the lighting on the planet to be avoided, if the White fervent pears, which still has a monopoly of 50 to 70% of the market, by fluoreszierend or better still, by diodes (LED) would be replaced.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This equates to an equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year had the big exhaust emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada was committed to voluntary Reduktionsplänen, the global fckw emissions from 53 to 49 Gt downsized Gt should.
From this record, we should withdraw even 5 Gt, however, from now until the year 2020 climate increases to stabilize 2 degrees Celsius to prevent this control.
In the White fervent pears 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% to produce the light.
With the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reduced energy consumption by 75%, reduced with the new LED bulbs this energy once again twice.
The Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen hold on average between 6.000 to 10.000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those which the manufacturer Philips has brought this week on the market - this society has participated in the study undertaken - have a life expectancy of 25.000 hours and 80% less energy than a weißglühende pear, which auswechselung plan gives a hint of the savings, which should be applied in 100 countries.
Apart from the fact that iese novel light bulbs only make very little heat, they can also work with a regulatory widerstand.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reserves to run because they mercury and that they therefore need as a toxic waste dump, which is not always possible in the developing countries, a Bring Centre available except producers.
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, according to the report, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit far more mercury, the electricity wasted by the White fiery oranges to produce.
Alone in the United States encounter these coal plants 25.000 tons of mercury annually.
The report sets out detailed the profits, which would generate each country thanks to this international programme.
Indonesia would, for example, a billion dollars a year in the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2 emissions, which means an equivalent of 3.5 Kohlekraftwerken, whose spiritual Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast expected heated the announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential election in the Ivory Coast called directly for their deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to maintain their work and the preliminary results without further delay disclosing" emphasized a press spokesman of the UNO-Chef.
"He invites all parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast, to demonstrate their accountability and any initiative to abstain on the announcement of the preliminary results."

Around 40 minutes before deadline had confirmed the president of the CEI television that the Commission "to continue with the work" would be to announce the results.
On Wednesday, multiple calls from all over the world has been made, but ultimately the CEI might like the name of the winner of the second round of voting under the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and Alassane Ouattara which had to be declared.
But the gbagbo camp expects with the cancellation of "fraudulent" votes in the north by the Constitutional Court by the Ex-Rebellenlager of the Forces nouvelles (group) during the abortive coup in September 2002 have been achieved.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the presidential campaign of the Ivory Coast, had confirmed that the maneuvers practiced by the group on the intimidation of voters in the north of the country had deterred the President's supporters to go to the election.
The whole election could be cancelled if the complaints lodged by Gbagbo will be considered by the Constitutional Court.
However, the Gbagbo-Kontrahenten are now more of the view that the country's high court is not neutral, because he of Paul Yao N'Dré, a political ties led with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, the man of the north, which denies any link to the Ex-Rebells, the delay in the announcement of the election results as "unacceptable" assessed and Gbagbo asked to respect them, even if he is not so far to claim the victory.
His Bündnisparter reaffirm Gbagbo blockiere the publication of the results, because he knew that he had lost; and a complaint before the Constitutional Court, after the electoral commission had disqualified to publish the results, seie illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday were deemed the crowning glory of the association and reconciliation process in a country that over many years was divided into two parts.
On Wednesday, the politicians, the United Nations had warned the Ivory Coast, it could, in the case of possible riots for those responsible to be held.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first round of voting on 31 October, with 38% of the votes compared with the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, the public support of the former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) genoß as a front-runner emerged.

Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its mediating role for Syria
More than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, considered the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher in Iran has been detained for "espionage," the French public in suspense, upsetting akzentuierte diplomacy in alert and the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the attentive eyes of the diplomats of the United States.
The WikiLeaks received and by the newspaper 'Le Monde' seen American documents give some background to this crisis price.
You describe how that display the Americans had declared its strategy, which went as far as this advice for dealing with their own crisis of "hostage-taking" in Iran (a small group of Wanderers).
They show how the French responsible have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman not the release of Majid Kakavand, a French prisoner and of the American justice system because of trade with material for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme ' Iranians have to Gegeleistung.
Finally, they put the manner in which the French Presidency to manipulate the media for the purpose has tried to convince the idea of Bachar Syrian President Al-Assad have a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, in a harsh light.
In truth, he had not done anything in this regard.
One in Paris on 12 August 2009 redigiertes diplomatic telegram of condolences bears the title "Iran: French comments on the way of dealing with hostage-taking."
François Richier Elysée adviser in strategic question kept accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They told her the French method.
The advised the Americans to do everything possible to make their own nationals back to bring the violent in Iran would be recorded.
"Power noise," they said, 'articulated loudly and clearly and without letting up "the words' fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime respects very sensitive to his image.
"Betreibt all the more so, especially if you ask the Iranians not to do it."
For "silence solves nothing" over the discussion experiments on unobtrusive way, the Iranians are "masters in prevarication."
Mr. Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is a "normal, Iranian tactic:" kidnapping for the purpose of political blackmail. "
He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss from the prison (which should come on 16 August, on the day on which it takes refuge in French embassy) "demand the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians" (230.000 million bail).
And he can disclose the Elysée antizipiere further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that "will worsen."
The Iranians could "in the near future another roughly arrested 1.800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is 12 days have been released from prison, but will continue to be detained in Iran.
An information was circulated: the Iranians Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States due to illegal trade with sensitive electronics materials to Iran, demand after ruling by a judge in Paris has been released from detention.
The American message is how many other observers, questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which the illegal Iranian networks followed the acquisition of the material provided for the nuclear programme is a bad news for the release of Majid Khakavand.
France has taken a horse-trading in purchase?
The liberation of the Iranians against the logic of the Frenchwoman?
During another interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September assured François Richier that this was not the case.
The display, as he says, was not only "quite surprised by the decision of the judges," but also tried to resist.
"It has a lively exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister for Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he says.
Mr. Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand still under 'strict' supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée adviser chooses a telephone number, sets back on, then informed the American diplomat, the Iranians "is currently in the buildings led by the Iranian embassy in Paris."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss display in Iran spares not his efforts, through statements and of the media organised "flight testing" believe Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential mediation."
The Americans are watching this activity is not without irony and note that the manipulation is bearing fruit as several articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram datierendes on 25 August 2009 evokes "the media blitz of the French authorities."
What is based so much "thanks" towards Mr. Assad, wonders the Paris embassy.
"Lobpreis defiant their statements, the French authorities privately admit that they only have a vague idea about what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons which have led the Elysée to plumb this fiction.
The intensive communications "aims to Sarkozy's policy of openness towards Syria to confirm," he analysed.
A 2008 launched policies, then "many critical votes in France and abroad as premature and undeserved perceptions."
"The Syrian role aufbauschend" testing Paris "Syria to remember what laud you can achieve by it plays a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also "discord between Syria and Iran to sow."
The American Embassy knows this from good source.
On 11 August Francois Richier had entrusted her: "Of course we do not know whether the Syrians what have always done."
"But despite all we have thanked them."
"This should at least create confusion on the part of the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss is returning to France on 16 May 2010 back.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives them in the Elysée.
In a statement, he would like to thank the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for its "active role in favour of the release of our compatriot."

He will also those people who want free programs available that make it possible to limit the time spent on the Internet.

The edition 2022 will then be somewhat exotic; the International Football Association hopes after the premiere on the African continent in the year 2010 new territories (Qatar, Australia) to win, or its branch in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea) to pursue.
The list of personalities for the delegation accompanying (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch leader, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) is the degree of economic and political use of a World Cup.
In other words, the machinations behind the scenes as a threat to the last minute to stop.
Otherwise it is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
After the evaluation report of the FIFA, offer the English, Spanish portugiesische (2018) and American (2022) Act bessseren arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations for the 22 members of the Exekutifkommitees on the hour of choice is not so important.
The Sunday Times, with the establishment of the suspension of two members of the Exekutifkommitees (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the revelations, could just as well the opportunities for their own country, cradle of football, can ruin, only a single time was allowed to take the World Cup 1966.
The BBC had the ground again on Monday by making a own report was broadcast, the three influential members of the Kommitees, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou takes under fire.
Reason enough to annoy the FIFA and the English responsible to embarrass primarily with David Cameron had pursued an intense lobbying in recent weeks.
The Government hopes for a repeat of the gambit fine by his predecessor Tony Blair in London in 2005 had reached the organisation of the Olympic Games in 2012.
Dignity of these intensive use enough image England appearance before the Kommitee again?
Nothing is less safe, because the duo Spain Portugal has no shortage of trump cards, with its already finished stadiums, his expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, the Olympic Games in 1992 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial downside of the two countries could dampen its ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal the chances of Russia, which despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport) has become the influential outsiders rise.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided the straightforward suggestion on the Bezichtigungs of the English press "an unfair competition in the runup to the vote" denounced by the Kommiteemitglieder.
"You bewirft it with dirt, trying to compromise," Putin lashed out.
The United States, for 2022 strengthened by the experience of 1994 to be the logical favourites.
First economic superpower, seat of the FIFA-Hauptsponsoren, the country seems a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have drawn up a very beautiful project separately.
But this new nominations seem premature for two countries, which had co-organised the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the long-awaited approval of the FIFA World Cup 2026 for China, the Asian opportunities for 2022 lapses.
With Australia and Qatar, with the Aufwartung futuristischer stadium had drawn all registers, extending its scope in the FIFA direction of new areas, but these two countries a greater risk for certainty.
Australia may as well as Japan and South Korea from the weakness of television rights akquittierten by the European countries (because of the time shift) to suffer FIFA's sensitive nerve.
Second mandate: the evidence
De Gaulle had genuinely curtailed.
Mitterrand had to believe that he stutze.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed not the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than that.
A mandate in the Elysée calls on the next.
The current leader will be candidate in 2012.
But the evidence is the side of the mystery, which accompanies the presidential function, not good to face.
So we must act as if the doubts now would be.
In one, as in the other sense.
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac's pretended that a third mandate is not excluded, without even believing.
On 15 November in serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy, said that his decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011" to be taken.
The fact that he on Tuesday evening in the Elysée UMP-Parlamentariern the prospect of "two mandates" would, therefore, had spread a little Fieberhaftigkeit.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The president left only remind you that the constitution of 2008 the number of five years of consecutive terms to just two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he is the presidential election on the occasion such meetings mentioned in a humorous tone.
"At worst, you are still seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
In a new in May 2010: "Does not, that I do not think beyond the stage."
His words of the day does not make him more for the candidate than the day before; but no less.
If they alarmist comment, then from a double reason.
The acceleration of Wettlaufes candidacy with the PS on one side.
But it is not the start of the competition with Segolene Royal, Nicolas Sarkozy is pushing to reveal itself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, many members of the PS early as adopted on the Challenge.
The bad polls on the other side.
For the first time would the voters of the rights of François Fillon a candidacy by Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the survey of BVA-L'Express) prefer.
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP ', responded immediately and carefully the environment of the Prime Minister.
"If it is a defeat would find as possible, he would not be a candidate" shares Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe to be able to win" corrected Alain Juppé, who has resigned with the evidence.
Euro: the ECB is obliged to maintain their buying of government securities
The final assembly of the Governing Council of the ECB in the past year should provide an opportunity to explore ways to show how it can emerge from the crisis, or at least the orders of a large number of unconventional announcements of monetary policy, which should come to its conclusion by the end of the year.
The crisis obliges the European government debt, the Central Bank in Frankfurt can afford no doubt today, more than tense situation on the European bond markets ambitions, not their worsening to cause.
The political cost would be far too high.
The French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde had yesterday, on the occasion of a press conference by the European Central Bank has adopted an active role in favour of the resolution welcomes Europe's state budget deficits.
It has not dared to say whether they thought the central bank can do more, for example, by reviving its program of buying of government bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...) ."
Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the ECB had in the previous day in Brussels on the occasion of his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament is not very articulate about his project has shown, but rather to point out that the programme of purchases of government securities on the secondary market "continuing enterprises" would and that we in the Assembly on Thursday "will see how the decisions will emerge."
The only certainty: the ECB is its key interest rate untouched at 1%, the lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the bond purchases were the treasure chamber last week by the ECB to approximately 1,35 billion doubled.
Some traders, according to leaks and let them yesterday new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government securities.
Overall, the central banks of the Eurosystem since May 2010 made purchases amounting to 67 billion euros.
Among the dealers is the anticipation of a follow-up of the Kaufkurses questioned under any circumstances (see page 29).
Already, the economists do not expect any notable change more.
If the Anleihengeschäfte of more than three months already disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB, the latter to create still at freigiebige type in the full Geldmittelreserven, and over a period of one week up to three months.
The economists are already taken that this measure will extend even for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will amend its programme on fundamental way."
"Otherwise they would risk provoking new tensions in the short term" suspected Michael Schubert, economist of Commerzbank.
"One for the course of the first quarter of 2011, progressive exit seems likely" anticipates, in turn, Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions in the market for sovereign debt, "the ECB should such a purchase volume of bonds to maintain that stimulates the sluggish market," Norbert Bräms adds.
In view of the relevance of the exposure of European banks on the markets of public debt in the euro zone, the Central Bank has no other choice than to maintain their presence in the market.
"At any price, you must come to the Steller of the lack of investors in the market and so act to prevent the premature enthusiasm about the paid returns to the most vulnerable states," bezeugte yesterday, an important bond holders.
Because if interest rates start to the exuberance would prevent more states to reduce their debt or even just to stabilize.
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
The government of Berlusconi in Italy in coverage
After a disturbing week beginning for Italy, the situation yesterday with the decline of the Eckzinsen for 10 years a little relaxed.
A return to the uneasy silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs had the regional chairman Giulio Tremonti situation as a "unentzifferbar" qualify and him with a "unpredictable" weekend can expect to hear what the person, however, immediately denied.
On Tuesday at least had the gap with the German interest rates his record of 210 base points achieved, and the prices are the contracts to cover the Konkursrisikos has risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain Kopflosigkeit in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi pointed out in his Council of Ministers that the discrepancy in Spain to the German interest rates is in the hands of 400 base points.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, was, however, as a "serious concern" of the "market turbulence" and a possible contagion from Ireland indicated.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro zone, not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy, like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
To put it plainly, his problem is the shortage of economic growth and the concomitant anaemic tax eingangs the state in danger, no longer meet its funding needs to be able to.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future will be an Italian growth of 1,1% in 2011 and expected by 1,4% in 2012... although this budget in the Senate for consideration with 1,3% respectively, 2% is calculated.
Under these conditions, as calculated by the European Commission, the budget deficit next year will be 4,3% of GDP (contrary to the governments predicted 3,9%) and 3,5% in 2012 (instead of 2,7%).
That is why the uproar about a new budget collective after the holidays on a sum of EUR 7 billion could be used.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says auditors Olli Rehn.
On the hour, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, we repeat this for a very long time," Arrigo assured Sadun Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund at the IMF is charged with Italy.
"At the moment there are no problems, neither short-term nor long-term perspective, since from Italy, despite its high debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011, A. that R.) lower Stabilisationsfortschritte required than other countries" observed Pier Carlo Padoan, chief volkswirt of the OECD.
That leaves the question of political Unstetigkeit.
On 14 December Silvio Berlusconi a motion of censure facing the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the early elections at the end of March could be organised.
It is therefore a little favorable period before for a decisionmaking process on a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about the development of the anti-crisis measures to
Christine Lagarde was still yesterday in the context of a press conference in Paris underlined: "I think it has to go on Sunday afternoon and evening proved: the Europeans think clearly together are ready and committed to defend its currency and its monetary zone."
Although entirely relative - yesterday was recorded withdrawal in the Zinsfüßen of European government bonds water to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But from a normalisation start may not yet be the speech.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could Portugal's debt approval, which is probably most effective target of speculators nowadays, belittle.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, particularly in the banking systems is weighing" the views of the economists of the Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, given that "the political time passes much slower than that of the markets."
The European countries, both this gap and the danger lies well aware, intensify the discussions on the strengthening of the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal discussions between the most closely affected finance ministers and in the wider sense with their counterparts of the G20 is progressing well.
And this in relation to the meetings of euro groupe and Ecofin early next week.
The ECB is today.
In the plan says the fate of the unconventional measures on the backing of the countries of the euro zone in the risk of markets (see below).
As far as the EU's Stability Fund, whose executive director Klaus Regling already on Tuesday in Singapour started his Asian tour, the investors in the Far East has to be informed of the developments concerning the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of his visit, although not expressly overrunning, as he prepares for this certainly the terrain.
The first Werpapierausgaben on the part of the EU's Stability Fund are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday an official US representative of the Reuters entrusted to the United States supported a possible increase in the by the additional direct involvement of the IMF mobilized funds.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first series, send itself to structural reforms, particularly in the area of the labour market organisation.
Reforms, which added to the austerity measures, should show effects in near future.
Lisbon and Madrid a different path than that Greece and Ireland have done.
Both the one and the other at any price is to avoid asking for international assistance to have before they set their own Budgetkorrektive and decided about inevitable structural reforms, which confers permanently confidence back.
The European investors, in turn, talk about the available options in order to speed up the normalization process of the markets of bonds.
Axel Weber, who is in transit in Paris on 24 November, Chen had first brought the idea that if the 750 by Europe and the International Monetary Fund mobilized billions of euros were not enough, so the Union would not hesitate to resort again in their own pockets.
The economists from Barclays Capital, in terms of the market in the European government debt whole player standing in the foreground, judge, an extension of the 100 billion euros would be enough, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This funding exists: the European mechanism being financial stabilization, which is currently 60 billion.
An advisory committee, which has every chance to draw attention to be examined in European capitals.
Above all, if market conditions worsen.
Snow and black ice: 24 departments in alert orange
The Schnee-Episoden still follow Verkehrsschwierigkeiten, especially in the secondary transport networks of Brittany and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now because of the threat of snow in alert orange and Glatteisrisikos.
The regions your, Eure-et-Loir, deux sèvres and were already alert orange 20 departments have been added; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, affect the intense snow schauer the north of the Gironde and the Charentes, it is snowing slightly on the Ile de France.
In the affected departments snow cover from 2 to 5 inches, sometimes also expected from 7 to 10 cm and 1 to 3 inches, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
It affects the regions Charente, Charente-Maritime, coasts of d'Armor Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the Lower Normandy, Ile de France and Limousin regions.
The snow is remarkable enough Verkehrsbehinderungen to cause and affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
Coasts of d'Armor in the region are several Regionalstrassen for the heavy traffic of about 7.5 tonnes blocked, including the routes Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The transport situation of secondary transport networks in Brittany, according to the traffic police, which advise to only in extremis use their own car, very difficult, and the use of certain TER-Reisebusse was the whole day on deleted.
In the Picardy on Thursday repealed the school transport.
For Wednesday evening the heavy traffic provided no specific restrictive measures.
The police "to the utmost caution urges the drivers on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour."
The Directorate-General for civil aviation (DGAC) urged the airlines on Thursday 25% of their from Roissy airport and 10% of Orly from starting end flights due to the expected to remove heavy snow.
The DGAB recommends the passenger to contact their airline.
The airports Gatwick south of London and the airport in Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial spectacular
Since the debate about the modernisation of the transport sector is in full swing on the Ile de France, rain billions.
At least in the discussions.
We appeal especially the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris in memory of the Société du Grand Paris is to be built.
In order to guide the start of the SGP in the ways that the state has a capital dotation declared by 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical system, this is the amount, which would then allow the SGP to the markets to their two times to give a part of the financial bill.
Today it is finally come to initial projections.
The supplementary budget from 2010, this morning seen by the financial committee of the National Assembly, contains the planned measures to raise the first part of this money.
It is two measures: the creation of a special tax to Erschließund and a higher taxation of the offices at the Ile-de France.
The former, we remove Article 15 of the bill, "for the benefit of the public clinic Société du Grand Paris."
This is quantified: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year."
Two more is an overhaul of the existing business taxation: "In order to modernise them in order to increase their resulting product and this increase of Société du Grand Paris to entrust."
How much would this bring?
A mystery.
This amount is not put in the text.
From the 4 billion is far away.
"It is said that the fiscal resources to the 4 billion euros of capital dotation to be added to be raised by the state and the Société du Grand Paris after and to be done for the project," as is clear from the explanatory statement.
In the case of the SGP will take place this system not objectionable.
"Since the moment in which revenue (the two taxes that R.), you can cover long studies over three years and then extract from the 4 billion," said.
"This is listed in the budget and gradually withdrawn."
The SGP estimated that it will be launched in 2013, the 4 billion to note for the budget in 2014.
This measure, whose 4 promised billions we can look for a long time, risks a very turbulent provoking parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December instead.
Rachsüchtige hackers and industrious spies
The Affaire WikiLeaks has a dual significance.
On one side, it turns out as an obvious scandal, a scandal that only a scandal in the Sinner hypocrisy is the Beziehunge between states, ruled the public and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level, and gives a taste of the future dominated by recession.
But we are taking the series.
The first aspect of Wikileaks is the confirmation of the fact that each act produced by a secret service (an old nation) composed exclusively of newspaper cuttings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual habits Berlusconi's throw anything further than what we have months anyway to read in any old journal received (except those whose owners Berlusconi) and the terrifying karikaturierte profile rebuffed offered Kabarettkünstlern for a very long time substance for their Sketchs.
The rule, after which the secret dossiers should only consist of already well-known news is essential for the dynamic of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go into a library devoted to esotherischen publications, you will see that each work (on the grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, Templer or Rosenkreuzler) repeated exactly what has been written in previous works.
This is not alone, therefore, that the author occult texts will publish any research (nor, therefore, that he is not knew where to find would be news to report on the non existierende), but because those who devote themselves to the Okkultismus, nothing else than to believe what they already know and confirms what they have already learned.
This is also the most mechanism of Dan Brown.
Similarly, the secret files.
The informer is rotten and lazy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (he could otherwise whatever it may be, for example, editor in Libération), the only considered true what he acknowledges.
The Top-Secret information on Berlusconi, the American Embassy in Rome was sent to the Staatsdezernat, were the same as those that Newsweek had published a week earlier.
So why such a fuss was made by the revelations of these files?
On one side they say what any educated person already knows, and that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then the government leaders can call each other or can take a plane to take on the dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some small classed have transformed into spy centres.
Every old viewers of investigative movies knows this very closely, and it does not happen from hypocrisy, that it is doing so to ignore this.
However: the fact to repeat it in public, violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put the American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly: the idea that an ordinary hacker secret most secrets can become the most powerful country in the world, carries the significant blow to the prestige of the Staatsdezernats.
It also brings the scandal less victims, rather than the "executioner" in trouble.
But we address the profound nature what happened.
Ehemals, Orwell's time, it was all power as a Big Brother pool, which controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy had since then as a completely right can point out where you can control every movement, thanks to the telephone, each site's transaction visited hotel, the elected motorway and so forth; the total victims of citizens would be the eye of power.
However, if you look in mind, what is happening today that even the secret Kryptas of power can no longer escape the control of a Hackers hears the control transition to be unilaterally directed and zirkelförmig.
The power controlled every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hackers - chosen as citizens - can discover the secrets of power.
How can stick but a power which is no longer able to protect their own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel said that a real mystery is an empty secret (and an empty mystery can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the character Berlusconi's or Merkel's basically free of Geheimis is a mystery, because the public sphere price; but in the style of WikiLeaks to reveal the secrets of Hillary Clinton empty secrets were means to deprive them of any power.
Wikileaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wronged, however, Clinton and Obama.
What are the consequences of this injury, which has caused such an enormous power?
It is obvious that the states no reserved information in future will face more Online - that would be tantamount to a posting added on the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that it is frustrated with the current technologies to hope confidential reports to be able to keep secret via telephone.
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a Head of State move in a plane and one of his colleagues contacted.
How could in future private and only for certain ears certain relationships?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment for science fiction and Roma confinement sounds, but I am forced to imagine the government agents preoccupied on secret nature and moving to uncontrollable road routes, their messages anywhere else than in a mere memory key, and also the few written information they received in the shoe marketing verbergend.
Only copy the information would be stored in locked drawers: basically had the spy attempt of Watergate less success, as WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology nowadays like a cancer progresses, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telecommunications had revolutionized communications, the Internet with (telephone) a Telegrafen Wire.
The (analog) Videokassetten had allowed the Filmforschern, auszukundschaften a film gang on gang, by one spulen from the back forward and was able to reveal all the secrets of Montags, whereas the (numerical) CDs allow nothing more than to jump from chapter to chapter, in other words, Makroportionen.
With the high-speed trains travel within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this by plane, including the switching requires three and a half hours.
It is therefore not exceptional, policy and communications technology come back on car and horse.
One final observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the messages.
At present, the messages demanding confidential information from the press.
Climate: as France is talking about his financial promises
A year after the Copenhagen treaty, it is time the observance of the fast gelösten funding promises ("Fast Start" or premature funding mentioned) to investigate which have been implemented by the developing countries.
And already have revealed the rough French vulnerable to blandishments.
With the Copenhagen Treaty have committed themselves to developing countries, 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012 will be set aside.
The EU has 7.2 billion euros over three years promised France 1,26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of the COP16, the EU has taken all register their partners from the fact of their commitment to convince about the Fast-Start-Finanzierungen: accurate course report of its Member States, press conference, large side events, broschüre distribution.
The operation transparency is remarkable and appreciated for their actual value: the developing countries and civil society would look like if all developed countries the same made on the same precision levels.
The EU announced, 2.2 billion euros in 2010 to have released what they are on the right path to Respektbezollung their commitment of 7.2 billion brings in 2012.
If one looks in detail but are things a little more complicated.
This money should be according to the Copenhagen Treaty "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional deployment was introduced to benefit, without detriment of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed a harmonisation, certain member states, including France, the procedure has been blocked.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark, which he considers to be the best.
The European Commission, for example, as a benchmark for the person of the Year 2009: the international funding will be maintained, and in the context of "fast start" funding over three years of 150 million.
Other countries have similar benchmarks, either on year or about conditions elected at the level of public development aid.
In contrast, France has been of the opinion that the financing "of all new projects" of 2010 were "new and additional."
In other words: there is no benchmarks in the spending of the previous year or public development aid at a global level.
Specifically, the total amount of French support can remain stable developing countries (or decrease) - France gives its commitment with regard to the "new and additional" funding must be respected.
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is still no rule, and everyone elects its calculation mode.
Some, like France, for example, 1 borrowed as equivalent with 1 donated.
Obviously, this is only serious reasonable: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investment (often projects tied to emission mitigation based on effektivster technology) can be justified, it is wrong to present the euro as the equivalent of a donated euro captured... let only the cost of loans for the capital donor country to be counted as commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing else in mind as the following thought: it "respected" his commitment of 420 million euros by 91,5% loans (389,8 million) resumes and 8,5%) 36,1 million euros) - see the EU documents to convince themselves.
France is the only EU country uses in large measure that loans.
Germany urges 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among other things) their commitments to 100% to follow up with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union 1 spends to fulfil their obligations, France just 10 cents and meant a similar commitment.
Schöner!
Everything operates in all France in his fast start with a double deception: a part with a Weiterentwicklkung of action over the period and partly with the reality of the financial commitment.
France will be able to believe that 420 million "new and additional" million has been spent in accordance with its promises, it will save 36,1 million.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it would appear that Bercy was carried out of the arbitrage) a double negative effect could entail; even internally (why continue with donations from the other member states if it is enough to lend?) and then in the negotiations, as the developing countries do not completely fooled...
The chapter of the premature funding only a small issue in a relatively short time compared to the whole of discussions on the climate.
But it could drop too much in the huge machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
As it always is, it is essential to its lesson from this first year to learn verfrühter funding.
First and foremost, France could be a change in its Verbuchungsart parade for the years 2011 and 2012, and in the spirit of respect for its commitments and the compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union.
France could but, above all, the discussions on the contentious subject of long-term financing forward (another crucial and current topic): you can escape the question of the "Verrechenbarkeit" or the Verbuchungsart of its loans are not.
France could change its position, as advanced in terms of controversy, as it is in other things.
The hope is the new Minister for the Environment Kosciusko-Morizet, will arrive next week in Cancun.
A surprising announcement on the fast start of France and its vision of the "Verrechenbarkeit" and the use of loans would increase by nature of the international trust needed for further discussions.
Warning - pesticides ingested by children
A child of 10 years adopted on the day an 81 different chemicals, so a this Wednesday of the unification Générations Futures (former movement for the protection of the rights and the respect of future generations) published study.
The association, which says that their results "in the light of the low number of analysed samples do not reflect statistically significant value, but illustration nature of the treated problems pose" was between July and September usually within four of a nearly 10-year-old child meals consumed food plus an interim mahlzeit in the supermarket bought in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit share three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as biscuits from laboratories were in the search for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants studied.
The balance is staggering: 81 chemical substances, including 42 and possibly or probably carcinogenic classified and five klassifizierte as a safe karziogen, as well as 37 substances with Endokrinin-Störfaktor, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if the nearly whole cases the legal limits for any chemical, individual ingested substance not be crossed, we remove this collection but very good that the reality in which the consumer may be carcinogenic substances or substances with Endokrinin-Störfaktor is suspended, worrying," noted the unification.
On the breakfast included only the butter and tea with milk already more than 10 of the potentially cancerous changes that those responsible for delays and three safe as carcinogenic proven, as well as more than 20 residues, which may affect the hormonal system.
The apples imported from Brazil, planned for the study as an interim mahlzeit, traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same goes for the green beans from Kenya, including lunch, where the study traces of a strictly banned insecticide in the EU has found.
There were also the Hacksteak of tuna, even the Baguette and the gum of pesticides and other chemicals.
The senior water brought the analyses the presence of nitrates and Chloroform to light.
At the dinner was the salmon steak with 34 identified chemical residues on the "richest," and even putting the meal in the microwave used plastic applicants was not clean.
The eventual risk of this "Schadstoffcocktails" for the consumer "will probably undervalued," the study.
The "Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts" (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in view of the urgency of the situation," to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides, the "increase in the number of Western diseases" to stop.
In July was a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concerning the presence of residues 365 various, identified identified pesticides in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
