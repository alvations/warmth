A Republican strategy to the re-election of Obama to confront
The leaders of the Republicans to justify their policies with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, keeping the Brennan Center, the latter for a myth, by selecting it reiterates that the electoral fraud in the United States less than the number of people killed by lightning.
The attorneys for the Republicans have in 10 years in the USA, by the way, just 300 cases of electoral fraud were recorded.
One thing is for sure: these new provisions will be a negative impact on voter turnout impact.
In this sense, undermine these measures are part of the democratic System of the USA.
In contrast to Canada, the United States for the implementation of the elections in each of the States responsible.
In this sense, the majority of the American governments since 2009, the new laws promulgated, the procedure for the registration or the election more difficult.
This phenomenon has after the elections in November 2010 gained in importance, in which 675 new Republican representatives in 26 States were recorded.
As a result, 180 bills in 2011 alone, introduced, in which the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States limit.
The new election laws require that the voter photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship is required.
In addition to this, these laws also the time periods for the early voting shortened, the right to be declared invalid on the day of elections, as voters to register, and citizens the right to vote is denied, for a Gerichtsakte exists.
Before the 2006 elections, has no US state of voters is required, a photo ID must be presented.
Indiana was the first state that such a demand has been raised.
The Supreme court of the United States was confirmed in the year 2008 the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
The Republican authorities have hurried, this practice to other States as well.
In the course of the last two years fostered in 34 States to initiate laws, with which the voter can be forced to a photo ID must be presented.
It is important to note that the US citizens, in contrast to Quebec does not have a universal identification card, such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of the US citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible voters persons are not of a government Agency, your state issued photo ID.
In addition, five million Neuwähler in the year 2012 not have such a card.
However, it is often more than one hundred dollars to pay to get the necessary identification to obtain.
The new restrictions are young people, minorities and people with low incomes are disproportionately affected.
In fact, possess 25% of the Afro-Americans, 15% of the persons with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years of age and 20% of the voters between 18 and 29 years of age does not have the required photo ID.
This extends even further.
The students, as voters considered to be their voice more democratic candidates review, it is in several States, is not allowed, your by your institution issued photo ID to use.
On the other hand, allow the same States members of Angel or Jagdvereinen, the stronger for the Republican side, choose, which of these Associations is issued cards for elections to use.
Before 2004, has no state for Choosing a proof of citizenship is required.
Arizona was the first state that such a demand to bring it in.
Since 2011 have a dozen States adopted laws of the voters demand that your US citizenship to prove.
These measures aim is clearly to the Hispanic vote to limit.
Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters, the democratic party prefer.
In addition, Republican lawmakers 2011 in eight States laws promoted, with which the registration of voters on election day was abolished.
In addition, you have the right of individuals and groups is limited, those voters to help the wish to register for.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns for voter registration in the General elections of 2004, contributed approx. 10 million. Citizens to register.
Because by since 2009 adopted measures the proportion of registration of Neuwählern 2010 compared to 2006, to 17%.
Also, the Republican lawmakers in five other States adopted laws aimed at the period for early voting to shorten.
For example, were in the General elections 2008 in Florida 33% of the voters in advance have chosen, Afro-Americans, although only 13% of the voters of the state that make a difference.
The same applies for the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of the citizens in advance.
In contrast, made White, 76% of the voters were only 46% of the electorate in advance chose.
Of course, democratic lawmakers and their supporters vigorously the adoption of laws is confronted with, the registration of voters limit.
A number of bills were by the vetoes of the democratic governors blocked.
The advocate-General of the United States has intervened to make the most controversial laws to suspend.
You could damage partly limit.
For example, only 16 of the 34 States adopted laws, the Presentation of a photo ID request.
However, the new rules introduced in the year 2012, undoubtedly, the exercise of the right to vote more difficult.
The democratic critics denounce the political nature of the adopted laws, and see them as a clear objective of which is to influence the results in the 2012 key States.
A report of the Brennan center of 2011 shows that those countries have passed laws, 171 of 270 votes constitute, in the Wahlmännergremium are required to the presidency to win.
It is too early to know with certainty to confirm that these legislative Changes to the electoral system have significant effects on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is for sure: these new provisions will negatively affect voter turnout.
In this sense, undermine these measures are part of the democratic System of the USA.
Prostatakrebsfrüherkennung: the Test should be made or not?
The PSA Test manner in fact, sometimes erroneous results, with false negative or false positive results, to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to a greater reluctance of the already indecisive men for the implementation of early diagnosis procedures.
The Test should be made or not?
We have the opinion of two specialists obtained.
In the United States of America studies conducted passed numerous confounding factors between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret this data and clear recommendations.
Another study, this Time from Europe, came to the conclusion that a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that in a follow-up after 12 years, the probability of formation of metastases by 30 to 40% higher if no early detection was performed.
This is why I recommend the Test from the age of 50 years, respectively. 40 years ago, if you are a direct Relative who is already suffering from prostate cancer.
In men afro-American origin, is also at a higher risk.
The most Important thing is to make the right decision, once a cancer has been detected.
There are types of cancer, the aggressive, and others, the indolent.
The patient needs to the extent of the risk of his cancer really be made understandable by the possible options will be identified, in which Prostatakrebse are left untreated, if he is the quality of life in the long run is not affected, and in these cases for a more active Monitoring of the sick.
Today, there are many men, where cancer has recognized, no treatment, since her cancer is not aggressive, and there is no threat to their lives.
It proposes an active Monitoring and provides you with progression of the disease and treatment.
One determined with increasing precision, the criteria for deciding who should be treated, and who is not.
Therefore, I recommend nevertheless, the execution of the Tests.
Most important, it is but, with his doctor to speak, in order to determine whether he should be conducted or not.
In collaboration with the international society for urology Movember has developed a tool, with which it is possible, the pros and cons of PSA testing to evaluate.
This document (currently only in English, but a Translation will be available soon) can be downloaded from the following address: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening
Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress made in the research remains the adoption of a healthy lifestyle is the best way, in order to reduce the risk of him developing.
It is estimated that 30% of cancer could be prevented if all eat well and get enough would move.
"If there are no smokers more, would this value to at least 50% increase in", stresses Andre Beaulieu, a spokesman for the canadian cancer society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of the cancers caused by inheritance.
Several remain totally unclear.
For the canadian cancer society remains the fight against the tobacco dependence is a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
There is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It strongly harms the health of the people.
"Today, there are in Quebec 1.5 million. Smokers", says the spokesman Andre Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the waiver on the cigarette, and you reduce the risk of dying from cancer by half.
The Weight
According to the canadian cancer society to promote Overweight and obesity also the outbreak of the disease.
You seem to be the risk for breast, column-, rectum, esophagus, pancreas and cervical cancer to increase.
"The research shows that regular physical activity throughout the life against Grimmdarmkrebs protects", he adds.
The Diet
The organization also recommends that the red meat consumption to a minimum.
In large quantities, it increases the risk of a Grimm - or. Rectal cancer disease.
Sausage products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat due to Smoking, Drying or salts can cause the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, a number of scientists of the relationship between Vitaminzusätzen and cancer studied.
Their investigations are currently not conclusive.
According to the canadian cancer society are the studies on Vitamin E contradictory.
During a study of the reduction of the risk of prostate cancer has found out, showed a different rather an increase.
The effect of Vitamin D on the cancer was also not clearly shown.
In addition, it emphasises Mr. Beaulieu, how important it is, with his doctor about his concerns and his family history to speak of.
"The implementation of a Früherkennungstest does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs Boson is analyzed
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson has in the last summer of a certain interest, and for good reason.
We believe in the fact that this Boson at nothing less than the mechanism is involved, for the mass of all objects in the universe is responsible.
And finally, it refers to the last particles whose existence from the standard model of our best, or at least false" explanation of the nature and the behavior of matter - predicted, but empirically not yet been observed.
But for physicists, it is still not completely sure that it's really the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt, that we are a real new particles, and that it is the standard model predicted Higgs Boson is very similar.
In addition, this seems to be due to new data to be confirmed, which this week on a large physics Congress in Kyoto were presented, but it still lacks the data, in order to be completely sure.
Go, we nevertheless believe, that it is indeed the Higgs is, there seems to be only a low risk, to deceive, and we will look at what it is about.
There are in this world, a necessarily inviolable law, which means that two objects are not at the same time at the same place may be present.
It is not possible to breach the above rule and try not to be too strong, because they hurt.
Because even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out, that for such a law: the Pauli's Ausschlussprinzip, which States that two particles is not the same room at the same time can occupy, if you are in the same quantum state", and this "state" on the Whole, from some of their properties.
Assuming parts of the physicists of particles in two categories.
In a corner there are the good citizen, as Fermions are designated and well-behaved the Pauli principle obey.
And in the other to move the bosons, an ugly gang of anarchists, for whom nothing is sacred, and in any case not of this principle, which means that you are in fact at the same time in the same place.
These bosons are divided according to the site, The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (by the way, is absolutely amazing) into two groups: the mesons, which we can't handle, and the "Kraftteilchen", by which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs Boson related somehow.
It must however be stressed that these bosons not all such exotic creatures are, as you might think.
If you are capable of this chronicle to read, then only thanks to a boson of exceptional banality: the Photon, or the "photon", the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
If a particle with an electrical charge accelerated or a change of direction, the electromagnetic field is exactly in this place "disturbed", like a Pebble in a pond.
Through this "disorder" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared, or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a Photon and thus one of the bosons, "the carrier of the power".
More Stable Field
The same applies for the Higgs Boson, with the difference that a different field, Higgs field, "disturbed" to this Boson.
However, the Higgs field is very much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the causative agent must be very high energies, a little similar to a frozen pond, its surface only by a very large rock ridged could be.
That is why a huge particle accelerators, such as the CERN necessary, the Large Hadron Collider is a Ring with a circumference of 27 km! - to such energies to achieve.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to the relationship between the Higgs and the mass to explain.
There are, in fact, not all the particles and not all of the materials with the electromagnetic field interacting with.
Some, such as magnets, to do this, but others are not - for example, would a sheet of paper never even in the refrigerator.
And likewise, all the particles do not interact with the Higgs field: those who do it, have a mass, while the other (like the Photon) no mass.
For what can all this research now to "be good", asks woman Plamondon?
For the science, they serve to test the standard model (SM), and they allow the physicists also, all the deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM to examine exactly.
By the way, there are numerous physicists, the eagerly-in the hope that such deviations are found, because the slightest difference a door to a "new physics" open and some of the holes of the model could cram.
It is necessary to tell, that the latter is still serious shortcomings, because there is no explanation for the force of gravity (oops!) and the dark matter provides approx. 80% of the matter in the universe (re-ups!).
However, there have been at CERN such deviations until now not been found.
Impact
The implications of this research for the General population are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no God.
By the way: in the early ' 60s, the pioneers of the laser at Bell labs, does not suspect, that their Work in such a Revolution would trigger.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
Indeed, the late physicist Willard Boyle - the Bell Labs has worked, in which the Laser in the 1960s was invented, and the 1962 even the first continuous-wave lasers (they were the first pulsed) developed has already said that the Laser at the beginning rather than a "Laborspielerei" was considered.
Imagine...
In addition, for applications from all of the instruments, which the research surrounded.
For example, in turn, has Willard Boyle 1969 during his Work in optics, a small light sensor developed.
Although it is not the original purpose was, this Sensor today, all digital cameras worldwide as the "eye" and gave him the 2009 Nobel prize for physics to be introduced.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC necessarily change our lives, but it does mean that you can never know...
Palliative care is the best way to die... | Le Devoir
With your Committee to "Die with Dignity" has Quebec recently, the thorny question of the Lebensendes discussed.
The debate must shortly be resumed, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, it remains in this important topic is still much to do.
Le Devoir has tried this in more detail.
A few weeks ago, lived Mr. L. alone in his apartment in the monteregian.
The prostate cancer, it aufzehrte, had given him a period of two years left.
"They gave me five years to live, I've got seven years managed," he said half-heartedly, in his bed at home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil lying, in which he on the previous day had arrived.
"However, it is always a shock, so you can't be prepared," he says.
The disease makes your work: a huge weakness prevents him from alone to go to the toilet, and even to eat.
On the table in front of a delicious lunch sitting, he agrees resigned, when you eat to help them.
Brave he even succeeds to smile and Strangers to talk around him busy, give him his medication, and him a bath.
The courage of the ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that my diarrhea heals, because this is humiliating"he shares.
A few hours later, the Team has a remedy for this Evil found.
"In the course of our life, we learn that a man Standing peeing," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at home Victor-Gadbois.
In the Kindheitsphase return is for some people an unacceptable humiliation.
"This depends on the ability of the Person", a throwback to accept, he notes.
Because in the opinion of several persons, in the palliative care work, find great events in the midst of this regression.
The patients in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois to be instructed, all suffer from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In this stage you will be by the Doctors and nurses who take care of them, not with so-called "healing" maintenance of the force.
For Mrs. A., 89 years old, is the worst fear, "consciously and by asphyxiation" to die.
But by the disease, I have my children really gotten to know.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no more desires in life," she said, before she accepted that she puts on a mask that your Breathing helps.
You are expected in the next few days, still a last visit her son, who comes from Italy.
In the home Victor-Gadbois provides you with a group of volunteers personal care and help with the food intake.
The palliative care is used when there are no other possibilities exist any more.
To Die more enjoyable.
In Quebec comes on of 11,700 inhabitants a bed for the palliative care services.
This is very little, if one takes into account that one day we all will die.
Here is the life in the best possible conditions to continue, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the Physicians of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
You are granted the Dying, depending on the desire to have a care with Brandy or Pepsi.
Diabetics need to have their blood sugar control.
And death is a part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening, we have Mr. X, a beer is served, in the course of the night died.
Today, Tomorrow will be the son of the beer at the feet of the deceased drink.
"We help families and patients alike," reports Pflegedirektorin Nathalie Savard.
In the home Victor-Gadbois no day is like the other.
Next to an old man of 93 years, the last family reunion in Hof enjoys a well by his pillow, backed, while his honor hit dies, a young man of 36 years, from his parents, his wife and two small children, surrounded tragically, after he has tried everything to survive.
"For the past six months of three to five beds are always with cancer patients aged less than 45 years"tells Dr. Christiane Martel concern.
53% of the home Victor-Gadbois hospitalized patients come from your place of residence, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to a care that the Suffering of patients alleviate, if the latter is the final stage of your life, both at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois, and the society for domestic palliative care services in the greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively to the care of cancer patients.
Exactly this great inadequacy of the health care Quebec ensures that more of the palliative care specialist Doctors of the adoption of a law on the regulation of euthanasia and assisted suicide, with concerns together.
Since the month of October is a Manifesto in circulation, the prominent personalities of the palliative care as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe was signed to their opposition to such an Initiative to be tested.
Dr. Christiane Martel, according to the healthcare system in Quebec is not powerful enough to make sure that all the right to a high-quality palliative care services have, before you are accepted, to euthanasia move.
Recently, she says, I have a patient seen, the 14 days with great pain in the emergency room and no one measures to alleviate has taken.
I am afraid that the patient is the only reason to want to die, because they have no adequate health care.
And at the same time treat multiple oncologists their patients, despite the worst forecasts desperately until the last day.
The chances of Survival of Helena Richard were already minimal, as they are an arduous chemotherapy has canceled.
As I my Oncologist told that I stop treatment will, they answered me, that you regret that I have to give up the fight, she said.
However, she had told me that I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have asked to die, the nursing staff would like to thank, that this request is not complied with, after their pain by a Team of palliative care services have been alleviated.
But it must be clear that the palliative care services for the treatment of pain is not omnipotent.
After Elsie Monereau, Director of the palliative care of the society of the domestic palliative care services in the Metropolitan area of Montreal speak 8% of patients not on treatment of pain.
At the very end of life, grab the Doctors often on the terminal sedation back, leaving the patient either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death, putting you to sleep.
We can no longer do so, as if we this page of suffering does not perceive.
Patients without pain relief are becoming more common to have the possibility, to this terminal sedation in the public domain.
Patients whose pain is not relieved, they all say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to have me sleep", but "I would like, that my pain is alleviated".
The realisation of this report was possible due to a Journalismusstipendiums canadian Gesundheitsforschungsinstitute.
Immobilienskandale large scale in Quebec
Officials of the Straßenbauamtes, companies of the Bauhauptgewerbes, Fund raisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia to tell every day, what you have a great "System" to know, in the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso to be involved in.
An "industry", which for the taxpayer Quebec was very expensive, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is strange how the System breaks down, since you drastic measures", quips Jacques Duchesneau, a member of Parliament in Quebec and former head of the police of Montreal.
The scandal was by him due to a thorough investigation of the Veruntreuungen in connection with the contracts to road works in Quebec revealed, the then Prime Minister had agreed only reluctantly.
The "Duchesneau-report" established a direct connection between industry, the secret funding of political parties and corruption of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in the year 2010," he stresses, "would have been alone in the Ministry of transport a billion dollars to the treaties saved", for some, they moved their instinct for your share!
The Charbonneau-Commission "has already two mayor brought down," he adds, in the hope that it succeeds, "the tactics behind the individuals show".
A 2011 launched, permanent Antikorruptionseinheit
The 2011 launched, permanent Antikorruptionseinheit doing with their troops to auditors, to Determine and government analysts also made great efforts.
In addition, the police officers of the "Marteau-force", which since 2009 has done, that the "Kanalisationskartell" of Montreal at the artificial inflation of contracts more cautious going on...
In the last few weeks she has series of house searches carried out and accusations of fraud and corruption against elected local officials, such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte collected, the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, just from his post as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec, has resigned.
He is suspected of, in exchange for public procurement repeated bribes accepted.
Expressly were accused by the way engineers of the Straßenbauamts of Montreal, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has caused quite a stir by the Commission of the operation of the "system" for receiving public contracts has declared.
He has several years of 3% of the value of the Montreal received contracts with the Mafia related intermediary paid the money to the Union Montreal transferred, the party of the mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito has in the 2000s everywhere had a Hand in it, by more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approx. 68.000 Euro) Provinzparteien, especially at the time of the Power of former liberals.
He admitted also, an illegal fundraising for the former liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau to have organized.
Kanalisationsverträge, the cost of it have been artificially bloated
In Montreal was in the "System" of corruption smoothly.
The former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant has this before the Commission described in detail: in ten years, he received from the construction company gifts, invitations to travel, Golf tournaments, Restaurants and ice-hockey Games, as well as bribes in the amount of 736.000 dollars in return for Kanalisationsverträge, whose cost he artificially aufblähte.
Other officials of the Straßenbauamtes admitted that lubricate made by the bills with the wrong benefits artificially by 30-40% aufblähten.
It also has a host of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, Mr. Tremblay accused that he deliberately over a Schattenhaushalt winked, his coffers with black money filled.
As a result of these revelations is Mr. Tremblay at the beginning of November resigned, what of Montreal, in a severe crisis fell.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first deputies of Montreal, which raised the Alarm.
As mayor of the borough of Riviere-des-Prairies, in the East of the island, rejected you from 2010, against the sale of a Gemeindegrundstücks on that for 5 million dollars was acquired and for 1.6 million to property developers in the booming real estate market resold.
70% of black money in election campaigns
Of the investigation, which ultimately will be carried out, said that you "on a theme, which allows the operation of the ants unterwanderten system, to understand the Evil to stop and denounce the culprits".
She says that the procedure is "painful, but positive."
We are in the process of the wound clean, would, however, only for Montreal certain unit of discovery, as well as supervision to a return of the questionable practices to prevent.
How to clean power.
On a regular basis.
Jacques Duchesneau noted in turn that "officials of several Hundred million dollars have been stolen", but, above all, thoughts about the role of the "elected representatives, about the tactics in the picture", if you are not involved in the fraud were!
On the basis of a share of 70% of black money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that this is only a weak imitation of reality."
The government of Quebec suggests that donations to political parties on 100 dollars to limit what according to him, nothing to the Situation would change: "as Long as the campaign spending not strictly limited, dirty money in politics in circulation."
He recommended a complete Revision of the system for the awarding of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "We can't drop deeper; by the things with the courage to go to the bottom, we can get the house on a more predictable Basis with more controls and laws to set up again."
If this story the international Standing of Quebec and the Montreal damages, calls Mr. Duchesneau those who laugh at it, have a look in your own back yard to throw...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season you have with PSG a new extent.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be through a personal insight, but also by the new Dimension of the PSG explain.
Great players have come.
Every day I'm on your side to progress.
The technical staff has also given much.
These items will inspire me every day to my level of play to improve.
And in a game, this is even easier.
In football, everything goes very quickly.
But I break not in enthusiasm.
Since my early days in the centre of preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine up to my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I always have gradually made progress.
You do so by Carlo Ancelotti, introduced competition advantage...
The new signings this summer are accustomed to games at very high level assistance.
You also know that each training session is crucial.
This leads to the fact that a player like me, the forehead has to offer and want to do the Best.
By the way, I Carlo Ancelotti much in terms of my position.
He is Co-trainers such as Claude Makelele supported in the same Position played as I do.
Is Ancelotti is the right Person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti instills all technicians respect.
In Ligue 1, there are currently no comparable Person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has many titles with prestigious Clubs won.
He had contact with great players.
I think that he is in Paris for more win a title.
In January, I have an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time, I had just returned from a Verletzungsserie recovered.
The confidence he placed in me, is also an explanation for my services.
What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?
In Ligue 1, Lyon us the place of the Spitzenreiters taken.
We lurking but in the ambush.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have in this way qualified for the knockout stages.
What is the aim of the Association in this competition?
We will try, as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will be against a very good European teams, our say.
First of all, we want to first of our group in front of Porto, so we have the second leg of the Achtelfinales home game sweep.
The PSG in the short term, a major European club?
He already has the Budget for it...
To a big European club, Paris title win in the long term to make a name.
Today this is not the case.
Financially, the PSG is the means for this project concrete shape.
It would be a big failure, not the title in the Ligue 1 win, like in the last season was the case?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year we are really at the heart of this title prices.
In the last season, we were close.
In may, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to win outright.
We have the season with a very strong performance of the terminated.
We have with 79 points completed.
Normally you should get with 79 points to be masters...
But another team, those of Montpellier, has an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux for the title of the rings, I believe that we have what it takes to win it.
Do you think that the media too much from the PSG expect?
In light of what has been invested and the players that we have, is it normal, that much is expected of us.
We accept completely.
However, when we are at a home game against Troyes 4-0 win, and you still find something you accuse us, this is certainly a bit frustrating.
One wonders what the people expect.
We could never every weekend with a 4-0 win.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We try a game concept to establish.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League we have strength proved.
Look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons creates, for the next round of qualifying, and also the huge spending!
In terms of the invested sums believed you to break with 15 points ahead!
That would mean that our opponents and the French championship disregarded.
Lyon and Marseille, in the last season were not good, were of this new PSG "geboostet".
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we in the month of may, the smiling winner will be, and tell us that we, despite all the difficulties, finally won.
The PSG seems to be completely different from the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic to be dependent.
So much the better, that one of a "Zlatan-dependence" speaks.
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and has a lot of scoring goals.
That is why he came, and he proves that he is the Star of the Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has demonstrated that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the players and the Person.
He respects also the people, who surrounded him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This motivates the Other, your level of play to improve.
Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defender, it allows all Others to make progress.
As you will have the Euro 2012 with the French national team experienced?
As a disappointment.
It was close to my heart, at this EM participate.
Unfortunately for me, my injury prevented from some playing time out.
I have seen things, from which I emerged strengthened am.
Today, I succeed, good matches in the national team to achieve.
This was since my baptism with the "Bleus" my hope.
From what Ukraine has happened, we have our lessons, and today we have an exemplary behavior of the day.
What is your opinion on the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has promising results achieved.
We have a good Position in the selection for the world Cup.
The national coach is strict, is available to the players close and encourages us to victory.
As Laurent Blanc was.
But I would like to no comparison.
Blanc had reached his goal, by joining us for the EM qualified.
I hope that Didier Deschamps the "Bleus" after Brazil.
Is on the 16. October in Spain forced a draw (1:1) an opening match?
This game has given us Confidence.
Everyone has for all the others.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never been a similar game in my career experience.
With Bitcoin is to Pay and Sell without Bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of Central banks, identified transactions and handling charges between the parties Involved.
In addition, as so often in these technologies, a political Vision tangible: the Belief that the current Bankmonopolen crafted monetary system, to financial crises.
In fact, that is by Satoshi Nakamoto (a Pseudonym) invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency (dollars, Euro, etc convertible) as well as a Protocol for the secure exchange such as BitTorrent, that the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network have already been approximately 200,000 transactions.
Some thousands of web sites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the course of Bitcoin in June 2011, a peak of $ 30 (23 Euro) had reached, he fell five months later, on 2 dollars before he today to around ten Dollar has recovered (the courses are available on the website bitcoincharts.com listed).
Nothing particularly Impressive in comparison to the world trade of real-world currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) in an in October, a report published on virtual currencies of interest shown.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in the competition with the Dollar or the Euro," and "similar to the conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, such as the "Credits", which used to be in a video game to move forward, it is possible to Play win or buy (and sometimes also zurücktauschen).
The social network Facebook has also such a System is developed.
However, the trade each Time from a Central authority is checked and edited.
With Bitcoin are all the nodes at the same time, the Depositary of the Rechnungsbuchs, examiners, money issuers, as well as the buyer and the seller.
How does this network?
Any transaction between two users takes place in reality between two E-Mail addresses in the Form of an E-Mail instead.
With the difference that the user for any payment of a change of address can choose what the anonymity.
A number of this transaction-related data is electronically by a double encryption system signed.
In this way, the network can the authenticity of the transaction check.
Using the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoins in the entire network widespread accounting book of the public accounts exist.
The crucial step is to put these new transaction in this book are entered.
This is done using a mathematical task on the computers is launched, with the winner, a kind of preliminary Zentralbankier is, has the privilege of being, this additional line to add.
It is a Fragment of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file in a shorter and unique fingerprint.
The Computer "take" the new transaction and add a number to add, before the Whole "chops".
The goal is to be the one to find a number of special fingerprint (lots of zeros at the beginning).
If this number was found, the other node easily check if it is correct.
The transaction is thus permanently with the chain of all other transactions related, and any modification would the fingerprint change.
If a user with the intention to Defraud two Times very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money to pay for, would be only one of the two transactions from the network will be validated and the other remains without a link, since both have different fingerprints.
The Computer, the task receives 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent Inflation is this reward regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The circulating Bitcoins are thus to 21 million limited, but up to a Hundertmillionstel divisible, what a certain amount of leeway...
In addition, the difficulty of the task with every improvement in the computing power increases.
The life of the network has already UPS and Downs had.
The web sites, services for Bitcoin deploy, were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits stolen.
"Used, the vulnerability does not affect the actual Protocol," says Pierre Noizat, just Paymium has introduced the company for the payment with real money, and the network Bitcoin uses.
The ECB also reported about the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also these shortcomings.
Key actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
Of Others, such as the blogging platform WordPress, you will be accepted.
Recently, Adi Shamir, and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, the book contains analyzed and shown that almost 80% of the Bitcoins not in circulation.
In November, a "Mega-Sale" started.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, for the company Coinabul works, the Bitcoins in Gold converted.
Pierre Noizat, the also the author of a book about this currency is firmly believes in the potential of this technology as Transaktionsnetzwerk.
His System Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin for the validation of the transactions, the cheaper.
In addition, managed by the holder's identity and thus can remain anonymous.
The System can be at the dealers are easy to implement, and the Latter have no new terminal or computer programs to install.
You just need to specify an address, a telephone, "photographed and recognized", Pierre Noizat, assures that he is thousands of users.
There is a General Trend was in the hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontally oriented systems to be reconsidered.
"It will take some time until Bitcoin interspersed, but in 2013, could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, by the way, the different today as a highly respected risks in case of success of this currency to re-evaluate.
We are withdrawn from Afghanistan.
And afterwards?
French troops have their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi) leave.
NATO and the USA are expected by the end of 2014 to follow.
It is time that the Afghan army possession of their territory again take, and that the Afghan population, their future is decided, without all of us to expect.
We have, in particular, the Afghan farmers punished by them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the injured and disabled person.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders, who fled to Pakistan, but often also from farmers, an armed foreign presence, refuse, as to the time of the Soviet Union.
They want their centuries-old and archaic traditions defend, even if you jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks have connected.
Tolerated, sometimes by local insurgents, the Latter no longer be there, if the Western countries are discrete.
The withdrawal of French troops from the base in Nijrab, the I with almond trees, over the hills have observed, the use of French loans was financed, was properly.
The helicopters crossed trucks and tank convoys have reached Kabul, without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no influx of more of the Taliban in Kabul.
Since her irresistible rise from 1994 to 1996, have the conditions changed.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country due to the struggles of the various insurgent groups from the war covered.
Their seizure of power was a kind of liberation and return to safety.
Afghan women have the price for the obscurantism of the organization of Al-Qaida overwhelmed farmers are paid, but their situation has not improved.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban have the common desire, the women in a subordinate Position to hold.
The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war in 2001, again come to Power.
You have to profiteer transformed by plots of the government have seized to you as a land of refugees from Iran and Pakistan to sell and so Benefit from the massive American subcontracting moved.
You have brought into disrepute, and most of them were not even in the Fighting involved.
I like it in the campaigns have heard the wish of the people, a government, not from thieves is composed of.
Many young people want to leave the country, like those of the American contributions to make Use of them, were: the flight of capital is considerable.
The young people have the war and its ideologies tired.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, you have contact with the modern world had, and have their advantages enjoyed.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, of which one-fifth of the total population.
In the cities the state schools is full of girls like boys.
These young people who are neither to the obscurantism of the former parties to the corruption of certain executives want to return, you will be jobs available.
All the armed parties, are possessed of mobile phones; the television with his Turkish series, which is a modern world, will be looked everywhere.
An army is now available.
The authorities, under whose authority they will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already making efforts to the restoration of the militias in the province, which is the Power of the Central government to escape.
Afghanistan, a Land of mountains with strong local identities would have a certain degree of decentralization on the example of the Western Nations will benefit, but by the abolition of the office of the Prime Minister, since the Constitution of 1964 was, the us tried to turn him into a centralized state with a strong Präsidialgewalt.
President Karzaï don't want to foreign controls, in particular on the occasion of the April 2014 elections.
However, his country since the 50s, and already for a long time previously dependent on foreign aid.
Industries were not rebuilt, operational water reservoirs are not present and important irrigation system were not repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruits and vegetables will not produce anything.
The private Initiative is the priority left.
In a country of 30 years of war ruined, would be a state control of the infrastructures have been required.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan's vast natural resources would have.
This will reinforce the impression that the Western countries were, in order to seize.
Without energy, to the iron or copper ore on site to process, and without the means of transport for Export over the mountains is not possible mining.
The Chinese have the copper mine of Mes Aynak already almost out, let the international archaeologists (financed by the world Bank) on the huge Buddhist site of their excavations and remain the most important employers in the province.
One day it will also be necessary to Afghanistan and Pakistan, which is largely the imports and exports are dependent on, and return to normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French troops was at 20. November completed.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls and Jungengymnasien, Department of French at the universities, the French research Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural sector, support for archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, a Service "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of defence (Cimic), the 2012 has been set, in dozens of villages in the numerous non-profit Work and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture carried out and a small French non-governmental organisation carried out in order to try the "hearts and minds to win" and the impossible task of the compatibility of AIDS and offensive actions to achieve.
This Work, a number of local workers were needed, can help to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase of agricultural land.
Which Souvenir we leave for military expenses of two billion euros in return?
A much more modest Budget is to improve the local living conditions contribute in these often at a height of more than 2000 meters-lying valleys are very tough.
In the message are dozens of written requests of small agricultural projects of municipalities of the province of Kapisa has been received.
In order to allow farmers of the foreign groups-led uprising free, what, according to your own statements, you desire, would be the continuation of a small, well-controlled and directly concerning civilian assistance in their favor is required.
A Constitution with a crowbar in Egypt
It is a new poker game of President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt in relation to the constitutional Declaration that it will temporarily unlimited power of attorney granted, more than ever, remains divided, he has decided, all on one card.
To the Surprise of all, he has on Wednesday announced that the constituent Assembly the next day, its final version will adopt.
Just a week had the head of state this plenary two additional months for the completion of his Work is granted.
Egypt relies now for almost two years on a temporary basis, several times amended Text, which the institutional stability weakens and to a legal mess.
This new Initiative has only to an even greater division of the country and taken care of.
For his opponent remains the President in his "autocratic Delirium", by he continues, "his word breaks," and "the right with feet".
On pages of its advocates assures you that there is a way, the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible to end and the process of Transition to accelerate.
Within 14 days should a Referendum be held.
A very short period of time, the brothers forces, on your intention to renounce the Egyptians, the Text section by section to explain.
For the President, it is also a way, his public and democratic legitimacy, to find, during the Protest throughout the country is raging.
According to assertions in an Interview with the American newsreel Time seems Mohammed Mursi convinced that the Egyptians favorably votes.
Especially since the people of Egypt with this to fall back on a hasty vote issued an Ultimatum: "Either it is for my own design, or I keep the unlimited power of attorney", the latter should be after the adoption of the Constitution, supposedly an end.
85 mostly Islamist members of this constituent Assembly have the Text yesterday in a strange atmosphere was adopted.
The majority of the liberals is that the demand is not complied with.
Shortly before the constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they have turned away, because you are of the opinion that they are not able to have their views to the full.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities and civil society alike have acted.
To achieve the quorum were yesterday Morning in haste to 11 persons, Deputy members, added.
Some are Moslembrüdern very close.
It is not surprising that the article mostly unanimously adopted.
The commentators found it by the way, entertaining, that the only difference of the day... in the time for prayer has come, because some members of the Committee were of the opinion that the pendulum clock of the constituent Assembly not exactly went.
The Text that yesterday in the evening is adopted, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2 all the attention, remains, finally, is identical to the Constitution of 1971, and States that "the principles of the Sharia is the main source of Law".
The Salafi parties, for the establishment of Islamic Law, an important requirement is that had the hope that "the principles" by "the rules" to replace what a stricter application would have made.
For the Islamists is the fact that this article has not been changed, a proof of their good will and for their respect towards the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy" reciprocate the liberals, this is only a Propagandaschlag view.
Because according to them, is the Islamization of the Constitution over other items.
They have particularly article 220 in the eye, of the University of Al-Azhar a consultative role to play, particularly in relation to the Verification of the conformity with the laws of the Sharia.
According to the Ägyptenspezialistin Sophie Pommier, this is troubling, because "the persons invited to submit its observations, not elected, and no democratic legitimacy.
You can herein, the first signs of a theocracy, see".
The fears of the liberals are also of the fact that fueled the next rector of this University, far less moderately as the present should be.
"There is currently no specific religious commitment to detect.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most of the lawyers in this Text have worked, are not Ulema, but academics, the part of the French System have been trained", appeased Alexis Blouet, a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian Verfassungstransition writes.
However, he admits that "in relation to the article 220 an ambiguity can be present, because the terms used in the religious vocabulary borrowed from.
One refers here in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic law, the editor d. Ed.].
And in the future, the question might be raised as to the extent to which Zivilrichter are competent to decide."
In addition to its religious aspect of the yesterday Text adopted strong because of its far-reaching powers criticized, he is the President of the Republic granted.
The Moslembrüder argue that these are compared with the former Regime considerably reduced.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the desire of the military is the examination of the defence budget is not submitted to the Parliament, but a national defense Council.
Likewise, there is no prohibition of civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations for the defence of human rights had demanded.
The latter also share their concerns with regard to the Text with that you as a freiheitsbedrohend view.
The offence of blasphemy will be maintained, and insults are now banned, which has serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article is more on the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, is the only positive point the prohibition of torture by article 36.
This word was in the previous Constitution does not contain.
While the Egyptian President yesterday evening in the television voice had, are demonstrations for today afternoon planned.
The supporters of the head of state will be Saturday aufmarschieren.

The Dead sea is even warmer and there is all year round bathed.
By the way, is this unusual sea with a layer of 417 meters below the sea level at the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise water has a high salt content, and thereby contributes even non-swimmers easily on the surface.
The surrounding countryside is indescribably beautiful.

"The great and mighty" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While members of Parliament and civil rights activists to discuss, what is the Use of the law on compulsory language tests for migrants bring Criminal act already with fake certificates
Every year, 13 million workers after Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money for the upkeep of the home remaining families to earn.
On 1. December was a law in force, which provides that any migrant worker a Test, the knowledge of the Russian language, certified, must discard one of them.
Previously, this provision only for migrants who are in the service sector, in the municipal housing industry and in the retail want to work.
However, should the Tests with the time, according to the Federal migration authorities in the future, for all migrant workers to duty.
One must not only language tests, but also Tests in the Russian history and the basics of the legislation drop.
Language skills both for the receipt as well as the extension of the work permit has to be demonstrated.
Exceptions apply only for the citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language.
Also by this law excluding persons, their Ausbildungszeugnisse and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Sense of the issues and the protection of the rights
The whole of the regulatory Agency will be under the Aegis of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian language, the Russian University of people's friendship, Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can the Tests in all the cities of store; already were in Russia already more than 160 corresponding centers opened.
The Initiative for the introduction of the testing was made by the deputies of the state Duma and the Federal migration authorities supported.
Civil libertarians, however, presented before the entry into force of the law in the press several times the following question: What does the Whole thing?
What changes will bring the regulation, language skills, to demonstrate the need, both for the Russians as well as for the workers?
Especially, counter spokesman for the migration authorities, the question, the number of forced laborers to decrease.
"A lot of talk now about the protection of the rights of migrant workers", says the head of the representation of the Federal migration authorities in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
Their rights must, however, already before their departure to be protected.
Only an organized recruitment is 90% of the problems of foreign workers to solve.
Encounter problems migrants without occupation, education, language skills and medical examination.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrants without language skills necessarily people with bad intentions to meet him under the pretext of the help in a dark, narrow barrack stuck, where he worked with dozens of his peers months without food and documents to wait 12 to 14 hours on the day of toil.
Us achieve many of the complaints of our migrants.
"In the home will make you A promise, and on arrival you will be scammed, get their passports taken and does not receive the promised reward", confirmed by the head of the main Directorate for labour migration of Tajik migration authorities, Tolib Schwaripow.
Do not scold, boss!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, in Russia you want to make money, too, that not only the language of the destination country does not dominate, but also in their own language hardly in writing expressions.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as much as the Evil: Only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can also only a reasonable primary education afford.
Because in their families, there is still not even have the money, to feed the children, let alone, you decent clothes, shoes and school Supplies to buy.
As a Teenager to take these children then immediately the first opportunity to make money.
"It is difficult without language skills", give it to.
"You feel degraded and inferior."
Civil rights activists emphasize respect of the law following important aspect.
The Test must only migrants with a legal Status drop.
They have this Status does not, so there is no check and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, holds the majority of the migrant workers continues to be illegal in Russia.
"Welcome" or "access to Unauthorized persons is prohibited"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy in Russia an official Status.
The reason there are bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the language difficulties.
In addition, the cost of the legalization of money: 12 to 16 Thousand rubles.
A fake registration, you can quickly and only for one and a half Thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly fake and we are not a registered user, and arise from then, cases of extortion.
"You want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea", says the Tadschike Umed Huschkadamow to journalists.
"Just no cost for false papers shy"
Already on the day on which the law entered into force, it turned out that not only the Registrierungsdokumente of migrants be a fake.
Some of the fake certificates, the completion of the tests to certify were already of the employees of the Federal migration authorities beschlaggenommen.
The fake papers have an ordinary color printer printed.
Of course, received the new owner of this for a good reason: Every Migrant, the hoped, so the Tests to spare, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as much as the cost for the official Test: This costs a migrant workers three thousand rubles.
Moreover, that the most important immediate task of the System against corruption, to protect, so the certificates will not be easily purchased, are both public officials as well as civil rights activists agree.
For the Moment, the authorities of the guest-workers, the first Time through the Test fast, just promise that you have time for a Sprachgrundkurs.
In addition, newcomers without language skills Authorities in areas in which there is no active communication with people is necessary.
The Ministry of the interior ignored illegal Waffenmarkt
Share of legal weapons in crime is extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the interior plans to the aggravation of the firearms act for private gun owners.
This is the reaction of the authorities on the recent events: injured in gunfire at weddings, as well as seven Dead at the rampage of the Moscow lawyers Dmitry Winogradow.
The police want to Wear non-lethal weapons in the Public prohibit and the age for the possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years of increase.
The proposal of the Chairman of the Duma Committee on security and the fight against corruption, Irina Jarowaja, support and promised that the Amendments to the weapons act in a nutshell the Duma, will be presented.
Not all are happy that the Russian authorities to the problems of "attraction of the screws" want to fight.
The Internet was an open letter published, its author - the representatives of different Waffenverbände - the authorities are claiming, "it is senseless tightening of the rules" to take distance.
The percent of crimes registered weapons is very low, expressed the criminal lawyer , Vasiliy Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC.

The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners Criminals do not discourage, to the black market to operate.
Currently, the authors suggest that in Moscow every possible weapon for little money.
Meanwhile, stresses the Ministry of the interior, that the spread of illicit weapons is under control.
Supplier: from the factories to the officers

There are five main channels, told a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, the ten years in the Ministry and in the General staff was employed.
Screenshot of a web page that accepts Waffenbestellungen
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. Weapons during the fighting in the Caucasus have been stolen.
"The weapons were both of the Russian officers as well as the Caucasians, even stolen," says Baranez.
On the second channel of illegal weapons, the police of Criminal stolen.
Baranez explains that these weapons include, both from the armouries of the police, as well as directly by the employees of the law enforcement agencies have been stolen.
Further illegally sold weapons come from military arms caches.
Many military camps there was often a lot of explosions.
"There is evidence that in some cases, arson was, for the Lack of weapons to cover up," says the former military personnel.
A contribution to the black market to afford according to Baranez the arms manufacturers.
"Today, there are countless private Rüstungsfabriken, the international competition does not withstand, and therefore the weapons under the Hand on the black market, such as in Moscow, squander," said the expert.
Another channel of the black market smuggling is.
Especially a lot of pistols and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a own, sometimes craft production, and a Mafia, the smuggling organized," explained the former military personnel.
What is the origin of the weapons?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels of delivery of the black market in illegal arms about.
In 2011, a report from the centre for problem analysis and state administration submitted.
The experts analyzed reports of the Ministry of the interior and the Federal service for state statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data on portals on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons dates back to the investigators, according to the army and the Rechtsschutzbehörden.
Half of all weapons on the black market were there by the "guilt of those responsible, in their work with weapons have to do," says the report.
The data of the researchers, according to originate 17% of the weapons out of conflict zones, 14% go on thefts in the production of weapons back, and 5% originate from illegal excavations.
A salesperson of a Waffenladens that is not mentioned by name wants to be assured that weapons in illegal excavations to be found, long time, no one buys because they are obsolete.
According to him, it is more likely that the dealer supplies in a weapons cache to get that.
A warrant officer is a weapon, for example, a gun-type TT, purchased.
The weapon is being issued and by the fence pass.
"The dealer brings the weapon into the town, and sold it for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says
"The police know, of course, about all of it and leads therefore, if you Plan to the detection of crime do not meet periodically Kontrollkäufe with dealers, illegal weapons," adds the salesperson.
"How in the Luxusladen"
Buyers and sellers will find the most well Known to each other.
I had web sites and Blogs viewed as someone noticed me and I suggested to the Station "Begowaja", where a Person would wait for me, the me to a certain place would be where we are then, the price could negotiate.
The price for the weapon, I have learned just there
Militärkommentator Viktor Baranez
"In order to find a weapon, I need a friend, contacts," said the salesman. "I have such a friend, but I trust him not".
There are traders in the markets, but there you have to go and with a Code to arrange such as "Ivan Ivanovich, the position, that the daughter lost a Tooth."
I'm currently even to some of the knuckles of a friend, whom I trust.
He gives me the knuckles also, only because he knows that I can't verpfeife.
Newcomers to search for weapons in different Ways.
The former military Viktor Baranez tried in the mid-1990s as a buyer of illegal weapons, as he is an article on this subject I wrote.
The Schemas have according to him, is not changed.
He got a photo album, in which "everything is Possible" was shown.
"I felt like I was in Luxusladen", recalls the military.
The buyer gets loud Baranez not the cat in the Sack, but you can try it all.
I, as a potential customer to buy not only easy, but go with the seller in the forest, and there we put a target on.
"I can go there and shoot, and if I am convinced that the weapon a good shot, we negotiate with each other", describes the expert of the procedure.
Shopping from your Sofa
Internet search engines display search results to web pages and groups in the "Vkontakte", where weapons "for different purposes".
There are no any paperwork required nor is it a personal Meeting.
"You only need to have the appropriate sum of money", it is said in the advertisement on the website of the "Kampfpistole or rifle to buy".
There, users specify your orders and requests.
Will also be sold to minors?
"Of course, without a license," asks users to "Ivan" (direct quote).
"Buy a DD. Moscow," was the laconic request of the "Fedorenkow".
The Federal security service turned off Recently countless Scheinwebseiten, and the purchaser, the weapons wish to purchase, go to the service abound on the web.
The people are as hungry fish feeding and end up in Siberia and must coal shovels
Militärkommentator and former Militärangehöriger Viktor Baranez
I have the following scheme: The site is normally registration in foreign countries, and Russian laws do not apply.
The managers take the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via an ATM machine.
"As the answer he receives a photo and a description of the blind, the weapon", reported the press Secretary of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitry Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stresses that you finally end up empty handed and behind bars can come, if you have a request placed on a web page.
The Federal security service turned off Recently countless Scheinwebseiten, and the purchaser, the weapons wish to purchase, go to the service abound on the web.
"The people like hungry fish feeding and end up in a Siberian labor camp, and must coal shovels," he says.
A Makarov for 100 US dollars
When buying illegal firearms is, according to experts, with prices ranging from 100 to 900 US dollars is to be expected.
According to Dmitry Kislow of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can get a gun of the type Makarov for 100 to 300 dollars to buy.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is in military arms caches of supervisors middle-level output.
The official statistics of the Ministry of interior according to which, the number of crimes related to illegal weapons in Russia as a whole, in the period from January to October 2011 to 7% on 22.9 Thousand, while the number of detected cases of theft and extortion, in connection with weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices by 7.8% shrank.
In the United States to strike Fast Food and supermarket Workers
Every fourth American teenagers sitting at some point behind the counter of Mc Donald's
In the past few days it came anywhere in the United States to massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and Restaurants popular Fast-Food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Still, no one can predict whether the protests still continuing to swell, or whether you again soon running out of breath.
The protests by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations supported.
In addition to the modest increase in the wages of simple Walmart - and Fast-Food workers pursue the organizers of the protests that aim to form trade unions.
So far this sector of the economy hardly unionised.
46 Cents in the year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called Black Friday, the USA sales took place, the millions of customers anlockten, which was sometimes to the Handgemengen led.
On this day, put some Walmart employees, of which it is globally 2.2 million, your work down, and bestreikten together with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, whose target group is people in low and middle income.
Walmart sells all the products, diapers about hunting rifles, and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart stores is, on average, between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, buy many of the slightly paid Walmart employees at the workplace.
The prices and the range of goods made Walmart to one of the largest companies in the United States.
Critics, Walmart the goods are often the only reason why so cheap to sell, because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain of severe working conditions, for example, lack of forklift truck or hand-held scanners.
The participant of the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their Anger about the contribution to the company's own health insurance from 30 to $ 100 a month had increased.
A typical Wal-Mart employees, the 9.5 U.S. Dollar an hour deserves, could this increase can't afford it, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley prove that if the company the average wage on 12 Dollars an hour, it Walmart 3.2 billion Dollars would cost.
These are approx. 1,1% more than now for wage donations.
Would Walmart increases are completely on the customer to kill cost of each purchase you will only 46 cents more.
Per year would be for you in comparison to today expenditure of only 12,39 Dollars.
Proponents of Walmart provide satisfactory, that it is only in nine States to protests and this the company no losses brought.
The Black Friday took in his Shop from 8 o'clock in the evening on Thursday until midnight the next day, and in this period Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, the Walmart cash on "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The spokesman of the company, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an Interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington Post that, overall, "fewer than five" Walmart employees the work down and the action of protest is "just another PR Trick" of the Union, the protests organized, had been.
"Free Cash!"
The protests went this week in New York, where your aim is not, however, Wal-Mart stores (in this advanced city not desired and, therefore, so far non-existent), but McDonald's and other low-priced Restaurants.
McDonald's says that the company sell a billion servings, and yet you have no sick time, and you will for your honest work is not paid!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York city Council
Currently, the minimum wage in accordance with Federal and New York legislation at 7.25 Dollar an hour.
In Fast-Food Restaurants is the minimum wage gradually raised, but not too strong, and on average, get your easy employees in New York 8,90 U.S. Dollar an hour.
Less than you deserve no one in this expensive city.
How it is possible, in New York with a little money to get along, is beyond me.
There was once a time in almost a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald's behind the counter stood, however, the young people lived with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw it as the main source of income, or planning a longer stay there.
Now meet me in Interviews with employees of McDonald's constantly people who complain that you pay to get along, and sometimes even their children to feed.
On the other hand, there are in the Forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal published a comment, whose author points out, it was irresponsible to have children, if you do not know, how you want to eat it.
The participants of the protest on Thursday at 6 : 30 in the morning in front of the McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue began, demanded that the cashier and chefs of Fast-Food Restaurants, a minimum wage of US $ 15 the hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage corresponds to.
They demanded to continue the formation of trade unions in the Fast Food industry.
U.S. law prohibits the corporate governance, this is an objective way to stand and trade Union activists warn or to dismiss.
On the other hand, the corporate governance, it is not easy.
The establishment of trade unions in the Fast Food industry, but also for objective reasons difficult.
The most important reason is the high staff turnover.
Dissatisfied
The loud protests, there was on this day in front of many other Fast-Food Restaurants in Manhattan.
The peak of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of the McDonald's at Times Square, where some local Democrats languages, including Stadtratsmitglied Jumaane Williams, said: "McDonald's says it will sell a billion servings, and yet you have no sick time, and you will for your honest work is not paid!"
The protesters were also of other prominent New York Democrats supported, for example, Bürgermeisterkandidat Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should work together in the Fast-Food employee support, so you can just receive wages and economic prosperity can reach every New Yorkers deserve!".
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the US-American Fast-Food industry.
However, there were only a few Hundred people on the ground, of which by Far not all the Fast-Food industry in New York tens of thousands of work.
Still, it is not clear whether the spark of these protests whole mass will mobilise.
"The brain can so far only moderately outwit"
The followers of modern technologies popular topic of augmented reality in the last time, usually through the lens of a special glasses perceived.
First presented to Google in the summer at its annual conference will be a working model, in November was then announced that Microsoft also a corresponding Patent had logged in.
In an interview with the head of the group for interactive 3D-technologies in the Microsoft lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it is apparent, however, that the glasses for the scientists of the company's only a way station was.
You are intrigued by the possibility of virtual objects into the air with his bare hands to manipulate and virtual spaces to create.
- Please describe briefly the research your group operates.
- We deal with the interaction of man and machine, with the aim, however, the limitations of this interaction expand.
So far, mankind is mostly in the Phase stuck in with the pixels on the flat screens working, sometimes also to be touched.
However, we want to 5-10 years of vorausblicken and the radical changes in this interaction to predict.
For example, the Xbox console and the Xbox Sensors progress, and today is no Xbox without Kinect sold, since all for motion control are interested in.
- What awaits us in the future?
- Although Kinect the interaction on a physical level, plays a lot of things on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the System receives more data) could be improved, the output is not yet critical.
We try to change, work on real three-dimensional Darstellungssystemen on the basis of different technologies, including projections.
We have the world in our physical world are discharged and they are comprehensible.
For this purpose it is necessary that not only the users, but also its environment is detected.
Then we could the real world much easier by virtual objects Supplement.
And, first of all, we should be this stupid Virtual Reality helmets to get rid of!
- What do you think about voice control?
It is popular, but it is not overrated?
- It is certainly not the Allzwecklösung, since you have questions about the privacy issues, because you are not getting any bystanders about his actions and intentions would like to inform.
In fact any kind of interaction with computers is good, however, each in their particular niche.
For example, we worked in the field of control of objects in public places in a project in which we have a short and concise, instead of sweeping Gestures experimented.
The Gestures are not of the Objektkamera, but from a bracelet recorded the movements of the muscles and bones registered.
It is still relatively large, could, in theory, however, on the size of a wristwatch be reduced.
But overall, the future belongs to, however, mixed types of controls, for example, Gestures, and language.
- How come?
- We would me ask you this Sprudeldose to be rich?
You say it and point at the same time.
- Usually I say it simply.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to detect.
- Does that mean you want that the user can log on to the contours of what a machine at any given time can afford and what is not?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that we will in the next time, especially on the development of new types of sensors work will need to allow for the reactions of people to more accurately capture.
This can, for example, laser sensors, as in the depth of a good resolution offer, which is very important.
- What are the demands set on the basis of their work with the Xbox Xbox Sensors in modern cameras?
There is a lack of resolution, depth, or something else?
- The current Generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, would be 8 mega pixels with a speed of 1000 fps not bad.
But the main thing are not the Megapixel itself, but rather the quality of the Matrix and the depth.
From this point of view all the current technologies for us, not good enough, because the developers of the Algorithms have more work to do.
It is not only the resolution along the X - and the Y-, but also along the Z-axis to be taken into account.
Also the speed and the number of images per second are important.
The movements of the people are extremely dynamic and frankly, current 30 fps, in particular, for Gestures too little.
Stephen Betishes developed in our lab in Redmond a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay between 1 to 100 milliseconds, where the present-day commercial Sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand how much of the interaction of man and machine is affected.
For my work I needed just such a device, only without the touch and with more frames per second.
Should the number of cameras not be increased?
- Kinect is currently working with three "cameras", where one of them is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected Signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB-camera.
It is not intended for calculation of the object depth.
More cameras could possibly solve the Problem...
Or the Problem intensifies as more calculations are necessary.
Would be nice to be a flexible, Xbox similar System, in which we have a different Kameraneigungen could play, to see how we in the three-dimensional determination of a Position helps.
- If I remember right, presented by Microsoft, in contrast to Google his glasses to the Public.
Do you not think that in terms of the application of the technology of augmented reality in everyday life, the glasses, the best prospects?
- Of course it is not pleasant, out of a Smartphone in the raised Hand to hold, but I think the following: The best variant would be a "changing" augmented reality, when we have a Cloud of the glasses on the Smartphone switch could
The glasses is a personal Gadget and therein lies their strength (Private, only you can see), but also their weakness, because an enhanced reality by means of glasses to prevent that, together with the Other virtual objects can work.
- Let us imagine for a Moment that the Manipulation of virtual holograms in the air not only Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also accessible to mere mortals.
There is a Problem, on the critics of this idea is often to point out: There is no sensible response!
The hands feel nothing at all!
What are the answers want your group to this objection?
- In my Lectures I speak often of the fact that the reality of the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough may well be the Integration of the tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second-Hand as something unusual Projektionsunterlage.
It takes print perfectly true!
But there are also technologies that actually are geared to the "images in the air" is something Tangible to give, for example, creates the interference of some targeted Ultraschallstrahlen in a certain point, where the Finger is, a feeling that at the moment but still so weak, as someone blew over the knuckles.
There are also bands for the wrist, on the endings in the fingers impact, this is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried the brain to outwit?
It think that it can feel, what to feel it should, if it is just something that looks?
- This is a good idea, so we have not tried it yet.
Here lies a further task, with the us for a long time have to fight to be, namely a person who is physically present in a closed room, believe he was, instead, in an open, practically infinite space; here, we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), moving platforms, as well as large balls.
So far it is the brain only moderately outwit, and we still have many busy years.
This makes the work in the field of virtual reality for a researcher so appealing: On many subjects, we are only at the beginning.
Own taste in lieu of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt is implementing the project "St. Petersburg avant-garde", the citizens is dedicated to the avant-garde of culture and art form.
On the select list landed already high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, the success of which is beyond the borders of the city, and often recognition in Europe, not in the Rest of Russia to be known.
The new Hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the Red-clad Bearded, once at the Russian Museum, once during the summer garden, times at the scene or on exhibitions there.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller also be issued, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg socially-philosophical artists, the new myths created.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg avant-garde at the end of the 80s, respectively. At the beginning of the 90s.
He is also a man of the city, and conjures up by his presence on the road to his fellow citizens a Smile on your face and provide you a good mood.
Recently, he grabbed a barrel-organ, and became the Petersburg street organ players, since it is for this challenging role with regard to his Künstlerdasein, his philosophy, and his Image, we are finally ready felt.
- Kirill, why are you always in Red and not, for example, in Yellow and turquoise in the city on the road?
I have the color Red as a fashion designer, with the look and Image of deals.
In this world, Red is the compromise between the artist, image consultants and society.
In the society gets everything, what some of the Graunorm differs, aggression and bad behavior.
But I want by my provocations with the people into the conversation.
Each of my recent provocations was an invitation to the conversation.
- When did you know that you are a painter need to be?
- At an exhibition in the Nevsky Palace of culture, in my Works were displayed.
I realized that I go this way.
Then was the time of the ancient free, however, not officially recognized painter at that time to the end, and the new and free painters like I were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the artists of the new Generation, so with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; this resulted in "Pushkinskaya 10", and then was once an end.
It takes me to a theatre, fashion, music, actually, to all, except the literature.
And all this is United in your Art-clinic... - It was important to me, in the center of the Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists congregate.
In the year 1995 hour I a space in the Pushkinskaya 10, and there was up to the renovation of a musical-artistic club for the Boheme, the house of the St. Petersburg Boheme.
Many of them were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember, like a cord with his project "Ucho Van Goga" came there.
Cord and his friends sang simple songs to the Play-back, wearing tight shirts and among them was also the now fashionable composer Igor Wdowin.
As the group began to play live, was out of it "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of the "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and there began his great career, but the principles he learned in the us.
Also the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origin in the Art clinic.
Went there for our staff and regulars.
I am a Hero of the last century, as a culture still meant something.
In the year 2000, there were in the press survey, when it comes to the award of "personalities of our city".
I won in the category "artist of the year", and so I was at the peak reached.
It is not easy, in the new times, according to old rules to work; I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
At the present time, it is easy to be famous, but the culture and popularity are not the same thing: You can be famous, without a cultural contribution.
Your Works have a distinctive style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and bring clearly the timeliness and clarity of the thoughts expressed.
I'm going to an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and prepares fear to be that way.
In a Clown blurred all and loses its tragedy.
I love the Grotesque, and I've grotesque ideas.
We save, for example, the world, we require that each fully to dress up.
Now pays each on the clothes and is based on the Outer and the Inner of the people.
But perhaps you may a people not to shake the Hand, but he should spit in the face.
The illusion disappears through the Dress.
- Recently we saw you in the role of urban Drehorgelspielers. - A city of culture should be as a hero.
Who, if not I?
- Can also commercial art to be beautiful?
- These days, commercial art, careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the collapse of the cultures.
Earlier, formed the people of big groups: The Bohemians loved the One and the simple people of the Other.
Now, there are Mikrogemeinschaften, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not one hundred-dollars-Note that appeals to everybody.
Now you need to consider who you like will.
Now everyone has cult star about 100 followers.
- The performances of the Stas Mikhailov come but several Thousand!
- To come to him deserted women, plays in the sexually-social sphere a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 persons and 10 Thousand, consequently, there are fewer Management, money, and all perish.
I have the trailer, and the most Important thing is for you not to cheat and Reached not to destroy it.
In my youth I used these pictures to be painted, the case of a collector, even in a row with the works by Falk and Larionov hung.
I began with images normally only at the end of the career.
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.
It means: spiritual culture, and culture.
Consumption has absolutely no culture, which is something quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with the artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and money refused to paint.
This is the culture I am advocating.
- Kirill, what is missing Petersburg?
- Good Culture Experts.
One says: servant of the culture.
However, not all of them can deal with culture.
The real Tsar was different, because the Tsar understood may not be much of a culture, but they understood that the right experts are necessary.
In Moscow, there are currently good adviser.
In St. Petersburg we have what, the experts could be, but you, the way is blocked, because it hochrangigerer experts demand that the Former properly evaluate them and clear the way.
Now it is only your own taste.
The same is true for the Erarta, however, with the difference that you honestly say that you are not all contemporary art accept and some painters therefore, other museums have to search.
- What is available for you to Petersburg?
Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow, there are much more culture and a suitable breeding ground.
On our stones, art is difficult to grow.
We need a cultural soil, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is still not right.
In Europe there are many curious people, exhibitions or concerts.
In the us are much less.
Art must again be modern, as well as to the beginning of the last century.
The project is from grants of the city of Saint Petersburg financed
Birth in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with Killerasteroid.
Caravans of ships with people of planet earth to embark on the search for a Ersatzplaneten.
To save humanity, poses the important question of how we in the weightlessness, or on the Ersatzplaneten can reproduce?
Many choices there are in my opinion not.
De facto, there are only two real planet, we at least hypothetically could inhabit.
"Mars and Venus", says the scientific staff of the Sternberg Astronomical Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars comparatively Pro, there are on the surface of Venus at a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would be only in large amount, or in the orbit of Venus, so in All possible.
The question of reproduction in All treated the researchers first in terms of the Flora.
Already half a century before were experiments with plants is carried out.
The fourth Generation of the in Orbit cultivated peas does not differ in the least from the terrestrial species.
It was followed by the breeding of insects, specifically by tiny fruit fly (Drosophila), in Orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into outer space, in order to explore how the microgravity on the development of Embryos effect.
It develops a normal chick.
But then, the Problem begins.
"The Problem is that the chick Just have to find it; it must be on his legs and start to move forward," explains the head of the laboratory of the Institute for medical and biological problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without a solid ground began to spin the Chicks wild.
Ten hours later stumpften the instincts of the newborn.
The Chicks did not react to light and Loud.
Four days later, they died then simply.
"Twice we left the Chicks hatch and made the Whole thing, simply because it is impossible for there to work with them," believes Vladimir Sychew to the failed Experiment with the chick at All.
The last Brutkäfig with animals flew 16 years ago in the Orbit.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments continued.
However, on the Biosatelliten "Bion" only same-sex species.
It was an Experiment with rats, the already fertilized sent into space.
In principle, it was nothing Special is established.
"That was just with the Biosatelliten, but again it was only a single Experiment, and the research must be continued", noted Vladimir Sychew.
After landing got the Weltraumratten offspring.
The problems of the reproduction right in space, you can not solve the problem.
The task is difficult.
Animals from their natural habitat to be torn, you can simply your reproductive drive not follow.
In contrast to animals, man could the principle.
Homo sapiens is to Think in the abstract capable and can have a similar emotional Background to create.
From ethical Considerations, such experiments are not carried out.
However, women are already flying since 50 years in space.
The biggest risk, there Tereschkowa.
The most Valuable thing mankind possesses is the female organism.
Our Seagull flew away, and no one on the earth would have to answer the following question: can Withstand the space flight?
It is after this flight a child into the world?
"After all, no one answered this question," says Raumfahrtveteran Vakhtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, only a year after her space flight, gave birth to the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereschkowa, a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, gave birth to the second woman in space, Svetlana Savitskaja, which twice in Orbit, and even Work outside of the spacecraft performed, a son.
However, still remains a risk.
We have only very few cosmonauts, where after long flights, everything went well and you healthy were young.
"The more, the more dangerous it is for flights into Orbit," concludes cosmonaut Valery Polyakov, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet, the mankind must for new Ways in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial Gravitation are looking for.
The Hydrolabor in Vorbereitungszentrum of cosmonauts is a mandatory Station during the flight preparation.
Here, in a state of uncertainty win the cosmonauts Routine for the work in open space.
The water represents the weightlessness.
Even if adults water as a pleasant experience, it is a foreign environment; however, infants perception of water as a natural Element.
It is as if the small Ichtyander testify, that the life of the country stepped out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child about 9 months in the womb of the mother in the amniotic fluid is, and that it is easier for water to get used to.
In principle, this is logical, because from birth up to the first Swim just 2 weeks.
"This is too little time to do something to forget", says Babyschwimmlehrerin Marina Aksenowa.
While for a newborn child weightlessness so a much more natural condition, the woman is not without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness forms the abdominal and pelvic muscles very fast back and this also increases the ability of the child to say.
Well, we can avoid this by geburtseinleitende AIDS.
The birth could also, for example, in a Spezialkammer take place around the child to say.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant matter of Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, does a child need also artificial gravity.
Without the earth's gravity to feel the organism, the skeleton and the muscles do not develop.
A newborn child can be in Orbit, not as an adult Training in a Belastungsanzug be plugged in.
It is simply the absence of what his life is of vital importance.
"This Experiment, which together we make, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to a disabled person, a totally non-conformist people to the world will bring," says the head of the Bioethikkommission of the Institute for medical and biological problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in the universe is mere theory.
At some point, but it is reality, if the man of the earth in their spaceships to a distant planet to leave the home for her in the All-born descendants.
NKÚ-chief: control of the Black-system failed due to the fault of politics
The Czech Republic has in connection with public contracts, on good Policing and adequate laws, but in their application.
In the conversation for, Welcomes says this is the Vice-President of the Highest Kontrollamtes (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and I think this is not the case for us," commented Kala the current Situation.
A similar result is apparently a common control by Czech and German examiner.
As a negative example, he leads the setting of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to suction. "Black-System".
Recently told the Prime Minister that the ODS, the entrepreneur does not have controls that would harass - the System is now prohibited or allowed?
"A law must however, its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then you can not just the heads of government, and the Kontrollamt, whose duty of the control of the observance of the law is, in its activity hinder", provides Kala.
At the meeting of the audit Committee of the chamber of deputies, they spoke about a joint Czech-German project, in the framework of the laws of both countries with regard to public contracts were compared.
What was it exactly?
It is a parallel audit, with which we started some two years ago.
Simply put, it is a matter that the European legislature determines how public procurement to handle. This is the Foundation of the national legislation. And finally, there are the actual practical application.
All of this, we have compared to each other, and although the inspection is not completed, we were able to very interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws in the us, maybe even a little bit "strict and perfect", the actual application, however, is in Germany, in a number of parameters better.
This confirms that it is not sufficient, always new and more detailed rules. You must also with the actual application of the Right deal.
To what extent can the project be of help? What emerges from this project?
Just such a common control that could help us to stop us constantly to perfect the laws and the reduction and Balancing of thresholds to try, if this does not appear to be particularly positive effect.
Efficiency means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) to purchase and illicit enrichment or even criminal acts to exclude.
But the lowering of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal.
Perhaps it is even so that we, the System in this way only with excessive "paperwork" charge, and those who are gaps in the System, it will be much easier for the System to take advantage of, as if the thresholds are higher remained.
You talk about the problems with the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law.
How does the monitoring system in Germany?
There is a similar authority, such as our NKÚ, or the System works differently?
What the authorities concerned, as is the German equivalent to the NKÚ the Federal court of audit, the similar structure is as it is and also about a quorum, which is only slightly different is formed. Generally, both authorities, however, are similar.
The competences are to a certain extent, comparable, although Germany is, however, a Federal state, which means that this audit offices also in the individual Federal States are - this is what distinguishes the German System of our.
The BRH may only Federal control what our state funds equivalent.
Public funds, at us from the districts and municipalities are managed, are subject to the control of the courts of auditors.
What the German legislation is concerned, is the simpler than ours?
In General, I would do this without concrete information is reluctant to compare. However, in Germany, in some ways, often as a model referred to, although you certainly can't say that Germany in particular, is better.
Is it because that there examiners are better?
That certainly is not, but as I said: Such comparisons, I may not particularly like.
This is still, it should be noted that even those countries, which are an example for us, also have to deal with problems.
Otherwise you would have nothing to work with our authority, isn't it?
What the Czech legislation is concerned, what was the significance of your authority in the amendment of the procurement law, do you feel any impact?
Considering that this amendment only a short time in power, it seems to be in our tests so far have not.
Since our controls subsequently take place, you have to do here with a certain delay is expected.
Impact we feel far more in the preparation of future checks - so we have the new mechanism of control "detection of risks of inefficiency" and with this almost 14,000 public contracts reviewed and analysed here are the Changes, of course, have an impact, since the threshold values change, the conditions for certain types of calls for tenders have been modified, etc.
You will see the adoption of this law is rather positive, or is the System with further burdened by bureaucracy?
I think that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption is confirmed.
However, there may be the Problem, that the rules of "strict" and no longer can be met.
Under the previous rules are a test constitutes persons with regard to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational program of regional policy, the regional Council), accountable to the effect that any non-compliance with the procurement law for a breach of discipline).
It is then reasonable to the law is even stricter to make?
In my opinion, not in this way.
The System must be the ones to exclude the System to attack and misuse want to, and does not punish those who have a formal errors have been committed, on the actual decision-making has no effect.
Such a System requires only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where is the way out?
We say, first of all, what is not required.
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS, the entrepreneurs with inspections of the sog. "Black-system" would bother - what does that mean exactly?
Is the Black-System is now prohibited or allowed?
A law must however, its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then you can not just the heads of government, and the Kontrollamt, whose duty of the control of the observance of the law is, in its activity hinder.
He can say: "We change the law and allow the thing," but he can't say that we do so, as if nothing was the matter.
The Vergabegesetz contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain operations - and that is for the protection of the public contest correctly.
On the other hand, it is also tragic, if the bidder with the best deal solely because of formalities have to be excluded.
The law will never be perfect, but it needs to be properly applied and that is what we, in my opinion, is missing.

Šimon Ornest: On our concerts we want to positive energy collect
What do you think about that in less than a month of the end of the world is supposed to take place?
This is one of those disaster reports, on which we humans are so happy to pounce.
With our Band The Tap Tap to make us more about fun and say that we are the only Band in the world are enough positive energy can use to collect the end of the world to stop or prevent.
In December realize there is also a unique project, with three concerts against the end of the world.
You can get to our readers the project closer to imagine?
It is a national charity, we have already been two years in the planning.
For this, we want the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar to use, the end for the 21. December at 11:10 am in the morning forecast.
The day before, i.e. on 20. December, find from 21:00 o'clock at the same time, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts will be in approximately the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone to 12 hours before us is that the Mayan calendar ends.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally from me, then we have the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta developed.
Here, we would not only sufficient positive energy, to collect the end of the world to prevent, but we also want to be together with the Public think about it, the condition in which this world once our children to pass.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have a unique collection of shoes, T-Shirts, bags and key fobs against the end of the world to be developed, with their purchase over www.e-tap.cz the people also can support.
The Band the Tap Tap, together with other artists also the so-called. Anthem against the end of the world with the title "end of the world falls out."
Today is the anthem on YouTube is very popular. It is also to the benefit concerts, resound?
Of course, in the very end, assuming that all goes well and the doomsday will not take place...
The anthem is supposed to be from all of the performers on all three concerts at the same time, are sung.
In addition, the hymns together in a direct circuitry by the Czech television broadcast live.
The Text of the anthem comes from Tomas by HANAK, who is also the main character of Jesus in the video clip is playing, also Xindl X sings with...
How are they to the cooperation with the two of them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which related to the fact that we have many Fund-raising events and concerts...
We strive to keep these people intensively in our projects.
It has been shown, that the majority of working with us are interested, and have some fun with it.
What is the purpose of coming to the proceeds from the concerts against the end of the world benefit from this?
For the establishment of a barrier-free educational centre Studeo, we had been six years, together with the Association Tap in the Jedlička Institute work.
The students of the Jedlička Institute regularly editors looked after them in different activities to help.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to the editors to visit, we want to give you this way to help.
In the context of the completion of the Jedlička Institute is supposed to be a private building, in which we then use this project to move in.
At each concert will encounter several groups and performers.
According to what criteria have you chosen?
We wanted a program to compile all generations, including children appeals.
In Prague occur, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiri Suchy.
All the details are on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "major events" is also planned for the future?
In may, we get for the first Time during the Prague spring, and also for this concert, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to be in the Czech house in New York occur, and I personally, as if we had time, in the USA - this would also be happy with performances in Washington and Chicago connect.
Their plans abroad are not just small, so far, they are already in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow occurred.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group composed of people with disabilities is composed of.
How do they cope with this travel logistically and organizationally?
It is not as bad as it seems at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs need to be transported in the Luggage compartment. In addition, we must, of course, many an instrument case and other Luggage to lug around...
Nevertheless, so far it has always worked without problems, CSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, that I am sometimes, sometimes even surprised me.
Even in Moscow, where we recently, there were no problems.
Through their travel abroad, you will have a comparison, as it is in the individual countries with accessibility looks like, how to get there, people with disabilities, deals, etc.
As you have these things been experiencing?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, in which everything works better than us, we were just in Russia witness that in the East, everything is still in its beginnings.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is absolutely not suitable for the disabled. There it is still unusual for someone in a wheelchair alone in the city centre is on the way.
It is not even, of course, that you can use a wheelchair, for example, in the Elevator vorlässt.
Fortunately also arise there, clubs, trying, on the problems of people with disabilities should be noted.
And in what respect we must compared to the more developed countries catch up?
There are many things in which we hang behind...
But still, it should be noted that an improvement of the Situation always depends on the Efforts of the parties Concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is very common that people with severe disabilities independently in the public space to move, go to the Museum, toilets can use, etc.
But it is not common that there is a larger group of disabled people to participate actively in the social events involved, we're with the Band The Tap Tap the West a little ahead!
Respect in the Public and accessibility is one thing, but only if from our ranks significant athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, are things really start to change.
So far, these are only isolated cases of particularly strong-willed personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. If we have but a few years back: What was in the year 1998 motivated to start a Band?
At that time I started as a supervisor in the Jedlička Institute, where I have a lot of young people met who were interested in, and with a little intense.
And since I myself am a musician and others. Saxophone games, I, together with a colleague, a music-AG was founded.
Well, and with the time it is like our Moderator, Láďa Angelovič, likes to say, a bit out of control (laughs).
Became known the Band, but only in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that for us to cooperate with well-known singers has helped; in addition, we have also started to actively for us to advertise.
We are aware that, if you are doing anything, and this is outward is not visible, the own performance, in a sense, does not exist.
Thanks to EU funding can we also good editors, high-quality equipment and etc afford.
Their aim was it with The Tap Tap so far as to bring?
From the outset I have the Potential felt that one way of doing things.
In show business, copies today often one to the other.
This is on his way, logically, since everything New considered with caution and only after some time will be accepted.
There are only a few of the really unique things, and I would venture to say that Tap Tap.
The first impression of the audience usually has, of course, is pity; this is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings, we regret to have to.
There are people who have a full life to live and to develop, if you have the necessary funds.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed, this is not only for itself a step forward, but for the whole society.
It was for this success is also helpful that you have a strict boss, how many people listen to?
If you do something good, want to make, you may in many things not compromise and must also have a certain discipline in demand.
This is, in my opinion, but it is completely normal.
Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and if you then find that you twice a week sample preparatory stages must complete and a lot of time on concert tours to spend, then turns off the enthusiasm of many fast.
So it works but everywhere, in each Band, the work seriously and want to achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap twenty members.
How many of them were from the very beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. People come and go. This can't be prevented.
Those who have the will and the desire to Join with us is always welcome.
Takes place on the day before the predicted end of the world, Thursday, 20.12.2012 to 21 PM

The aim of the concert is the means for the equipment of a multifunctional accessible educational centre raise, that, under the name STUDEO in Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost: 25 Million. CZK

Poland and the outer space.
Last week Poland has been on a Ministerratssitzung of the member States of the European space Agency (ESA) as a twentieth of a member of this space Agency added. Poland is the second country from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic on 12. November 2008 ESA member).
Poland began in 1994, a close cooperation with ESA, and participated in the following years several ESA projects.
The path of Poland in the space began admittedly much earlier.
Already before the Second world war employees Polish Kosmosbegeisterte with the space, although this does not always met with understanding.
I remember, for example, the speech of A. Šternfeld from 6. December 1933 in Warsaw Observatory, in which the author thoughts from his pioneering work "entrance to the Astronautics" was presented.
The ideas of the young engineer (geb. in 1905) let the listeners, however, cold, and after years remembered Šternfeld still, that only Dr. Jan Gadomski interest in his work had shown.
Šternfeld won in the year 1934 for "entrance to the Astronautics" by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and Andre Louis Hirsch donated Prix REP-deer.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) was later an important supporter of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis worldwide-recognized contribution to the development of the space was, inter alia, thereby acknowledged that one of the craters on the erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him.
Already in the year 1925 was in Poland a railway trolley built for a rocket engine was planned.
The author of the draft, and the Details of this project remained unknown unfortunately.
It is not even clear whether the rocket to Start or to the deceleration of the trolley should be used.
The information is sourced from the contemporary press.
Began in 1933, the Polish infantry, with raketenbetriebenen Shot to deal with.
The research, led the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia, in collaboration with prof Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the surviving documents, it is obvious that the research into the stage of practical Tests penetrated.
The research was then certainly by the invasion of the German Army interrupted.
In the year 1937 appeared in the trade press by Ing. Rohoziński originating draft of a photoelectric Jagdrakete on, and in the following year appeared to be the work of "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
Both of these projects dealt with the military use of the Raketenantriebs.
Shortly before the war, all the projects were for military use the rocket from the Temporary scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) coordinates.
The Committee was set up in 1937, after two years of activity, has been his work, however, from the beginning of the war ended.
For more articles about space appeared after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company shall be in 1954 in the November issue of the journal Problemy, in the four major part of the space dedicated to it.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of a Raumfahrtgesellschaft.
At the time there was already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was to be expected that the exploration of outer space, would have a future.
Already in its early stages, in the year 1956, the Polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft PTA to accession to the 1951 based International Federation for space, and, in fact, the PTA already in the autumn of 1956 ordinary member.
In the following year became the first PTA Chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Vice-Chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics.
This office, he had, until his death in 1959 held.
Since 1956 involved in the PTA instrumental in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was established in 1957, completed the first launch took place on 10. October 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight altitude of 1800 m was approximately 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved Version, the RM-1A, built, and in 1959, began in the Błędów desert flight tests with the Zweistufenrakete RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 m) long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
A further stage of development should already be in the position to real scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should an altitude of up to 14.5 km away, and for the observation of Höhenwinden used.
In 1962, however, was the further development of the set.
The successor of the first rockets of the type RM was in the years 1962 to 1965 developed Meteor-1 rocket.
The rocket was as Zweistufenrakete designed, their total length amounted to 510 cm and the weight was 32.5 kg.
Of this missile were three types have been developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and 1C), differing from each other in the size of the Transportraums for scientific instruments are distinguished.
The Meteor-1A-rocket had a room with 0.4 litres capacity, Meteor-1B on 0,34 litres and Meteor-1C about 0,62 litres.
The maximum flight altitude of fraud in all three types of 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968 in the aviation Institute the Meteor-2 rocket, and its first flight in October 1970, began.
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg at a height of about 60 km of freight.
Later versions of Meteor-2 and Meteor-3 built.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in the year 1960, two years later, the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee followed.
Poland participated in the context of the inter cosmos programme in space exploration with Soviet satellites, and, in 1978, the Polish Pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimír Remek second Interkosmonaut.
The repeal of the law on non-profit Work is not a solution.
In the last week highlighted the constitutional court the law on non-profit Work.
This decision called for in the Public a lively discussion.
It is interesting that the problem from a wider perspective.
The liberal-oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In effect this means that the individual national economies in a state of permanent conflict.
Reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of the Privatkapitals, with the rampant financial speculation goes Hand in Hand.
Due to the large differences in the value of work (wages) it comes to Preisspannungen.
Under this term is a condition in which the manufacturer is trying, through the importation of cheaper Goods in the economic competition by the competition "undercut", and thus a larger share of the market to usurp and its profit increase.
On a large scale, this means that most of the companies, their production abroad to transfer or buy low, or your business to give up. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparatively high labour costs.
Since the private capital is no social responsibility, and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment caused carries rise necessarily government spending.
This Situation is strengthened by the fact that the men entrepreneurs absolutely're reluctant to pay your tax and thereby caused by them wider economic and social damages.
This Situation is commonly known, so that concrete statistics at this point, are superfluous.
The ruthless practice of Privatkapitals creates in the individual economies, a Situation in which the governments will be forced to compete with each other to come to the social level of the population artificially reducing foreign capital into the country to attract.
With other words: The governments of supply its own population without regard to the social consequences of the private capital.
This is reflected, in particular, Changes in applicable laws.
The aim of these measures, it is its own population to force the dictates of the Privatkapitals in particular in the wage sector have to accept.
This happens by economic coercion in long-term unemployment, on the other, by the circumcision of workers ' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as ever-larger differences between the Poor and the rich.
In Germany, there are already several years in public Lebensmittelabgabestellen for arms, which no longer are able, through their work to feed.
The number of those Affected is already in the millions.
In the course of the increase of the competitiveness of the German economy it regularly to cases in which workers such low wages that the state your income up to the subsistence wage increase.
Such a scandal was also in the case of the German Bundestag employees assistants revealed.
The austerity measures, virtually all of the EU southern States will undoubtedly be on the same condition as result, the people are under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social levels are forced to emigrate (as it is in the 19. Century was the case), or for a pittance at the edge of society to starve and to hope that at some point private investment capital to flow into the country.
Here is urging naturally, the question of how this capital comes?
If it is from another EU-country, migrates only the poverty of a country to another; or the capital remains the same, quite, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa work at all, the workers for a fraction of the European wages.
This applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim ad nauseam, that the state is not with capital to its own economy involved, and that planned to Wirtschaftskatastrophe.
Private capital insists narrow-minded on his point of view, that the state is not directing in the economy allowed to work.
Then you have to ask yourself whether or not the private capital of the policy and thus the entire state in its own selfish purposes influenced or even directs.
Here is the definite answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a practical Almighty and in all States ubiquitous Lobby.
The result is a desperate Situation in the area of corruption, the mutual preference, a law in which virtually all reprehensible, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany the Situation is such that a Ministry of state for lack of finances private, closely with the industry interwoven Rechtsunternehmen with the elaboration of draft laws commissioned.
These draft laws are then in the Parliament.
All violence is then no longer from the people, as it is the Western constitutions proclaim, but of strong financial groups, which have their own interests prefer.
Obviously advised the liberal democracies currently quickly in a Situation such as that Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic in times of Caesar and Pompey' describes: "The state has long been in decay terms, and the Offices were with violence occupied.
Against bribe, unlawful procuring of benefits, or with stone and sword.
The corruption rampant uncontrollably, and the people went with already purchased voices to choose" ... "people with character competed not for Offices, so that the government as a result of this decline in eight months, no Consul had" ... "You began really to talk about, that is the only medicine in this difficult Situation-a dictatorship, and that a strong man to be elected must be"... Appian thought at Pompey, but the strong man was then finally Caesar, the democracy permanently by the dictatorship replaced.
As it turns out, is based today's society, as well as in ancient times on the reckless preference of one's own advantage, and without the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital is already by its nature is not in the position to the benefit for the whole of society to recognize and enforce them.
The result, today, as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, not in the Least to more in-depth reform effort.
The cause for the emergence of fascism and communism, we must therefore, in the ruthless liberalisation of the economies in the 19th and 20th centuries. Century look.
From the present state of view, can be the downfall of this regime in favour of liberal democracies as a certain Pause to be considered at the next round already emerging.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that today's elites in future possible losses of hundreds of thousands of human lives, humanitarian and social disasters, we witness today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we are from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance.
The repeal of the law on non-profit Work here is not a solution, at least not lasting.
Under the pressure of the global and European economic competition will the Czech Republic be forced to continue ways to search, to the social level of the population to press down.
This Trend is therefore due to the system.
The only solution are targeted political and social reforms which the equity participation of the state in the economy, increasing the influence of the citizens on the government to increase and the monopoly position of the Privatkapitals in the society in favour of the state of weaknesses.
Israel: the laboratory of the Chaos.
"... that nothing from violence, or ever could cause a" Sting sings in the song Fragile, the most important Verse in the chorus is: "...lest we forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons no wars wanted, there would be no", says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in the year 1849
After the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza strip, there were, as always, a great number of reactions.
A stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while the Palestinians as terrorists; the other, in turn, support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the state of Israel, the Palestinian Arabs carried out the genocide and call the state of Israel as a terrorist.
I do not want to write about, who in these recurring waves of killing the guilty and who the victim is, in the end, were the today's inhabitants of Israel, including the self rule areas in the current political Situation, was born and have the beginning of the violence themselves have not experienced.
For me it is important that the readers look behind the Scenes, to open your eyes to it, to whom the 95-year-voltage (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small patches of Land in the Middle East especially helpful.
My thoughts are based in part on accessible historical facts, others are derived of these and go from my own understanding of them, who or what group of people, the events of the modern history influenced.
The history of mankind is primarily a story of the struggle for Power.
In each epoch, we can Alexander the Great, or a Napoleon of the total.
What is less apparent is the question whether it is really getting these people were, their steps Autonomous specific, or whether behind her throne one was, of their actions on a predetermined goal directed.
We must acknowledge that we are living in a period, in which the wealth of the world in the hands of very few Single, concentrated, and that this concentration of money and the resulting Power is not within the life span of a Generation has arisen.
Under these astronomically rich families stands out particularly, the man as the head of the octopus may call (I don't know whether you or anyone, I close this but not from) - the Rothschilds.
Much is not written about them.
Understandably.
The first press Agency (Reuters) has been the Rothschilds already in the 90s of the 19. Century purchased in order to connect your Name with highly criminal actions to prevent, in whose Background is always the consolidation of their Power, and the growth of their assets, or both stand.
The Rothschilds are at almost all Central banks in the world, and against the countries in which they are not at the Central banks are involved, make war or preparing to this (before the Invasion of Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the Invasion of Iraq, there were 5 countries, after the fall of Ghaddafis were only four, with Russia in the meantime, the Central Bank of the Russian government places).
Whoever tries, this family to resist, had to take the life to pay for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused the Status of the Rothschilds Bank of America as a Central Bank to renew, began during the civil war, its own (i.e. state) Bank notes are to be surrendered and was in 1865 in a Theater murdered.
J.F. Kennedy started their own banknotes are to be returned and wanted the FED to abolish he was assassinated in 1963; the Deputy Louis Mc Fadden in 1936, poisoned, after he FED due to the triggering of the world economic crisis in 1929 wanted to sue.
The global lust for power of the Rothschilds resulted in 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of a Plan for the unleashing of three world wars by Albert spades, a Freemason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of recognition.
The first war, had the goal of the large monarchist Staatenwesen of Europe to eliminate, by the second war, should, in particular, the colonial rule of great Britain will be broken, and the third war, the world's population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people reduce (such number would be for their amenities and luxury of worry and would also not consume a lot of resources), a Universalreligion create (Ecumenism here is nothing more than the first) and finally to the Takeover of absolute Power.
The method by which the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds at the top of works, is triggering a crisis, and then offer a solution (order from chao - order out of Chaos).
These solutions are wrong and lead to worsening of the Situation (see the founding of the FED, to crises such as those of you in the year 1907, when triggered, will not repeat).
After it to you by the murder of the Habsburg heir to the throne, Ferdinand in Sarajevo had succeeded in the First world war, trigger, they destroyed the Russian tsardom by the Revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First world war ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian tsarist Empire, the war was no longer required), then, was the resolution of the Central European nation of Austria-Hungary.
About the Second world war easier kindle to be able to let the bankers by the policy of a latent conflict situation by Germany with gigantic Kriegsreparationen occupied; as a result, they created the condition of poverty-stricken masses, so that the Germans only a sufficiently strong leader to foist had the culprits named and simple solutions offered; another factor was the creation of the Vielvölkerstaates Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which has the function of a fifth column should take and also took to the Kriegsbrand to ignite.
At the end of the 19th century. Century, the Rothschilds, the founding of the Zionist movement, in the case of a branch, the establishment of a Judenstaates sought, as far as possible on the historical territory of Judea, with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The already mentioned Balfour Declaration created the condition for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it came to the first clashes with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks, there were on both sides.
The Second world war broke out, and if Hitler of the chain losriss, to him, the international bankers initially had held, or whether everything went according to Plan, it is difficult to estimate, in any case, created the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps, the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the international community.
Israel was established in 1948 founded, and as well as by the Kriegsreparationen against Germany, the ground for the Second world war was prepared, is the proclamation of the state of Israel, the creation of a focal point for the third world war.
If it is the international bankers will succeed in this unleash war, the Jewish people, similarly as in world war II victims in the front line of battle, this time together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of strife and Chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think of how sharp the people of supporters and opponents of Israel divide).
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelites, where injustice only wrong in an endless spiral of violence triggers, where at the beginning of the greed of individuals and their pursuit of a global Power?
Here, between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders differ, set but the international bankers in Israel as well as with us, the people, only their own candidates for election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the hawk Benjamin Netanyahu, is a typical example of a faschismusanfälligen, the international bankers, loyal, devoted politician, who do everything to a war with Iran to kindle, which in the face of Iran's membership in the Shanghai cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan,...), rapidly developed into a global conflict might be enhanced, and in which, due to the control of Iran, about the only 2 miles wide Strait of Hormuz, about 20% of the world's Erdöllieferungen run, to a destruction of the world economy might come.
In what light there appear the words of David Rockefellers from the year 1994: "The only thing we need is an overarching crisis, and the people of the new world order is welcome."
In their conception of the new world order, a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the Rest of the human Population of a small group of Finanzaristokraten.
A world in which every newborn at birth, a Chip is implanted to this being the total scrutiny.
"And it makes that the Small and the Great, the Rich and the poor, Free and the servants, all of a mark to give on their right Hand or on their foreheads, and that no man might buy or sell, because he had the mark, even the name of the beast, or the number of his Name.
Here is wisdom. Who has understanding, think about the number of the beast.
Because it is a human number, its number is sechshundertsechsundsechzig."
The Film Argo: When it's at its worst, Hollywood call
In November 1979 occupied a Mob demonstrierender Islamist students the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they asked for the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, after the Revolution, in the USA, who had fled, for decades the patronage of his Regime maintained.
For the American government gave it out of this Situation no positive way out - you could not afford it, the Shah to throw overboard, because this is the trust of its allies in other countries massively damaged would have.
At the same time, she was not able, in Iran, where the Revolution in the establishment of a theocratic regime that led to the release of the hostages to enforce.
It was a heavy blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco, when a violent attempt of the hostage release made it worse.
The caught taken diplomats were finally after 444 days released after negotiations by the Algerian government has been taught.
The fate of the hostages called home a wave of solidarity, as well as antiiranischer moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter's against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in the year 1980.
The Film Argo of the Director and actor Ben Affleck describes an Episode of this story, the USA a small Teilsieg brought.
Immediately prior to the occupation of the Embassy managed to six Botschaftsmitarbeitern to escape.
This ended after many complications in the residence of the canadian Ambassador.
The CIA succeeded in cooperation with the canadian authorities, the refugees from Iran; it helped them an extravagant Story to mask their true identity - they traveled with canadian passports disguised as members of a Filmstabes, the supposedly in the country filming locations for a Science-Fiction Film visited.
Combination of Genres
The experts of "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, developed Plan was also made by the cooperation of Hollywood required.
So the camouflage became credible, articles appeared on this film project in journals, there were press conferences are held, and the fictitious manufacturing company had a real office.
The details of this Operation have been long kept secret. The Film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks Film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a more realistic political Thriller, but at the same time, a so-called. "Caper Movie", that is the story of a successful Husarenstücks such as, for example, the Film Ocean's Eleven.
This change in the Film the Stimmungsebenen - on the one hand, the Dokumentarszenen from Tehran (in the title sequence to be iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and also in the Filmfassung the same situations, there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and slightly exaggerated.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA Headquarters and other institutions, such as the men in suits at the conference table, on the Amtsfluren, on the phone...
Ben Affleck is with this Film is a remarkable restart his career succeeded.
From a dismissed actor is a respectable Director and as an actor, he is now no longer the goal of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film after the crime is Not an easy job ("Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller city without grace (2010).
At the same time, it is Afflecks first movie, not in his native Boston is the Director's plays.
The feel for the atmosphere of the place belonged to the characteristics of the previous films, this film Director from the Standard Hollywood took flight.
Affleck proves this sense, however, also in Argo, where Tehran of Canada "played".
The best scenes of the movie playing in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that actually took place - the opening sequence of the storming of the Embassy is in its Clarity to be very impressive, and it provides nevertheless, the feeling of confusion and uncertainty that occurs when somewhere once the story moves.
A similar effect can be achieved Affleck with his Team in fictional scenes (the wrong stage crew scared at a Bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The Director had to face the fact that the story is actually not many in the cinematic sense exciting scenes.
With the Few works he, however, quite successful, but he reality is sometimes a little nachhilft - what then is not always so elegant effect (the scenes of the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran of a phone call in America is averted, or even the car chase on the runway, seem a little contrived).
The weakness of Argo is its too wide spread, by the need is caused, to a lot of action in too many places, the need to show.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in their role as Hollywood-staff very charming, their figures, however, would more space earned, and they are in the Film is far from alone.
Afflecks Film loses a bit of traction. It is a Film you with some degree of interest and the design, construction, and to a Thriller from the 70's. Years reminiscent of Retro-style of truth.
Enthusiasm, however, it is difficult.
As a reminder of a until today in some way living piece of history, and as proof of this, as covered but the ideas of the Almighty and all-knowing intelligence services are, however, he is sufficient.
Guidelines for the Inflation of the balloons, for bananas, and for the circus
The Server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, an annual survey on the most absurd Bank charges exclaims, this year has decided, in the competition "most Absurd regulation, respectively. Idea from the EU-workshop" to organize.
"On this idea brought us the recently by the EU put forward a Plan, a women's quota of 40% in the Management of large European companies to introduce," said Patrik Nacher, for the organization of this survey, care, against the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominees absurdities is for example the judgment of the European court of justice about the unification of the insurance rates for men and women.
Until then enjoyed women in the life insurance is an advantage, because they are for the insurance companies lens at a lower risk.
"More incredible ideas from the EU-workshop by the end of this year, will be nominated.
The actual voting takes place by end February 2013", said Afterwards.
To the controversial EU regulations include, among others, the binding of an admixture of Bioethanol fuel in their Wake, naturschädigend is, furthermore, the prohibition of reliable thermometer, just because this is a relatively small amount of this Gefahrenstoffes contain, or the Directive to the size of Hühnerkäfigen, because in this year the eggs are much more expensive.
Criticism harvested in the past, the de facto ban on the use of the term "Butteraufstrich" or the ban on the sale of incandescent bulbs.
Bananas need to 14 cm
The EU apparatus decides often under the pressure of this or that Lobby of trade and industry, whose claims in Brussels in the rule of one or several member States are represented (so tried the Czech Republic currently, for example, with Veto threat, the claims of Czech banks to enforce).
Lobby interests were behind it, that bananas are of the highest grades in the EU, at least 14 cm long and no "Krümmungsanomalie".
The European Commission has defended with the Argument that only the variation in national standards harmonize, the trade of which would interfere.
The standards for fruit and vegetables were by the EU against the resistance of some countries already with the note softened that the existing policy to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey may be the EU-regulation of last year, according to the balloons on the sale with the note that children under eight years, the balloon is not without the supervision of an adult bloat.
The EU appealed to an American study, in accordance with balloons is the leading cause the painful death of children.
A similar restriction applies to children up to 14 years in the use of Jahrmarktströten.
Curious ideas, there are also at home
Relatively absurd is also a policy, the European officials is concerned, everyone in the EU have an official role, due to the sensitivity of the issue for Greece is not the name of Macedonia, use and must instead, FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) say.
The Server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominees in cooperation with the Association of liberal Economists Laissez Faire in addition to the above mentioned. Absurdities also the EU regulation on the extent of food on the territory of a member state.
The EU laid out so that the maximum volume of food festival, that on the day of our EU-accession on the territory of the Czech Republic are allowed.
The Czech Republic exceeded for example, the volume specified for Pilzkonserven for a high fine threatened.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed with the idea that certain countries of money for it, so that you are not a sea, or the idea of funding for applications for funding.
These ideas were certainly not from Brussels, but also from Prague.
"We are not disadvantaged by this, that we have no sea.
We are in the EU, apply for a refund", declared in the fall of 2004, the former agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
As an Argument he stated that the Grain harvest is very high and the state-owned stock as a result of the sog. Interventionseinkäufe were full to overflowing.
Since the Czech Republic have another way to seaports have, the EU should, according to Palas hundreds of millions of euros to pay us.
The European Commission came to the Czech Republic finally so far, however, that a tender on the purchase of grain from countries, organised, with no access to the sea.
Funding is available for applications for subsidies offered the municipalities of the Ministry for regional development under the direction of Minister Pavel Nemec (US-DEU), specifically, if this means for the drafting of Fördergeldanträgen to Brussels to act.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Regulations in the member States, although it is easy to become a target of criticism, the efforts of the EU to regulate and, thus, also to the effectiveness and development of the entire European Union deserves in the opinion of some experts, however, more recognition.
A more serious Problem in the opinion of these experts, rather, the EU funding for projects that absolutely nothing to do with the deepening of the European Integration have in common, however, for the negotiations of individual member States were enforced.
Emotions calls in this country is also the fact that the Czech Republic, similarly to other member States in Brussels to have the right to use specific names of traditional products must fight and this fight is not always wins.
The Czech Republic, according to a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the term "Olomoucké tvarůžky" defend the Inländerrum (Tuzemský rum), whose Tradition with us till the 19th. Century back, had our manufacturers, however, in "Tuzemák" rename.
The name of Rum may be used only for products from Zuckerrohrdestillat be used, not for products from sugar beets.
In the official list of the registered in the EU in products diving in the society of the world-famous cheese Feta and Gorgonzola, Luebeck marzipan or Parmaschinkens now the Karlovy vary rusk, carp from Pohořelice and Trebon, or even the hops hop on.
With a community trademark may be because of the Pardubice gingerbread or the subject in hořice roles Breasts.
"The people want, that I the Republic of rescue, but I'm just an Amateur," said Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how do you get the idea, for the office of the President to stand as a candidate?
I'm not about, Senator or President.
If in our country, all work without problems, I'd be nowhere to run.
But I can not see how the Republic for 20 years, is looted, like thieves are free to roam around, while the people of the taxes and the retirement age to be increased.
I had no ambitions of politicians.
But if I see something, what I don't like it, then I try a solution to propose to change this.
And since I already have about 40 am, and independent and nonpartisan, I have no other way for things to influence, as for the office of a Senator or the President to stand as a candidate.
In the Senate, you have made it and then straight on the way to the castle.
Return this does not make their voters back?
I have all the time I said that I was the battle for the castle following the results of the Senate elections will record.
Later, I have this clarified and said that I for the office of the President election will if I have to Senator am elected.
My goal is not the function. The function is an Instrument with which I my visions to fruition.
For that I need as much influence, and have a strong mandate.
The difficulty is not only in the fact that we as a people in the bar and in front of the TV rant, but each knock, who want to change something.
Come to the media, which is one of the honour want to steal, and the freedom of the word, with the freedom to lie confused.
About me, for example, has claimed that I bribe journalists would, or that I Advisor Jiri Paroubek was.
We talk about your visions.
The battle for the castle with the Thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive asset declarations about 20 million crowns included.
To do this, you must laws change.
As President, you have, in this respect, no skills, and only the Senate as a Whole can propose legislation.
How do you solve this Problem?
As a simple citizen, I've used the guide a free trade remains, and this could be enforced.
The Problem is the small-minded policy - if someone is right or to the left with a good proposal, is this deliberately rejected, and this keeps the population only.
As an independent Parteiloser, I possess a much greater potential, support of all parties represented in Parliament to win.
My advantage is that I no stereotyped thinking and Parteidogmen of each party can take, what our country is the Best.
Do you see yourself as a human being in politics is rather right or left?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people get me more left to see.
For me, this is Right-to-left Thinking, but it is completely unimportant.
For me it is important that we move forward.
I'm not about whether someone to the left or to the right of the stock belongs to; I would like to connect people.
Always I support the public every good solution, even when this is the KSČM or from the ODS comes, and also, I will myself against bad ideas.
It displeases you, if someone you as populists referred to.
However, confirm that you want, not what you have just said?
If you are in a company, a business plan to set up, then you have also an ideal goal and a Vision.
And this, you want to approach.
You can do this for my sake as populism call, but all proposals, of which I have spoken, work in the world already, or they were of key experts.
But without support in Parliament, leaving you with only keywords.
And so they come into politics in the long term is not far away.
Or do you think it's you, if you just long enough to talk to the people, will succeed in, for example, the material and criminal liability to enforce it?
I have no other option.
Politicians, journalists and the Public to convince and to try them on our side to bring these objectives to enforce.
As President, it would be no Problem for me, the Chairman of the parliamentary live on television to ask the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors by law to anchor.
And the target would then may say, why you refuse.
A strong personality, the grievances indicates that can put pressure on the political scene exercise.
Take the direct election of the President, the credit to the public pressure was.
I say quite clearly that I am an Amateur; I am not a genius, nor an Intellectual.
I try allies for my views and visions.
With the policy, I have only just started and try, for my program the support of the majority.
I try to keep things to judge for themselves; and if it doesn't work, then I go to six years in the private sector back.
That sounds a little, as if Okamura the Czech Republic should save.
I'm not a Savior.
I know that I alone nothing reach; so I have with several well-known personalities talked about, if you do not also for the Senate election.
For example I have with Radim Jančura spoken, however, due to heavy workload, he refused.
I also have the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová supported the fraud in the trade of light heating oil revealed.
My candidacy, I began with the premise that people are deeply unhappy, but for now, I'm not sure anymore.
Sixty percent of eligible voters are not at all the elections have gone, and those that are gone, mostly representatives of the Establishment chosen.
In the Senate, we are only two Independent.
The people have such a Senatszusammensetzung that Changes is very difficult to be enforceable.
Anyway I'm going for my visions to fight, for example, for the direct election of mayors and Bezirkshauptmänner.
Think about starting your own party?
Furthermore, I have not thought of, because I have no time, the past of each potential Parteimitglieds to check, and also do not have the money have for it.
I don't even have money for the Präsidentenkampagne; on my transparent account are only 20.000 CZK.
You have no money?
You speak of asset declarations, how would your from?
My personal expense and I estimate that about 60 million. CZK.
In Prague, I have a plot of land with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, with a further 8 million, an art collection, which is about 10 million value, as well as the Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb, about one Million of value. And then I've got a couple of million on the account.
The Aston Martin was the way a child's dream - James Bond liked me, always, as he drove the car galant to women and at the same time, fought Evil.
You will drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
They say that the Republic want to change, but your own money, you do not want to invest in it.
This is not exactly convincing.
I have no 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make debt?
I have already 2.5 million in the campaign plugged in.
The fact that I have no sponsors have, shows that my program is probably not very much interest.
And I am not obliged, the campaign from its own resources to cover.
The cost of the campaign are basically by my salary as a Senator covered.
But from the Senatorengehalt alone, I could not live; so could I, for example, my son is not the English school Finance, the 30,000 per month costs.
If I only wanted to earn money, I would go for nothing-election.
So stay continue as entrepreneur, in order to make a living?
They said not that these activities back?
But that has nothing to do with the amount of the salary.
As promised, I have my activities partially reduced.
For example, my Deputy in the spring of managing Director of the travel Agency.
The people want me as a Samaritan see, the Republic of Croatia.
But I have to live from something.
To which monthly income, they were used as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is also continue to be so.
As President, I would set my endeavors, however.
The full interview can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects to prove that the real adventure is not only in the head - on the example of Spijkenisse and the recently established Bücherberg - 2 photos
"I think the building is funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by on the side of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large-scale enterprise, says: "But that is nice, it already, the house."
But I wonder why we still have a library need.
All have Internet, iPad, and E-Books.
No man is still voluntary in one of these Old-Style libraries, or?
Spijkenisse, a barely besichtigungsbedürftige dormitory area of the city on the outskirts of Rotterdam, is odd to-head record.
The 80,000 inhabitants, the municipality has the lowest Bildungsrate the whole of the Netherlands.
To this stupid fact counteract, decided a few years ago, to General education and to contribute to the seven fictitious bridges on the Euro banknotes are shown, as pretty bepinselte Stahlbetonminiaturen to build.
The success of the educational campaign was limited.
And so, gradually, the city fathers, that there is only one way would be, of the statistics to be Lord of: A library must!
Winy Maas from Rotterdam architects MVRDV, master of daredevil bar charts and producer of witty, often cynical buildings, took up the matter with his usual Calmness, and appeared for the competition-Hearing anno 2003 with five books under her Arm and a Grin on his face.
And while the Jury is still taken aback to be looked up and shrugged, put the naughty Maas his fine gifts according to the size of a pyramid, and ended his action was supported speech with the words: "love municipality!"
So that's it, my suggestion for the Bücherberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, is the 30-million-Euro mountain piled up.
He is part of a Revitalisierungsprojekts, which also includes underground Parking, supermarket, Post office and a few adjoining residential and townhouses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November was the Bücherberg with the second prize for "Best Library of NL 2012" award.
Furthermore, the project for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012 nomination.
This is the faceless Kleinstadtretorte, which until now, not had more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian area and a stunned ugly town hall, behind the white facades, one would be inclined, a dairy factory, to suggest, to a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
But above all, has Spijkenisse now over the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence.
The long way to the book
The first impression: Büchereldorado under Käseglocke.
Although there is a Lift, right through the mountain, but the true space - and Lesefreuden open themselves to the ordinary Climb to the topography.
The fully glazed interior is bright and clear, the burned Klinkerboden and the elegant street lamps speak clearly the language of a public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You already keeps a lookout for a Park bench, a dog and a soccer-playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally, the bookshelves along the facade and in the middle is a large, dark room, the most uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have the classic room configuration is placed on the head and the reading from the inside to the outside covered.
The Interior of the Bücherbergs is cleverly used: In the centre there are offices, Internet, library, chess club, environment centre and HV unit.
A special joy to the black bookshelves, the times, wall covering, time parapet, time Stiegengeländer.
Look, feel and smell are alien.
Even hard-nosed architects and civil engineers shaking of the unknown construction material of the head.
"We wanted to here with the use of recycled materials in our work," says Joop Trouborst, project Manager at the borough of Spijkenisse, at the request of the Standard.
And so we are in a friesländischen commercial farm one day on a suitable waste product from the agriculture encountered.
Used for many years in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields millimeterdünnes nonwoven synthetic as Wurzelunterlage.
This is cheap and efficient.
The thin textile holds two seasons, and then it is ready for the trash.
For the library was the fleece - for the first time in this amounts to four inches thick plates are pressed.
Under heat and pressure, if the so-called Landbouwplastic (CLP) to a dark, homogeneous, resistant Material, that a bissl for new cars and a little after sports Shoe smells.
After 105 steps you have reached the summit.
At the end of the almost 500-metre-long wandering in the literature café not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with the Dutch croquettes and potted Ficusbäumen rewarded.
They provide for the atmosphere, but especially for the proper humidity in the Literaturgebirge.
Donations for the new soul
"You would not believe, but this house is in spite of a lot of glass showcase in terms of Ecology," says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled with geothermal energy.
Although the Bücherberg under a Glassturz, the sun shines even on Sunny days only briefly into the Interior.
The wide wood-glued rafter, the perpendicular to the glass facade, serve as shading and catch a majority of the sunlight.
The indoor climate is very pleasant.
The Rest is done by automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT industry, dared are already on the way to the new library.
Also Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM-teacher Cynthia Bogarde, the Boekenberg even as Spijkenisses "long overdue soul".
The reason: For the opening of a few weeks ago, every resident invited to a book from his personal inventory to donate.
It is intended for the time being, once the optical gaps in the not-yet-fully-stocked library currently 70,000 units - to be filled.
The concept worked.
The shelves are filled.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library", says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation has now every inhabitant of a certain relationship to this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building is.
And if it's only for ornament.
This is MVRDV those ultimate succeeded, in the jargon of establishing an Identity is called.
Spijkenisse has history of literature written.
So young and uneducated, you also may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans have a larger role to play"
Germany has in the vote on the admission of the Palestine of the voice.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, poised Berlin on a narrow diplomatic degrees.
Deutsche Welle: in the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it is against the application for observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations would agree.
But then contained Berlin.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports, what the Israelis in Gaza have done, not.
Now Germany is due to its special relationship with Israel, however, to be careful.
But at the same time, I think, that it is also not the American Position is supported.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, without, however, is critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany has also abstain, as it was a matter of a no-fly zone to be set up.
This was finally a NATO-enforced.
It falls Germany hard, on major international issues a clear Position to take?
Yes, that's true.
The reason is that it is just his foreign policy surrounded and while away from a policy, so to speak, of the United States managed, to a German foreign policy.
Complicating this is the fact that the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
The Germans found between the fronts against.
You are expected by you that you have a more independent role to play, because they are not accustomed.
I think you keys to their role approach, but you are on the way to a more ' normal ' foreign policy.
A foreign policy, such as France or the UK.
What does a ' normal ' foreign policy concretely from the German point of view?
It shows the willingness of national interests, positions, to relate to, which are independent of those of the us or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy of the economic policy is motivated, so of exports, and its relationship to specific regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from that of the other great powers, and therefore, Germany has its own interests to protect.
These economic interests impact on the attitudes in the middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
Firstly, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be wary of the Public, but also the elites in the Arab countries, not from the head to come across.
This is definitely a role.
But I would not be too much weight to do, this is not entirely one-sided relationship.
But it is definitely an important role in German Considerations.
Germany has its relations with the United States corrupted by it in making important decisions of the voice contain, for example in the vote on Palestine?
I think, in Europe and even in the USA there is great understanding for the German Position.
Therefore, I do not think that this is such a dramatic break was, as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps, therefore, Germany is even a certain respect for import.
Because it indicates, however, that it as an international player to be taken seriously, and his interests have to be considered.
In Europe, there are different opinions on the Palestinian Initiative.
The United States, by contrast, have clearly for a Veto pronounced.
There are differences of opinion between the United States and many European Nations?
Due to the American domestic politics have these differences will always exist.
I think that the Obama administration secretly probably pretty much understanding for the European Position.
But due to the political Situation here, can the government Position publicly, of course, is not represented.
I believe that the actual differences are not so great as they appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so thrilled by Netanyahu's policies.
It falls Germany hard, its close relations with Israel and the us on the one hand, and the Position of the main partners in the EU, on the other side to agree?
I think that is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a bit easier for the Germans, if there is a coherent and unified European policy would be, which is not currently the case.
So you can't be part of a broader line and must instead things from their own Position going forward.
Do you precisely with the Euro.
I think, in the future, Germany will play a leading role in Europe a European Position to push.
This is of course not just for Germany, because of the relationship to Israel.
That was always a delicate topic.
But I believe that the German it is clear that a more independent role to play.
Looks Germany itself in the role as a major international player wants to Germany play a major role?
Or falls Germany, the Leadership still hard?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still unpleasant, and, for obvious reasons, it falls to the country is still struggling, a greater role to play.
If we, for example, the Euro is to look at, because every Time when Germany play a greater role accepts a variety of anti-German feelings freely.
This makes it the Germans were not easy.
This is actually the old Problem: you don't want by hostile countries surrounded.
Seen in this way, Germany is in a much more difficult Position than the United States.
It must be sensitive to a variety of neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
Now, the influence of the USA in European politics continues to decline, the EU fills in the Moment of this vacuum but not, who remains as otherwise?
The Germans will be easy to play a greater role.
Even if you don't like, it you uncomfortable and you have a lot of unpopular power - c'est la vie!

"Trademark" in China: If Puma and Armani suddenly Chinese are
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is based on a China officially registered name, however, nothing to do with the Ursprungsunternehmen has to do.
Nevertheless, it enjoys as long protection, such as the actual namesake't complain.
And even then, it is not clear whether they will get justice.
"It is for foreigners are always more difficult, their brands in China to protect", says Thomas Pattloch, an attorney with the law firm Taylor Wessing, on rights in the far East is specialized.
Each week, lands a new case on my Desk.
The imitators enough to have seen a few extra letters, so that their brands are allowed to log.
So, from Gucci simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada makes you Prada-Kny enter.
German companies also in this way are legal copies, such as the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the Trademark office in Beijing.
On 14. September 2010, let there be a Chinese company, the trademark Zegna DF Puma protect a name, which is also the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna served.
The fact that the Chinese world champion in the Copy, and in the infringed intellectual property, is well known.
In the large cities, there are multi-storey Department stores, which are almost exclusively sell fakes.
Pattlochs cases, but are different: on behalf of his clients, he goes on the other hand, that Chinese companies by the trademark office officially received the right to a name, to use the already elsewhere is protected.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", a Beifahrermarke.
The word is oriented to "Bang Dakuan".
Thus, women are meant, which is rich men fishing.
The Chinese authorities are aware no one to blame
"This is bad for business, you have to overcome it", calls Pattloch.
"The brand is diluted, the unique position disappears, the image is enormous."
The financial losses and the costs of the proceedings of the affected sectors are in the millions, especially in the case of expensive Vorzeigeprodukten.
According to the market research company CLSA's China with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year of the third-largest market for luxury goods and the fastest-growing.
However, deletions dubious entries in the register of marks are difficult to achieve and go into the money.
Up to nine years is the method to last, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports of cases in which the court abwies, because of the long duration of the disputed Name to the "market reality".
If the plaintiff bad luck, he must have the plagiarist even have to pay money, because he is its brand in China injured, says Pattloch.
Sometimes, there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also concern the graphical elements.
2009, Daimler has a dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently the German Betonpumpenbauer Putzmeister took over.
The Chinese may, therefore, is today an Emblem to use the Mercedes star is similar.
The Volvo buyers Geely used originally a blue-and-white Logo, the BMW remembered; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion brand Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous crocodile look in the other direction could.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any guilt.
The trademark office CTMO in Beijing that it there in 2010 due to lower personnel and equipment of the rooms bottlenecks have given.
In the past year was, however, one of the "emergency situation in the workflow returned to normal".
So, the stock of raw, unprocessed opposition to 22 per cent.
Almost 57.000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, waiting in the office still 81.500 objections to completion.
Address costs a lot
As so often in China the Figures are impressive.
In the past year, the CTMO more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, which is almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China, for the tenth Time in a row, the list of the registrations all over the world, giving the authority will notify with.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademark, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
2011 would be 1.8 billion Yuan in fees had been taken.
Simplified means that each application on average, 1280 Yuan or 160 euros.
Address costing many multiples, such as the case of the German family-owned company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years of fighting, the group against a Chinese plagiarist.
Although the Germans could reach that his illegal manufacture of imitation auto parts was dug.
But secured the imitators continue to the Chinese rights to the mark Freudenberg.
You yourself have failed, because in Germany surname is not protected and could be said Hanno Wentzler, the Chairman of the Board of management of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trademark office CTMO dismissed the objection of the Munich because even back.
In the next two instances got Freudenberg right, but the opposing party is fighting until today.
You must be extremely careful
Now is the matter before the Supreme court of justice.
Wentzler is confident that the thing to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The process is extremely complex and it cost us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs were almost impossible to quantify, the company archives have even one hundred years old files browse need to proof.
Five years ago bot Freudenberg the other side, in vain, a "high six-figure amount in euros" for the settlement.
"Because you can see how much the value is", says Wentzler.
The dangers in the far East, threatening even to Europe zurückzuschwappen.
Then, if there's imitators, unprotected brands secure.
So wanted a Chinese manufacturer in Germany, the term Freudenberg for shoes and leather log on.
This area of business, the group has been abandoned long ago, yet he was able registration to turn away.
"You have to be careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and the attorney Pattloch rates German companies do business with China very careful.
It is not rich, international trademark rights to leave, rather, should the foreigner "everything that is somehow worthy of protection, even in China, sign in", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the much more expensive than the registry.
In fact: If Freudenberg in the last act of his Markendramas subject, then you would have probably the opposite side of royalties for the own names, numbers, explains Wentzler.
Or we are in the Segment of the market.
World's AIDS day: Stamp, to sing, to help
In Heidelberg, the choir rehearses Imbongi and in Swaziland are happy about AIDS orphans.
The story of a connection, which is far more than 8733 kilometres overcomes.
First, there is the Stamp: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies pumps and Herrenslipper are looking for on the parquet floor to the beat, to find him quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then only swell the voices of the singers slowly - Old, Bass, Tenor, and soprano - press, beguile, and track.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, it raises almost from its Stoffschuhen, when he with his smooth wild Gestures together.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical psychology in Heidelberg rehearses the choir Imbongi a new song.
Of the fifty singers have come between 23 and 69 years old, from the field of human genetics to the Hausmann.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, every voice of a choir has a different Text, and this in a very foreign language: Zulu of eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in Parts of Swaziland is spoken.
Help for self-help
Worldwide, there are about 34 million people are HIV-Infected, the estimates Unaids, the United Nations programme for Bekämfung of Aids.
23.5 million people live in the South of Africa.
In Swaziland life 245000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40 percent of the population is now HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni the Association Voices for Africa godfather found in Germany.
70 of them visit a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 Euro a month you can sponsor a child.
You are guaranteed to the child's school fees, school uniforms and a warm meal per day in the Gogo-Center.
Imbongi means Zulu storyteller or Celebrators.
The Bantu language fluently speak in this room, no one, but to sing.
For almost ten years is exercised by the choir of the songs in this strange soft language and brings you now and then, back to where they originally came from: the South of Africa.
Because 8 733 kilometers in a straight line from Heidelberg away, in the Northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni by the loud voice of the German Choir depends.
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live there, some even in simple clay and straw huts, a majority of whom are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents, because this is the HI-Virus in the dust.
In Esitjeni shows up in the Small, how very Swaziland suffers from the highest HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to Unicef.
Circumcision of the male foreskin, the risk of transmission proven to reduce by half, by the population hardly accepted.
More than forty percent of the people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency Virus, with mid-thirties to die is not uncommon.
At a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, discovered by the choir of the village, above all, but saw the Imbongis many children on the streets, where it is not only parental care was lacking, but simply to everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a school in a poor country, it was only right not a Chance.
Initially, it was still the private commitment of Individual, for a few euros in the year a child to school to send him a warm meal a day.
But a year later, he founded the choir of the Association "Voices for Africa", since almost professionally to the Aids orphans in Esitjeni care.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STI include Syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral STI, HIV, Human Pappilomaviren, genital Herpes or Hepatitis.
Pubic lice and scabies belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the Hauptbetroffenengruppen?
Syphilis and gonorrhoea occur primarily in men who have Sex with men.
The Robert-Koch-Institute assumes that at least four out of five of all in Germany, reported Syphilis cases through sexual contact between men be transferred.
In the heterosexual adults are chlamydia infections, cancer, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and Humane Pappilomaviren common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV is among heterosexual adults in this country are relatively low - nevertheless, Some 20 percent of the new HIV infections are attributable to this group.
Among youngsters of chlamydia infections is much more likely than other population groups.
According to European surveys cover three-quarters of all infections are young people between 15 and 25 years.
In this country there are also the Human Pappilomaviren when young people are often before.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reportable.
The number of Syphilis infections, according to the Robert Koch-Institute of 1697 diseases in the year 2001 on 3698 diseases in the year 2011, more than doubled.
The number of new HIV infections have been declining since 2007.
in 2011, there were about 2700 cases.
This is about one-tenth less than the year before.
What are the signs of a sexually transmitted disease?
Infectious diseases can ulcers in the genital area, discomfort during Urination, vaginal discharge, lower abdominal, as well as blisters or warts cause.
Often they cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can the risk of infection to reduce, but does not wholly protection.
Because, in part, the causative agents of sexually transmitted diseases also by smear infections and close physical contact to be passed on.
Therefore, experts recommend, especially in the case of frequently changing sexual partners regular studies.
Diagnosed early, most STI healed and long-term consequences can be avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations, and last but not least, the fees, the choir in the whole of Germany into existence, comes a lot together.
"In total, we have about 200 000 Euro after Esitjeni sent," says Annette Lennartz, the Chairman of the Association.
In the village itself, managed Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and excellent woman, the funds from Germany.
You also cares about the orphans find good, in one of the grandmothers about.
The Gogos, how to get to the old women on Zulu calls them, are the Pillars of the village.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans shelter, give them a roof over your head, and ensure that the children in their uniforms every day, just in time for school to appear.
Anyone who has come into the shelter to Khanyisile, a single woman, the same way the club is paid as the two cooks every day for more than 200 hungry kids cooking.
In addition, "Voices for Africa", a sewing school launched two Hühnerhäuser built and together with the American health organisation, PSI organized that many in the village of a HIV-Test.
This is not a matter of course, because, obviously, the disease throughout the country, you are silent you most like to be dead.
A king with 14 wives
"Aids is a taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it's to do with sexuality."
Really strange in a country in which the king officially 14 wives holds.
The last absolute Monarch in sub-Saharan Africa, king Mswati III., for his excessive Lifestyle known.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is this state-sanctioned way of life due to the HI-Virus in the past decades as quickly spread.
But also the many migrant workers, the Virus through the country.
Free condoms were, while it on every corner, " says Annette Lennartz, "but they are rarely used.
The culture is different - flesh to flesh."
As to cultural exchange something to promote, travels the Imbongi choir every two to three years jointly by the South African and sings songs full of melancholy, fighting spirit, Confidence, and black self-confidence, which many at the southern tip of the continent yet from the times of Apartheid know.
A Bus full of White, the songs in a black language singing so much recognition brings not only mood and joy, but has also been some fierce border guards a few tears uncovered from.
The journey will always after Esitjeni, where the singer of her godchildren visit.
Also if you take the small village on the maps impossible to find, in the valley of the Ezulweni river, it is more than well known.
"Goes after Esitjeni, there is light" say to the people there.
And if you 8733 kilometers in a straight line to Heidelberg returns to the pounding of the singers in the rehearsal room at the Bergheimer Strasse, then you see it also as fixtures.
Messenger: NASA discovered ice on mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that the planet mercury ice cream.
The ice cover, you may want to up to 20 metres thick.
The U.S. space Agency NASA, the existence of ice on the planet mercury is demonstrated.
Although he is closest to the sun, there are also there, frozen water, such as from three on Thursday in the journal "Science" published studies suggest.
The Messenger probe have found evidence that it permanently in the shadowed Region of the planet in a sheet of ice.
This should be at least 30 centimetres, and possibly even up to 20 metres thick.
The water probably came from comets or, possibly, asteroids, on the mercury hammered.
Nobody bring the Fund of ice but with the existence of life on the planet, said the Chefwissenschaftler the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature of the mercury can be up to 426 degrees Celsius.
The findings could help to clarify, such as water and other building blocks of life in other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the Erdenbürgern probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix, the Depths of the universe to explore.
From time to time, send pictures to the earth: Small, as well as peepholes into infinite space.
The image comes from a camera, the German scientists from the Max Planck Institute have developed.
The eight planets in our solar system, in addition, the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, the past Neptune orbits around the sun, is Ceres, according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006 no "Planet".
This section of the image of an infrared image from Spitzer shows a "family portrait" of countless Sternengenerationen: The oldest stars are as blue dots to recognize, difficult to identify the pink "newborn" in Sternenkreissaal.
This sternenbildende Region of scientists unromantic W5 - has the telescope pointed in the constellation Cassiopeia discovered, at a distance of 6500 light-years.
This dazzling glow of a dying star has the Spitzer space telescope, Nasa added.
The Donut-shaped Ring is made from Material that is the star in the dying process herausschleuderte.

One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool galaxy
Depending on the color scheme will be taking pictures of spiral galaxies true works of art.
By the European southern Observatory published photograph shows the several thousand light-years away in Trifid nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The Name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (divided in three parts, dreigespalten), since dark Staubstreifen the glowing heart of the star-birthplace three share.
In the constellation Ophiuchus, astronomers have been the harbinger of a cosmic collision photographed: 400 million light-years away from the earth lawn of the nuclei of two verschmelzender galaxies each other and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star-birth drew the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Who technical abbreviations are not, like your nickname southern wheel of fire.
The photo from the Hubble space telescope shows an excerpt from the Irisnebel in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1400 light years distant fog consists of specks of dust, the ten to one hundred Times smaller than ordinary dust.
This picture was made of the optical and x-ray images of different types of telescopes together.
It shows a Ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from earth.
This group of galaxies, Arp 273 called, took the Hubble space telescope for Nasa.
The larger spiral galaxy is what researchers call UGC 1810.
In this Nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our milky way.
The Sternenwiege always produces new Youngster.
Also this star-cloud connected with the rosette nebula, brings new Babysterne - 5000 light years away from earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small Black hole there is no dust, but only Gas.
Researchers suspect that he only shortly after the big Bang, when the universe mainly hydrogen was to be found.
Our insight into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope should 1608 by Hans Lipperhey have been invented before Galileo Galilei it a year later to Sternenbeobachtung began.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes become larger and larger and the insights they provide, deeper and deeper.
for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was the Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego, the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It makes looks into space over two levels, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The inner workings of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary island of La Palma is huge - alone in the mirror comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented in order to save costs.
Nevertheless, he reaches a diameter of about eleven metres.
The disadvantage of cheap construction: The telescope is in his elevation lashed, and so in his mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is in the angle of elevation fixed.
Its special feature: the high Lichtsammelkraft.
This ranges, namely - despite a comparatively low mirror - the world's largest optical telescopes approach.
With the help of a radiotelescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) listen to researchers All for alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), each computer owners to help, by computing power is available.
Look at the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - his name.
With its total of four Mirror can the telescope also the middle infrared spectrum lighting.
Also on the Chilean ESO Observatory, the European Extremely Large Telescope planned.
His primary mirror should whopping 42 meters and almost 1000 mirror elements put together.
With images, but at the earliest in 2018 is to be expected.
Until 2007 were the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea as the largest in the world.
They offer two mirror each with an average of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, next to you with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF in the sky looks.
Also on Mauna Kea, a new, huge telescope, with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is on an Illustration to marvel at.
The most important impressions from the All, however, provides the Hubble space telescope.
Since the 24. In April 1990, it provides pictures of the far-off worlds.
Since March 2009, is looking for the Kepler space telescope for extrasolar planets - especially to those which are habitable.
On 2. February 2011, Nasa announced that 1235 Planetenkandidaten since Missionsbeginn were determined.
In the picture are the final launch preparations at the space telescope Kepler documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the earliest in 2018, on Board a Ariane5 rocket into space shot.
The primary mirror of the Weltrauminfrarotteleskops has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It should be according to the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big Bang are looking for.
Scientists assume, that even at the South pole of the mercury ice exists.
However, there are no reliable data, because the Messenger far closer to the North pole to the planet orbits.
Radar measurements have for decades been suggested that it is on the mercury ice cream.
By the 2004 launched Messenger probe - the first, to the mercury orbits - the scientists have now certainty.

A search for clues in the country, in the 97-Year-old is still relatively young.
The ride through the Talysch mountains is extremely romantic to call.
The minibus rumbles on the winding road past the densely forested hills, raging rivers and simple peasant houses.
Everything is green and lush, you might think you were in the black forest.
But this is the deepest in the South of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talyschen, not much is known, except that they are perfect, Persian, as well as Aserisch speaks and very durable.
Terminus is in Lerik.
The small town of shows off to a strong side of the architecture from the Soviet era, the so-not in the picturesque mountain landscape fit.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too burdensome, the directions of Azerbaijan's capital city Baku.
For the 323 kilometers, you need eight hours, because the road is only one lane.
The fabled wealth of the country, its Oil in the Caspian sea owes, is here in the province has not yet arrived.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik the potential to be a tourist attraction.
"Baku was in may with the Eurovision Song Festival, famous - and in the next year we have here is a Festival of the oldest people in the world", says Fatulayeva.
She is the Director of the Museum for longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the Vita of about eight dozen Talyschen from the area, documented, older than 100. Fatulayeva shows on a Black-and-White photo.
Here is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years ago, a child fathered
But the controversial Star of the Museum is the shepherd He Müslümov, the 168-year-old should be.
A birth certificate, however, there is not.
And in the face of the oldest documented people, the 122 years old, appears Müslümovs age but extremely doubtful.
"in 1805 he was here in the Region, born in 1973, he died," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three Times and was 23 had children, at the age of 136 years he still has a daughter who have witnessed.
Has He Müslümov so in his old age, at a couple of decades will be charged?
But Rembrandt Scholz, Researchers at the Max-Planck-Institute in Rostock, of the Aged in Central Asia belongs to.
"Quite a lot of hochaltrige people, there are also some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia life is extremely lots of very old men".
Because of the lack of documents is, however, no scientific evidence about the age, to lead, particularly since the civil registry were missing.

But the fact is that the people of the Region around Lerik remarkably often, a biblical age.
Currently, there are 20 persons older than 100 years.
So why live here in the South are so many very old people?
The aserische guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that with the special genes of the Talyschen.
Curator Fatulayeva, in contrast, believes that it is up to the diet of the table.
But that of all the high calorie diet of the Talyschen to be so healthy, meat, bread, and especially dairy products, love and many of which are a daily glass of melted Butter drink, appears from the nutritional point of view is just not plausible.
Or is it the original way of life, the people are young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With its 97 years, it is for these Latitudes is still relatively young.
Mirzayeva, the claims, 143 descendants, who lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the entire Caucasus region.
She is sitting on the ground with a butter churn, you tirelessly out - and ist rolling.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both of which are long-grandparents.
Also two young children jump around.
In the kitchen to prepare the guests with tea, in the typical, bauchförmigen Armadu lenses is served.
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfect in Rank and file, under her headscarf hides long, dark blonde braids, her son pride before us reveals.
I have my hair is always washed with milk, so they went, I never made and kept their color.
"Shampoo I've also never used", says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She has just eaten, what of your own yard, and was, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
My whole life I have not a single Time in the supermarket food purchased.
Then, she tells her husband, who was in the army.
At the worst it was in the period after the Second world war.
But anything was better than the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took the helm.
The Propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult to the father of the Nation is driven to his country as a dictator ruled that knows no limits in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003, he was in Power, and later was taken over by his son, Ilham, the rudder.
After all, there is no Need of Azerbaijan Old.
230 manats (approximately the same amount in euros), receives Mirzayeva of a monthly pension, for local circumstances, an amount that you can live very well.
And maybe has also Mirzayevas long grizzled son of law: "The Old enjoy in our culture, respect."
You are living in the midst of the extended family, to be loved, cared for and are happy.
If no reason is, as long as you can to stay alive
The word "human right" is missing in the Constitution
The Revolution is returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future Constitution of Sharia law as the Basis is a highly controversial topic.
The Egyptian President was not sparing with Pathos.
We need to make the Transition.
"And that he will succeed, is part of my responsibility before the people and before God," he told state television.
His speech was sent to all people, especially to do with the Christian Copts, the liberal, enlightened Muslims and Secular.
Because you all, so far hopelessly divided in a confused Opposition, have fear.
Fear of a theocracy on the Nile river by the grace of the powerful Muslim brotherhood.
He had so said Mohammed Mursi, almost apologetically, the competences of the constitutional court temporarily curtailed and its competences, "to the Revolution to save".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a Ph.D. from the American University of southern California bears, really wants to save, the Egyptians, the world is not quite Clear.
Should the judiciary disempowered?
Actually, the article 234 of the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly, because in the night, 15-hour tour de force durchgepeitscht were partly a matter of concern.
As in previous constitutions, it is said in the draft that the jurisdiction of the reasons on the "principles of Islamic Law".
But what is called "principles"?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is to be feared that the Islamists the vague formulation and the ensuing legal scope for a more stringent interpretation of the Sharia.
This is at least a new hinzugeführter article near: In all the Sharia matters must be the Al-Ashar University be consulted, the most important Islamic Institution in the country with great charisma in the entire Sunni Islam.
This is not necessary, but it can mean that the clergy of the legislation supervised, what are the de facto disenfranchisement of the judiciary as a consequence.
Much in the Verfassunsgsentwurf is a matter of interpretation
Also problematic: The civil-military courts should continue to remain in force.
These dishes served during Mubarak's rule for the suppression of opposition.
After the fall of the dictator sat up to 11,000 civilians in Militärhaft.
The state should also, as it stands in the draft, "the true nature of the Egyptian family" protect "and their morale and promote its values".
This is legal so blurred formulated by state institutions, with the help of this article, even the content of film art and literature could check.
In other words, it means nothing other than censorship.
No article by the way, writes explicitly the equality of men and women.
This prohibits the other, the prophet Mohammed and his messengers to insult or slander.
But what an insult is and how they will be punished, remains unclear.
Equally dubious seems the formulation of the "insult of the people" was prohibited.
Ranges as a caricature of the President or a joke at the expense of a jurist?
Subject to interpretation, as with so much in the draft, the Mursi to signature exists, and according to his words, "very soon" the Egyptians to the referendum will be presented.
"The Revolution has returned to the"
The Opposition was formed for weeks against the Overwhelming power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in an unusual display of unity on Friday night in Tahrir square, Cairo, and praised the Charter on a case to bring before it can enter into force.
"The Revolution has returned and we shall win", said Hamdin Sabbahi, came in third in the presidential election.
Nobel peace prize winner and Ex-chief of the International atomic energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei said the draft Constitution belong "to the garbage of history".
Via short message service Twitter, he accused the trailer Mursi, a "coup against democracy".
"If he Referendum exclaims, are we to his Palace to go and bring him down," said the opposition Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brethren is not yet atoned for", - quoted the Egyptian media, the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that the Referendum does not monitor want to, making it invalid.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim brotherhood blew themselves for a counter-demonstration, as a precaution, but not in Tahrir square, but after a Massengebet on the other Bank of the Nile before the Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafists were a part of it, and cried: "The people, calls for the application of the law of God."
They asked Mursi: "clear out of the country!" and asserted: "The Koran is our Constitution."
A fight for the sovereignty of the emblematic Tahrir square, on which everything took its start, would probably have an internal States recalled.
The wanted Mursi's followers obviously not risk.
The Muslim brotherhood is declared, both the opponents of the draft Constitution as well as the proponents would have loudly and clearly expressed.
Now is the time, the people at the ballot box to decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the design of the Islamists is considered safe.
"The word of human rights even before"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this accelerating the constitutional process, which is actually up to the February would have a go and all social forces to integrate.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and President of the Egyptian organization for human rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim brotherhood, as under Mubarak in prison sat or were before court.
Not because he is their belief would share, but because, to him, human rights are indivisible.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, imprisoned.
"And now, the word human rights, not once in the new Constitution", he laments, in an interview with the "Welt am Sonntag".
Mursi Hegemony on all three powers of the state were the lawyer resigned.
These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy and Egypt in a new dictatorship.
"Rather than the strengthening of civil society, set by the President, de facto, cease to be in force," complains Saeda.
But without civil society organisations could be a democracy does not work.
Saeda feels left alone by the international community, the ideological Richtungskampf on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement considered.
This could take revenge.
A protester on Tahrir warns: "you gebährt a Monster you don't control you."
Rakfisk from Norway: this Is the übelriechendste fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy the highest standards of living - and not only in Europe, but all over the world.
Could the secret of the success of the country's something with the local appetite for quite smelly fish have to do?
Take a selection of over ripe cheeses.
One place you in the midst of a pile of dirty, humid sportswear.
And leave them there for a week.
So about you nasenbetäubenden smell of Rakfisk imagine, one of the great delicacies of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo airport.
There is snow, spectacular scenery and these persistent smell in the air that just will not go away.
Rakfisk is with salt gritted trout, which - depending on how smelly his fish would like - up to a year in water is fermented.
If in Norway the darkness of the Land and the weather becomes colder, currents Norwegians to a Festival here in Fagernes, the this, now, is really very impressive specialty is dedicated.
"You have to eat it raw, and rinse it with a glass of Aquavit down," says Havard Halvarsen, which is actually in the local fire station is working, but as a so-called "Rakfisk-General of the Festival.
Around us people consume small Fischwürfel and take this large amounts of alcohol.
"Mansche people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk," says Havard.
The Spirit can smell displace.
I taste some appetizers.
If one is to avoid the Rakfisk in Nasennähe to bring, he is not bad - such as Sushi, which quite a long bus ride behind.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there was no refrigeration, gave and fish in the autumn in airtight Salzwasserfässern was soaked.
In the dead of Winter, he was then, after a long fermentation removed and will no doubt use of alcohol muted senses consumed.
Even a Generation ago, saw thousands of Norwegians on the search for work, forced to leave their country and emigrated, mainly to the USA.
Today's population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a booming labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, not too long time ago, far richer was as Norway, streams of immigrants.
Rakfisk is as something Important regarded as an essential, albeit strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.
He is one of the more expensive dishes, which you can buy.
But actually it is here, Yes everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a Sandwich costs proud of 10 euros.
Norway does not create it often in the world media, and most people don't seem to bother you.
Here hates you have it still, Different Breivik to call it by name - those racist right-wing extremists, the last year 77 men, women and children shot.
Instead, one refers only to the "incident of 22. July".
Norwegians do difficult to accept that someone in their peace-loving country to such a brutal murder is capable of.
The main reason for the today's wealth of Norway since the early 1970s, the growth of one of the largest Oil - and Gasindustrien the world.
"But Oil is not the only reason why it is so good to us," says Anna, our waitress, round tablet with Mature Rakfisk is distributed, and with her long blonde hair, and piercing blue eyes the Nordic Ideal is embodied.
We are a - how to say - prudent people.
Your English is just like that of most people here spotless.
We are not very pretentious, we don't like bragging.
Norway is using his oil wealth to be very carefully handled - a large part of the Branchenerträge is for the benefit of future generations in a special Fund invests.
As in the years up to the world economic crisis all the money around threw that you do not possessed, held Norway his purse tightly closed.
"As long as, in Winter we go skiing and in summer Hiking can go, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, Rakfisk food", adds them with light-hearted Laughter.
I stand in the snow and put me on another court - by Rakfisk I have enough.
So a moose Burger is definitely something else. The succulent flesh next to me.
But in the evening it is time again for the Stinkefisch on the menu.
The Hotel, in which I logiere, is one of several venues, a Rakfisk Dinner organize for the guests for the best - or perhaps the Geruchssinne the most challenging - fish can vote.
There is a Live-TV-circuit to a Fly-clad host, the plates with Rakfisk is surrounded.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here are our points, Havard".
You clapping and laughing.
A man falls out of his chair, possibly from the Aquavit overwhelmed.
But maybe it is the strict haze of the whole fish.
Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto, is facing a difficult Start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto, on his assumption of office prepared, analyzed Wants to Grant to the BBC him upcoming challenges and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, the traffic in Mexico city is particularly bad.
Even better days this is a always congested city, but on Monday was a Ring of steel was built in several important traffic routes in the capital absperrt and on the streets for Chaos.
The aim was not, however, commuters on the way to work to bother you, but protesters to prevent the Parliament to reach.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto the Präsidentenbinde and the leadership of the Nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderons has Mexico economically well-to prove, but the country is in the grip of a Drogenkriegs, in the last six years we have 60,000 lives.
"My government is strongly committed to ensuring that violence is to reduce," said Pena Nieto the beginning of this week in the Oval Office, the US-American President, Barack Obama.
I'm going to have a new security strategy suggest that we can achieve this goal.
Before he with the US President on an equal footing, it was Pena Nieto, Governor of his home state of Mexico to act.
In this densely populated large part of the country, the capital city that surrounds it, are the opinions about the new head of state is divided.
A direct man
In the remote town of Valle del Bravo one remembers, for example, to him.
Residents of the resort write to him, the development of tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.
To the city, on one of the highways go, Pena Nieto had built and a great improvement over the fragile, bumpy roads represent, as it once was.
Plaque with his name also hang out outside of a modern sports centre and an impressive, interactive Museum for climate change.
"We expect him to be real and lasting changes", his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, as a Congressman for the party Pena Nietos, the PRI works.
In particular, what is the security and the economy is concerned, we hope to have an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in Power was the PRI in 2000, Vicente Fox replaced.
Congressman Olvera admits that the party after 12 years outside of the Präsidentenpalasts of Los Pinos great expectations Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations of the Opposition, the new President, it lacks in substance, he dislikes.
He was a very direct man, very committed and have big plans for the country.
He was a great statesman, especially, but he was also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the heads of state do not share many people have this view of their former Governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, could the contrast to the cobblestone streets of Valle del Bravo not be greater.
The place is hidden under Autobahnüberführungen and is in many ways a suburb of Mexico city itself.
And the problems in the community are of critical urban nature.
At the beginning of this year the military power on to in the neighborhoods operating to fight drug gangs, and violence against women is a particularly acute Problem.
On a patch of wasteland near a large landfill were alone in the last two years, the bodies of dozens of murdered women left behind.
During the term of office of Governor Pena Nieto were in the state of Mexico over 1,000 women murdered - a statistic that even in the city of Ciudad Juarez exceeds that for their violence and the murder of innocent women is notorious.
The critics Pena Nietos are of the opinion that it is the Problem of the Frauenmorde during his term of office, at least not adequately addressed.
But in the worst case have his government their eyes to the issue closed.
In a concrete construction, typical for the run-down quarter, fights Irinea Buendia with tears, and when she told me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna shows.
The official Version of events, according committed Mariana 2010 suicide.
But her family believes, that of your significant other was murdered.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the rigor Mortis had already been used.
While her mother was her story, looks down from the wall a picture of Mariana down on us. It is next to a cross attached to a single word: justice.
But exactly this, so the family, I have to get out of her until now denied.
The authorities have treated me as if I was a Schwätzerin, Unruhestifterin, Nörglerin.
You want to get your judgment simply accepted and the mouth holds.
"But this is not possible, when there are so many flaws and omissions were," she says.
If President Pena Nieto, on Saturday the Präsidentenbinde receives, accepts, he is also a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been in the last six years of violent crime affected, and the new President has promised during his term of office, especially around this Problem to worry about.
"I hope that as President he is, how he was Governor," said the PRI Congressman Olvera, in the Valle del Bravo.
But just afraid of the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza the most.
The prosecution claims: Bradley Manning did not complain about ill-treatment complained
The Prosecutor's office contradict Bradley Mannings accusations that he was in prison mistreated
The consultation dealt with Mannings time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense is seeking a dismissal of the indictment due to the hard conditions of detention at
The corporal of the US army, is accused of thousands of confidential documents stolen to have
The public Prosecutor's office on Friday trying to find that the Armeegefreite Bradley Manning - accused for the greatest revelation of confidential information of the US-American history - several opportunities missed, about his allegedly suffered ill-treatment in Militärhaft to complain.
In a cross-examine Mannings during a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, said Maj. Ashden Fine, that records to a weekly Visit, the Gefängnisbeamte during Mannings nine-month period of detention in Quantico, Virginia had made no complaints about his treatment in the EU.
A day before the cross-examination, the result of a request by the defence for the dismissal of the indictment was held - Manning was through the hard period of detention already been punished - Manning had testified that he had been in prison suicide considered.
The Geheimdienstanalyst the U.S. army, in June 2010, was arrested, accused of, during his tour of duty in Iraq, thousands of confidential documents to have stolen.
The Material was then WikiLeaks published in the Internet.
WikiLeaks has Manning as the source of the information is never confirmed.
In the hearing on Friday went Fine with Manning the forms by the officials after their Meeting with Manning during his detention in Quantico-the military had filled, where he was from July 2010 to April 2011 under enhanced conditions of detention eingesessen had.
The officials, Manning questions, and wrote to his answers.
As Fine him on Friday to the forms respondents, was Manning that he is the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the establishment as a whole as "very professional" had evaluated.
The forms, so Fine, contained no complaints about ill-treatment, although officials Manning directly to his treatment had asked.
Manning replied that he had his concerns verbally expressed and the officials would have this discussed with him, and specified that these should be addressed. They were, however, not been logged.
"They wrote (after meeting the concerns) "No problems", and that meant not necessarily mean that I don't have said"says Manning.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, asked Manning also why he does not have its treatment complained, as he in January 2011, with a Committee, met him a few months earlier on a form above mentioned suicidal ideation study.
Manning replied, his intention during this meeting have passed, his Beobachtungsstatus to the "prevention of violations" demote.
The military said that it gave him these restrictive Status of a level below that of the Suicide - to his own, and the protection of others assigned to it.
"I wanted to employees convince them that I was fine, and the Beobachtungsstatus on the prevention of injury to get rid of (...) from my perspective, a higher quality of life to be able to achieve," said Manning.
Manning said on Thursday his arrest and transferred to Kuwait, where he nearly two months was recorded before July 2010 in the prison of the naval base in Quantico, Virginia, was moved.
He said, in Kuwait, he had considered suicide, and was due to the heat even become unconscious.
Don't know what with him or in the outside world to be done, was distressing.
"My world shrank to Camp Arafjon, on this cage together," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I would be in this cage die.
As he Quantico was moved, I Manning most of his days in a small cell spent - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours and without society.
It took him only a mattress, a blanket, Flip-Flops, clothing, and his glasses allowed.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion, because the day, it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down.
Always have it with light sleep, from the outside in his cell entry.
When he turned around at night and have a watch his face could no longer see, you have woken him, so he returned back.
In January 2011, rose Mannings lawyer formally objecting to the treatment Mannings.
In April 2011 was Manning in the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas laid.
On Friday asked the judge to Manning also to a charge he in his statement on Thursday had raised - so he had a night naked in his cell in Quantico sleep and in the morning count naked in front of guards and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had during this count never had the opportunity, with his blanket to cover up.
In the survey on Friday was Manning that he was from a command his guard closed, that he is the ceiling, he would have to cover, let them fall. He admitted, however, that no one had asked.
On Thursday, Manning had testified that he was in the previous night was forced to sleep naked. He would have been tried before, a civil servant to show that he is no danger for itself to present.
Manning did the officials said, he would have the waistband of his underpants or his Flip-Flops can use to get yourself hurt, but this is not done.
In that night, said Manning, were his pants, Flip-Flops and glasses from his cell has been removed.
His lawyers are hoping that the judge his Hafterlebnisse at least take into account and be Haftmaß dramatically decrease will, he should at his trial before the military court to be sentenced. This is for the beginning of next year scheduled.
The defense has indicated that Manning is smaller Offenses for guilty, while other charges, as too extreme to be considered to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend. Of the public Prosecutor's office is a justification of the conditions of detention expected.
The Pentagon remains in his Position, that Manning in accordance with the provisions set forth for all under the highest safety precautions in Quantico-held prisoners apply.
The charges against Manning include favouring the enemy, unauthorized disclosure of intelligence information in the Internet, the Transmission of national Verteidigungsinformationen, and theft of public property or documents.
He will in all charges found guilty of threatening him a life sentence.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are due to the lack of opportunities forced to leave Mexico
Mexicans tend to be immigrants to blame - you call them hard times in the memory, he says
Navarrette is of the view that Mexican Americans caught between two worlds are
On a recent trip to Mexico city I had only just crossed the hall and went to the passport check arrived, as perplexity at me wide-made.
Signs referred to two queues: One for "Mexicanos" ("Mexican"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigner").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure of what I should go.
I am in Zentralkalifornien grew up and became my whole life, "Mexicans".
An ethnic abbreviation, just as my friends in Boston "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italians".
Later, I decided to "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfather's, there was no need for abbreviations, or hyphens.
I was just Americans.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough to keep me in this language at both Ends of an interview to claim.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and my American accent, I will also not let go.
So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for Extranjeros.
I thought about that Moment of this week, as the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto the White house visited with President Obama to meet.
On the Agenda were all those topics that you would expect, when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs, and Commerce.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in the growth of the Mexican economy to speak of. It is one of the reasons that Mexicans today with the same high level of probability in Mexico to stay, rather than emigrate to the United States.
He would like to engage with the United States and Canada ally and a North American trading bloc modelled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to take the war against Mexico, the drug cartels continue, even if he has no details to be called.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans are wasting probably never be a single thought to the fact that the United States in 1848 in Mexico for the pictures and the leadership of the country under the force of the gun to compel them more than half of its territory to leave.
But for Mexicans, in centuries, and not in minutes think, are the memories of this event is not to be overlooked.
So, as soon as a U.S. government official also only mildest criticism of Mexico exercises, you can hear it in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country's complaints about how the Americans, the sovereignty of their neighbouring country beset.
And the children of Montezuma's go on the warpath.
And yet, the biggest challenge of Mexico, in truth, in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
Lust, resentment to speak?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People, for the country offers a lot of chances, and others, for which it does not do this.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio life, is that at one point in our family tree a Person - maybe a parent or grandparent - no Chance in Mexico offered and got in the direction of the North emigrated.
And in most cases, this Person is a profile dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our Loyalty is to you.
Not Mexico.
And although, perhaps, we now live the American dream, good schools and good Jobs have received, we must never lose sight of it the American dream is that we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is sometimes may blurry, but what about our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This is clearly the United States.
In addition, we are aware that we have many members of the Mexican ruling class not like.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish is never good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, is our existence is a Symbol of failure.
If our families are not in Mexico failed, they would not have gone.
And then we would not now behind the Seidenvorhang trapped see - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, in Guadalajara and was born as a child legally in the United States, immigrated, reminds me that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans tensions, because Mexicans have a clearer idea on who you are, and Mexican Americans take them this evil.
While U.S. citizen, it sees itself as part of the two countries.
However, many Mexican Americans that I know of have the feeling that neither the one nor the other country.
We love the Mexican Band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You can enjoy the Best of both worlds, but in none of them rooted.
In Mexico, we will be seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we Mexicans seen.
As I have during my journey to learn, there's something that this relationship is even more complex: Some Mexican leaders and parts of the Bildungsbürgertums want your Connections to the Diaspora.
You want to Mexican Americans than temporary "Ambassador" for Mexico, its interests in the United States.
We want our American colleagues tell about how great a visit to this country and to put pressure on the political leadership to exercise their ties to Mexico to intensify.
Now.
That will not happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unjust distribution of income, the rampant corruption and the Drogengewalt many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.
I'm afraid, because you have to go through this alone, Amigos.
This is fair.
If at least some of the Mexicans are not ready yet, the United States for dealing with Mexico, one and a half centuries to forgive, you must also accept that some Mexican Americans hold a grudge for that cherish, such as their family members until not so long ago were treated.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are "Mexican", as I thought.
Old battles, new middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could be as unexpected cornerstone for peace prove
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The recent bloody events seem to have such a hope to nip in the Bud.
In the midst of the usual finger-pointing, numerous buildings reduced to rubble and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed - and for the first Time of rockets from Gaza, near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the Holy city of Jerusalem taken.
However, even though the Israelis and the Palestinians in their historical conflict caught seem, is changing the middle East around you.
The Arab spring has a new, uncertain Situation created, and whether you want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis are part of this turmoil.
Maybe this will only lead to more bloodshed.
However, there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate finally come to an end.
A war that neither lost nor won
At first glance it seems to optimism in the face of the current location is everything other than appropriate.
Even if the on 21. November agreed cease-fire stops, the week's fighting, the Hardened on both sides strengthened.
The leader of the Hamas, the Islamist movement that since 2007, the Gaza strip, controlled by, say, the Israelis pushed back, although its grouping of large losses recorded had.
Although several Hamas leader killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza strip in one of the desolatesten and densely bevölkertesten corners of the planet cooped up, it is Israel until now did not manage to destroy Hamas.
Actually wins the Hamas in the West Bank to that of the rival, the moderate Palästinensergruppe Fatah controlled.
And the Hamas leaders could arrive at the conclusion that the time is on your side.
So, as Islamists in the Arab world are gaining influence, the Hamas powerful and rich friends on their side.
Turkey, a wiedererstarkende, regional Power, once considered one of Israel's closest Muslim ally was, for the Hamas party taken - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic States of the Gulf.
Cheering Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamic Crescent forms - from Lebanon in the North, where the militant group Hezbollah has the Power over Syria, where rebels an increasingly islamistischeren embossing before the Stürzung Bashar Assad could stand up to Jordan, where Hamas-allied to the king threaten.
And, in particular, the rise of the Muslim brotherhood, under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - which is by far the most populous and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel has the balance of the Region changed in the long term.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular Despot, Egypt until his fall 2011 30 years reigned, had only a little time for Hamas left.
In contrast to this, the brotherhood with Hamas to any of their leader more of Volksansichten dependent.
In future diplomatic negotiations could Hamas as an actor prove itself from Israel and the United States is not expelled.
The Israeli hard-liners, on the other hand, an opposite conclusion.
Militarily speaking, the Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli anti-missile defense system, "Iron Dome", prove themselves, and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
At least for a while Israel is a peaceful sleep.
In diplomatic ways, the United States is holding steadfast to their Position. Many European countries have the Hamas for the latest escalation of violence; instead held responsible.
Israel, it is in recent years fared well, in particular, under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, of the peace process, in large part ignored.
Though the rockets from the Gaza strip since 2004 about 30 Israelis have been killed, the country is relatively free of suicide bombers stayed - not least thanks to the barriers in the West Bank and in the body of an eventual Palestinian state hineinverlaufen. These protect the Jewish settlements, for contravention of international law were explained, however, always to be further developed.
Netanyahu is well there. His Likud party in the run-up to the elections on 22. January under Avigdor Lieberman, with a still kämpferischeren group allied.
Why this deceitful Palestinians coddle them and give them a state of their own forces?
If you are actually in control of the West Bank, you would then not exactly like their counterparts in the Gaza strip also firing missiles?
No, it is better for you behind the wall to hold at Bay and to punish, you should dare, the heads up.
Maybe the hard-liners can enforce. But the Arab spring could give you a stroke by the bill.
Even if the Islamists, who is now in Egypt and in other countries of the Power seats, little for Israel left, first on the difficulties in their own country focus.
The defense budget of Israel is greater than its four Arab neighbours.
A war with the local superpower is the new Arab governments are hardly in the repair of your business to help.
The pragmatic President Mursi with Barack Obama teamed to a cease-fire to reach, could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new Era symbolize.
Also, Israelis should long-term thinking.
While the rest of the Arab world tentative steps towards democratization taking, Palestinians continue their right of national self-stripped - a powder keg, which is no doubt one day in the Israeli-occupied territories to explode, just as this week, a Bus in Tel Aviv exploded.
The suppression undermines already now the democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this Situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to defeat Hamas in the Gaza strip over the years increasingly their diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from the outside
The correct answer is that, of the more sensible representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world, and by this newspaper is represented: Two States, in which Israel to enhance security areas to resign.
For the near future is small hope is that the cease-fire outsiders more influence to the enforcement of this solution is given.
Egypt must now work together with Turkey and Qatar, the supply of weapons into the Gaza strip to stop and is better positioned than ever before to the Hamas by the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by Gebietstausch and a shared Jerusalem, to convince.
Outsiders Arab Nations should also Hamas and Fatah to an agreement to move.
This would be more for the creation of a Palestinian state than done with the upcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama must do its part to contribute to Israel to negotiate to move.
During his first term, he failed the presentation of his own peace plan.
Far away in the white house, it seems as if he is just a participation averse.
But, this is unfortunate, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
And this is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian law for uniform cigarette packaging shall enter into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs for all tobacco brands are the same
The world's first laws for uniform cigarettes and Tabakverpackungen in Australia are in force. This brand logos and colors by neutral, olive lid replaced in addition, with dramatic images are printed, which diseased parts of the body, and by cigarette smoke ill infants and children show.
Of the different health warnings and images, set apart, is starting this Saturday, the only difference between the packs in the brand name, which is identical, small letters are printed.
So does Australia, the world's strictest regulations for Tabakverpackungen.
The Australian Federal government wants to young people from Smoking stop by the glamorous image of tobacco use is eliminated.
Here, the government of studies that have shown that people with 26 has not started to smoke, with 99%probability, then no more will begin.
"You can already among children of young age, to see that they understand the message, the tobacco companies with their brand image, to promote try", said health Minister Tanya Plibersek. They cited studies, for example, have shown that children are the crown of a logo with the idea of a Princess associate.
Although Australia is one of the lowest Smoking rates continue in the world and the Changes only slightly on the profits of multinational corporations will have an impact, consider other countries already have similar steps.
The Tabaklobby fought hard against the laws.
So it was with the laws would Schwarzmarkthandel favors what to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes do.
"The laws are to serious unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian forgers will be much greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia to offer.
Others, however, say that the laws of your business boost.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, notes that the demand for cigarette cases and Silikondeckeln to cover the unbearable packaging has increased enormously since the companies British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco, two months ago, at the top Australian court with their challenge to the laws failed.
Zico have up to 6,000 units in Großhandelsgeschäfte sold and waiting for new stocks.
For us, this is a good deal.
According to experts, is the hook in the popularity of social media with just the section of the population, to which the Plan addresses.
A number of Australian laws tobacco companies from the TV advertising is banned, you are prohibited, as Sportsponsoren act and the most dealers are forced cigarettes in shops will no longer be interpreted. Now is the tobacco advertising in the Internet changed.
The Australian government has Internet advertising by local companies and pages prohibited, but has no influence on the international pages.
"Who tobacco markets, and only a small area left has to make its products to apply to the Internet is not around," says Becky Freeman, a researcher in health care at the University of Sydney.
On social media sites like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook has Freeman, an increase in reports to trademarks identified by "normal people" were written.
One must ask the question: Is this just a private individual, the so great pleasure in Marlboro-cigarettes finds that even a Video - or has a Marketing Agency to do so?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry rather than on Marketing focus, with the new laws to deal.
She's even gone so far as to Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to pay to the new rules challenge - those countries complain to the world trade organization about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries-major trade with Australia operates.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
Plibersek, according to the government talks with other countries, the similar Verpackungsgesetze consider.
Canada in 2001 was the first country, the photographic warnings prescribed.
Now these were more than 40 countries expanded, including Brazil, Turkey, and Ukraine.
Tougher laws in the UK, new Zealand, South Africa, and India is being considered.
Many Australian smokers show up defiantly.
The images are not influenced me.
I simply ignore them.
"It simply takes a Butt and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a packet of cigarettes, a photo with a Mundtumor is printed.
To be honest, there is only one reason why I would stop, and this is my little girl.
James Yu, the operator of tobacco, see the "King of the Pack" in the city of Sydney, says the uniform packaging have to populate its shelves difficult.
"I used to have an hour is needed to run a delivery sort, now, I need four," says Yu.
"The government would cigarettes just completely prohibit should - then we would have said, okay, that's it, we make it tight," he adds, visibly angry.
In an ever-electrified the world, it is nice sometimes to be bored
This Thanksgiving, I spent unexpectedly five hours at the airport, as our plane due to mechanical problems that failed and we are on a different plane had to wait.
So I had enough time to get me a couple of thoughts about boredom.
I don't want to lie.
A half-day at the airport on a flight to wait, is pretty annoying, even if the books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free Shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and Kindesentwicklungsexperten lead to boredom as something Positive.
If it is after you, it is for us and our children - okay, occasionally get bored.
So the brain is forced to engage in interesting thoughts to lose, potentially resulting in the creativity.
And because most of us nowadays almost all the time on one or the other screen rigid, come to us the advantages of the boredom of not more benefit.
We should boredom so with open arms to welcome?
Yes.
And no.
I'll be back again.
Like many people, I am always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, the increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, a Professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) that it is not seen.
"In fact, the boredom of a very long story," he says.
The walls of Pompey is decorated with a Latin Graffiti, boredom, to the first century back.
And then there is the question of how we boredom actually define.
John D. Eastwood, an associate Professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada, according to the Problem consists in the fact that boredom in many ways defined and discussed.
After a long reading of literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people came Professor Eastwood and his colleagues to the conclusion that boredom as the experience, "a satisfactory activity to want, but not to be able to" define.
Boredom is different from apathy, consequently, to the effect that the Person is not employed but would like to be.
At the apathy, however, there is no urge to do something.
The key lesson of boredom, he says, is a "disorder of the Aufmerksamkeitsprozesses, coupled with a bad mood and the feeling that the time slowly passes by".
Boredom can almost sound like Depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, although these two States could relate to, to see the bored people the Problem in your environment or the world, while those who are depressed the Problem in see themselves.
Sometimes, we believe that us is boring, even if we only have difficulties to concentrate.
In their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", in English: "The idle mind: The Definition of boredom under the aspect of attention", in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science" was published, assign Professor Eastwood and his colleagues on a previous Experiment, the participants a Band to listen to, to which a Person is a Magazinartikel read.
Some groups heard a loud TV program from the neighbouring room, nothing to do with the content had to do. Others heard it on low volume, so it is hardly noticeable, while the third group this sounds at all not heard.
The people, the hardly audible television heard, said, more boredom than the other two groups to feel - you had problems, focus, and could for no reason, and wrote their difficulties of boredom.
If you try to be a difficult or strenuous task focus, the disorder of attention lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate Professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
If you are a monotonous activity "as the search for faulty products on a Fabrikförderband, music can distract your attention and help, not to be bored to feel".
In fact, he says, we now know that flounders about and Scribbling, often as a sign of boredom interpreted, even to fight against by persons physically attentive to stay.
"Studies have shown that children who herumhampeln may, to learn more and more to retain information than those for sitting still be forced," said Professor Fenske.
All of us will eventually get bored of my delayed flight, a boomed speaker, a particularly tedious Film.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
These differences to measure, developed by researchers in the 1980s, a "scale Langeweileanfälligkeit".
On the scale, in statements such as "Lots of things I need to do repeat themselves and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys more often boring than girls, so Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida - in particular, what is the need for more and a wider variety of external stimuli.
But, in General, Teenagers are a pretty abgespannter pile.
In 1991, Reed Larson, Professor of human and Gemeinwesensentwicklung at the University of Illinois, an Experiment in which he almost 400 Teenagers and their parents seven to eight Times a day with a Pager contacted.
He found out that 32% of the Adolescents in school and when you Do the homework were bored, while 23% said bored to be, if you were not at school.
However, only 3% of the parents stated that bored to feel.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he did not know whether the percentages regarding the boredom has risen or fallen.
He was sure, however, that "the youth as a particularly boring perceived", mainly because of the children and Teenagers not have much influence on their Alltagsablauf.
So back to my original question is: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it causes people to extreme physical risks to take and the gambling or drugs expire, in order to alleviate studies have shown.
On the other hand, examine many philosophers and writers of the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich on the subject for more than two decades researching.
"With the boredom wants the brain will tell you that you have something else to do," said Gary Marcus, a Professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what you do best.
When bored, and this energy is used to playing the guitar and cooking, you will be happy.
But television can in the short-term for happiness, worry, this evaporate, but in the long again.
Who his bored child, so an iPad enough, it can thus be bored dissuade. It has not, however, learned how to entertain yourself or control, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "self-control is transferred from one Situation to the other."
The child learns not only to entertain, but also in other areas, more self-control.
I don't think we boredom celebrate.
Also, we should not be too critical.
Instead, it should be our aim, and we are off to the constant activity and Technologieberieselung feel at home.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"It sounds as if we are frequently to be boring. But boredom is the nagging, unceasing desire to do something Useful," he says.
He believes that the people of truth only looking for a way to switch off and relax.
"In an environment In which we are constantly überstimuliert, it is difficult to be engaged, if the noise once silenced."
In Colorado, there are no clear guideline for the new Marihuanagesetz
The 19-year-old Community College Student and a footballer Anthony Orozco is in the South-East of Colorado for an Offence before a court in this state will soon be legal: The possession of a few Marihuanabrocken and a whistle, he smoked.
Orozco, according to he and some friends at a Septembertag with the car in Lamar near the border of Kansas on the road, when they were stopped.
After the police officers marijuana in the car had found, was Orozco for the possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia pre - peccadilloes, each with a penalty of 100 US dollars are provided and received a court date.
"We are treated as Criminals", so Orozco.
But he is also one?
In the uncertain weeks after the conclusion of the state, small amounts of marijuana for personal use to legalize the answer depends, in hundreds of minor drug offences less from the law, as the location.
Hundreds of offences and to marijuana turn, here and in the state of Washington, the similar measures are approved, has already dropped.
The police keep track of adults over 21 years of age, no longer for possession of small dimensions. This is permitted by law, as soon as the new laws in the next few weeks to enter into force.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced existing Marihuanadelikte pursue quote still people in court.
At the same time, voices of several cities, from the suburbs of Denver's up to the Western Mountains to the new, state-licensed Marihuanageschäfte at the opening in their communities to prevent it.
"This Situation is evolving so quickly that I don't even know what will happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, East of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington scratching at a loss on the head.
They are waiting for a guide to the establishment of a licence system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a period to 1. December 2013 eyes.
In Washington, it is felt that Colorado is in any case the majority of the States in advance, what the regulation of marijuana. There was the drug only for medical purposes and then to the personal use of legalized.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore good for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman of the Inspectorate for spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith also that there is no place or System can do more, as in the sense of a rough guide to serve.
"We have no real precedent, and we can follow," he adds.
The Washington law, called I-502, occurs at the 6. December in force, and as such is also the end point of a grey area, in which the state licensing system still does not exist, but the ownership was legalized.
And unpleasant Praxisfragen need at this time to be clarified, for example, such as the state requirement of a "reasonable access" to licensed marijuana with the prohibition of Cannabisgeschäften within a radius of 300 meters to schools, Parks, playgrounds, childcare facilities to be agreed upon.
"Nowhere is it harder to be a site for a licensed Cannabisgeschäft to find than in urban areas, especially in the Metropolitan area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis", a recently formed group.
On 21. November sent Chief Oates its employees in Aurora an E-Mail, in which he stated that the public Prosecutor would be smaller Marihuanadelikte for persons over 21 years of age no longer pursue, and that the police "from now on" no criminal charges for these Offenses aspire to become.
Chief Oates added that the police continue to urban standards for the regulation of growers of medical marijuana would prevail and drug traffickers continue to pursue.
In Weld County in the North of Colorado represents district attorney Ken Buck a stricter view.
After the vote, he gave his authority would cases of Marihuanabesitz continue to pursue, mainly to consumers for the withdrawal to move.
Currently have to 119 persons for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana to answer before court, although many also for other offences were charged.
"Our authority has the duty to violations to keep track of which were carrying to the offences concerned", let Buck in a statement announced.
The reactions are even in places such as the rural Mesa County, where voters of the marijuana Initiative refused, ambivalent.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, shows adults for the possession of smaller amounts of not longer.
District attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, decided, however, not all of the outstanding Besitzverfahren to drop.
"I don't think that I have time to waste, enforce the law, until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado, the measure is supported, was, from the outset, clearly, that it would not be easy, the personal use of marijuana with the complexities of the government and the legal system to agree.
And the contradictory reactions in the entire state promoted among local officials a deep dichotomy in terms of the big green Experiment-a-days.
In Bezirksstaatsanwälten if it were a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, for Marihuanadelikte before the court standing accused represents and on the spot, as a spokesman for the national organization for the Reform of Marihuanagesetzen acts.
"You have such a large part of your life is spent, people are prosecuted, that the legalization still can't accept", he believes.
As the first States, which have smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol treat, Colorado, and Washington as a national Musterfälle for the legalization of drugs traded.
While advocates and government officials to an era legal sale prepare wait for you at the same time also nervous on the instructions of the Federal government, which the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the Federal level will continue as a criminal Offence wants to treat.
Advocates of the Legalisierungsbewegung hope that the Ministry of justice to yield.
Despite several controversial arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the Federal government has the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other States for the most part, is permitted.
Kevin A. Sabet, former policy adviser to the Obama government is of the view that detectives although probably no doors, to smaller amounts, the seizure of drugs, but probably Balk, under the new legislation, legal, state-regulated marijuana shops to tolerate.
Several cities in Colorado wait not even sure that the Federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day approved some local government authorities moratoriums on new medical marijuana shops, although these only in about a year could open.
Last week decided to Montrose, a city in the West, a six-month ban, probably next week will be adopted.
"We don't want to be in a Position advised, when we have someone license, and then at the Federal level is a big issue," said Bob Nicholson, member of the city Council.
Our community is against this amendment voted.
We align ourselves with what the community has decided, for which the state has decided.
There are still many open questions.
Petronella Wyatt: I was in Oxford, bullied, because I Tory am
Not only University students of today will be for your views attacked
It was always been my biggest dream, a place at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother had those at University, I was once the largest Wissenstempel the world stopped for a modern Greek Symposium, the major pillars of the civilization - free Thinking and tolerance promoted.
However, within two weeks after my move-in Worscester College at the end of the eighties - it was there that I was going to study history, I had regained my suitcases is Packed, and so the first scandal of my life brought about.
My father burst into tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard said it, I would have gone, because I have a Problem with that would have had that fellow students in the neighbouring room had Sex.
The author of A N Wilson said mischievously, I would have left the University, because I was forced, from a damaged cups to drink.
The truth, however, was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, ran, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my unusual Name, or because I'm from a private school had come.
You had me for only one reason-harassment - a reason that in this alleged cradle of enlightenment to be so closed-minded and cruel seemed to: My now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt was an important Advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I supporter of the Conservative party.
Why do I mention this just now?
Now, the current reportedly suffers from a new Generation of students of the moderate Right under similar persecution.
The organized and increasing hatred on Tory students in Oxford now has such dimensions developed, that a group of them last week, the same Gleichberechtigungsschutz demanded, the Homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities to benefit from.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College say they are, because of their political views, "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable".
You are claiming a place in the Gleichberechtigungskomitee your College, to ensure that their opinions freely expressed.
Has been aggravated their Situation by a recently broadcast documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright, and on the Right", the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
In it was shown, among other things, a graduate Joe Cooke, former President of the conservative student Association of the University of Oxford, in a Rolls-Royce and drove with silver suit and silberbesetztem walking stick for showing off.
At other universities say conservative students, they are called "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of the conservative student Union of the University of Nottingham, was in a Sunday paper said: "There is a growing Linkstendenz at universities.
The people believe that we are like the Bullingdon Club, without us ever to have met".
Samuel Roberts, 21 and a student of history, in Corpus Christi, of the request for greater protection initiated, is of the view that such a climate is "unpleasant". The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, designated President of the conservative students ' Union of Oxford says, you have JCR members of a growing rejection of students of the moderate Right is observed.
"This represents a danger for the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of the members," she says.
In my first few weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As incredibly shy 18-Year-old was I in September 1986 arrived.
The hatred on the Conservative party had reached its peak.
In the previous year, the University had voted in favour of it, Margaret Thatcher, a former graduate student because of cuts in higher education no honorary title loan.
The atmosphere would have been even Stalinists can scare.
In the first days of fresher's week, when the new students and the Tutors to get to know, I got a taste of the future events.
I made the experience, that the Tutors, the mockery of the Tory students not only tolerated, but even with joy participated.
Political issues such as the Bergarbeiterstreik, the privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the Apartheid Regime in South Africa found their way into the wood-paneled rooms of the tutorial.
On my first of these events, I should, French texts from the 18. Century to translate to English. On what then should come, I was not taken to have been.
"Miss Wyatt," said the Tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "to translate, please, the first paragraph".
I stumbled across this.
Pitt was a small man, with a face from the cake batter, and pretty spiteful.
"Refuse Thatcher followers to learn French, or are you just stupid?", he asked me.
The other students giggled.
In my eyes wallten tears.
"I suggest that you in your leisure time, a couple of French lessons take - so, when they are not with their social activities are busy"growled me Pitt.
I returned with his head hanging in my room.
This evening I sat in the College alone at dinner, when someone lightly on the shoulder and typed in.
It was a Englischstudent from the second year of the name of James, a member of the conservative student Association presented.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is as it is.
Anyone who is suspected of Tory to be harassed.
For me it is bad enough, but you know that your father Margaret Thatcher close, so is it for you to be worse.
Most of the Tory-freshmen give, supporters of the Labour party.
In a local Pub, I tried later, me to adjust.
I insisted that I do not in all respects with Mrs. Thatcher an opinion was.
This Trick should not prove to be successful.
A first-year students in philosophy, politics and Economics, which, ironically, as a conservative applicable Eton College had visited, said to me: "You are the daughter of a Faschistenschweins".
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was kinky and dirty.
"How Tories have Sex?", asked me one.
The beat each other, or?
I felt myself as a homosexual in front of the more liberal legislation of the United States must have felt.
Would I ever succeed at the University of Oxford to lead a normal life?
I would like-Minded people only after dark?
Should I of the Labour party to turn to, and my natural inclinations must repress?
The three years in front of me were expanded before my mind's eye to a purgatory of Ostracism and Isolation.
The only Tutor, who is openly as Tory to recognize, was Norman Stone, Professor of contemporary history, which has its seat in my College had.
He was not only hated, a Conservative, but also because he Thatcher in terms of foreign policy advice and for you to Talk to had written.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found him provincial and small-minded and rejected him for his Marxist-deterministic Geschichtsperspektive.
in 1997, he took a professorship at the University of Bilkent, Ankara in Turkey.
"You're not happy here," he said to me.
I began, between Oxford and my parents ' house to commute and found refuge with supportive friends and family members in the city.
My father told me that I Oxford hated, and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the forties were all political views are accepted.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said meekly.
Something you would never do, not in my city of dreaming spires.
Even my Communist friends put always impeccable manners of the day.
His moist eyes clouded.
Give it a Chance.
I'm sure you teases you.
It would break my heart when you went.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London was my emotional resistance weaker.
One of my male friends, also a Tory supporter, had the pressure caved in, and his Convictions to renounce.
During a seminar the following week, with a further Geschichtstutor seriously had claimed that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly shame zerging, I admitted that my parents have a "brainwashing" were tested, and called it "old fool".
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father who is the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford-career suggested.
At that time he wrote per week, two columns in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes gave my pursuers.
As they went, I Packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
Like can you make me a whiny Schlappschwanz call.
But no 18-Year-old should ever have in an educational institution under such intimidation and wickedness have to suffer.
And even more tragic is that Oxford was - a University, not only 14 Tory Prime Minister emerged, but until today behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought is hidden.
"Valentino draws elegance of the celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - master of Couture"this week in London was opened talks with ABC Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum and other famous customers of the Italian fashion designer in.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital, the accommodation of an exhibition about Valentino Garavani is worthy.
This has the Designer at the opening of the "Valentino - master of Couture" recognized, a Grand retrospective, for the more than 130 dresses Haute Couture were compiled by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this Palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the completion of a history, whose sole Protagonist "il signore" Garavani, but without its distinguished clientele would not have been written.
Valentino had always been a fascination for the stifling and distant world of the nobility.
In the first hall of the exhibition, which runs until 3. March will be seen, there are a number of private letters and photos with the signature of the finest aristocracy, ranging from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as the trophies of his social ascent from the modest fashion designers in the city of Voghera in Northern Italy to the Idol of the international jet set.
In the nobility to be in love, must not be a disadvantage.
"At least they kick your Tilting is not on your magnificent carpet, as there are some nice celebrities from the pop music," said Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum.
In the 60s and 70s, lived both in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, spacious and elegant host.
"We were all looking forward, if we are in his home in Gstaad have been invited," explained the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, is a close friend of forgotten beauties such. B. Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always been the elegance of the celebrity preferred.
And yet he is a Star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress Valentino
Also, the Argentinian model Valeria Mazza forget the Charisma of a fashion designer in not.
Many years ago we went to a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome to his home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every Detail of his apartment, the decorations, the food and the music is realized and felt its influence.
"All of the guests feel important and loved," recalls the "Top"model, the her career in the week of Haute Couture in 1995 in Paris began.
"He never goes out of fashion, because its Designs, works of art," she says finally..
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession with rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was in a glorious and 60 metres long runway is transformed a role reversal suggests: the user takes the place of the model and is the catwalk along to a dream "audience" to admire the masterpieces of Valentino, as, for example, the dress, the Jackie Kennedy for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis chose, the costumes, the Monica Vitti in "La Notte" carried, or a coat made of wool and leather, and of the Empress Farah Diba belonged.

For four Euro put the institution of the Indonesian volcano your life and your health at risk if you are 70 pounds of sulfur on the steep, stony ways to wear.
There are people for whom their work is a hell, and other work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners, earn their living by sulfur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the East of the Indonesian island of Java to get.
To do this, he every day down on the floor of his crater where rising up from the earth out of the sulfur-containing Gas in contact with the air solidified.
After he had a great Schwefelsteine has broken out, the total of up to 70 kilos can weigh, it transports you into two bamboo baskets on their shoulders, on the sloping paths from stone.
Although there are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, up to a height of 2386 meters rises, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the Schildkrötentempo, with the balance to keep your steps carefully, so you don't slip and fall.
You know that each step of your life can cost as this is a French tourist happened years ago, on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen crashed.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for each Kilo of sulfur, which reduce it.
Once at the top, blast its way between the tourists, as Zirkusaffen shooting and running with the tiring heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale, a mining company, a little further down, at an altitude of 1850 metres, has set in
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, since 1960, the Deposits in the volcano and (never been better said) his workers exploited, where you 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Euro cents) for each Kilo of sulfur pays.
The sold then for every 10,000 rupees (83 cents) in the petrochemical industry, because of this Mineral in everyday life is widespread and for the production of matches, Feuerwerksartikeln, cosmetics, dynamite, and even to the Bleaching of sugar is used.
"Because we typically 70 kg, we obtain for each way about 46.000 rupees (3,8 Euro) ", explains to us Anto, in most cases, three routes a day makes.
For each route it needs three hours, what he's done completely at the end of the day he has but then 138.000 rupees (11,5 Euro).
What a miserable wage for such a seemingly inhuman effort looks, but the Triple of what he's with the field work would earn.
"The Tagelohn of the miners here, where in the coffee harvest of 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros) a day to be paid and the average monthly income of two million rupees (167 EUR) is very high," explains the carrier, the previously as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali worked.
There, he earned the 75,000 rupees (6,2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is with his family after Banyuwangi, a village in the vicinity, returned, and for a reason that in Indonesia as important as the sulfur is: "I have a girl from Bali married, where they are Hindus, and I have you to Java and brought to convert to Islam".
Anto has Asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs frequently, and his eyes because of the toxic gases irritated.
The 27-year-old Anto since the three years of his life on the Kawah Ijen the game, its sulfur when he is already the first traces, although his face with a mask and special glasses covers.
Anto has Asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs frequently, and his eyes because of the toxic gases from the volcano irritated.
This is the price he wants to Achieve his dream must pay.
"I'll be here for another two years to work, because I have a Shop or Spanish, or French would like to learn," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent, but from life gestrafte young man could be considered as tourist guides, waiters or at the reception of a hotel to work, but instead, it does the work of a Tragesels.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other institutions and is available each Morning at two o'clock on, because of the sulfur night out, where its characteristic yellow color in the dark bluish sheen.
The shadow challenging, it rises in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, he of his own money has bought into the crater.
About 400 carrier load on the crater floor of the baskets with sulphur on your shoulders.
Despite their large profits has the mining company the Schwefelabbau not mechanized, in order to save costs, and provides the carriers, the own-account work and according to the weight to be paid, no equipment.
You also get to any part of the 30,000 rupees (2,5 Euro) Supplement per camera, the guardians of this nature Park together with the admission fee in the amount of 15,000 rupees (1,2 Euro) of the tourists require, to take pictures of the volcano and the human Tragesel come.
"This work is for the animals and not for the people," protested Madrusin, a stocky, a 42-year-old institution, the three decades since Leaving school at the Kawah Ijen works.
He is capable of up to 110 kg to wear and assured that he continues, "as long as it is", because he has the money for the education of his three children aged between 10 and 18 years needs.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here, because the volcano my whole life was.
Even if the sulfur throat burns and the eyes itch, if the Wind suddenly turns and the miners in the thick pillars can become trapped, out of the crater rise, men are so hard that no one about serious diseases complains ... of course, apart from the usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and blow on the shoulders, the weight of baskets and deformed.
With the basket on his back is Unainik with its 53 years, is only able to 50 kg to wear.
Every day break he and his companions 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, the three Trucks on a Path between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari in 18 km distance to be transported.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here, because the volcano my whole life was" explains Unainik, his mouth wide open, in which some of the missing teeth.
Of his five children works of the Oldest his 30 years as sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but the Armseligkeit holds Generation to Generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: those who, as human workhorses of the Kawah Ijen work.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans will push the blame for this, that you have no children, on the career, the Stress and the cost of the real estate and the child-rearing.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a Patriotic husband, You're my Patriotic wife: we Fulfill our civic duty, and we create life!
It appears unglaubhaft, that the Verse part of a promotion for breath mints are, but nevertheless - or perhaps because of it - they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viral Video on YouTube.
The sentences are part of a Rapper Songs, the local sayings such. Example Slide is a "bao" (loaf) in the oven, to find out about the low birth rate in Singapore to make it funny.
The advertising company BBH, the Video has turned maintain the hope that the commercial funny way achieved, draw attention to the Problem.
Your creative Director Douglas Hamilton says that he has the Power of music was going to use that to get people to their "national duty".
This is something just for the Internet, which is why we had it funny and fun to make.
It is the biggest Problem in this country.
In Breeding we are the Worst in the world, therefore, we realized that it is a topic that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government is much had tried as such. As the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organization of Speed Dating evenings (fast flirting).
Possible that many of these ideas were creative, they led, but not necessarily to success.
Therefore, we thought: Why don't we make something as creative as possible in order to address this Problem, as such. As a Rap to compose?
1,2 children
Who is this topic is not easy to take, is the Singapore government.
Every year you at 1,300 US dollars for political measures, in order the citizens to encourage more children to get.
A package of the government for married couples and parents grants of up to $ 15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits.
But everything has so far had little success.
Singapore is a rich, leading high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also for the conservatism of its Rulers and its strict social controls is known.
In accordance with its national Bevölkerungsbehörde, the fertility rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last Time the Rate on 2 - fraud-which is also the Ersetzungsrate is known - was in the year of 1976.
So why get Singaporeans have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of the marriage and family policy of the national Bevölkerungsbehörde, says that this is a "better education" and "greater career opportunities", was due.
"This has the people, except to marry and to found a family, to form far more options in terms of goals in life to have and to set priorities," she explains.
These Changes in the social conditions have contributed to the higher number of Single adults, and the Delay of marriage and births contributed, which will result in the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, introduced an immigration policy to a sharp increase in immigration is aimed to the reduction of the population, to feelings of resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely concealed xenophobia against many new immigrants blooms, particularly against the Chinese people to be criticized for that you keep wages low and do not integrate.
The increase in Immigration is also considered as one of the reasons considered that the ruling party in Singapore last year, its worst election result since the independence achieved.
Since the elections, an attempt was made, the Problem with higher contributions and dues for foreign workers to be correct.
Unexpected Consequences
While the falling birth rate, the well-known effects on the economic growth of a Nation, the tax revenues, the cost of healthcare and immigration policy, demonstrated by the example of Singapore also have unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve, that not so many small apartments to be built.
So she already has also impact on the housing market.
The authority for urban development has begun, the number of small apartments to control, as the "shoeboxes" are well known and in certain areas of the city can be built.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters, and show a major success.
However, there is concern that the Lifestyle of the Single can promote, and that the construction companies deter large apartment for families to build.
But Lim Yew Soon, General Director of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoeboxes" much faster than larger units to sell.
They are so popular, and the units are to days and even weeks sold out faster than the larger units.
This means that for our Cash Flow much better.
He is, however, that the new standards developers clearer guidance, which previously obstacles put in the way, if you have too many small units in a project to build.
Too much Stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if these new rules, the way to increase the national birth rate could cause, the discussions with the Singapurern, the financial work, see that you do not have great impact.
"The people who are severely stressed the apartments and the education is expensive, which is why many delayed" says a young Manager.
The children can get another.
"For me it is important to use my own money and time to come," says another, about twenty years old man.
Men and women perform their career, the Stress and the cost of the property and the education as the reasons why you have no children.
That is why Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to children - because the government can still do so much.
The offline Private is offline online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary it refers to the property privately or "that area of private life, where you are entitled to protection against any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this Definition to his everyday life and the social networks applied?

El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 years, often in the road network.
In four of the cases associated with the term with "something very own" on a personal level, and "on the password and the user", if you set it on social networks are applied.
"My deepest secrets I would not in a Post to announce" says the 10-year-old Jorge when you try, the meaning of "private" in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger to explain where he had been for two years on accounts.
"These are very sensitive secrets, my mother may know you, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB, I invite beautiful images or pictures of Playing high.
I sell me my time with Friends.
"I would not have a picture to share, not by me or by someone who is the fool power," he says.
The Boy is Aware that it is wrong, obscene photos, Naked, from crime to publish, or offensive or violent to write comments.
Jorge insured, 35 friends to know that he is in FB and nine followers in Twitter.

After giving the boy has no other person hints, or made him after his address or phone number in demand.
"If someone is afflicted me or you demanded of me, I remove him from my account," he admits.
Jose came up to Ask after it in Twitter, a recommendation had read.
The boys are experiences not unknown to you today as Cyberbullying knows.
The well-Known a friend was in a social network blackmailed.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He has never find out who it was," he says.
According to Jose, the victim has the user account is not closed.
"He has it privately."
Then, he explains a series of steps to create an account to securely configure.
Unlike Jorge would this Boy photos of well-Known in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations upload.
Yes, that's what I would do, if he is to me unsympathetic or I him to take revenge wants.
"But I know that this is Cyberbullying is," he explains.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with graduate degrees in education and Learning, says that the children and young people to Orient, must be understood that the purpose of social networking is to inform.
"The Internet was created as a Medium for the search of information; with the Appearance of these pages have the rules changed," she says.
Porras explained that the academics Marc Prensky, holder of a masters in education from Yale University and author of the book "Digital Natives and Immigrants" these notions for the explanation of the phenomenon that is shaped.
The Digital Natives are you, the children and young people, with this technology were brought up.
"We are the digital immigrants, who are you to teach, but we are even still have to learn," he says.
He explains that it is a complex issue, "because we ask of you is that you have a well-defined criterion of what disseminated, published, or may be said, and this in an age where the maturity is not sufficient for this."
"You should also be choosy when it is most Important to you, to be popular, thousands of friends to have, without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, is the most effective way, the children and young people to teach, what privacy is to ask them questions to make you Think.
"To say to them that they should not do, it will not work," he says.
Porras called then a few possibilities: There are things that you are a Stranger will not tell you. Why do you do it in the Internet?
Or: Would You like to, if you have a photo of you, like you published by a friend?
Do you know what the other about you publish?
Do you have the other persons previously asked for permission, if you have photos of celebrations labeled?
And one more question: all Must know what you are in each Moment're doing?
Another point is, you understand, you must act as you do it offline.
There are the same rules.
"Someone outside of the Internet with respect, morals, and other principles, and the same need for the social networks are," he explains.
Monitoring

If all the sections understand, you have a solid Foundation, to be with their children about the importance of Opening one user account on the Internet to talk to.
"For example, age, or what you share or publish," he explains.
According to the Guardia must the children of the lesson, "Thou shalt not with Foreign speak" to be remembered.

"America needs in the Integration of the citizens to learn," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship, a goal is, where the "South America is actually something to learn from Europe."
Correa, on 6. Summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) participated, took place in Lima, told the state television in Peru that the Europeans "in the second world war and other conflicts murdered" and "today is practically a Fatherland."
In this sense, he defended the project, a South American citizenship to establish the member countries of the Unasur advance.
"Must be achieved by the free circulation of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as this is already in the Andean community is the case;however, there are still reactionary sectors with a return to the past seeks", he warned.
The President of Ecuador supported also the redesign of the organization of American States (OEA) subject to the proviso that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States to reduce and those, to take into account the agreement of San Jose on human rights was signed.
The teachings agree never to something, and in return, we sign the South Americans always everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the inter-American Commission for human rights based in Washington and the United States will be funded," he explained as an allusion to the political asylum, Ecuador, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has granted.
Correa assured that he, this decision does not regret, because he does his principles have betrayed, but his "deep democratic values and views on human rights" has complied with.
He added that it is time "reasonable guesses have given that Assange to a third country, and delivered his procedure was not followed."
He also criticized the Swedish judicial system, which is required of him to have him on its territory an interrogation because of an alleged Sexualdelikts to undergo, during "the Swedish case-law, this by means of a video conferencing allows, through the Embassy of Ecuador in London would be able to run."
Correa said that the danger would be that the health and the mental condition of Assange, would be impaired.
"Since he has been in our Embassy, I have not spoken to him, the Ambassador has for me, however, know that he is a slight Problem with the lungs, but not serious," said the head of state of Ecuador.
But there is the risk that he is bodily and mental harm to take, because he is in a tight space was caught and no physical Exercises Outdoors could.
"That would be the health of each people", he added.
Correa said that the solution to the asylum, the Assange since the month of June in the Embassy of Ecuador in London has been granted, the granting of a Freibriefs was what he was after Ecuador travel could, and that this is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe's would be. He underlined that it is with London talks have given to a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with the human rights, this word we use for this case, however, have constant discussions.
"The solution to this Problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe , because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, a number of processes on different European instances leads," he said.
And "if the UK Tomorrow this license is granted, this is, in my opinion, done."
And if Sweden Lord Assange to the Embassy of Ecuador in London or via Skype to the question, as it is the Swedish case-law permits, and in other cases has been made, whether the Problem is done.
Correa took the opportunity to itself as a defender of the freedom of the press to confirm and said that what he does not tolerate, " the mediocrity, the evil intention and the lie, the freedom of expression debunked."
"The biggest enemies of the freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists, the striving for profit and blackmail," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself that Ecuador is not more of such journalists, "and not by the bankers, or hegemonic preservation and extension and petty-bourgeois countries is dominated", and took anticipated, that in case of a re-election, "the Revolution will deepen to the way in this right direction to continue."
Correa has also supported the decision, the right of Veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections maintain, where he argued that the organism is "hard to stay and no opportunism, and not as a legal disguised coup grant may", because "the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay was destroyed."
The President of Ecuador is also the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now, and according to the judgment of the International court of justice in The Hague, the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua bevorteilte, with Nicaragua the seerechtlichen borders between the two countries to negotiate for "absolutely right."
Currently, this judgment was not implemented.
It is a Problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be in pursuit of a common way to be overcome.
You need to be fully addressed, so that they can overcome them and to look ahead.
As well, he trusted on a good conclusion of the dispute over the Maritime boundary between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that "it is for Latin America is correct, international instances call, if both countries agree to accept the judgment, even if it is very hard to fail."
In relation to the possibility that he, as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador to his third mandate in a row to reach, he admitted that he is this way "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa assured, that if the elections in February 2013 lose it from the political life would withdraw.
Makes me personally never been interested, but among so unjust circumstances, such as in Ecuador can these socio-economic poverty only by the political Power to be corrected.
"My political movement had Faith that it was I, the likely victory guaranteed, so I have this responsibility," he said.
If I should win, it would be my last period as President, then I pull myself out of the public life back.
This also applies if we lose.
"That is decided," he said.
Correa also took on the treatment of health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, Cuba's respect.
I've just with the Vice-President of Venezuela Nicolas Maduro, spoken. He has told me he is scheduled for a routine treatment traveled there, and that would be expected that after the election campaign back to Cuba travel could.
"It in no way implies a relapse in the state of health of President Chavez," he commented.

He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he after several Fights in 1994.
Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), for 22 years, which at the beginning of the 90s was hard to imagine, as there are many doubt, a few treatment options, and more Stigmata were.
At that time, avoided even the Director of a clinic of the IMSS, to say goodbye, "because it's a dead end."
At that time AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible that this syndrome also with quality of life to survive.
However, still many people in the hospital, none of their disease knowledge, and where the Virus is already harm and your immune system is exhausted, and the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the Appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e., after the Occurrence of the first reported cases, "means the great success it is today, that the Survival of a patient, the treatment takes time, and the Survival of the General population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, where he said that this Information is in April of this year from a reputable scientific publication have been supported.
The specialist for infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since the year 2008 concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the year of Survival and the quality of life of the degree of impairment of the immune system of the persons at the beginning of the treatment stake, and that the greater the chance they have not drug addicts: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years for a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the meaning of the above, that, who at the age of 25 years, the diagnosis of being HIV-positive, in this sense, "easily 75 years old can be, as long as he is under control," said this professional.
To this progress classified correctly, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of the Mexicans today, an average of 76 years.
Even if the mortality rate in the past few years, significantly reduced (in Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS, of 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in the year 2011 (the annual report of the ONUSIDA) reduced), it is nevertheless true that since the advent of the AIDS 60 percent of the national database collected patients have died.
Alone in the state of Jalisco died in the year 2011 255 people, and until the month of may of this year, there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured, that since 2005 universal access to the antiretroviral medicines.
- Why die so still people in it?
- In my opinion, is not the Problem of access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have had no supply problems with drugs. The Problem is, that the people in far advanced state to come, because your Infektionszustand not know, i.e. in the very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us, if you already have an accompanying infection. To the global mortality influence, are to earlier diagnoses required, which is why all persons, where this is required, massive detection tests, must be provided."
This proposal agree with the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (state Committee for AIDS prevention in the state of Jalisco), and also the patients as Fabrizio to its Test at a private laboratory to perform for him, and this for the simple reason, because it is a friend of him had made, in spite of his young age already in the AIDS Phase was, and even the Kaposi's sarcoma (a cancerous Tumor) had, which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different when you know that you AIDS have.
Some think that they are going to die, and want to hear nothing.
"If I must die, rather then three Times burst", as you say in my case.
The Change was to towards improvement, I eat well, exercise, and take the medicines.
Today, to know his parents, that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like any other.
"I work, I do a lot, have an active, but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and the health of the other Person", is one of Fabrizio, which agreed to its intimate Details with MILENIO JALISCO to share with his testimony those to animate, today, in the framework of the world AIDS day to be afraid.
You should do the Test, if you are in the risk group. The sooner you know whether they are HIV-positive are, the better, and if the diagnosis already know, you should learn how to be like all the people responsible life.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in the year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Between the programmes and the simple citizen, there are large holes, explains Ricardo Salazar, a Journalist from Guadalajara, the matter of HIV has been accepted.
And the most Important is the prevention.
At the certain places "was the distribution of condoms actually increased; previously they were individually released, now give us packages with one hundred pieces, what is good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
To the people at risk for new infections include the young people.
"Why do you need it?" is a common Spottfrage of social workers, Orientierungspersonal in schools, employees in pharmacies and the health care system, the young people do not want to be exposed to, assured the correspondent.
He suggested this inefficient distribution to re-Orient; the condoms should not only behind the counter, but rather in output devices in a public toilet facilities, which are often of young people to be visited.
It should not encourage promiscuity.
It should not give them the beer and Motel be paid, as the Governor Emilio Gonzalez on the question and replied, whether under his administration condoms will be distributed.
"Sexuality looks not so; it is Best that condoms those to bring them closer to that already have a sexual activity," he brought it to the point.
Key data of the Jalisco
There are 13,435 thousand cumulative cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The state is national seen at 4. New and cumulative AIDS cases, and at 13. Location in relation to HIV.
92% of the instances of contagion to occur through sexual intercourse, 6% via blood and 2% of perinatal transmission.
It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, because it is for each registered case 4 or 5 people out there who don't know it.
After the court of appeals of the United States, a judgment has confirmed that the restructuring of the liabilities of the group Vitro does not acknowledge that a Handelskonkurs in Mexico has been reached, an ominous precedent for each national company with offices in the neighboring country created, the payment problems.
So you could say that the procedures for the Survival of the company, the Mexican laws allow, in the Land of the Stars and Stripes in contradiction with international agreements no validity.
In practice, however, on 15. June has been the recognition of the judgment by the judge Harlin Hale at the court in Bancarrotas for the Northern district of Texas, that the Mexican companies in the seizure of their property beyond the river Bravo helplessly exposed.
However, opens the conclusion of the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico, door and gate, due to three inconsistencies of the Supreme court of the United States to call.
As the judge of the matter indicating that the creditors in the bankruptcy law of the United States subject, says the court of appeals for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, first, that the trial in Mexico treated Handelskonkurs.
The first point would mean that the international cooperation in proceedings for insolvency of companies with länderübergreifendem profile is not known.
In fact, it was to this end, the model law of the United Nations for the unification of international trade law, where the American Law Institute as an Arbitrator has been used.
Secondly, determined in the judgment, that without the voices of the societies for recognition of liabilities in the bankrupt's estate, the branches of Vitro with its parent company, had not the required majority for the restructuring of the liabilities would have been reached.
However, this possibility of the Mexican laws recognized.
In fact Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities under the companies of the group, from the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for Handelskonkurse) were confirmed.
Right, moreover, that after deduction of the votes of the branches of the creditors of Vitro, the creditor, in the courts of the United States against Vitro complained, i.e. the vulture funds as such. B. Aurelio's Capital, Aurelio's Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, not a majority, would reach.
The vote would be 45 percent against 37 percent is assumed.
This is from the court of appeal is not taken into account.
On the other hand, there are Vitro blame for his difficult Situation in 2008 in the framework of the major economic crisis in the United States, the country blows granted.
For this reason the Gonzales family Sada before the same court of appeal appeal, so that the vote in the plenary session, i.e. by all the judges, because only three of them voted.
If that is not upheld, the Cerciorare-objection, the Review of the process by a higher instance, calls, in this case by the Supreme court of the United States.
The Serious about this case is that the court a document aside made by the government of Mexico, under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court) was sent, in what of Vitro procedure, which is performed in the framework of the law on Handelskonkurse is described, and what it is pointed out that it is strictly abide by the two countries signed agreements had kept to the Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy law of the United States.
It also noted that in the country the principles of the United Nations Commission on international trade subject, i.e. the set of rules for the cases of cross-border insolvency, the equality between the debtor and its creditors guarantee.
Two bands August: a blow for Vitro and for the country.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The Globetrotter of basketball, Hector "Hetin" Reyes was the Korbsport for more than 60 years and has traveled all over the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great spiritual collection of the history of basketball in the country such as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Before it by a stroke in 2008, wheelchair bound, was Rexes 6 years part of this sport, whether it be as a player with the lower classes, players of the first national League, a representative and head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of the Basketballverbands.
"Throughout my life I have me in Basketball many hats set up, even several at the same time, as I am President of the BSN, chief Executive of the national team and President of the Association in the 90s was," recalled Reyes, during a visit by Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he is with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years, resides.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes exaggerates with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all photos and memories of his long career decorated and testify.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those who believe in his time at the Vaqueros from the middle of the 50s as a player until 1982 remember where he has his 15-year anniversary as co-managing Director or managing Director of the club was celebrated.
"Those were the best years of my, I most enjoyed, because I'm part of eight Championships of the Vaqueros since 1967, it was as managing Director, co-managing Director or Trainer to be allowed.
There were a lot of fulfilling years, including five Championships in succession from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with a championship in 1981, the year of the debut album by Jerome Mincy BSN.
From then took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who is a very good Manager was," says Reyes.
I still do that to me genes Bartow, as a Trainer and worked at the University of Alabama (Birmingham) was employed, said: "I have a very strong and 2 m wide players.
Do You want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players, the Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow recommended after the Freiwurfspezialisten Raymond Gausse, naturalised and let one of our best pitcher was.
I remember how he said that, if Mincy a championship for Bayamon allows had Gausse for a more would be taken care of.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but from a distance out, because in 1988 he already at the top of the Union state.
At this time he moved it in front of, its enforcement, and the Mincy in the national team to enjoy.
I remember, when we for the first Time when vorolympischen tournament in Mexico against the United States won.
Then came the world Cup in 1990, when the fourth place is occupied, what actually Bronze would have meant to be, if not this canadian referee would have been in the us for the last turn, for the second Time to repeat left, said Reyes.
This group was the world Cup in 1990, the best national team, which you've ever seen?
It is one of the Best, as well as those at the 2004 Olympics against the " Dream Team", won.
My favorite is the team of the pan-American games in 1991 in Cuba, where we won Gold and the Team of the USA a fight offered, as at that time, as you may have against us in the world Cup Bronze won.
In that team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and "Piculín" (Ortiz) again, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" colon and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, the 1990 due to a knee injury, could not be there.
A team, perhaps in terms of personalities was not the Best, but we won a gold medal and the us great joy, those of the vorolympischen tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the suspended players because of the events on the pan-American Games in Mar del Plata, we won contrary to forecast the gold medal.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
This was without a doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His Numbers on the level of the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico on this level as dominant as Piculín.
And this, without his career in the different leagues to take into account, in which he has played.
Who was the best trainers from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a couple of good Trainer, such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the boys, I like the work of Leo Arill well.
What do you think is the Best thing you in the Federation have reached?
I was part of the most successful Era, the national team from 1988 to 1995, the BSN at the beginning of the 90s up to 17 teams in a season included.
What remains for you to do?
There are things I would have introduced such. Example, the regionalisation of the lower categories.
The guys in Ponce z. B. only in their field of play and only in the national Playoffs to the teams from different corners of the island meet.
Today, the children have many unnecessary travel and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed training and courses for trainers, table officials and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are You doing today?
I love to listen to music, see Videos from the music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and I go to a basketball game.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who is always at my side.

Larry Hagman was at 21. September 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) was born and became famous worldwide with its role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R". in the TV series "Dallas", where he was a ruthless, insidious and manipulating businessman played.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the Ölmagnat J.R. Ewing in the TV series "Dallas" a Symbol of greed in the 80s was, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, which this year J.R. in a new season of "Dallas" came back, died Friday afternoon due to Krebskomplikationen according to a press release from the family to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the producer of "Dallas".

He made all the joy that knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him a lot.
"He was an original Person and lived life to the fullest," said Gray in a message.
Hagman 1992 was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver, and he admitted that he, over the years much I drank.
in 1995, a malignant Tumor in his liver is determined, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas" was Hagman in television as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "Bezaubernde Jeannie" the broadcaster NBC known.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is placed on the head, as he is an attractive "genies" hits (played by Barbara Eden), at his home life.
He was also a performer of two comedies, the only a short time broadcast such. B.The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72), and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
To his Kinoarbeiten were part of the criticism is well-reviewed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchanting despicable J.R., the Hagman to a Superstar made.
The dramatic series of Fernsehkette CBS over the Ewing Clan, and other figures in their surroundings was of April 1978 to may 1991 broadcast.
The slogan "Who shot Jr?", the expectation for an Episode full of emotions, where the figure of Hagmann almost was killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were in Wetthäusern bet.
Thus reached the series an attendance record at that time.
As the answer in one of the chapters in November 1990, became known, she was of an average of 41 million viewers have seen, the "Dallas" in the second, the most seen of entertainment since the end of the "MASH" in 1983, the 50 million viewers had changed.
It was Kristin, the sister-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) had shot.
J.R. had affected and threatened to you as a prostitute if you do not have the city crypts. But others also had reasons to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of the Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic Smile: a devious businessman and untreuer husband, the striving for his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) to commit.
"I know what is on the gravestone of J.R."said Hagman 1988.
It should mean "Here rests the honorable citizens J.R. Ewing".
This is the only shop that he has not won it.
Victoria Principal, Mitdarstellerin the original series, remembered on Friday Hagman as a "tremendous personality on and off the screen".
It is for millions of admirers in the world memorable and irreplaceable nature, and remains with us, who have had the fortune to know him and to love in our hearts.

As he sat against the smoke and took part in several campaigns.
The beginning of the course, the "end of the world" studying
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such. As the nuclear war, Zombies, Virus and bacteria and global warming.
Each Semester, when the Religionsprofessor decided to take a course about the end of the world to hold, he knew that he was about an irresistible hook had: the end of the "long Rückwärtszählung" of the Mayan calendar on 21. December, many people believed that it was the end of the world mean.
But Charmé had no idea what to him in the following two months should be expected: the destructive hurricane Sandy, the some as the "Deudarmaggedon" have referred to, as well as a growing conflict with the participation of Israel, to the place from which the Christian theorists believe that the Apocalypse begins.
"I have not noticed that this is the apokalyptischste Semester will be, that it ever existed," said Charmé this week the students at the University Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If someone is analyzed, what in the world today has happened, as if we have thirty days away from being, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds that the Bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only Professor this Semester, which is actually the last in the history should be, courses via the "end of the world".
In the Temple there is the associate Professor Barry Vacker the course "media, culture and the end of the world."
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such. As the nuclear war, Zombies, Virus and bacteria and global warming.
"We analyze the reasons why these ideas with the time to spread," he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios will be offered to a particular human behavior.
If nuclear materials in the hands of terrorists, for example, could a war to break out.
This month analyzed the students films with apokalyptischem content and studied in comparison with real life comparisons made.
"I tried, the students about what is possible, probably, credible, and it is impossible", said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania have the Professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague, Amara Solari, an associate Professor of art history and anthropology formed a Team to provide a course with the simple name of "the end of the world".
"We take 2012 is not on, so we'll always have the Option to retain the course of new hold for the case that the world is not going down," said Restall.
In spite of the "impending doom" students have to study, to create projects and audits to participate.
In Penn State is the final exam on the eve of the Apocalypse carried out, which is why students do not have another Chance, as "up to the night work, where the world is supposed to end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours, there were no more places," said Restall of its course for students with a high average, with 35 students filled.
In the weeks before the start of the semester, we received E-Mails from students, asked whether places are free.
The students, in turn, assure, that of course the most Interesting counts.
"It is fascinating to see what people do to themselves to comfort her," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student at Rutgers-Camden for Religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic cults or Religionsmentalität is actually only a question of comfort or Lack there of.
The 25-year-old Student Wants to Wekesa for psychology and nursing explains all the apocalyptic films to have seen.
"I never something of a lessons, where this is taught," he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the surveyed students - and even less a Professor explained, to the last date of the 21. December to believe.
"Our first project dealt with the prophecy of the Mayans, and in a certain manner, discredit, we, you," said Julie Zeglen, a Student in the last year in the Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayans never said the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
He notes, however, that in the Western society, an apocalyptic fear is, several centuries back, when people make Changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world have responded.
The Internet has made this speculation is increased.
"Elsewhere think the people are not so", he says.
This is mainly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a Religionsprofessor the University of La Salle, this year in the Philippines informed, quickly respond to the question, whether he is a course on the "end of the world" would know.
"The Philippines are not taking part at the end of the world", he wrote as an allusion to an exception of a higher instance.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days from the last court was spoken, and said that, if at 21. December, nothing happens, "the people immediately to a new date of thinking" or about were philosophizing that the 21. December is the beginning of a seven-year period, according to which the end of the world to come.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said that they celebrate about "the end of the world" want to go.
"Maybe I'll call a few friends, so that together we can laugh," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communications.
