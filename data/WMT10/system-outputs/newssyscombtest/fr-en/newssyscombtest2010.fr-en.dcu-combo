The lack of snow in the mountains the hotel
The tracks were not a problem that operators of ski lifts.
The lack of snow discourages people to book their stays in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is still possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and new year.
We have a lot of hits on our Web site.
The Internet offers, asking prices but dare not commit to set aside for the moment.
And if they call us, they call immediately if there will be snow or mud at Christmas, "said Martin Jandura, operator of the information portal Spindl.Info.
If you want to spend the new year of his dreams to Špindlerův Mlýn, better not too reluctant to book.
If the priority is given to economies and that the quality of accommodation is then, then we can try to wait a few more days.
The hotel of špindler not propose for the moment that stays of a week for the new year.
I think they will try one more time to place, but they also and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of rooms free will rapidly diminish, "said Jandura.
The tourism agency Ingtours of Vrchlabí also proposes yet beds of free for all periods of winter.
The week of Christmas we most interested at the moment, it is not completely sold.
There are still free, say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That is why we have already prepared some last-minute Christmas less expensive, "said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The agency Vrchlabí tourism may also propose the new year to krkonoše, but there are fewer empty seats.
The first 14 days of February as well, the remaining winter trips are moderately.
This year, the interest in the winter has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow to Krkonoše.
People expect it to to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the cover during the week, Christmas also will be complete, "think Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupation of the hotel horizont Pec pod sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
It was an improvement of about five percent.
We still have a few places for the new year as for Christmas.
There is a great interest during the holidays of Polish January and February also sells well, "Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The hotel Omnia near the central parking Jánské Lázně is also full to eighty percent during the period of the new year.
On the contrary, half of the beds are empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we have already sixty percent at present.
February is a bit low at the moment, but as soon as the snow will fall, interest for stays in the Krkonoše Krkonoše certainly indicated the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The hotel of Krkonoše should not expect more snow.
On Thursday it will be and if there is precipitation, they should be in the mountains.
But the time should warm, Jií Jakubský station of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
United States: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It becomes even comical, the effort with which Barack Obama, president of the reputation of wise, reproduced the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan issue, that he regarded himself as simple.
When he eventually leave its doctrine so hard, it turned out that he had in carbon paper since the Iraqi scenario of Bush three years ago.
Not content to use in the text itself several times the expression "as in Iraq," he has not hesitated, moreover, to use the title of Bush's speech in January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "a new way forward"
At the same time, he has personally criticized the idea of Bush to send new reinforcements in Iraq consumed by the civil war as "irresponsible and a disastrous decision in its consequences."
The following month, however, have shown that the strategy of Bush, who came from the recommendations of the commanders of campaigns, was the only possible and likely success to the point that the newspapers currently do not speak at all of Iraq.
This has not enhanced the reputation of Bush, however, objectively speaking, it was left to his successor a final situation much more favourable than we could have hoped.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
These are the commanders of campaigns that have requested an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, which has severely criticized the reluctance of the White House despite the habits of subordination.
He asked 40,000 men in order to make the situation more favourable.
The president has hesitated for three months but in the absence of a better option, at least he had defrauded the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He has managed to root out the promise of additional 5,000 from Europe, even if it were 10,000 the.
This brings the most problems in the strategy Obama appears to be its intention to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan within the next 18 months and to complete the process within three years. The doctrine of Obama raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt the fact that an increase of half will bring the same fruit that progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders to honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation is distinguished by the exact opposite - we cannot rely on anyone and no treaty is respected.
In these conditions, difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to change leader from day to day depending on what suits them.
The political institutions, although based officially, will remain as a smokescreen behind which will proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is particularly complex balancing the interests of various ethnic groups in given the lack of clarity on the reports, which are further complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "state quick to act", which is the aim of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of the strategy of Obama makes perplexed by his determination.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a heart purely romantic and the reality can be confident that the small soldiers sent in the tumult of the war for "speedy return home" will bring a real miracle.
From a political point of view, set a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban as the indirect admission of defeat.
The last NATO summit has shown that the will of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving towards the negative.
European politicians do not know or do not want to explain to their constituents why security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor that could radically alter the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and that the sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult issue of a resolution of the problem by the use of military force.
It will respond by example at a time when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Each solution of this type will, however, a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Obama is the fact that there are still three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for it is working on a new strategy, should it prove to be a total fiasco.
The leaders of the bank Goldman Sachs will receive bonuses in cash
The employees senior leaders of the US bank Goldman Sachs will not receive bonuses this year in cash.
The company announced in response to strong criticism of its pay practices.
The group of 30 senior leaders will receive shares instead of cash, they will not sell within five years.
The actions can be taken to the leaders in case they would take too many risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is leading the effort to link the rewards with the long-term performance on Wall Street.
I suppose that Wall Street is well aware of the overall sense that must be taken, "said the former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan
The concern is in the details, he added.
The bank Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after being set aside almost $17 billion in premiums in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, large bonuses in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced Wednesday that it intended to affect a single fee of 50 cent bankers' bonuses in excess of 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women received the Nobel Prize in all areas except the physical
These are five women, a record number, who received today in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave the Nobel Prize in the technical disciplines and literature.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer Herta Müller of Romanian origin.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider received with their compatriot Jack Szostak the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes
The last winner was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with his countryman Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.

The minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus has invited to the castle
The President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning the Finance Minister Eduard Janota, which weighs his stay in government because of his disagreement with the state budget for next year as it was passed by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also the position of Janota the cabinet will be on the agenda of the meeting on Friday.
Klaus also criticised the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which further deepening the crisis in public finances.
It is the presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat who informed of the meeting.
Janota then discuss its function Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget, which will be submitted to the signing of Klaus is a deficit of $163 billion that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies approved Wednesday the proposals of the left of money transfers and has increased the rewards of officials, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the proposals of the Social Democrats, the fact that they would increase the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and right on the other hand, disagreement which calls into question the future of Fischer, who had been trained by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics argue that the budget, as it was voted by the members, removes the package of measures by the government of Fischer and according to which the indebtedness of the state.
Klaus, who can ratify the law on the state budget but that there is no requirement, said today at a breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs, that the policies have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "irréfrénable disability" of public finances.
Now there is, according to him, no solution.
Only a strong government could bring an improvement, if he could rely on a broader consensus among the political parties, according to the president.
The president of the ODS Mirek Topolánek has indicated that the budget is staggering and that the government should call into question its existence.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas ČTK said that the idea of a Cabinet supported by the ČSSD, the ODS and the Greens is clearly more.
In its response, the Prime Minister Fischer described such words of "drastic".
The head of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek has responded to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit for this year by the former government of Topolánek is staggering and that it will exceed 200 billion kronor.
On Wednesday, the ČSSD called a success the ratification of the state budget for the next year.
The Popular Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in the new film Clint Eastwood
Despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans say that the new Hollywood film Invictus - Invaincu will explain to the world a lot about the country, its struggles and victories.
The history of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, U.S. actor rewarded the Oscars, embodies the film on the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the apartheid racist regime in South Africa and first black president.
Freeman said, that it is a Mandela, who asked him to embody in the film.
Matt Damon plays an important role.
I told him: "If I were you, I should be able to see you personally.
The actor 72 years who was awarded a prize for his role in the drama dollar baby of Clint Eastwood located in the middle of the boxing has, for example, the leader of a movement against slavery, slave, a fictional US president, even God in the film Evan Almighty but never someone still alive and so important to so many people that is Mandela.
The ex-homme State of South Africa was jailed for 27 years for his hard work in favour of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning unbeaten and it is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak with him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country resteencore and always divided racially and economically after apartheid.
He is able to unite his people through sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world.
The South African team will eventually move in World Cup in 1995.
Freeman has worked for a few years to bring the history of Mandela on a large screen.
I had no other purpose if not play this role in order to bring it closer to the reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge for me it was, of course, talk like him
The actor said that if he and the international rights were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shake my hand, I recover your energy, it is transmitted and I had the impression of how you feel, "he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh environment of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I come to the door of the house, he opened and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was: 'I have the air much greater in the film ".
Despite the differences between the actors and models, under the leadership of director Eastwood has received positive opinion and there is even talk of ambitions for the Oscars.
The film critic Todd McCarthy of the newspaper Daily Variety summarized his assessment in these words: "This is a very good story, a film very well done."
In the evaluations of films on the site rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive feedback.
The mystery of the will in Norway is resolved: the Russians tested a rocket
There has been a phenomenon strange of unknown origin over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence has recognized that yesterday have tested a rocket intercontinental ballistic not far from the Norwegian border.
The launch has been a failure and the missile "Bulava" which was originally scheduled to be the pride of the Russian army is gradually becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His presence during tests of the rocket has not had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, Bulava has not disappeared, or it is damaged in flight.
The Russian newspapers talk of "Bulava" as the "missile which do not steal"
A missile that do not steal but
This test took place at the beginning.
It was not until the end of the flight that there was the damage on the equipment.
This is clearly the engine of the third floor of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" of the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be fired from a moving boat and
That is why the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object has likely been a "Bulava" defective.
Moreover, the Norwegians have not doubted for a moment that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot talk of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket have resisted and the damage was confined to the third.
In the previous cases, the drivers have been failures on the first floor.
Although none of the test launches went smoothly, the leadership of the Ministry of Defence considers that only six out of thirteen have been failures.
This success rate of nearly 50 percent fills the general optimism and they claim that one day "Bulava" fly without problems and that it will prevail even ten nuclear cores hypersoniques a total weight of 1,15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetissov to 51 years has signed a one-year contract with the CSKA Moscow

Fetissov, which ended his career to 40 years in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After the injury of Denis Kuliash we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov is regularly and agreed to help the team.
We must still resolve some details on the form, said the coach of the club Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the agency.
It was not clear whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will affect only one match.
I think that Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mental other players, "said Nyemtchinov.

Hyundai has listened to the unions and cancels all overtime
The direction of the Hyundai plant in Nošovice has agreed with unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of overtime frequent that unions have declared a state of emergency strike Monday.
The spokesman Petr Vaněk plant Hyundai has confirmed.
The management, wants to reach agreement with the unions on a Saturday worked again this year.
We cannot abandon our production plan, it is essential, that is why overtime volunteers have been proposed on Saturday, 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, Vaněk said.
The site Sedmička.cz indicated that the company has proposed a bonus 400 employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will be awarded a posteriori for the day worked on 28 November.
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change the way to motivate its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for hours, or they can ask a replacement leave on 28 December and extend their new aindiqué Vaněk.
In addition to this all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for the costs of transport and for their lunch.
Given the fact that hours were the most urgent and the warmest in the comments and the demands of the unions and employees who have spontaneously ceased production last week, management has taken the decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, said Vaněk.
Until last week, the employees of the automotive plant were forced to work almost daily two hours in addition to their eight hours.
Unions have cancel the state of strike after signing of the agreement.
The following negotiations between the management and the unions to take place Friday afternoon.
The union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were ready to stop the state of strike if agreement on their claims and signing of a joint document.
The situation in the plant culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees went on strike because of overtime.
They also protested against the poor conditions of pay and so-called bizutages.
The management has defended with the fact that employees had to work as a supplement to meet the imperatives of auto production.
At the announcement of the strike Monday, the unions have also asked that the employees who have ceased production are not subject to any sanction.
The unions are asking the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want this year a reward of 5 million kroner (209 €) for them.
The Hyundai car plant of Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
She started series production last year in November.
It has produced about 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars a year.
Czech discovery: a substance that operates on the HIV virus "endurants"
A team of Czech and German scientists testing new combinations that can slow the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it is also on the virus that have already developed an immunity to the drugs.
This is, in some cases, the upper hand on the fact that the combination is not as intensively on the common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at the moment.
However, it can extend the life of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
Consumption, however, a series of side effects.
The suppression of this increase is the development of so-called resistant viruses on which the drugs have no effect.
The work of the three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way for a way to cope with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination is blocking the development of the virus in a different way of all drugs used to date and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of researchers leads them to discover new substances "improved", on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their routes on the protein from the virus.
The metalocarboranes have a single three-dimensional structure: two cages to multiple walls are formed by the boron atoms of hydrogen and carbon and connected by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A virus traitor and resilient.
The HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus which is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by HIV protease there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If we stop the HIV protease, will stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the researchers in a press release issued by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic link, which is then systematically amended.
A little smaller but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on the HIV protease was tested in test tubes and its variants resistant, obtained from patients infected with HIV.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as on clinical medicine, however it is not diminishing on resistant versions against which the current drugs are often ineffective.
The metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and their other properties as their biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are therefore interesting combinations to consider more to move towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, director of the structural biology laboratory of the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and molecular genetics Institute of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute around the budget. The ODS is attacking Fischer, who defends
The president of the ODS (Civic Democratic Party), Mirek Topolánek has described as "staggering" the budget for the following year and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The Prime Minister has described the ODS of drastic verdict.
He said take time to analyze.
The spokesman of the ODS Petr Nečas said that the idea of a Cabinet supported by the ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party did more.
According to Nečas, the head of the government should decide whether ilprend in the Chamber of Deputies on the minority who cares to combat the growing deficit, or if it is to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas has warned that the positions of the ODS and social democrats in relation to the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, but with the proposed amendments to the tune of 12 billion kroner included by the left.
The House has increased the money for the salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's complaint against the proposals of the Social Democrats was the fact that they increased indirectly the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should run a deficit of $163 billion kroner.
The ODS has left the chamber before the vote, obeying the wishes of the government as an amended budget is a variant less bad than a budget.
Disappointment and
The Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still consider the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office in the case of ratification of the proposed changes, the situation might be different.
According to the Czech Television, Janota made an appointment Monday with Prime Minister after its passage to the government:
He said at the same time that he wondered if he would remain in office.
His disappointment with the negotiations on the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight against the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of čssd, which have imposed changes in the budget, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make clear that he will resign if the House ratifies the other laws increasing the deficit, such as those affecting the health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the law on services.
Topolánek: ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
This is the case of the head of government Fischer and the government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing wrong, said in a press release from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some would claim top 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to give his resignation in the face of a fight against the amount of the deficit of public finances, "it is entirely logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority which is currently in the House."
That said, it should not expect the support and tolerance of Democrats.
I have not thought about it and that it will be on the agenda when I, said since the House to journalists, the Defence Minister Martin Barták, elected government precisely by Democrats.
The Prime Minister Fischer has soared in the afternoon for a discussion of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS has backtracked at the request of the Prime Minister.
Nečas stressed at the same time that the ODS would probably have voted on Wednesday against the amended budget if he had not specifically asked the Democrats to allow the vote on the budget.
We do not have the feeling of being orphans, it is not small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not suffered criticism from the chairman of the Party in the House or in the country during the negotiation of the budget.
I have not noticed that my vote would have been lacking.
I already knew when I renounced my mandate that what would follow in the coming months would be a bolchévisation of the House and destruction of all that was positive, reacted Topolánek in person.
According to the new schedules of the ČD there will be fewer trains for the same charges.
The Czech railways will remove or limit from 13 December some express trains regional or less responsible and will instead some others.
The total coverage of transport will fall on the day of entry into force of the new schedules of two percent compared to today.
Most of the charges will not change, including the basic rates and the reduced rate.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region who will have more routes to the capital, the railways will add a rowing pendolino.
On the contrary, an express will cease to serve Bratislava.
There will also be less fast trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, direct line Prague - Letohrad will be drastically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transportation for the region of Hradec Králové eight percent in total, Prague and its environs can an increase.
Two night trains on the line Prague - Tábor - eské budějovice are also cancelled and the movement of some express trains on the line Prague - Písek - eské Budějovice is reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the major changes, you can see the introduction of a new line of Milovice in Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice must change at Lysá nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of the commuter system, the opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The lines to the capital will have their final destination at the main railway station in Prague (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
The ČD will introduce more lines HC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk / Jeseník will leave by intervals of two hours.
Travellers can no longer take the Pendolino up to Bratislava from 13 December.
The bill this year for regional railways: 200 million kroner.
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the Railways next year in all four billion kronor to losses visible, the same amount as this year. The regional trains are ordered by the regions who will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will be up to almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The railways have newly signed a contract for ten years, until now, the length was always a year.
The railways the system, which also explains that they have not resorted to a price increase of the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will affect only tickets a day ČD Net and the eLiška Internet tickets at reduced prices.
For travellers without a map of reduction, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance travelled, whereas previously it was valid between the towns of a region of choice and was a single rate of 160 kroner.
The Filipino rebels still hold more than 50 people, children have been released
The rebels have kidnapped today 75 people in the southern Philippines, including some students of a primary school and their teachers.

The history of South Africa for everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
The new Hollywood film of Clint Eastwood arrives in American cinemas in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus: Neporažený), and narrae part of the life of the former South African president Nelson Mandela.
The role of the fighter against apartheid globally known returned to Morgan Freeman, who has been chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody.
The second male role of the legendary champion South African rugby has been attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in cinemas, of critics and the public are heard.
Nelson Mandela
Its full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on 18 June 1918 to Mvezu in South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for freedom of spirit, in 1993 he then received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside de Klerk.
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great expectations it is presented at a time when the South Africa is in full preparations for the World Cup, and secondly because the media are agitated by disturbing news about the increase of racial conflicts and discrimination of people on the part of the black majority in power.
According to the agency, reactions to the new film are for the moment rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations towards the main roles where "pavanent" of Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is nevertheless, using his own words, proud of the film.
I dreamt of this role for many years and I am well prepared.
I have also repeatedly personally met Nelson Mandela to power - as they say - its energy, "he said in the first official film in Los Angeles.
I think it is a good thing if we had the opportunity to remember via the film personality and the message of Mandela.
It is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it is for each individual, he added.
Wear the shirt of the national rugby team
The film based on the history of the novel by British writer John Carlin the title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the room that gave his creation to the people portrayed the South African defender of human rights during his presidency.
Morgan Freeman is trying during the film to pick up two racial groups of a population long divided and that Nelson Mandela in 1995 it between the national team of South Africa on the lawn of the World Cup, which South Africa had won.
To be shown on the lawn in Jersey, which is seen in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been standing ovation fourteen years ago mainly white audience and has been recognized by the white populations.
Hope that the football championship will be able to unite the people again in a single nation, "said the rugby player Chester Williams, who was in 1995 the only" black "of the national team.
It remains to be seen if the situation tense situation will improve.
The white South Africans, however, are sceptical as recently said in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who has fled to Britain.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.

The damage is estimated at tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure will be known once the fire extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the processor destroyed will be replaced by a new one.
She added that in ten years of activity, the company Čeps has experienced anything similar and that such incidents are isolated.
The electricity supplies had not been interrupted, said the spokesman for the Society for the Northern Bohemia Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova, the functioning of homes, government and industry has not been influenced by the fire station.

Jančura will file a complaint for defamation against three prefects of ČSSD
Radim Jančura, owner of student agency, will file today a complaint for against three prefects Social Democrats.
And specifically against Michal Hašek region of southern Moravia, against Radko martínka region of Pardubice and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesařík.
Jančura indicated in Dvacet minut of Radiožurnál.
The complaint is linked to the attempt by the company to operate regional railways in some regions.
All regions have to sign long-term contracts with the Czech railways.
All three have attacked us and say that the fine, while it has only made an offer for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the price of Czech railways that were signed last week.
So we have to defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for slander on society Student Agency, said Jančura Radiožurnál.
Similarly, he said he had evidence that no region has conducted in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint to the European Commission.
The Hašek considers that the complaint of Mr Jančura represents the result of its media spectacle that provides free publicity for his company and for him.
I am of course prepared to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on other to do the same.
I assume that this will be an opportunity to show clearly that it is precisely Mr Jančura who manipulates public opinion and using false and misleading arguments about the regional rail transport, "says
Jančura has already informed last week that it will invest a few million kroner in an advertisement that the steps the regions.
He said Radiožurnál that it halt the campaign after Christmas and that it intends to resume after the new year.
He said that the campaign will target corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura began his campaign after the regions have agreed to give the Czech railways of rail links to an order of about 150 billion kronor, without issuing a call for tenders.
According to Jančura, such action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions has even led to Jančura threats of a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if it does not stop, we could lose our bus licences.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I do not know who it is, but I will not say his name, said Jančura today to Radiožurnál.
Vaccination against pneumococcal will be free and voluntary
Vaccination against pneumococcal the old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Some voices already, saying that a compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumococcal peak.
The pharmaceutical Institute already for vaccines the maximum prices that will pay for the insurance.
The experts also see clear in the process of vaccination.
A new vaccine.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated for free against pneumococcal.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If you started vaccination last year or earlier, you must pay yourself the following vaccinations.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the third and the fifth month of the child.
Last year a quarter of families has voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcal.
Yet parents paid 1,600 crowns or even more for a dose.
The vaccination of young requires four doses.
Experts estimate that each year the health insurance spend 300 to 450 000 kroons in doses of vaccine.
However, they save on medical care that the children would require.
So far the state spent approximately 500,000 per year for the vaccination of children.
The vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package."
The bacteria are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including inflammation of the brain and blood poisoning.
According to surveys in hospitals, there have been 28 deaths of children under 10 years caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced vaccination.
The vaccination will be mandatory?
There is advice on a possible vaccination in the future.
From January, it must be resolved by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that a compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
The association has long promoted the vaccination against pneumococcal.
At an international conference in which our association participated, experts were not really satisfied with the fact that we have a voluntary vaccination.
This is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased to have been able to impose at least this.
I think it is a direction that we must now follow said Kalovský.
But the Department of Health does not change the process of vaccination against.
We do not see it at the moment, "said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, say doctors.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Society of paediatricians, acknowledges that a vaccine based on the volontariata its shortcomings.
If all children were vaccinated, we could consider a reduction of vaccinations "in the situation where the vaccine is such a sum I understand the decision making the vaccination," said however Cabrnochová.
Experts predict that by next year, more than 80 per cent of new parents will vaccinate their infants.
Vaccination against pneumococcal also marks a break from the fact that this is the first vaccination of children, which is financed by the insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochová explained that insurance should free up funds for prevention, they would save and on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their products themselves
This is linked to the concerns of practitioners, which related to the purchase of vaccines.
The original intent was to buy vaccines by insurance, physicians receiving in the same way as other products of vaccine provided by the state.
Some Members were concerned, however, that this would allow insurance companies to deduct the amount of health insurance. "
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for the insurance reimburse them.
According to estimates, pediatricians will invest nearly 40 000 SEK per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
Always them and we
Islam can be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, fans of the author's latest book, "why the French do not like the headscarf" (2006), an elegant study and well documented on an issue that has divided and concerned the country for 15 years and whose effects are still being felt today.
The last book by Mr. Bowen presents a much broader and more ambitious.
Good anthropologist, he does not want to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that provide now in France this queM. Bozen called "spaces" for 5m-6m Muslims.
He knows very well listen and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
A Muslim should marry in a mosque or at the town hall (or both)?
The evolution and the rights of homosexuals should be taught to young Muslims?
A Muslim woman can marry a non-Muslim?
A Muslim can use a banking system based on interests for a loan?
These are practical problems, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas of concern to the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, a Muslim Arab born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate until the end.
Lesconservateurs do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts lawyers of a Sunni Islam purist associated with Saudi Arabia that today, are a small part of Muslims in Europe.
M Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secular nature of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can be achieved only with the efforts of each side.
He wondered how the French politicians (and the intellectual elite guardian if virulent of secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims have not been spoiled, compared to the Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also had to make compromises with the secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, he detects a "narrow key values".
Islam can be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The view of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other place on the planet.
The ice is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
The oil, gas, shipping and fishing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "on a thin layer of ice," Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the symbol of the far north, the polar bear.
The history and complicated political of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who were their evidence in the polar bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then courageous aspiring 14 years who had to fight the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young cubs, captured as they swam alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a show celebrates 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still generally a millionth of the necessary for an adult in the climate is rarely mentioned: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green because of algae that grew in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and is often on the threat posed by hunters on the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, in America and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada, where hunters by helicopter and Inuit Indians in use fusilsd 'powerful assault to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northern waters of these two nations of hunting that ice will be the longest.
In his new book, "After the ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of the Arctic science and a fascinating glimpse of what may be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither the atmosphéristes nor oceanographers cannot tell exactly the speed of change.
It is not for lack of trying.
Late 19th and early 20th, travel pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen gave the first information on the melting of the ice cap.
The submarines in the Cold War were then mapped changes Sous-celle-ci Sous-celle-ci.
The surveillance satellites and probes placed on icebergs are a great help, but most of the work is done by men, out in the cold.
Mr Anderson at the extraordinary world and tiny system dependent on the Arctic ice, formed by the nets of brackish water by freezing.
But the bear mentioned above the wonders microscopic contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of summer ice, scheduled between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, this may be our turn"
The Marines, among the 6,000 people who have laid wreaths on the graves in Arlington
The first class De 'Angello Robinson, 19, made a trip of seven hours by bus to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier that he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip to Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina at Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was devoted to salute to the men and women who, one day, were in their place.
In a few months, where we will be sent, we will be in their place, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If this happened to me, I would like someone to do the same thing for me, that is why I am trying to show respect.
It was one of the 6,000 volunteers to be gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans, in different sections of the cemetery of Arlington ceremony.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others have decided to decorate hundreds of graves in the cemetery of Arlington ceremony.
Now, to continue a tradition of 18 years, and his wife Karen, each year the journey, stopping in different cities on their way to organize celebrations in honour of the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcester have also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America (of Wreaths Across America), which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers have placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves of Arlington cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the cemetery Fayetteville National Cemetery enArkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City and on the site of the memorial to the victims of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation has given more than $150,000 to buy and carry the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said that she had made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a career soldier died.
While her husband is not buried at Arlington, Hunt said that for her, it was a way to thank those who had sacrificed.
It is a small gesture that can make the civilians to support our troops, she said.
It is like visiting a family tomb.
Wrapped in several layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked between the lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers have chosen ancient tombs, dating from the first and second world war, and the Vietnam war, because they are not as often visited the new graves, the organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, while children played and couples by the hand, bringing the fresh pine costs on the graves.
Each round had a dark green, with a small red butterfly knot on the top.
Nearby, the silence on the Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals without hiding, others praying and families and friends supported in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in stone while others looked to see small black and white, in the wetland for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers in tears on the grave of her son.
It is part of Zanesfield, in Ohio and had led eight hours to come to collect on the tomb of Marine Sergeant Gunnerydavid Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget to what we are free... my son has paid for it, "she said.
"long after I have gone, I want someone to remember him."
A US citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested an American citizen who was distributing mobile phones and laptop computers in the country, said the services of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The National, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana trying to gain access to the inmate who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested under the pretext of being "dangerous".
All the so-called revolutionary activities, including protests moderate and critical writing, the risk of arrest.
The graffiti and speeches are regarded as serious crimes.
Cuba has a community of bloggers increasingly large, conducted by Yoani Sánchez, popular commentator who writes often about how are husband and were followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards but the authorities have always been denied.
The detention of an American citizen may increase tensions between the communist government of brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration which pursues a "soft" approach to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times, on Friday evening.
The new American policy insists that the Cuban government advance by concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and create more space for the opposition, so that the US to reciprocate.
Mobile phones and laptops are permitted to Cuba, although it is desired new and in a country or the average salary of an employee is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government has granted to ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for text messages or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a day's pay.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
The Cubans want to connect often must provide their name to the government.
Access to many Web sites is limited.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few American imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, "says Gloria Berbena, press officer with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any open society, would be allowed -- distribute free mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas program director of the group Human Rights Watch, which recently published a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba, called "new Castro, even Cuba", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as leader of the country to replace Fidel, his older brother ill.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, put on trial and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, when the two countries begin to initiate a dialogue.
The Pakistani authorities prevented a plot to send men in Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities have identified an organization supposed to prepare a plot to send five men of Northern Virginia in Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, saying that they hoped that this case would an extensive network of terrorist recruiters the Internet in search of young men.
Investigators have said they were a personality insurgente hidden, known as Saifullah who invited these men in Pakistan after having discovered when one of them made comments endorsing the waves on on the Internet video site YouTube.
Arrived in Pakistan, these men have been guided by Saifullah who tried to help them to reach the remote area of the tribal belt of Pakistan, home of al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the Pakistani secret services has been informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince the al-Qaeda commanders that these men were not involved in the plot of the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the mountains of northeast become a haven for terrorism.
They have been as undercover agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities said that the men were determined and that they were still trying to obtain the necessary approvals for the entry in the camps of al-Qaeda when they were arrested by the forces of Pakistani law.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and who are interviewed by the FBI -- on the crucial role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and perhaps more important, in the determination of people who trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US secret services have been a priority for men in the al-Qaeda network.
Recruiters of the organization play the role of gardes-barrières, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may be spies.
According to analysts, the potential American recruits are studied closely by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their value propagandaire.
However Evan Kohlmann, an expert of the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that the terrorist groups must also do more and more attention in recent years in the choice of the people they accept because the US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow its recruitment model that so many other people have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen called an "action" for climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants have marched in the streets here Saturday, calling for greater action on the part of the negotiators working in the palace of Congress Bella Convention Center in the city.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000 people, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
The event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists has lit a few explosives near a set of government buildings in downtown.
On a day when little has happened during the discussions on the climate sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists marched through the city, deploying signs in English saying 'there is no planet B "and in Spanish, saying" the Earth said she has had enough.
Several celebrities have joined the protests, including the top model and Danish photographer, Helena Christensen, who said that travel to the home of his mother, Peru, has opened our eyes to the problems facing the country due to the impact of climate change are already happening. "
This is one of the reasons why I decided to join the great march -- to get the word out and to launch an appeal to leaders around the world to take the right decisions, ambitious and committed, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the Bella Centre and said that it had arrested 19 people on the ground that they were wearing a mask or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
The police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the Bella Centre and said that it had arrested 19 people on the ground that they were wearing a mask or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passer-by who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in the discussions on the climate, the activists who were wearing masks and black clothing, have several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is surrounded by some departments.
They launched near the buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, followed by "a few large explosions".
Inside the palace of Congress, people were gathered around television screens to follow the march, throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the demonstrators have failed to awaken the conscience of key authorities such as Su Wei, China's representative for the climate.
When asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English "in fact, this is something that I had no conscience.
He then continued in Mandarin, saying "the event is important, I can't hear what is happening outside".
He observed that the march could be harmful or helpful to the prospects.
It shows the interest of the general public and different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or that they are harmful to the freedom of others."
The results of the tests reveal persistent differences between the races
The federal report last week on the results in mathematics has brought good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the District is still far behind the leading institutions, the report shows that the Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are much greater progress in the past two years in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of the progress of education) is the persistent gap between the results of African-Americans and whites, on both local and national level.
The results of white children in grade 4 (CM1) to washingtond.c. have increased over the past two years, 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their classmates Afro-américaines increased by only three points, 209 to 212.
The gap of success has actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) generally remains constant, falling only one point, from 245 to 244.
The average score of White has not been included in the results of the tests because the sample was not important enough.
The overview over a period of six years is not more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in class of Grade 4 (cm1), when the first report NAEP district was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved by the children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District have expressed concern that the rising celebrated by the Director of group of educational institutions Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were propelled by the white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we have raised the aggregate in considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, director of DC Voice, a non-profit group that promotes equality in education in the District.
I do not jump for joy for one or two points earned, "said Kwame R. Brown (Democrat), a member of the D.C. Council and whose daughter is in Grade 4, Eaton Elementary (elementary school).
Often critical of the management style of Rhee, Brown said that the message of the test results is that the middle schools (colleges) of the city desperately need attention.
Really, you always see the positive signs and I respect that.
But the fear is that we do not spend enough time and energy to our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee said the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson reading system, in classes end of elementary and early college who have not incorporated the foundations of reading earlier in their school and who are behind their peers.
Every day, the mathematics curriculum for the classes of (kindergarten to grade 6 (6th) focuses on the games and real life experiences, as they have been put in place in the District by the former superintendent Clifford Janey, which must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I simply believe that we must continue to work to provide better responses to these students below that of the class, said Rhee.
Others believe that the NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less success in order to reduce the gap.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a trainer of education at the University of California at Berkeley who is studying the results of the tests of cities.
The conventional political solution is to spend your resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
Also this targeting may have political repercussions that impede this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that as the other of schools, it is trying to use the middle class whites and blacks.
We focus to ensure the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our schools so that all families, regardless of where they come from, be assured that their children can get an excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the gap in achievement étaitla duration of the traditional public school, today of 180 days in the District of Washington, to compete with the Charter schools.
Must obtain approximately 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with the union of its teachers last year for 185 days, which it considers a "starting point" for an increase in the next contract.
Make higher education a promise for the future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years, and cligne a moment of eyes at the sight of white columns, facades and lawns.
The parents of Graciela had only been able to complete high school, àEl Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela itself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, when she and other students in Grade 8 (4) of the group have explored Gettysburg where tuition fees are $38 38,690 per year, his attitude was less that of a new student impressed that enthusiastic.
This is where I will study! Gushed Graciela who would like to study medicine, while the guide heading towards the entrance of the building of science.
Youpi, really? "she says, when he said the low ratio professor of law student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that visiting children during their journey of discovery of three days and now they had completely integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to the university:
The question is where.
Although this question is still largely for the large number of American children born to parents Hispanic immigrants who have left the school where became parents to adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit of university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, a "Hispanic" second generation "on cinqpoursuit his studies at the Lycée -- a significant achievement considering the fact that many of their immigrant parents, most from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without having completed high school.
Their success is important, say the researchers, they pave the way for future generations who will play an important role in the country.
Researchers who study the wings say that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
The mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children as it to reach the university -- in particular, if its efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at University of California, Davis, who has studied Latin American students.
We need to provide a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that has funded the visit of Graciela is a good example.
Known as the gear up (you), it provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems to organize programs of preparation for the university that begin when students from low income families are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of years of high school.
Since 1999, the programme has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent the university, according to the US Department of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Oil agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auction that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies from China, Russia and Europe are poised to play a major role in the rehabilitation of the oil industry of Iraq, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies are left with an interest in only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began Friday.
The only one that had an auction has lost.
Two American companies have obtained contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, are of Asian and European companies that are leading the way, "said Ruba Husari, editor of the forum Iraq Oil Forum, a site of information on the Internet.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Concerns about security, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings, Tuesday, and political instability while the US military troops withdraw have hampered the American oil companies, preventing them from entering with more force in Iraq, which has the third largest reserve of crude oil in the world, say analysts.
The American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, especially the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, including labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they had not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the department.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and brought their technical advice, came away empty-handed.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the state, has more on contracts that other companies and is left with significant holdings in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, "said Assam Jihad, spokesman for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on an equal footing with its competitors and will carry out its commitments in Iraq.
The companies to submit auctions have made offers which were then compared to the price per barrel that the department agreed to pay to motivate the production above current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaeda was killed in Pakistan
It seems that an American missile, which hit along the border with Afghanistan has killed one of the organizers of the operations of al-Qaeda, this week, U.S. authorities said Friday of the counter-intelligence.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack against a terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected to have been killed by a pair of missiles in their car, Tuesday, near the town of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities have said that the missiles had been fired by a pilotless aircraft of the type used by the CIA, inside the lawless tribal border of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, where the car was hit, said a member of the secret services Pakistani civilians, speaking on the telephone from Miran Shah.
The representatives of the authority said that local militant suspects rushed to place and quickly confiscated what remained of "body completely.
It was completely impossible to local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two representatives Americans have given unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of the organizers military operations of the al-Qaeda terrorist group outside the region.
Its role was to organize conspiracies in the world, "said one of the authorities who wished to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of the air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this included probably conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe.
It followed the instructions of the leaders of al-Qaeda and has translated into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the American authority said that Somali had increased rapidly in the ranks of Al-qaida 's and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It is perhaps not known to the general public, but this does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, "said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, would be the second major figure of al-Qaeda or the second leader Taliban killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks carried out by CIA drones has declined since the summer, about six per month to two, according to the figures by the Long War Journal, a Web site tempered by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while killing also informants suspected, says the site.
The UN special envoy to Kabul withdrew
The UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous tenure marred by allegations of corruption during the presidential elections supported by the United Nations.
The departure of Eide comes as the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said that he supported the increase, but it has expressed its concern about the timetable for a withdrawal of troops that would begin within 18 months and that would force the other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, to send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, "Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat has also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international staff assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he did not resign but that it would respect the commitment he had made to his family, in March, will spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I simply said that it was better to start looking for my replacement, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a gap of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to the representatives of the United Nations, Ban has already begun to seek a replacement.
The representatives say that the name of Staffan di Mistura was quoted; it is a citizen who recently chaired a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who has previously led the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan has been put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, was accused in September, President Hamid Karzai in the presidential elections and to conceal evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has denied these allegations, but he said that the accusations of Galbraith - who was thanked -- "have damaged the mission because there was already a good dose of scepticism as regards the international observation of éléctions".
Eide said that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the rescue of US forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the leaders of the United Nations to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries that it is attributed to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence about how their money is spent.
Eide has expressed his frustration about the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy hiring regulations hindered its ability to bring new talent.
The rules of the United Nations are such that I could not recruit a single person since May, he said.
It is catastrophic and it cannot last.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the major world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on the nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking before a crowd of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a visit to a week in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, has played down the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a question from a soldier on the possibility of such an outcome.
One of the things that weighs me most is that if I learned one thing in Iraq over the past six years, it is the unpredictable inherent in the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that target the military and political elite in Iran, but Gates has reported that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians in the street.
He said that a "package of incentives and punishments" might be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would be less good security with nuclear weapons "because" his people would suffer greatly 'of these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the administration has joined the European leaders in warning that Iran will face consequences "probable" if it does not bring its nuclear program in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran continues to say that he wants to develop its nuclear experience only in a peaceful purposes.
In the Geneva talks on October 1, he indicated that it would resume dialogue on the reduction of its nuclear programme and agreed to give up a significant part of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed such an agreement, to build confidence on both sides and to save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to be the attempts to agreement - in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my view, the stiffening of Iran in the face of some of the proposals of the international community to which they had in fact given their agreement in early October, has prompted the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join what they had not considered, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before it turned to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "increasing sanctions".
In a statement Thursday in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations has denounced what it called "baseless allegations" of some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and said it was willing to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to obtain a satisfactory solution in the long term."
Gates, who was to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning, the Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, before flying to the oil rich region of Kurdish to derencontrer troops to Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly on the borders, property rights and the sharing of revenues.
Gates has urged both sides to reduce the conflict potential in order to avoid any delays of US plans to reduce the number of American troops, 115 000 to 50 000 before the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm the anxiety of the Kurds on the withdrawal pending. The American authorities have quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan regional government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you. "
In China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by displays of the propaganda, "the Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "a baby, it is a more".
They have learned the lesson that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate of their city and the ageing of the population, have radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their response has been instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
There is no second, said Wang, 31, director of human resources and has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of children notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled, dubbed the "little emperors", a population crisis facing the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and over, 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This figure is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in the rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Commission of the Shanghai municipal population and family planning) said that the fertile couples to have babies in order "to help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and to prevent a lack of manpower in the future".
Shanghai is on the verge of becoming "too old - but not as rich, however, that the developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual reduction
Written in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is, without doubt, the most controversial requirement introduced by the communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay huge fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and to suffer discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have attributed to the police on duty to help the country to avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while lawyers for human rights have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority have forced women pregnant with a second child to have abortions.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to a ratio of boys, girls abnormally high.
In recent years, the authorities of the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they have been more exceptions to the rule -- including for residents of cities, members of ethnic minorities and the cases in which the man and the woman are already children -- and in 2007, they have softened much of their slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research (Institute of Population Research at Peking University, said that the authorities of the central government have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child.
In July, Shanghai has become the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, the posters encouraging families to have only one child have been replaced by copies of regulations retailer who has the right to have a second child and how to apply for authorization.
The city government has dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples, in their home, and slipping leaflets under their door.
He has also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response has been disappointing.
A disappointing
Although officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for records of couples wanting a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The common Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still only four to five requests per month.
Officials in Shanghai, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is still expected to be only about - -- slightly higher than 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in the municipality of Caolu of Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years and his wife, Liu, 26 years, said they would love to have two children and that they are legally allowed.
But like many Chinese, they have only the minimum health insurance and life assurance given by the government.
Without a social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
The Western mistakenly see that the one-child policy is a problem of rights, "said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
It is true, we are fortunate to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only the law.
It is money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their reluctance.
Wang, Head of Human Resources, said that she wanted a single child because she was a itself. "we were the centre of the family and had used that everyone cares."
We do not have the habit of taking care of someone else and we really do not want to take care of others. "
Chen Zijian, 42 years and owner of a translation company said more bluntly.
For couples working at two, middle class, which reduce the birth rate, he says, he must be selfish pourbien succeed.
The people of 20 or 30 years have grown up watching their parents struggle in the early days of the China capitalist and do not want to have themselves this way of life, "he says.
Even one child takes a lot of time with his parents, he says.
A mother must abandon at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the problems of space -- "You must change your apartment" -- and planning -- "when your child has only 9 months, you must write his CV for a place in the best tongue."
Most of his friends are willing to this experience once, said Chen, but not both.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, "he says.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
The group of the United Nations has plans for reducing emissions
The climate conference, sponsored by the United Nations - characterized so far by disorganized and mutual recriminations - is back in the spotlight Friday, due to the publication of a document outlining the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations supporting most of the burden in the coming years.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, said the remaining obstacles, as it has informed the path to take.
But it was seen as an important step forward in the negotiations that lack of time, with more than 100 leaders around the world arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Written by a special working group of the United Nations, the text does not say how rich countries would give the poor to withstand global warming, the short and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how the developed economies and emerging economies could reduce their production of carbon and what would be the upper limit of the increase in global temperature that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility in the process, said John Coequyt, Representative àWashington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has written six pages of the document, studied a text of 180 pages to focus on what was described by the secretary-general on the United Nations climate change, Yvo de Boer, as "the full picture".
It shows the guidelines of a possible agreement in which the industrial nations reduce their emissions by 2020, from 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990 levels, while the major developing countries, during the same period, reduced by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched negotiations, Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion per year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, US representative to the negotiating climate has rejected any discussion forcing the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, in comparison with the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed countries.
This change is a signal that the Obama administration is becoming harder to China that the Bush administration has been two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of the major developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text does not enough to ensure that the reductions could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after the Chinese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, He Yafei has said that the chief American negotiator, was "common sense", was "extremely irresponsible" for having said earlier in the week that the US would not help financially China to combat global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of major world powers involved, defects are both within the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more concerned with the rescue of individual economies that the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States on their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the two dozen countries most influential ignore scientific imperatives to act more boldly.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of the reduction of greenhouse gases, even if the vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major emitters accountable for their actions.
It is really a game in which has developed a new economic hegemony, said ulate, who is also advising on the climate for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to put pressure to for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say that the negotiations will lead to a minimum, a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States which brings together 43 members, has drafted a proposal for a treaty of 24 pages, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of the climate unit of the European Commission, said that the action of small island States has "put political pressure on the political process," in part by what they are now unified and they seek to emerging economies such as China and India, to act.
The debates have become a matter of urgency, while delegates focused on the fact that they should solve most of the problems pending before the heads of government come to an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian Minister of the environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese are descended from their plane and rushed into the building of the Bella Center to attend meetings in camera and conferences of information, in order to make claims that will be considered during the following week.
The true image of the gathering -- in which 13,000 people in and out of the Palais des Congrès each day -- activists guitar players are performances of countries which they will, and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by emails -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is increasing: almost all key ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the big boys, "said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of Conservation International.
Lorries arrive.
In Britain, the first train to 225 km / h will redefine the Monday syndrome
A 5h13, Monday morning, a whistle the night to signal the start of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 225 km / h, of Ashford, in Kent to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the transport minister, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first commuter train Javelin outside London.
He hoped that the new service will allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast trains and reliable and will connect major conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland in London.
The small holes will become commuter towns, the business travel will be much less long and the passage of the plane and the car to train will reduce national emissions of carbon, while reducing congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhering to this project.
But the 10 billion pounds needed to build a new rail network, the battle of planning inevitable and fears of danger to the environment will the British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company established in January for the government to conduct a feasibility report, will make his report to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment can be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres in the final itinerary.
It is also expected that HS2 has three options for a high-speed network, to the north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are put forward in a configuration for which a high-speed line will go up to the West Midlands.
The line in two at or near Birmingham, with a branch from the west of the Pennines àManchester and Scotland and another towards the northeast, Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line through Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best option of performance 'said a professional rail.
When this is completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a an hour.
The proposals will allow the train to travel 400km / h, making the British network the fastest in the world.
The original route is designed to allow trains to long and can carry 1,100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a line from London to Birmingham.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the constraints of space, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
The rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he feels that the project should be put in place, but public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will be built by party.
The trains will be forced to roll out of high-speed lines on the existing track north of Birmingham, journey times between London and Scotland more than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure a passage from planes to trains, constituting a reference point for the revolution.
Taxpayers repay the loan of £75,000 for the Orangerie of Tory
Alan Duncan, senior Tory member of parliament, made payable to the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year to repay the cost of a Orangerie he has built in his home in his constituency.
The head of the party that has been demoted by David Cameron for complaining that members of parliament were "maintained", has increased its loan of £75,000 to build an extension in oak at his second home in Rutland.
He had been authorized to pay the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The authorities of Commons received complaints at the time and have not been asked by Sir Thomas Legg, which has a control of members' expenses. Last night, Mr Duncan said that complaints could not be "clearer or simple."
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, is the owner of a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland - Melton.
The houses have been sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a living room and dining room, but the fees office said that Mr Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a véranda at home, in its plans as a orangeraie.
The neighbours described it as a "porch for fun".
It has not been asked Mr Duncan to give an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation made by the Committee of standards and privileges of the Commons, on its loan provisions.
The Committee has cleared last month of any accusation of non-compliance with the rules, after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan has changed the legal certainty of borrowing of 271.406 London his property to the house in his constituency that he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr Duncan claimed approximately £1,400 per month of interest until March last year.
In April, its applications have increased by more than 1,800 GBP per month.
The interest rate on the loan RBS of Mr Duncan has not been changed at that time, suggesting that all the increases were intended to finance the borrowing of £75,000.
The interest rate standard variable RBS from 7,94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, without moving since then.
The last publication of Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim £1,250 in May.
Mr Duncan lost his position as head of the shadow cabinet in September, after an undercover journalist was allegedly filmed saying that members of Parliament had to survive "on budget" after the expenses scandal.
"In fact, it is now, you have to live" on budget "and you are treated as" m... "
He said: "I have spent my money on my garden and I asked a small part, based on what was right.
And I could ask more, but I did not. "
The member of parliament, a millionaire from his former job as an oil trader, has begun to explain its spending, in May, after it emerged that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before agreeing with the fees office that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist has dug a hole in the form of £in the lawn of Mr Duncan, to protest after it was revealed that he had claimed £4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing, last night, Mr Duncan said: "It was for improvements capitals, approved at the time by the fees office then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem of evasion or development or use of rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
This could not be clearer or more simple. "
True, you all see the Advent calendar of Brighton
The cabins of Brighton beach have found a new way of promotion for the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, a group of church alternative that encourages the spiritual exploration by the creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for each day of December, using as a theme, songs of Noel.
The event began on 1 December, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m., each day, with blocks and wine served free of charge.
The songs of Noel selected so far include "I saw three ships, O come, O come, Emmanuel and the first Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, an assistant marketing TV of Hove, is a priest of the Diocese of Chichester and director of beyond.
He said: "We want religion is closer to the people in a society post-chrétienté.
"As a church, why do we expect that people come in an old building strange? it seems to me that the Church should get closer to the people and celebrate more exciting.
"The idea of the Advent of the beach came just after a conversation with a few friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is a place where creative and vibrant and we try to experiment and to represent this through spirituality. "
Late payments: anger of prison guards, actions
The prison guards' unions called Friday for "general mobilization" to demand the payment by the end of year holidays bonuses and overtime which payment has been deferred to January for budgetary reasons.
Fo-pénitentiaire (2nd Union supervisors) has asked the personnel who will not be in service to demonstrate Tuesday morning in prisons and the "block", to "denounce the theft of their due."
The CGT-pénitentiaire (3rd of the profession) calls on them to "meet in general assemblies in the different prisons for a strong," as "shameful and unacceptable" the payment in December of 'overtime, bonuses night, Sundays and holidays "worked in October.
And the first union of supervisors, the prison autonomous federal Union (Ufap / Unsa), "calls for a general mobilization (...) to the discontent and anger".
The direction of the administration and the Department of Justice explained that the hours have increased significantly in 2009 and have not all been budgeted, but ensure that the leftovers will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of supervisors to ensure that the payment would be made next month.
I know the efforts made by the staff for the operation and the modernisation of our prison system, the Minister of Justice in the mail.
I asked the leadership of the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation born of a poor assessment of the number of overtime does not recur in the future, "added Mrs Alliot-Marie.
The pay in December will be lean, except for the personal with the famous premiums of functions and objectives, deplored the Ufap / Unsa, for whom "the budgetary constraints have good."
It is a pure scandal, has outraged the union FO of Marseille, in announcing its decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings".
The staff will not work on Sundays and holidays if those of October are not regularised in December, ditto for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when increasing our tasks and our missions without increasing our workforce, it is more than regrettable to dare to take money to staff, believes the CGT-pénitentiaire of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of which are less well off than others.
But in any case it is not, found the Secretary General of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama said offer "more" than those it receives
US President Barack Obama, who is preparing to spend his first Christmas with family in the White House, gave the "papesse" of the small screen Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple rule on gifts: "I give more than I get."
In the framework of a special programme to be broadcast Sunday night on ABC television, the president and his wife Michelle offer an overview of how they intend to celebrate the holiday season in their new and prestigious remains.
Even Bo, the small legs companion of the family will be of the party.
The Father Christmas also likes Bo, said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would "of course" a gift, according to excerpts of the show broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama takes issue with claims of her husband about the quality of the gifts that he receives: "Certainly not, I offered gifts last year," she teased the President.
Absolutely, he was forced to concede before responding with humor by pointing a finger at the pearl of the First Lady: "who did you offer it?".

Failed to Zelaya of Honduras to Mexico
Mexico has seen Thursday that the conditions were not right for the transfer on its territory of the deposed president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied a safe conduct by the government.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation in the night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities of achieving this transfer are not met, "said the Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.

The government wanted to force Mr Zelaya to "resign" and to seek political asylum abroad to give him a pass.
But the president refused, because he wanted to travel to Mexico as a sitting head of state invited.
The government "has been a new failure in that I waive my responsibility (...), they wanted me to resign," said Thursday Mr Zelaya on Radio Globo, on which he often expressed since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the Central American country.

USA: Polanski's lawyer calls for the dismissal of charges
Counsel for the franco-polonais filmmaker Roman Polanski has called again Thursday in Los Angeles, California, western United States), the dismissal of charges against his client, currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a matter of more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer for the director of "The Pianist", has denounced before three judges of the Court of Appeals for the Second District of California serious procedural errors at the time, in 1977.
I call for the abandonment of charges here and now, said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was in the back".
According to him, the judge Rittenband -- died since -- would be discussed, before making his sentence, with a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved the prison -- which is a serious lack of procedure.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired), in the words of the prosecutor, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells was finally declared the end of September had "lied" to the author of the documentary.
In the event the court refused to dismiss the case, Mr. Hummel has demanded a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his arguments.
The prosecution has also reiterated the arguments already developed in the first instance, namely that no charges could not be seriously considered as Roman Polanski would not be before the court.
The filmmaker, aged 76, had fled the United States in 1978, before the sentencing, for "unlawful sexual intercourse" with a girl of 13 years.
He has never set foot in the United States since.
The deputy prosecutor in the county of Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayama, stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to appear at the hearing.
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to escape?, asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "request a favour to the court, while scorning its authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- has also highlighted "that there were other alternatives to the flight".
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to request the dismissal of charges against Roman Polanski.
Counsel for Samantha Geimer, the victim, has also claimed, once again, the end of the prosecution.
Recalling that his client is no longer bear to be harassed at every twist of the Polanski case, she added: "Nobody in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough ".
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on U.S. arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he has been under house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, pending a possible extradition.

The news of Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," according to his son David
The news of Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," said Friday his son David on his arrival at the airport in Los Angeles where he had to go to his father, hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It is very strong, it is going very well, "said David Hallyday to exit the plane that took her to Paris shortly after 1: 00 pm local time (00 GMT).
The son of singer, looking relaxed, assured that he would make "very quickly" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection following the operation for a slipped disk in Paris on 26 November.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent suffering and be able to administer his treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at the hospital Cedars-Sinaï of Los Angeles, where he had been admitted Monday for an infection from the operation of a Herniated disk in Paris on 26 November.
The singer had to be on the night of Wednesday to Thursday because of significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning at the Lycée Français de Los Angeles where is their daughter Jade, to attend a school performance, an AFP photographer.
The head of orthopaedic surgery and trauma hospital of the Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel Monday in Los Angeles with the singer.
The producer has vehemently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on 26 November at the International Parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that it was a massacre.
The surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, "said Mr Camus.
I have heard talk of a possible judicial proceedings, "he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday was "much too quickly to Los Angeles, with the permission of the surgeon.
I had this doctor in person in line who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and I was amazed, as I myself had two hernies discales, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "party without drain, without anything", after his operation in Paris.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic community.
It had operated the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic in Oxford where he was at the time.
In 2007, he had also made the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to a hématome following a brain haemorrhage.
But it is also a doctor's reputation, repeatedly condemned by the justice, in medical liability and for tax evasion and fraud.
I Olivier Metzner, counsel for the order of Doctors, was accused of being "a man without scruples" continued "regularly" before the Council of the order, and that is "not appropriate".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
He said that the intervention was "perfectly well" and that the reviews were "normal".
The operation "was not haemorrhagic and does not require the installation of a drain," he added.
In any event, the tour of the singer, whose health problems are growing since this summer, appears in parentheses.
Clearly, a resumption of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, "said Mr Camus.
The association UDF increase the tone and the new centre to use its acronym
The association UDF, controlled by the MoDem party of François Bayrou, responded Friday to the attempted takeover of the President of the new centre, Hervé Morin, the acronym of the ex-parti giscardien, by putting it not to be used on any support, under penalty of prosecution.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced its intention to recover the acronym UDF, ruling that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after he reached out to the left.
The Defence Minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support his approach, he has received the support of the Member Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP past the NC) which claims ownership of the mark for having been the first to file in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But Friday evening, the office of the association, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not intend to let, is out of his silence to launch a formal notice to the Minister and MP, not to use the acronym and to transfer the ownership of the mark, under penalty of prosecution.
You have multiplied in recent days, the statements indicating that you would suggest to your political movement of + + the acronym UDF, the association wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez the modem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis the centrist alliance.
You have also seen fit to follow up on your equipment activist and on the front page of your site, the name of this movement, the + New Center +, the slogan the UDF today +, also see the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to the use of the acronym, said the office of the UDF that remains the NC to withdraw "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF of any medium and (its) website."
It also calls on Mr Hervé de Charette "to pass the property of (the) marks its legitimate right".
If you do not, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, prevent the signatories.
In their letter, they specify that the UDF "is a full-fledged political movement since 1978" and recalled that Mr. Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave in 2007 "to create a movement competitor, as others have done in 2002, to create the UMP".
The new centre has therefore, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 accession to the modem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Mr Hervé de Charette, pursuing the office, "when he filed the mark", it was "more of the UDF for three years", but the UMP.
It benefits and fraudulently abscence of the deposit of the acronym UDF to do.
This is turning into crime, dénoncent-ils, before on the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more fit to make a name for yourself to try to break the anonymity fraudulently taking a name which was not right".
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The court in Nanterre decided Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine if, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, it has benefited from a state of weakness of the octogenarian to rob a portion of his fortune.
The photographer for 62 years, known for his photos of stars, will be held on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment and a fine of €375.000.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families of France, in which a mother and daughter out while taking the reins of the L'Oreal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th criminal chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87 years old, should be carried by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oreal has always refused to submit to such a review, at least not in the conditions proposed by the prosecutor of Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors Friday will submit a report before March 10, 2010 saying if Liliane Bettencourt could find themselves in a state of weakness and at what times.
I think it will.
I will speak to him, said at the end of the hearing counsel for Mrs Bettencourt, Georges Kiejman.
For its part, counsel for Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, lawyer Olivier Metzner, welcomed the decision of the court.
This is excellent news (...) the expertise will show that he (Mr Banier) has handled this elderly lady that we must protect, he said.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has committed criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, photographer and artist, which it accuses of having benefited for years from the weakness of his mother to obtain one billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or tables of masters.
For its part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, as an old friend.
While the court should examine the admissibility of the action taken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers have sometimes turned into a large family unpacking Friday.
Thus, the lawyer Liliane Bettencourt has reported three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary, in which she said wary of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for 15 years.
Françoise, I have never been able to speak to him since his marriage ".
For its part, the prosecutor in Nanterre again suggested that the complainant was not entitled to act, especially as a judge refused in recent days to grant his request to open a procedure of judicial protection for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act, it is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place, "said the representative of the public prosecutor, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court has decided that it would decide once the trial will be held on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Revolution managerial or end of the economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our struggle for the development of the economic intelligence will have been in vain...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies to its employees, said the position vis-à-vis consumers before the revolution marketing: it is to join the staff to "values" determined from above as it once was, to impose on consumers of products designed by technicians of the plant.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the revolution has handed the marketing strategies of conquest of the place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected factors of return regularly!
A demobilization of employees can lead to a deadly.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much more general phenomenon which affects.
This seriously undermines the development of all intellectual functions of the company, including the R & D and, more importantly, the economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE "requires of all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires on the part of employees a commitment that the authoritarian management completely.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would put the staff at the centre of the concerns of the company the same as the client.
The opinion surveys
The internal opinion surveys as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its salariés- will encourage this revolution in the managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I fear not.
- firstly because I could see that, faced with a new situation, any structure in the end, after many twists, priority... what it has always done.
- Secondly, because authoritarianism of the pathologies of the increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most of the leaders have a simplistic view of human behaviour.
From the schools of engineering, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old theory behavioriste, revived recently by the "Neuroscience" and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by the institutes and the media.
Thus, suggesting that it is possible to handle the "levers" (sic) the commitment of managers, a recent survey by Ipsos published in The Figaro.fr conforte-t-elle leaders in a governance posture, unsuited to today's world.
Identify and measure the factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern business, to adopt a vision of human behaviour.
It is to integrate, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: for employees, the commitment to the company is only possible if it is clear as a means of achieving a portion of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only studies from the analysis motifonctionnelle adopt this design of employees.
These studies have shown that they consider their company based on a predetermined which allows them, through their image of the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these factors of mobilization, business leaders can control, and anticipate their "social performance" and their human resources management "the place."
They create a breeding ground for joint development of a robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo: the "just war" is right to praise Obama
The American right has welcomed Friday the speech the day before in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had the award to Mr Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former candidate for the vice-presidency in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, "said Ms. Palin, of the right wing of the Republican Party, the daily USA Today, adding that she herself addressed the issue of war" sometimes necessary "in his memoirs that have just been published.
The war is, the last thing in my view that the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We must stop these terrorists out there, she said.
Mr Obama, who has inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, has worked Thursday to Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr Obama, Newt Gingrich, said that the president had done in Oslo "a very good job".
I found that the speech was very well, welcomed the former speaker of the House of Representatives, which has particularly appreciated the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
By some side, I found this quite historic, "said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed on the radio show" The Takeaway ".
The former elected, regarded by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012, said he was delighted to have seen "a left-wing president" to remind members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not put a price of peace if the use of force did not exist.
For Michael Gerson, former pen of George W. Bush columnist for the Washington Post, Mr. Obama delivered a speech "very American".
In addition to appear in "citizen of the world" as "it always does," he spoke as an American president, "the Europeans that they live in a bubble of security that they have not created and that they do little to preserve it," said Mr. Gerson.
Among the few right to not be convinced, a hawk in the Bush era, the former ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, called the speech "dull, and without inspiration" on the National Review Online.
Has the left of the president, the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When the war in the concept of justice, can easily justify the killing of innocent people, he warned.
The press remained against the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr Obama, described his speech "blockbuster" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," has ignited the daily newspaper.
Mr Obama "delivered the speech that he was," said the New York Times, "both dark and inspiring".
Road: three marathons for an agreement that saves the supply of Christmas
After three sessions of négociations-marathon, the road sector unions and employers, the only organisation to be stayed until the end, reached an agreement Friday night to end the strike and the threat to the supply of Christmas.
At the meeting of signatures Friday evening, the secretary of state for transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "delighted" of this agreement, after several rounds of negotiations, which began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions the negotiators were left in the early morning Friday, with the hope of signing quickly in the late morning the text of the agreement.
And even if three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had slammed the door.
But it took more than six hours of a meeting that began at 11.00 so that everyone is in agreement and that the text should be signed.
The conflict "would have been very damaging for business" and "it was feared that it would disrupt the for years," said Mr Bussereau.
The text provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in the local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
In hourly rate, for the bas-salaires, "from 8,72 euros to 9,06.
It is not much, but it is very far, said Patrice closed (FO).
It will give the order to our activists that there are no barriers, no blockade of centres of supplies.
But we can always have some who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed "a good agreement", even if it was "difficult to concede the increases on the high salaries because of international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of EUR 170 monthly for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is the agreement of common sense and the respect of employees, "said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed" a historic agreement ".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) has "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for the upgrading of the travel expenses of 3%, and the holding of general state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will address the issue of a 13th month and modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau said that "a decrease of EUR 100 million in employers' has been the subject of a government amendment to the bill amending finance for 2009, voted in the night from Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "in the same".
The signing of TLF allows that the agreement applies to the member companies to this organization, and in a second time, the entire profession, in the case of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be "as soon as possible," said Mr Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organisations may only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "fool's bargain", because the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to offset a portion of the carbon tax."
The Secretary of State for Transport has obliged us to negotiate in the urgency, not in a shared analysis, but not to thwart the turkey eaters of the next, deplored the Unostra.
For the OTRE, the agreement "to dig the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
A: disruption this weekend, unions unhappy with the proposals of the RATP
The disruption on the RER, the largest urban transit line of France, will continue over the weekend, while a meeting Friday on the second day of strike between unions and management of the RATP left on their hunger for their demand for premium.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there will be no trains between and, with a train on two on the central portion (between defence and nation) and a train on four outside the central section.
The interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, which will require passengers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette, who expect 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the efforts to serve the department stores".
The RER A crosses from west to east the Paris.
The AAPN short of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about a train in two was circulated at peak hours, and virtually no off-peak hours, as planned.
As Thursday, there has been no melee on the docks, is being organized.
In the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, especially because of the absence of pupils and students.
A Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer of 29 years, explained to be lifted "an hour and a half earlier, so be sure to arrive on time.
The station has not been saturation, "said the SNCF, which had provided a framework of agents and security forces.
The RER has operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from the Gare Saint-Lazare to join the subways.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held Saturday and Sunday, which will review the results, deemed "weak" by the unions, a meeting with management on Friday afternoon.
The director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the RER A on all aspects, working time, career etc.
This is not what the drivers want, who are demanding a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP is even its proposals for premium brackets, has outraged the CGT, stressing that the management "was not to solve a problem in the road and the SNCF is done."
A new meeting is planned Monday for "a broader review of the conditions for the exercise of the profession," said the RATP.
What also say to the unions that the company "the users of the weekend".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded a committee at the headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the leadership, which refused until then any discussion during the strike, had suggested "in a spirit of appeasement" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to widen the RER B Tuesday, after the filing of a notice by UNSA and independent.
The unions are demanding a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to EUR 150 euro30 variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, independent) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line the million daily passengers.
Drivers of drivers, all in the second part of their careers, to euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros in, for hours, Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish justice dissolved the pro-Kurdish party, decision with far-reaching consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled Friday the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision which was immediately followed by expressions of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which is to reach out to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "home of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," said to the press the President of the Court Hasim Kiliç, after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to advise the dissolution, said Mr Kiliç, adding that 37 of the party, including its president Ahmet Türk and Aysel Tugluk, are banned from politics for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Mrs Tugluk and the confiscation of the property of the party.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without a label.
The decision follows a process launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accused the DTP to obey the "guidelines" of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organisation by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party, however, that there was "no organic links" with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with him.
The verdict of the Court comes as the government is to reach out to the Kurdish community in proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, to try to cut the support to the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP had said that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in the southeast Anatolia, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan have degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
After the announcement of justice, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the main city in the southeast by majority of Kurds.
The security forces fired tear gas and used water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails and stones with slingshots.
About 100 people demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr Türk said that the decision of Justice would "deepen the despair".
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurdish) by banning a party, "he said to the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties.
This resolves nothing, "said Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total of democratic openness launched by the government, "said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, "he added.
On Thursday, the PKK has claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the north of Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months.
The new "Silicon-valley"
For a long time she had the reputation of city secret, closed to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the 10 districts of Moscow, was under the Soviet regime, a place of secret weapons, under strict supervision.
Today, with its 216 000 inhabitants to 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the "Silicon Valley" of the Soviet Union.
Centres of production and research into micro and nanoelectronics are located.
In September 2008 representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, place science francfortois – with academic institutes and companies in the centre of Frankfurt (FIZ).
There have been meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg signed a "Memorandum of close collaboration".
The signatories were the Deputy Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz section chief project for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strong point is scientific research, will Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific
It is a scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow companies FIZ to enter the Russian market in full expansion.
Unlike the Russian scientific to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of research institutes and companies Soviet famous.
There is the Institute of Electrical Engineering from Moscow, the major firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The town was founded in 1958 as "socialist planned city" for research.
Zelenograd (literal translation "Green City") gets its name from the forested hills in the heart of which research centres are located.
The project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
Cannot be placed high enough the magnitude of the project Stuttgart 21.
To its supporters it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe".
If you want. S21 is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a massive construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg, in a chaos of for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 is born of the spirit of the 1980s.
The stations head of line, with routes that ended in the city, had a reputation at the time to be the relics of the technique of transport of the 19th century that were effect of brake shoe modern rail traffic because it was once a lot of time to get the back to the front.
Arrival, stopping short, departure – that is what needs to be done.
That is why the head of the line must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And Stuttgart also: a station of passage of trains, which is about halfway on the Transeuropéenne trans-European rail between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava where the slogan "the heart of Europe".
The project S21 will really start, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners have recognized that the cost to bury the station in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
Indeed, the head of the line stations no longer pose real problems of entry and exit since there are modern trains, reversible with and voiture-pilote at both ends.
However, it is now the achievement of Stuttgart 21 next to the new route of the inter-city line to Ulm.
The regional policies and communal prevailed.
The company is in part because it is the taxpayer who paid the cost of the risks of the largest infrastructure project of the Federal Republic and not the public company.
From the point of view this project is relatively well justified.
There is an urban space which - according to the planners generated by computer – will be very green.
For the system of rail transport the S21 is harmful.
The station and the enlargement of the section are designed for human trafficking is - and this is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth.
At the time there was no competition from cheap flights.
The modern traffic policy should first concentrate on strengthening the traffic of goods for transport by rail is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly affects many other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the draft.
It is the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion is more realistic.
One thing is for sure, in the next decade will this money for other points and congestion in the network.
The list of the Ministry of transport in 60 major projects.
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section across the Rhine Valley of 180 kilometres.
Since 1987 the line is built in slow motion.
It would be really urgent support here to build on the fungus.
But the project is the effect of a shoe.
The itinerary of the Rhine Valley is becoming the bottleneck of international freight traffic, and this in the heart of Europe.
The government is considering the judgment on the airport
The regional parliament in Wiesbaden, the Land government has raised the possibility of appeal to the judgement of the Administrative Court of Hesse concerning the prohibition of night flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the coalition CDU / FDP had entrusted experts to examine the legal point of view the ruling by the administrative court and which is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Tribunal of Kassel was justified in a written document that the land should adapt the regulation on the prohibition of night flights in the case or the construction of the runway aterrissage northwest of Frankfurt Airport would be reached.
The approval of attérir for 17 aircraft between p.m. and 5 in the morning, as envisaged by the national government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against air pollution at night.
The coalition must have decided on 4 January, if it wishes to make an appeal against the judgment.
The opposition criticism this time and trying to put pressure on the government representative for celui-cirenonce to appeal to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise before the elections and which was to ban night flights. Otherwise, it will be condidéré as a total failure to a word.
It is difficult to be allowed to keep its word, "said the head of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the slogan of the FDP" We keep our promises ".
The Minister Dieter Posch denies the accusations of Schäfer-Gümbel who claims that the land government tries to even the night flights using "avocasserie and roublardises".
It takes time to conduct a legal review.
The coalition does not take a decision on the basis of a "first impression."
The decision is legally reliable, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition on the statements of its share on the prohibition of night flights is completely érronée.
US banks repay the aid
The big American banks, very affected by the crisis, their ties to the state.
Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had fully repaid to the Treasury $45 billion (more than 30 billion euros), corresponding to the aid under the rescue plan.
The American television CNBC reported in a story that Citigroup was also planning to repay the aid received.
The banking institutions seeking to get rid of the restrictions, which accompanied the acceptance of the money, such as limiting bonuses awarded to the leader and the regulation of higher costs.
The Bank of Americaa launched a capital increase by the sale of securities to investors who reported $19 billion of fresh money.
The remainder comes from the coffers of the bank are met through the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis, the director general of the Bank of America held specifically to thank the American taxpayers: the injection of capital has significantly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The bank had assumed its capacity by buying the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup also plans to raise money on the financial markets to free themselves from the guardianship of the state.
The American bank could launch as early as Thursday a capital increase of $20 billion, reported the CNBC citing the banking community.
The spokesman for Citigroup did not wish to comment on this information.
In June the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had received.
Election
Finally it even faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the dismissal of the current holding the post of chief Nikolaus Brender by the board of directors of the German ZDF, the successor is appointed.
The Commission wanted to vote yesterday evening to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who heads the drafting of ZDF was the odds-on favorite.
The chain has not wished to confirm - officially - the vote so as not to pre-empt the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a desire not to further damage to the of the ZDF Markus Schächter if the proposal would not be accepted by the Council of Administration.
Frey, who is the candidate of Schächter, needs the votes of nine members of the Commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the end of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Council to extend for five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender but it had been rejected.
Only seven members of the Council had expressed support for the continuation of Brender and 7 others had voted against the dismissal by a vote of Brender represented a failure while predictable for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which has a majority on the board of directors had already suggested several weeks before the vote, not wanting to renew his position.
It is Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse who had organized a league against the editor.
He had denied that the contract of the esteemed redacteur in chief is extended, citing the fact that the rate of viewing of the ZDF had fallen under Brender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost up to the vote, denouncing the growing political influence on the ZDF.
At the end there was even 35 experts in public law who had meddled in the debate and who felt that the action of Koch was unconstitutional.
But it will have been for nothing.
Peter Frey: who is it?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 to Bingen.
He studied the sciences-politiques, pedagogy etles Romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked in Südwestfunk (radio body of Rhineland-Palatinate) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (national).
In 1983 he became editor in the ZDF first to the news magazine "heute-journal" (newspaper today).
Then his journey continues: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy editor of the time; then corresponding to Washington in 1991 and 1992, then until 1998 he was head and presenter of "Morgenmagazins" (emission information presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the service of foreign policy of the then head of the Berlin.
After the disgrace of Brender, which had just been elected journalist of the year by the trade journal Medium Magazin, the Greens have announced that they will launch a constitutional complaint
The enemy of to the Council, the premier of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the states should transform the Intergovernmental Treaty of the ZDF so that the proposals of the staff could not be blocked by a political majority.
However, Beck has no plans to seek the withdrawal of political figures who are members of the committees of the ZDF.
Peter Frey, the likely successor to Brender had skilfully manoeuvred to the board in criticizing the Commission in its decision to sack Brender.
This evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose for the position of editor without losing face, as well as the administration could elect without being able to put in the position a political supporter.
In the representations arithmetic of parties, Frey is classified liberal left.
Cleansing in university studies
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike the ministers of education and cultural affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between Ministers and delegates from the Conference of Presidents, an agreement has been developed that the working conditions of students bachelor or master needed to be improved.
In the future, students should be able to overcome their studies.
They are particularly accordpour to lighten the burden of reviews: a single review is to close the module of study.
In addition, the workload will be reconsidée to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
The political authorities and institutions of higher education to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also committed to structural requirements more flexible for the channels of Bachelor and Master.
At the regional level, there should not be any different from one state to another.
Reviews
Since the beginning of student protests in June, the Minister of Education of the Länder and the presidents of universities have repeatedly in the mouth the words: "étudiabilité".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take a practical meaning.
The accreditation council decided to reduce significantly the number of some reviews: "Each module should normally be concluded by a single review," in a document of 30 pages on future conditions of admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, President of the accreditation council said that by significantly reducing the burden of reviews should be able to stop the abuses, which significantly the étudiabilité.
The "étudiabilité" should also be, in the future, the decisive criterion of the organization of studies.
The modules like the substance must be examined carefully to see if you can't avoid this feeling of suffocation that sometimes in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in raid on Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and the flexibility to allow and encourage the personal initiative".
The new regulation will access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to the existing cycles.
These cycles must be "réaccrédités" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only by 2015 that all cycles have been reviewed.
There are 10 of accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory which depend on the accreditation council created by the Länder.
In October, the ministers of education had exerted some pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies so that the programmes are not too loaded and the regime of not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and graduate schools have already agreed with their regional departments to take appropriate measures.
The Rhineland-Palatinate is so far the only Land have agreed to grant more resources to the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize programs tutorielset strengthen the educational guidance offices as well as the offices of reviews and the international relations
The states and universities provide for a budget of EUR 10 million.
In early 2010, the government wants to submit to Parliament an amendment to the law on higher education institutions.
As a result, it will be more than a single examination to complete his studies.
The organization of studies to be more flexible, more must be able to guarantee the recognition of other institutions of higher education and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, "étudiabilité" of all graduate, will be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition have again discussed the issue of conditions in the country.
The décisionsont been appreciated but there have been heard.
The federal president of the student union has indicated that he would like the organization of educational policy does not happen in the future "behind closed doors" of ministers and the of universities.
At the latest after the strike, students as individuals should be able to speak a little.
The future of higher education received the support of the President of the delegates to the Conference of Presidents (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "the experience of students is very useful," she said Thursday during a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with which the HRK is working on a project of reform.
For the Union of education and science (gew) the decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. It calls the right and the opportunity for each Bachelor graduate to enroll in a master cycle.
Andreas Keller member of the steering committee of the request that the Länder provide students of today, tomorrow there will be enough places for studies in Master and conditions as good as possible.
The need to hire more lecturers.
However, the ministers of education have not raised the possibility of easing access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is by these words "Arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work of the poet Werner Söllner, in which he thématise in snippets of sentences, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who won freedom but lost at the same time its territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Romania, was first professor of German and English in Bucharest and, subsequently, director of collection in a publishing house for youth before moving to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner received various literary prizes; in 1993 it was the highly coveted chair of poetry of Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 he is director of the forum of Hesse home of artist of Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
There has been much talk of him in literary circles not last Tuesday, at a conference in Munich, whose theme was "the German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your files."
Visibly upset and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his fellow writers germano-roumains as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had worked as an informant for the Securitate political police.
Söllner received in 1989 the price of the German language together with some of the participants.
The trials began in 1971.
I am, "Söllner" someone who has not sufficiently stood auxessais intimidation of the Securitate.
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honoration of the Nobel prize for Herta Müller and his literary copies with the mechanisms of power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, in a case that clearly shows the abyss and of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say with the current of knowledge, not only guilty but also a victim.
In his own Securitate file, IM Walter played a role, the specialist literature Michael Markel after the confession of Söllner and it refers to the positive influence of IM Walter, who had interceded in his favour.
"He had been drawn from all the difficult situations at the time," according to Markel.
Markel has felt the need moralde make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before the public was unexpected, however the admission of a former dissident its collaboration with the Romanian secret services is in fact, not so surprising.
Germany is a reserve for spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the journal "Die Zeit, after reading the 914 pages of his own record.
It can be assumed that the victims have made speculation and sometimes have guessed what real names were hiding last names of borrowing Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
In contrast to Germany where the consultation of the Stasi is a reliable process, the attitude to the legacy of the files of the Securitate files is still very confused.
A systematic clarification was constantly frustrated and in past years.
It was not until 1999 that a National Council for the institution Birthler was created to work on the assimilation of the Securitate Archives (CNSAS) but the return of files has rather dragged since.
Since 2005 there is a law that defines the management of archives.
The influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very high, is confirmed by an interview with a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expressed a very dismissive of the winner.
She had a psychosis, and in the end it had questioned only once.
The infamy of power to speak here, without any gene, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Of course, many questions are associated with the case Söllner as happens so often in a context of guilt.
Why now? which has been? the reaction from listeners, the admission of Söllner, hope that the result of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge that by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday received the Nobel prize, it is more than a footnote.
In the Champions League
We had the impression that a representative here, fired four pins from any right to a Christmas party, on which the manufacturer of sports had spread its goods when the new coach Christian Gross at midnight quarter in a Mercedes C Class, he had just call, a plastic bag orange supplier by hand.
The man, whose skull chauve drew attention, driving in the city that was still foreign.
Otherwise we could have taken the wheel – he had not been drinking alcohol and he was not drunk with happiness.
He had spent a pleasant evening but tomorrow it should return to work.
Because it is now that it would begin.
The words of Switzerland that had just three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the final eighth of", that is to say in the Champions League thanks to our 3: 1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania "but we must not allow ourselves to be blinded by the success. This will be a brutal battle not to fall back".
The "big job" lies ahead Sunday.
Here, it is to repeat in Mainz the results of the Champions League on a daily basis.
And it will have to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Drawing of lots
The eighth final of the Champions League (go 16 / 17. + 23. / 24 February / return match 9 / 10. + 16 / 17 March) will be drawn in Nyon on December 18.
The joy of the inauguration of the successor of Babbel was moderate.
And the joy was not only among those who had brought luck, which was sent to the professionals in Stuttgart, highly motivated and pleasure to play.
I went to see the players and I told them that they should focus on their strengths, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the plumber of souls "gross - the recipe for success that sounded if bienmais which was more effects with the Babbel.
It has triggered a certain magic, Jens Lehmann - supporter of Babbel - "in football when there is a new impetus it happens sometimes things that we would never have thought possible".
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of break for injury, as one of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" found by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the method of the new leader: "It is someone who is taking action and requires discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation. "
But apparently Babbel had failed.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet turned the corner, warned the manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart in need of tenacity.
As Gross, the players and the manager not to overstate the victory against a defence completely outdated and weakened guests Romanian.
They had also won in Glasgow before they have had four days later a bad awakening to Leverkusen with 0: 4, objecta Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved the goals of the season but there were others who were still far away.
We have not yet out of the woods yet.
That Heldt on the day of its 40th anniversary does not have the heart to celebrate, even after the first victory at home over the past three months, is due to the events of the weekend that a television interview of goalkeeper Jens Lehmann did bounce back just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others take and not Jens, Heldt, in response to the criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the leadership of weakness of style and said that it had decided to change coach under pressure from fans.
Lehmann had also seen as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jalousiele fact that his day of free after the matches had been deleted.
The statements of Lehmann were "marked by a pure selfishness" enfonça Heldt and announced the consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were more likely to become friends for life these two quadragénaires.
In any cast, they agreed to everything else, that is to say that without the work of the group by the coach replaced, the strong representation and would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants have been "for a large part in the success" Heldt and Lehmann in choir – and even the man in the plastic bag.
World championship heavy
Hot in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly verbally and gestuellement the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after 12 rounds difficult Ukrainian defended his title of world champion of heavy goods vehicles from the version of the Federation.
The judges in the points.
Hamburg Vitali Klitschko retained his title of world champion of heavy goods vehicles.
The federation announced that on the night of Saturday, the 38-year-old champion had won a victory to the unaminité of judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120: 10).
For the third time Klitschko defended with honour his title since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
The Ukrainian had already won twice the title of world champion of the WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately it has not passed the long-awaited KB.
Klitschko, 39 times winner in 41 professional fights, twice its defeat because of injuries.
The challenger Johnson has to accept its first defeat in 24 fight.
In the arena of Berne, before 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight, the top of its 2.02 metres, by the left.
Johnson, 11 centimetres smaller, which before the duel, announced the end of the era Klitschko, managed to avoid the of the empéchant champion, and Klitschko to bring into play its against right-wing dangeureuse.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, has tried to move the rounds.
Although he continued to cause Klitschko in words and gestures have reached only very rarely the champion.
It is the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, have exceeded with Klitschko distance of 12 rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the capital Switzerland before the fight.
It insulta Klitschko the villain of "zombie" which "is not really capable.
During the on Friday, the champion was unable to refrain from provoking Johnson by his sunglasses nose "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory since the comeback of Klitschko.
Klitschko imposed again in his fourth fight since his comeback on 11 October 2008
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten at the time the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "its" WBC belt that he had previously abandoned without a struggle.
This year, defending his title of champion, he won the battle against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola US.
"I just took a blow in this fight, and am in perfect shape," said Klitschko to explain his rapid return to the ring.
His rève is to try to bring in the family the four titles.
His brother Wladimir is the IBF and WBO champion federations.
But it is Britain's David Haye, who, having détroné the General Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 metres - in November, is the belt.
This summer, Hague had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko scheduled to take place in September.
It would appear that his promotion company plans to play this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The case Kunduz
Frontal attack of the opposition: the head of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, accused the minister of defence of lying in the case of the Case Kunduz.
The SPD and the Left party (Die Linke) the Chancellor explanations.
Hamburg / Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on the air attack in Kunduz, the opposition has criticized the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) have délibérémentdissimulé some facts.
The Minister has intentionally "made an untruth" on the deadly strike two tankers last September, said the head of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, Saturday during the broadcast of information of the ARD "Tagesschau" (the newspaper).
Clearly, this means that he lied.
The order to kill was given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
It is, in essence, the content of the report available to NATO and which was read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new revelations of the media, the objective of lafrappe was in reality, not to destroy the stolen trucks, but was intended to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the report of NATO, 142 people had been killed or injured in the US air attack, which was launched at the request of the German Colonel Goerg Klein, military commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the left have prayed Saturday Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to a decision as soon as possible before the federal parliament and reveal what really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Green Party Renate Künast are of the opinion that Mrs Angela Merkel must clearly say whether the strategy of targeted killing is part of the government's Afghan policy if the Chancery, the army and intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The government spokesman categorically rejects the criticism.
The Chancery has in no way influenced the actions of the army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were increasingly strong to express doutesquant the real reasons for the dismissal of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as it had been presented by the department.
According to the information in the journal Spiegel, the information they had provided to Guttenberg concerning the attack tankers were both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the report of NATO and hid the Minister some details.
In the entourage of two senior officials suggests, however, that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein and a report of the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung reported that Wichert would have meanwhile asked in a letter clarifying the facts.
So far, it has not received a response
Saturday, the department did not wish to comment on the charges and referred to the Committee of Inquiry of the federal Parliament that would be the next Wednesday to the light on the facts.
The worlds of dream
Some see, awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only among the mental patients, or under the influence of drugs, that the boundaries between fantasy and reality blur.
As these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is going very well.
When we are lying in our rooms, we can do without dreams and the wildest fantasies.
However, awake, the experience of dream, hear and see things that others do not perceive, has a reputation in the Western world to be crazy or drugged, or at least to be an original.
Such images and voices do not appear in the mental ill or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination that is at stake: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, but that sometimes the boundaries between the dream, madness and reality to merge.
A state of aware, taking the form of a dream, may be in various forms, in the best case we call them visions, at worst madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect differ, visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the prophet of the new age Carlos Castaneda, the latter, psychosis and hallucinations are attributable to process very similar.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, substances in the brain - the dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and achétylcholine - breaks and that the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The force of attraction has more power over the individual.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between the madness and the dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of rêve-éveillé; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 "a great similarity between the madness and the dream," for Sigmund Freud the dream was "a psychosis with all irregularities, imagination, delusions and sensory illusions.".
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning t turns into a comic strip.
His body is in two dimensions to the garish colours.
The no longer has power over him, on in the ceiling.
It is a coup.
Behind him creatures of ailées, grimaçantes, his mouth bloodied, showing teeth.
They continue, give him feet with heavy boots, the cast against the walls, he feels pain throughout the body.
The voice, nasty, howl, leaving the walls and radio.
It can no longer bear those voices that the insult and humiliate.
Henning T. two cables of its stereo system, in fact a loop and attached to a hook attached to the ceiling.
It rises on a baffle and is the loop around the neck.
He jumps.
The loop stands out.
You serve as a lesson, the voices in a chorus to extract the tympan. "in a clinic and fais-toi treat!"
Today Henning T. 40 years ago, he lived six acute psychosis, the last date of 2 years, the first in nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
The diagnosis: psychosis schizo-affective, paranoid, it is maniaco-dépressif, he takes medication for depression, mania and schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he is married for three years.
During the psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
The illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in his life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics is the most common illness after the depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, people can no longer make the difference between the inside and the outside world, they find themselves in a state of hyper excitation, are that they may suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relational or persecution.
It is very common to hear the voices of command, or dialogue.
The optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person can no longer distinguish between the important and the trivial, the brain can no longer filter out signals, the conscious is drowned in the sensations.
Just as the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies of deeper layers of conscience.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the issue, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is located in the centre of the situation, a service focused on him.
At the same time he found himself in a passive role, it is like a dream, overcome by events and not act on them.
That is why people with schizophrenia often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the opportunity to adjust the reality, the illusions are a cruel reality, wake up is excluded.
To experience once in her life of a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and to structure of reality that is seen during the psychosis, is fundamentally retained".
The thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the lived in a real framework.
Why our brain kind of antics, is still a mystery to researchers.
Exceptional situations can bring everyone to lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people develop a psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only factors.
The researchers assume that the people involved are tiny brain damage.
It is assumed that the maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, "Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained is how the anomaly of the system occurs and also the fact that it is not for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis, if there is a predisposition.
The hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they act on the neurotransmitters.
When our brains.
This is crazy, "said psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that the psychotic suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to dispose of while others buy drugs very expensive to obtain.
The perception pleasant or unpleasant illusions is often just a matter of perspective.
Kasten brings together for ten years reports of hallucinations and phenomena of images: last year he published his findings in a book entitled "the world in our heads."
The hallucinations are part of concomitant phenomena typical psychoses but also an impressive number of many other diseases.
They include the psychological problems such as borderline or depression but also the headaches, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or head trauma.
It is surprising that in certain conditions even the brains of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, composed of fragments of memories that normally are inhibited.
They take form when the areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions are not enough, hyperactives or refrénées; when our brain but also when there is a lack of stimulation.
The drugs can trigger this state as a brain injury or psychosis.
But the lack of stimulus, stress, of love or other mental states.
In recent studies, one third of participants acknowledged having made at least once in a lifetime experience of a hallucination.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. 16 years ago, she lives in a small town in earlier and it goes to high school.
A young girl to normal indeed.
If there was not the images and voices.
During the break, that a young boy, thin, with long hair, send him the floor.
When she meets his comrades watch, surprised no one else sees or hears this boy.
They believe that this girl is a lunatic but Sarah K does not dream, it is certain.
She is awake, hears and sees the boy as she sees and hears the girl who is sitting next to her on the bench.
It can even see his presence.
It is a good feeling, she found that young sympathetic.
Am I crazy?, wondered sometimes.
But she knows that this young and other visions are not real and they will disappear again.
The night appearances are, in general, frightening.
Often the visions are cumbersome.
When she is in class, it is that it can monitor the course because the professor is just trying to present a new student in his eyes and ears while it is invisible to others and that the professor is in trying to explain the equations in table.
The night the appearances are, in general, frightening.
When, in the darkness of his bedroom, it expects the sleep that came too little and too late, it often cannot distinguish if she is awake or dream already, if the images she sees, faces grimaçants or the girl with cuts on his arms and legs are before his eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, t-elle to these creatures.
It does not speak or his parents or friends, they would take to a mad.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
It was last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations have ceased.
Since it came into contact via the Internet with the psychologist Kasten she knows very well that it is not crazy.
The madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have sufficient incentives, the probability is high that he has hallucinations after a certain period of time.
I assume that the brain is not busy enough, ensures that there is animation.
Sarah K., single girl, was afraid of other children when she was small and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when she learned to 13 years, that the man she called Dad, since it was in age to think, was not his real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active in the visual hallucinations and acoustic, and for the impressions and noise, it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to differentiate between the illusion and reality. "Each experience", according to Kasten "takes place in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real. "
For Kasten, dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike the schizophrenic, mentally healthy person is able to recognise that the fantasies are not real images.
That is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish the hallucinations as a special talent.
There is only a step between the dream and the hallucination.
In our world too focused on the conscience has unfortunately quickly tend to take the imaginary experiences for diseases, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor at Heidelberg and chief medical officer of the clinic of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious disease, painful but which also contains something positive, creator - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has studied the form of so-called oniroïde experience, a particular form of the conscience of the dream.
The experienced oniroïdes are very complex semi-rêves which are seen as real by the lives and that it cannot differentiate the dream even when it is in a state of awakening.
The state of consciousness oniroïde occurs during a trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with polyradiculopathie which fully aware, experience paralysis engine.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a comprehensive and sustainable to move, it replaces the real situation that affects his life, by his own imaginary world that is divorced from reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between the dream and the hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change in the world, but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, a form of means and interpretation, in a situation intolerable in itself, a capacity that is given to us men, not to sink into the abyss of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurichois Peter Cornelius Classen, art historian also describes his experiences oniroïdes in his book "change of heart" as a safeguard action of the soul.
He was 49 years, when his hand for a trip of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed a transplant; during this time, his body is condemned to remain in intensive care.
Claussen plunges into a world that he created from scratch, visit places, travel in time. It is an old man in a sanatorium, a robot at his bedside on his health.
He lives in the Middle Ages the noble who manufacture drugs based on blood.
It is abducted by a Greek to who takes in his country, he is riding with his hospital bed in the Alps and meeting a Korean mafia.
It is absorbed completely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to these domestic travel are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different, "he wrote in describing what he lived.
Instead of dreams, memories from travel disorders are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
We can even say that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the real experience.
The intensity of this the detonated the horizon of our other everyday experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, the oniroïdes, psychosis, delusions, hallucinations and experiences we show how our representations of the external reality are fragile even in a.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be very rewarding.
The first snow can fall
Burda
A 27 years, the children will be the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen to the position of CEO of editions Burda is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda hopes that his two children resume the press group, he told the newspaper Spiegel.
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - in the long term, the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of its children
The two children will inherit at 27 years and are committed to integrate into society, said Hubert Burda, 69, Spiegel.
All the details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will.
It will also see if they are capable of.
We cannot impose its children to 7,500 staff without knowing whether they have the capacity to deal with it.
This the children as well as the company.
Burda said last Thursday that it was withdrawing from the position president in January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, is a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
It was responsible for the technology sector.
He held the sector that is to say that he was responsible for the capital of the company and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he was also the head of marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
For the first time this is not a member of the family who is at the head of Burda editions.
The children of Burda have respectively 19 and 17 years, his son Felix would now 42 years, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to make the connection of 10 or 15 years "
Burda said that the holding must remain at 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always held in the families who are left by a bulimia capital, which have made enormous speculation that thinking that they could climb ever higher.
It has never been my strategy.
I have never had a rêvede universal power, said Burda.
I do not see myself in the role of a tutor as could be and I do not intend to be part of the leagues international as the time, these companies have taken too much importance.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that allows only to watch his e-mail, without offering the possibility if only to see some type of attachments or surf the Internet.
It took its five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see in the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, peek offers a monthly subscription price and a very low, less than half of what it costs, for example, the subscription data of the iPhone.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free service for life, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event, the Web is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is also limited its grand-frère American, but is a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes the roaming across Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it means to the data when it crosses a border or seek a cafeteria on the WiFi (or a connection of Fon) to consult his mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and it is a long time that it should work.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have a PhD in physics to understand and good glasses to read the small print.
The repeated reminders to the order of the European Commission to propose affordable roaming fees throughout Europe have had a barely perceptible.
Outside his country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and it was not wrong.
A small device as the FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon while it does not have the WiFi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators are starting to think differently and are studying various proposals to make their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes the downloading of books and other research on the Internet.
Without subscription and boat.
It is a device connected and pay at its purchase and not every month.
And that is what I hope to see a day for the FonPeek: a purchase option with access to life as Peek is already in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I look at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I would simply because I believe that it is a formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The favourite colour of Michelle
The yellow is, without doubt, the favourite colour of the first lady of the United States.
If she went to the inauguration of Barack Obama to the presidency of the United States with a dress and a coat of this colour, it has chosen the same to accompany him in the second time, without doubt, the most important of his life: the in Oslo for the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a a very similar model in these two occasions: in addition to their colour, a yellow to green with bright, both times, the SafeguardTM consisted of three parts: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabric, and was decorated with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So a first glance, it would appear that the first lady of the United States to follow the wake of the Princess of Asturias and chose to deliver the same held.
But the fabric in which are cut both sets are very different.
If for the fact that it was a thick, however, it was in Oslo a printed velvet.
The accessories also are different: green shoes to heel means for the first time, and a similar model, but, this time.
The also has changed: the hair are now identified when it was released last time.
75% of working mothers have had problems because of their maternity
Discrimination in the workplace has increased in recent years, especially for women the younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is what the "fertility and professional career women in Spain," conducted by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, conducted on 9 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 years, leaves no room for doubt: 75 percent of working mothers saw their careers because of motherhood.
The study indicates that there are many differences about the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, whether the woman works or not and the type of job.
Those who do not work outside the home, working part-time or have a less stable, earlier a couple, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
In contrast, women with a stable job, mainly in the public sector, the entry of the couple and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women aged between 35 and 49 years with a fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after being installed as a couple. This figure rises to 4.1 among those who work in the public sector. "these data show that women with a stable employment needed more time in their lives for it, which led to the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised influence motherhood, but less the start date of common life, "explains the researcher of the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that is widening the gap in the age of marriage for women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they marry and have their first child later.
The difference is also among the women of the same generation.
For example, in the group aged between 35 and 49 years, those who have elementary and higher were respectively mothers for the first time to 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
"Another is also among women, according to their level of education.
While those who have done studies marry and have their first child before finding a stable employment, those of average level or higher this programme and give priority to obtaining a stable work as a prerequisite to marriage and the arrival of a child, "said Mrs Delgado.
Diane Kruger also worth
L'Oreal Paris has recently added a new name to its list jalousée ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will embody the image of several products of the mark, the universal currency "Because I'm worth."
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses of the international stage, just as well join other celebrities listed among L'Oreal Paris, as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before that, the last to enter the club if select were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
Among men, the brand of cosmetics also ambassadors of luxury: Patrick Dempsey (Dr. Grey, lessons of anatomy) and Matthew Fox (the companion of Evangeline in lost).
The price of the British
The British have much to say in the world of fashion.
Its greatest representatives, creators and mannequins, yesterday and today, gathered for the annual presentation of their price, which took place in London, the Royal Court of Justice.

The poker of Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer of Acso (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) 30 "X-rays" of writers who have crossed his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
It is not as predictable and apprehended (biographical biographical, life and work), but by seeking something similar to the core of the character created.
The trip is exciting and Vincent spares or the illuminations.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also an invitation to readings and relectures.
I leave you here a few snapshots.
On Albert Camus: "In its pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical, the one that I felt without the name: the pleasure against the sad fate, morality without guilt and innocence no god."
On Samuel Beckett: "nihilistic, Christian allegorical, he wrote what he had in the blood, not in the head, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a poetic humour, meaningless, as the blade of the knife which threatened to kill him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman a passion that lasted 13 years, in the flesh, which he conjugua emotion of adultery to the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege which was to reach the sky on the road to perdition."
On James Joyce: "The Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of eight thousand metres summits of world literature, he must climb by the north face, on which the best climbers lâchent still taken."
On William Faulkner: "It was a strange type.
In itself, he said that he was the son of a landowner in the county and other times he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
These two dreams were of magnitude. "
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer the cry pushed from a bridge by the character of Munch to bring its response to the bottom of the night of the 20th century, in his literary form, and it did in the brain itself and the grounds with a speech to the maggots."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day it began to its knees and prayed:" God, I beg you to do that I to write as a woman. "
On Joseph Conrad: "on his tomb were engraved to Spenser:" Sleep after the effort, / after the storm the port, / the rest after the war, / after life, tired death delights. "
On Virginia Wolf: "In his baggage she was carrying its depression.
Her husband accepted very normally she told him that Edward VII the between Azalées or that the birds singing in Greek.
It has never seen a man so patient and lover of a névrosée whose literary talent exceeded the madness. "
On Pío Baroja: "That Martín-santos if it is to try to conceal Joyce Baroja?
That tried Benet if it is to shoot Baroja by Faulkner?
Did this if it is to the glory of this man to serve as a pedestal? "
A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, was walking in our neighbourhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent beside her and our dog, a sang-mélé, saved the APS and not weighing more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they assenèrent two who left the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is great because we do not see what is fun to free a small animal which, moreover, was on a leash.
Add to this the indignation of a woman who was walking quietly and injuria, when these individuals came to fear for his physical integrity, as a énergumène which attack an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, anyone lower than him.
The episode took place at around 5 p.m., Tuesday as another in a usually quiet.
The dog was gémi throughout the day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint to the office of the district although we doubt that used to much, and not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
The outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening in young people to find fun to free a defenceless animal which gives us the affection, friendship and company.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of helmets, mainly among the young, as reported today the two structures.
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of the helmet, since it is the only element of protection to avoid injuries to the head, or even death, in the event of an accident in two wheels.
Michelin said that the campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond the design and manufacture of products always safer" and said it contributed to this objective by other actions to educational and informative.
This new campaign to encourage the helmet on two wheels, under the motto "To be or not to be," will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 garages of motorcycles, in order to ensure the widest possible dissemination.
Finally, Michelin has stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop products always safer.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles are starting to see a little light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the union of manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, the dealers.
However, the good news, since the reference for the comparison, the month of November 2008, has been particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the rebound last month, registrations accumulated during the 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if you add up all vehicles in the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from passenger cars, trucks, vans, light vans and trucks lightweight chassis) 95 have been sold.
The clouds that most of their applications are not. Indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external funding.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved by the limitation of bank loans, other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic conditions.
Faced with this situation and unlike the vehicles, aid for the purchase of the little used.
In addition to individuals, the self-employed and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of emissions of Co2 that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, in Ganvam, recalled again the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealers association provides a year 2010 similar to that end, for which it calculates a drop in sales (for passenger cars and 4x4s) of 19%.
The emergency braking is now mandatory
As has occurred with the anti-lock system of ABS and as it will take place with the ESP stability control, emergency brake assist systems (BAS) will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on passenger cars and light commercial vehicles newly registered, while for the rest of the vehicles a waiting period has been set up at the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if, by its mode of action, it can also help prevent many rear shocks.
The assistant emergency braking is increasing the pressure on the brakes in urgent cases detected by the system through the kick given by the driver.
But it does not always maintained the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for cars Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to build on the brake before the collision, and half of them had not benefited from its full force.
Up to 100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, revancha, requires the maximum brake system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to a study of the EU, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: It calculates that a disaster on four with injured would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it means increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device is the maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimize the damage.
General Motors postponed until January the plan for Opel
The workers at the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably the 8, according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, means that every point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may mean that the final document, which will be submitted to the workers and the governments of the countries where the factories are located, be postponed until early 2010.
In contrast, GM, it ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the US manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of the Dutch manufacturer of sports cars Skyper, supported by the Russian group Converg, importance.
In the case where there would agree with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last and precious jewel, engineers of Porsche left the Boxster S and have succeeded in nothing less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance to only 1 275 kilograms.
This has led to happen, first, the automatic roof has been replaced by a roof manual, to reduce 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors as those of the other, 15 kilos of less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the gas tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilograms of earned, climbing bacquets of sport, still 12 kilos, and with light of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they have renounced the audio system CDR-30, six other kilograms and have replaced the poignéesdes doors by in tissues, saving the kilo remaining.
Although the model also exists with the box to double clutch, the test was carried out on a model with manual box of six speeds, mainly on the roads of secondary network of California, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous.
His behaviour can be described as beyond reproach.
The weight does not prevent the car to drive on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: it was a long time that we had not tested a model as small and light, at the same time, guarantees of security, including at high speed.
It is a small athlete, able to heat its musclesà small speed for as long as necessary, until we ask him to sprinter, to recover and grow again its engine...
It is out what we wanted. Through his leadership, communicative as that, the car will do what will our hands on the steering wheel.
And it will do so with surgical precision.
Its engine will
The sound of his V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be strengthened with the "sport" or through a system that changes the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The ability of acceleration is brutal, either to the judgment or during recoveries.
The suspensions are firm, but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The road that we have travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car has managed the potholes.
The electronic assistants were barely act of presence throughout the journey, while on some turns we found ice in the morning and gravel, later in the morning.
Ultimately, a car ultralégère, more fun to drive and that is much more than a simple amendment of the Boxster S.
The car will be put on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70 euros.
"Bag Girl"

The Baskonia is a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral received a resounding triumph in 91-82 during his visit on the ground of Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences that plagued the team of Dusko Ivanovic.. It is at the top of his group, after the great spectacle of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight baskets to three points was the best of his team (29).
The team of Vitoria has managed to fill the absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a great deal of commitment and collective work, even if she had to wait until the end to win.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets to three points scored, largely the final victory.
The match began quickly for the blue and red, who took the advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four baskets of the team of Vitoria are marked since the perimeter, that they had jumped on the ground with the poignets hot.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was on the same tone, but the team of Alava chose the game within Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was received by cheers and applause to return to his former home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to get out as the best player of his team, with 13 points, although the "least six" Splitter assessment was already that this night would not be the best of the Brazilian.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right track to break, nothing was played, far from it, and the team of Avala wanted to remind that of Vitoria that you win so easily on their ground, and to "the hand of Elias, they managed to enter the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the yellow take the advantage on the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
The players of Ivanovic, wounded but far from dead, needed to pick up some actions to take the air, and it is at this point that the gun Mirza Teletovic who, with three baskets to three consecutive points and assistance of English and Ribas the meter to score a reassuring (54-67), and that the local managed to increase at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The team of Avala left to play out all the stops in the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) that they were tired person to take what they had earned during the first 30 minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini Eidson, the best of their team, not résignèrent and tried to support it in line with the three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for mistakes, the players from Ivanovic not rushed, defended well, and although the Israelis are together at the last minute (80 - 85), the party was already played and the victory in Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Injuries prevented the Unicaja fight
The Unicaja lost loudly in Greece Olympiacos and has given him the head of Group B of the Euroligue, in a match marked by the absence of players in the Unicaja, especially in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The team of Malaga was not intimidated by the atmosphere of the flag of peace and friendship or by the scale of the rival, without doubt one of the most powerful in Europe and with a big budget.
The game in the first quarter, helped to dream the Andalusians. An aggressive defence and three baskets on three consecutive points, two of the ringleader Omar Cook and one Guillem Rubio has dazzled the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the game within Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, has helped to reverse the score 22-20, in the 13th minute, when an action, an early fight, between the North American leaders Beverley and Williams has led to the disqualification of two players.
The Greek team has started in showing its superiority in both camps, while the exit for the central English Joel Freeland and three personal misconduct of Carlos Jiménez weighed on the Unicaja.
Domestic players and the Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with their baskets to three points, dug the advantage 44-32, in the nineteenth minute.
A rebound
The third period was particularly offensive to the Olympiacos which, despite the 19 losses, was higher and came even to match the difference of the meeting in Malaga 66-48, at the 27th minute, as the head of the group.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last exit from the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, thanks to his organization, three points of Cook, and to support Lewis, left a little hope with 66-57, in the 31st minute.
But the victory was virtually impossible because the Olympiacos was when the players were pressure and showed their superiority in centimetres in the area.
The Croatian Nikola Vujcic, managed to raise the score to 81-62, in the 37th minute, and the Unicaja is submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.

Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president will abandon the diplomatic legation no later than January 27, 2010, the date of the official end of its mandate.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d ’ affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he has refugee since September 21, before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on 27 January, at the end of its mandate, it must seek another destination."
The chain has also cited the former agent, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the period established: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the elections of 29 November (during which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya that he would remain in the embassy of Brazil until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed, since Zelaya refused the condition of exiled political intended to impose the de facto government headed by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much
After days roses since last spring, during which the asset inflation was the dominant note on the markets, the uncertainty there arises again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where the decisions on a future inherently uncertain.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize the markets has been to monetize the debt by the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by providing ample liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
Central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets have been virtually finalized and, without questioning their political maverick liquidity, begin to put some sand in the wheels, as did the ECB, with their award to a year in the next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain an economic recovery without measures and we are seeing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of stock markets and business obligations are rising again, although they remain very distant paranormaux levels they have reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to socialize the risk private and public debt is affected.
There is a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany were selected chosen by investors, an increase of differences between the countries of the euro zone and Germany.
Spain has been barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's threatened a new downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a bit of uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of moral hazard, trying to provoke a case of conscience among lesresponsables of global economic policy that had hampered the destructive effects of limiting the credit on the destruction of employment, whereas what we should do is declare a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation of Dubai resembles a fight between the tribal sheiks to restore its place in power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government who discovers the roses.
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be totally irrational that Ecofin saves Hungary a breach of its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a member country of the euro area not to meet its commitments.
What makes sense is that the Ecofin has prompted the Greek government transparency and makes its citizens of the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of standardization of risk premiums, after some excesses in high positions, it would be predictable.
In the case of Spain, as our differences in public debt increase to the extent of the obligations of European companies, nousn 'not have to worry.
If the European gap decreased and that ours continued to increase, it would be a risk idiosyncratic Spanish.
The Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our indicators most studies to anticipate their models of recovery and to revise up their forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, returning to the office with a Japanese model pourl Spanish economy, it does not much hope for their warning.
Again, this has to be an excellent opportunity to buy assets in Spain, although for the moment "caution is the mother of safety."
Sectors connected
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, which is discussed these days the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades.
After his speech, which was followed by the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Galán has outlined for the press that he had before the subcommittee, to huit-clos.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 000 euros by 2020 and 60 000 million more between then and 2030, where nuclear power plants in operation would remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments do not amount to 60 000 million but to 95,000.
By contrast, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be used to increase production capacity, but the distribution networks and interconnections.
From 2020, the question is changing, and it will increase the power.
His bet focuses both on the power plants to gas and coal, with mechanisms for recovery of carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that 18,000 MW more are needed, with other "sources of support."
Galán, who believes that the draft Law of sustainable economy that the government has just approved is in line with what his company, did not wish to attack the royal decree aimed to encourage the use of coal, which contradicts the policies to combat global warming.
According to him, there was "a clear long-term" in this sense, despite the measures "one-off", as the president of Iberdrola.
In any case, Galán believes that the decisions to invest, although they are in the long term, must begin to be taken, because they take some time before reaching maturity and a stable framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins the handling of Aer Lingus in ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on earth, will play the role of a privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services in ten European airports where it is present.

Acciona dispute its first motorway in Australia to Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first highway concession in Australia, market on which it is already working as a business manager of energy and water.
The site at stake is a tunnel estimated at 1 700 million Australian dollars (about 1 million euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A tunnel of 5 kilometres long in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, such is the option to allow Acciona to settle in the country as a company of public works and highways.
The mayor of the city wants to have by the end of 2014.
Having chosen the public private partnership (PPP for its initials in English) to complete the project, as part of a business plan under the tutelage of Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the presentation of their bids in May, the planned investment amounts to 1 700 million Australian dollars (about 1 million euros) and in the last phase three consortia, with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, only Spanish company in smooth, and his associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest manufacturers, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists to work underground.
Against the team of Acciona, the consortium northern direct, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, manager of the Australian infrastructure Transfield and the French manufacturer Bouygues.
The third and final consortium that has passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which has in turn the participation of GBA), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian market infrastructure promises of major projects and privatisation, but there is a great difficulty, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that followed the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which is still a step not validated for the Spanish giants of the sector.
Is just to win a place on the market by its 30 per cent in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Assets millionaires
On a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, on which it already has a large presence through its energy supplier and activity in the sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and the consolidation of companies responsible for building and managing the dessalinisateur of Adelaide, with a budget of $700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the markets of the construction and management of infrastructure.
The road toll underground, promoted by the Office of the infrastructure of the city of Brisbane and the Northern Link (North), is expected to link Western Toowong the peripheral to Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 km tunnel. It is the largest project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the administration indicates that the auction will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December of next year.
Despite the fact that the toll road will be open to traffic late 2014, it is not anticipated that the site is completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be developed in 2005.
It will include two times two, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work to Hochtief
Australia continues to be widely Hochtief, who mentioned yesterday of a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the national network infrastructure of broadband.
This will allow 400,000 people to have high-speed Internet access and provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has ceded the construction of the tower King George, 27 floors, in the city of Brisbane. The work has not yet started and Hochtief concluded the sale to 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC is adjudiquer a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary, is adjudiquer the construction of a tunnel of 2.1 miles long for a motorway in Slovenia, for an amount of $64.5 million euros.
The company has obtained this contract a few days after being given the responsibility of expansion of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria), for a total of 130 million.
Alpine consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The launch of the site is scheduled for early 2010 and its implementation will take 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore is adjudiquer advertising of Renfe
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore, for a budget of around three million euros per year, said the rail operator.
The contract mentioned the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was chosen from among 16 agencies that were presented to the tender organised by Renfe, of which four have been finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity in the past three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million to France Telecom to curb competition
The French competition regulator imposed a fine of EUR 63 million to France Telecom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region in the country.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition in the fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and loyalty programs to consumers on the margins of the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and even state company, more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it puts its competitors.
The penalty yesterday has been increased because the authority which oversees competition considers that France Telecom has committed similar offences in the past and that it is therefore repeat offender.
A shop applications
On the other hand, the mobile phone subsidiary of the French company has followed the wake of other operators and opened a shop of Internet applications, with the aim of increasing revenue from outside the transmission of voice.
Initially, the shop applications of Orange will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait until 2010 for that it happens in other countries such as Spain.

And that, although they have lost before the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, in the money reported by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure of distribution of money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the body chaired by Michel Platini expects to earn $1 million through to the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will 413,1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs who participated in the classification matches (including the Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who have managed to participate have received 3.8 million just to be there, more than 550 00 euros for each match.
There is also a bonus in the event of victory (800,000 euros) and equality (400 000 for each team). Those who arrive in eighth final of three million each, the eight teams who arrive in quarter-final reçoivent3,3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will win $9 million, the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, in the form of fixed payments, a club will win at least 7.1 million, and a maximum 31.2 million.
On the other hand, has pocketed $2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are the variable payments, which are enshrined 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four seats.
The champion of the previous year gets 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party will be paid depending on the number of matches played during the edition of the year.
Nueva Rumasa offer 61 million to 29.9% of Sos.
The group Nueva Rumasa listed yesterday the details of the offer to purchase of shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of the capital of Sos.

The CNMV not having been informed of the offer, although the company of Ruiz Mateos has said that it had made contact with the regulator.
If he had, the would amount to 611,7 million, while capital of SOS is 254,27 million.
In the meantime, SOS continues to restructure its direction.
In an attempt to remain outside any offers to purchase and judicial and of its former directors, brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, it announced the election of María Luis Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that in fact the first woman to hold a leadership position in the food company.
It is a newly created position that will directly depend on the president of the group.
And it is not without controversy, as the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged embezzlement of more than 230 million Sos to companies of Salazar.
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months Sos reveals new embezzlement of funds cannot be ruled out.
On the credit to Salazar, the former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.

New tools for the expertise of cars
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are reduced to a garage, where an expert to assess the damage and the cost of the repair.
Every disaster is different, and the calculation of the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complex.
To calculate the cost of compensation of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
However, with the assistance of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
It is for this reason that almost 100% of experts use such systems.
The suppliers of services and solutions for the assessment of claims and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of information provided by the manufacturers, and then treat them and offer their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, North American group, is the company leader; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of evaluation tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each provides information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to treat continues to increase, so that in the past five years, more versions, and have been launched in the past 15 years.
When a new car lots on the market, these companies are at work.
It is a very difficult, because it is each thousand pieces of the vehicle and its price.
In addition, it establishes a graphic image "smart" of each model on which you can click on the different parts of a passenger vehicle.
If it is a model sold heavily, the work can be ready in a week if the process is moving very quickly.
If it is a car sold, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex provides comprehensive information on 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the models, the most exclusive, they have information on the Porsche, but not the Ferrari or Lamborghini.
On the vehicles in circulation, the figure is 99%.
To perform the work of documentation and development of databases, Audatex has eight centres around the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (in general experts in mechanical) work simultaneously on three screens of computers.
Audatex invests each year 90 million to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and clients receive updates every two days.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and propose various products.
The most common application for the repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for the management of scrap or to calculate the residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that provides information on the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not propose in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide professionals in the sector.
This company offers 10 different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard solution assessment of claims, for experts.
There are cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it takes into account the time repair estimated by the manufacturer or the scales of paint.
This tool can be bought in terms of its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use little, up to 10 times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which conducts thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the identification of a vehicle and equipment with which he came out of the assembly line, only through its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on the glasses of vehicles, and AudaSubastas is open to the professional sector on the Internet server to bid on vehicles reported wrecks.
Its statistics service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting analyses géo-démographiques or problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a specific mark went to the garage for a breakdown or how many have suffered serious losses for a given period.
Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It sells, among other things, GT estimate, which is also intended to experts and provides digital images, as well as access to documents, price and time of the manufacturer.
Motive is a company of the group Einsa, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of claims, breakdowns or maintenance devoiture.
The guide GT evaluation is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3 100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has increased at a rate of 20% per year over the past three years, and has a turnover of EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, she began the process of internationalisation, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
For its part, Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and is located in Spain in 1979.
According to the sources of the company, 62% of its turnover is done in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33 000 garages, 3,000 of which are in Spain.
The turnover of global Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will amount to $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will collect 19.1 million euros, or 7.2 per cent more than last year.
In 2005, the group Solera was traded 1 000 million, today, its shares are valued at a total of $400 million.
Since 2007, it is part of the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the benchmark Standard & Poor's.
Internet auction of cars
Last October, the group has bought Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The operation has involved a cost of 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could widen next year to 15%.
The purpose of the acquisition was to provide more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of access to a huge international market.
This service and sale is intended exclusively for professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, leasing companies, garages, and professionals who must be registered before starting to carry out operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650 000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among its major markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1,500 sellers and 4,000 experts registered on the site.
It manages 3,000 announcements by day and on the Spanish market, 100 new announcements are published every day.
Under Spanish law, a car with the chassis number has been withdrawn can no longer move, but on the other hand, some parts which are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
The vintage cars can be réenregistrées, although they have been withdrawn, after the complex.
Description of garage in four stages
With the tool Auda-Taller, the company Audatex ensures that the user gets a quotation in only four steps: identify the vehicle, the replacement part, create a quotation and generate.
The ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince the older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1 034 vehicles, including 666 tourism, 109, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and trucks.
Of course, to use a computer and an Internet connection is required.
Once the model to repair identified through its chassis number, a graphic image of the model in question is then selects the necessary.
The user can include variables such as the price of labour, increases or reductions, then it can print the specifications for the return to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a tool to estimate as AudaPlus, but a catalogue of references.
The main difference between these two systems is that for garages does not include the time of labour estimated.
The cost of using this tool to the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be the subject of a credit.
Currently, the company Audatex works for that these images are in three dimensions.
It is an innovation that mechanics are a very good eye, as it will, for example, to select a door and turn to see the inside.
