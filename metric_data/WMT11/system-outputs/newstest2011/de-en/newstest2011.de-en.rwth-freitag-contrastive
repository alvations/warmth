What they do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague, Voldemort neither know nor the'culinary'.
The new Council of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will have to overcome language barriers, it appears that some of their old new colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and to be able to understand in the town of representation.
The newspaper aktuálně. Cz members of the new Council of the ČSSD a little "cut off", as they dominate the notorious slang that has become popular in recent years, in which the current coalition partners in Prague at the helm.
The encoded vocabulary, which was introduced in the verflossenen era of Mayor Pavel Bém Prague by the political elite, some of the best-known actors, borrowed from situations and Causae.
Surprisingly, it turns out that the new councils in relation to these new terminology.
The claim, at least.
"Anyone who is Voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I am a newcomer in the Prague policy", Lukáš Kaucký, the new councillor for Culture, the test of the "Godfather vocabulary."
But also the Council, Mr Karel Březina - a political veteran - responded in a similar way.
For example, the term'golf hole ".
"This is the only expression of those who put me here, I use now and then."
"I do not think much of slang."
From the vocabulary, which was published in aktuálně. Cz days in this year's June before the election of the ODS, the editorial pickte six concepts, particularly those that are associated with the notoriously Prague magistrate.
The Social Democrats, the term "Voldemort ',' biggest Prague golf hole" in the culinary, "bull neck" treason "and" verblechen ".
Three Prague gentlemen of the Council approved the test, the fourth - Mr Weinert, the head of the Prague education - promised to begin his participation in the conversation, but not even the handset.
The council, Mr Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things are, and how the Civic Democrats, I do not."
"For me, it is how we understand ourselves in our programmes" he responded.
As indicated, Lukáš Kaucký in the abovementioned headline allegedly failed to recognize that the influential entrepreneurs and friend of the former Lord Mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
The term "Voldemort" Kaucky says nothing and the only one that he erriet correctly, the test was "the biggest Prague golf hole".
"This is the Blanka tunnels" says Kaucký, added to safety but added: "but I know this from the newspaper."
And jokingly: "i will have to show a language course."
"Golf hole" will not only of matador Karel Březina deciphered, but also by the Council, Commissioner for the Environment Lukáš Plachý right as a tunnel Blanka deciphered.
Both Democrats also know, however, for whom the term Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý knows even when this figure is and what it means to "go into the Konditorei".
", that is, I believe in some kind of Prague catering operation", Plachý is quite close to the conundrum solution, when we know that this is the headquarters of Janoušeks firms.
In line with Březina claimed, however, this knowledge acquired from the newspaper, rather than this vocabulary.
The test participants, there seems to be under the Social Democrats actually no similar naturalisations slang.
"I have asked my colleagues, but obviously there is no such thing for us."
"We call upon us, and we also use words or nicknamed", says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - from his party comrades colloquially "Hulda".
"At school I was Bříza (birch), but I do not know whether my colleagues" tells us Karel Březina his nickname.
The newspaper Deník aktuálně. Cz has tried and behold - he works.
Councillor Weinert is for the party of the "grandfather" or the "old", the Representative Miroslav Poche machinations, before the elections, the party's sponsorship attention to some of my colleagues, "Igráček" (Czech Lego figure).
Nicknames are the only one that allow the Social Democrats, whose language.
Hulínský may not claim, "Hulda", but Deník aktuálně. Cz registered another nickname of Prague.
His nickname "Doctor of rubber truncheons rights" has to do with the fact that allegedly acquired Petr Hulínský his title Doctor juris in the Bratislaver police academy.
The government wants the torture of "witches" and issued a brochure,
Women who are branded as witches in Burkina Faso, usually some common social characteristics.
They are part of the older generation, they cannot find work - for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
If one of these women to witch "will", will be isolated, so that they can be dangerous for the rest of the village.
"Men are affected by this fate quite rare."
"The young and healthy women this, since they are at work and help" describes a sister describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a Spezialheim by more than a hundred women who were expelled from their communities.
The local government decided, against these abnormal "social action".
And for this reason, a brochure, the "witch hunt".
The issue has a downside.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read" said the newspaper "the standard" to the dilemma of the written information.
To be accused of witchcraft is, but also in other African countries.
In the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, Ghana, the 27 - year-old Ammy Hemmahová of three women and two men to death - they doused with kerosene and set them.
About this incident, including the BBC server.
The perpetrators claimed, however, The matter would have been only a combination of unfortunate circumstances.
Their version that was inflamed oil, which will be used for ritual Salbungen.
And, after the group, "an evil spirit" from "good health".
The isolation of "witches" support the people here without regard to their education.
"The standard quoted a 42 - year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso:" Fresserinnen human souls are used as a threat, "he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso, at least tried to defuse the witch-hunt that has mitgemischt the gambianische President last year, the President himself.
"President Yahya Jammeh revived after the death of his aunt, a monstrous witch hunt, because they had the death and would try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"He called shaman from nearby Guinea to aid, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the bodyguard of President indiscriminately arrested men and women from villages gambianischen kidnapped and brought to the farm in Kanilai", the organisation Amnesty International in its report.
On the farm were forced from prison people to drink an Absud from plants with halluzinogener effect, but also the bowel and kidney problems.
Two of the arretierten people survived not stay on the farm.
It was on the basis of international pressure were released nearly a thousand prisoners.
The tenants of Bakala: it is in the oven - but pays higher rent
An older man untersetzter leaves the clients centre of society RPG Byty "coal Barons" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental housing in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm of a file with three new rental contracts to three apartments, for their own and the homes of his daughters and his son, who is serving a prison sentence.
All three within the framework of the so-called "deregulation" increased the rent increases.
Instead of SEK 3500 monthly rent to fork out the son next year for a 2 bedroom apartment with kitchen in the second category 4100 kroner.
"And there is no heat in the apartment, fluent in hot water and a simple coal fireplace, if he angered the finger at the new lease to the son, he has a full power.
"But what I - has signed" he explains annoys half and half resigned.
The citizens association Byty okd. cz, the new rental conditions as "illegitimate and immoral" advises the tenants to sign new contracts and until 7 December to wait when it intends to publish guidance, how to proceed against such contracts.
But the man is on the horizon.
", the other", he is a benighted face.
The Ostrava region will to a large "deregulation laboratory".
After the New Year is this deregulation most rental housing in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not market-oriented pay rent.
Aktuálně. Cz decided, therefore, this "laboratory" to visit in person.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the region of Ostrava and nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday packed.
Alongside the door of the bodyguards of a security agency and a call machine.
"Rent" in 2011, is a special Tastfeld on the touch screen.
Briefly touched upon this and the machine will disgorge a registration list.
We have the number "157" deciphered and piepst them on the large display from the ceiling of the waiting area.
Half a hour later in the series.
A little later an old couple, the waiting room to ask after the rent, but the onslaught in the waiting room is apparently not even the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the current problems, repairs, insurance and the like.
In the middle of November fly in the region Kuverts with the new rental contracts most tenants out of a total of 44.000 apartments in the portfolios of RPG in the mailboxes.
The RPG Byty proposes them in the letter, a rent increase from about 15 to 38 percent.
The special counters for the new rent in the centre of clients since 18 November.
"The action is just over a week, that is to say, this is just the beginning", the honourable behind the counter after an initial hesitation, as the "client" out to be a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakalas former miners' homes are a sensitive issue.
Before the elections, the Parliament, from Ostrawa Vice-President Lubomír Zaorálek by the ČSSD this issue quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of them.
"Twenty years I want a new floor."
"Not even ne besch. Wc glasses could change", the man.
Until now, the staff, especially pensioners, in order to see whether they receive the promised tenants moderation, which promises RPG when they enter the supply of specialist in time.
In the half reduced February rent the other tenants, the new rental agreement until 15 December.
Until now, "deregulation" in Havířov but everything else, overloaded than demand.
"From yesterday's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 because of this" the counters.
Rpg offers both on their websites, as well as wall panels individual rental agreements, where necessary.
Should the rent parties but the new rent, they will be set by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach" said RPG on its Web sites.
"No one goes to court" said one of the staff of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the clients centre is at least partly right.
"I have 13.000 (5.000 kroner) pension, remain me for dinner, where should I find the money for a court dispute" he says.
Then the employees but uncertain.
"Let us see."
"Mr Zaorálek tells them about the media, they should not sign and so people are still waiting for" she warns.
The regulated rent in the largest part of the Czech Republic to New Year 2011 and RPG Byty according to rent increase an economic necessity.
"The existing level of rent is not enough for the maintenance of the housing fund" said Pavel Klimeš, the director of the housing portfolio of society RPG Byty and - by the disgruntled tenants, neglect of the housing fund is the homeowners the main reason for the increase in.
While RPG could invest in the years between 2005 and 2010 from the rents collected four billion in homes, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 will be 5.2 billion.
At the großformatigen LCD display from the ceiling of the cushion bellies in the waiting room of Havířov appear to keep a few red shining information.
"The rent increases by 2011% in 15 and 31 200 homes, with more than 90% of the homes of RPG."
"Always means a maximum of CZK 7.50 per square metre per month" is to read on the LCD screen.
Only 400 homes from the portfolio of RPG increased the rent increases by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is the increase in extremely low rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square metre" argues RPG.
In 2600, the rent next year at the same level.
Rpg Byty promises that the deregulation rents not jumped in, but gradually within four and eight years.
What is more, given the company a further commitment: all revenue from the rent increase (see diagram) wants to put the company back into their homes, especially in heat savings - in new windows and insulation.
But the priority should be to those people who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects saw a - the office is also a nursery
The office buildings Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company arch. Design.
But who would expect a mini nursery, with all that entails: colourful walls, creative furniture, toys and even a mini playground on the outside terrace.
This nursery is since last year, the staff of arch. Design available.
The study and architecture office arch. Design, whose Ateliers a number of prominent Brünner buildings, from the first drafts of the new building Avriopoint with the premises for his firms mini nursery.
Prescient, because most of its 90 staff (interior) are in the baby boom ages and the company is keen that the Projektantinnen and Architektinnen as quickly as possible.
Together with the possibility of shortening working, the nursery is another bonus, has to offer the arch. Design its employees in the concept of social program.
The Bauingenieurinnen and architektinnen have it easier, demanding their profession and child care.
The mini nursery is an original idea of the staff of arch. Design and with the support of the management them financial assistance from the European Union and of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The occupational mini nursery is financed by the operational programme, human resources and employment policy from the European Social Fund and the state of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (grants of $2, 8 million CZK) could be obtained the necessary facilities and equipment and for the duration of 2 years for qualified staff and for the operation.
After the absorption of funds (2 years) is committed to the society arch. Design to operate the mini nursery 3 more years at their own expense.
The preparation of this project, a year, and the society economy rating in the of effective aid.
The children Subcontinent qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten lesson Rin, the kindergarten children can visit without altersmäßige restrictions, although most of them are about three years old.
And because it is a mini nursery, at the same time, only 5 children, however, the day on several children each other.
The nursery operation is flexible to the needs of parents, the children of all staff have in relation to the use of the nursery equal rights, regardless of the corporate hierarchy and their position.
Although individual education and care, the programme content in the mini nursery nevertheless comparable with the framework programme of pre-school education.

What is more, the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive business environment.
The parents can always look at the children and so the stress in the late collection of children from a faraway kindergarten.
The parents use their working time more productive.
No wonder that natural and loyal employee relations.

A bone House fascinated even after 100 years. If you look at the Interieure of Gaudi to
The roof seems to be the backs of prehistoric Echse, as the vertebral column of a Dinosauriers the stairs and the Balkone are past Fischmäuler.
This is the Casa Batlló of Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
The local inhabitants of the house, with its organic forms the nickname "bones".
Organic forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, Kachelsplittern and mosaic, the scales, facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all this are standard features for the youth of Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the House plays with beautiful lines, lack force paints and Texturen, the natural and life.
Only on closer inspection you observe that everything from geometry, rhythm and thoughtful.
In the night, the whole façade of plastic, dramatic and the special Anleuchtung reinforces the luster of colors.
The same dynamic lines and tortuous forms dominate the interior of the house.
Waves of well-formed wood copied the window frames, parapets, Zierelemente by doors, even Guck holes and trade.
The house Batlló in the quarter Eixample in the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia No 43 was created by converting a house in 1877, said the architects Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialists Josep Batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but eventually he agreed to the idea Gaudís on an unusual and cheaper, too.
The rental house Casa Batlló Antoni Gaudí, however, is not alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol together.
On the drawing board take away for the representative of the realities owner and the use of mosaics of the facade was his idea.
In the design of the facade, but also many other Bildner and artists.
The joint work on the drafts of the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí.
So Jujol was also involved in the construction of Gaudís house Casa Milá in the park Güell where other works of Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house of the local inhabitants of organic forms the nickname "bones".
Others described it the specific Fensteröffnungsmechanismus due to the "yawning house".
It also says that at the top of the building is the sword of Saint George, the barons of Catalonia.
But also other bildhauerische elements of a hidden religious motives.
Gaudí devised for the House, for the time Zentralheizungssystem with unique ventilation channels and typical Kaminen.
Something seems bizarre their propensity to 45 degrees.
When he ignored Gaudí consistently all the building codes and could not be led astray.
Before construction - he of the city's planning permission, but the claims made about the planned reconstruction were so vague that the city fathers two years later, the completion of the result that they demanded.
The gentlemen of the Council, among other things, that the building with its pillars in the public sidewalk.
The changes, there was no longer, however, quite the contrary - only fifteen days after the invitation of the urban community, Josep Batlló submitted an application for approval of the rental of the two höchstgelegenen floors of the House - and they gave him promptly.
The homeowners themselves, in the lower floors.
In the gallery in the 2th floor was a social showroom, in the third floor of the bedroom and private rooms of the house.
The ground floor was leased to a jeweller business.
The whole sechsstöckige buildings going up the stairs to the roof terrace.
All the main elements of the new right-wing corner and precise lines removed and replaced by bent and geschwungene walls.
Gaudí worked but also with a modern approach to mutual combination of rooms.
The social part is by opening the showroom doors completely and while a larger society without having to take vertraulicheren talks on a certain intimacy.
The house was given by Gaudís reconstruction apart from a new facade was also a very unusual roof and two other floors.
Impressively is also Gaudís game with the light and the blue and white glasierten Kacheln, which is dressed in the courtyard and the light.
The game of these two colours gives all floors of the House a maximum light.
He made the principle that reflects the white light better than dark colours, which absorb sunlight, on the contrary.
The House Casa Batlló, which was included in the world heritage list of Unesco, can visit today everyone.
The first floor is the geräumigste and prächtigste housing made available to the public.
The homeowners determined in the years to this step and that on the occasion of the 150. geburtstags of the famous Creator.
After it was discovered that this is a very profitable business, it has maintained the surveys, and extended to other common and the attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
The price to visit the monument is no trifling matter, he is 16.50 EUR, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourists cards received 20 percent reduction.
This amount exceeds the entry prices to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
Anyone who wants to learn the real atmosphere of the House, with its Drachentürmchen should try to close friendship with one of the inhabitants and visit him at home.
The right mattress and right beds rust? Women have other desires than men
The tollste bed frame, but the quality of the deck area - the good bed mattress and rust.
These must complement each other, in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
In choosing to play a role - the weight, size, the state of health and, last but not least, the sex of the Schläfers.
Equally important is the Interieur, mattress and rust.
Typical example?
In a weekend house In which are not regularly, are not Latex mattresses, because they need much longer, "hot".
In addition, they are much more difficult than usual Polyurethan mattresses.
And, they should be changed regularly.
If they do not have enough Entlüftungskanälchen at its core, and on a hard disk, moisture movement: it is not excluded that tape from it.
Of course, also plays a role in the election, which is used to.
Anyone who has been a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with Weichschicht, will be difficult to get used to a low mattress with hard surface.
"All ice hockey players who have returned from the NHL, have complained to me that they cannot sleep properly."
"For their abgeschundenen shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a Weichschicht from Visco sparkling (memory Foam - a form of memory Polymer)."
"I recommend including diabetic people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, causing the" information "from the ligaments and skin badly" said Sylva Hadamcziková who specialised in padded furniture.
That is why I have many years ago ice hockey players, but also other customers these mattresses with Visco sparkling (Memory foam).
"Today, it is no longer a problem, because such mattresses provide the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And we must not necessarily be a famous ice hockey players, the benefits of the Visco surfactants, to learn.
This "miracle" actually works quite simple.
The sparkling optimalisiert his toughness and form the heat absorbed, in other words, he schmiegt by a warm body.
Nowhere is there, in the night shifts are not around, after a major battle.
It is simply sleeping much better.
The viskoelastische sparkling also offers protection against Dekubitus (advising).
In the election of the mattress size should add to body size is still the length of the foot soles, or some 21 to 34 cm.
Man and woman who are in the 180 cm tall, need a 210 to 220 cm bed.
Each of the sleepers should be at least 90 cm space available, 180 cm.
In separate beds, for example, In singles, 120 to 140 cm.
The comfort, and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb for the ideal bed width: "if you on the back, should be enough room for the easy angewinkelten arms" advises every Helena Prokopová, the guild of the Polsterer and Raumausstatter, which for many years the issue of healthy makes and the ergonomics of furniture and at specialist schools.
In a double bed everybody needs its own rust and his own mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattresses are also high.
Otherwise, there is nothing for it, as the Roste in differing degrees to fit and it is not possible for each bed.
Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with the skeleton 15 cm, should account for at least three centimetres in the form of class and fine cushion.
"With the hand or placing may feel the feathers in any case" warns Helen Prokopová.
Any mattress requires a special type of rust.
Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and document as union of Siam twins have to be found in the bedroom.
These mattresses are not and cannot wash, which is already common practice today.
And since you lose in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 litres of sweat, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years, becoming a huge (And congested sieve).
Experts also reject advertising slogans, the mattress with a lifespan of up to 25 years, and even a lifetime guarantee.
Every case has its ifs and buts.
And it is therefore a practical advice from dealers: mattress of 120 or 140 cm width should the hygiene of waschbaren, not abziehbaren salary, however, it is recommended to use a Matratzenschoner, and wash it easily.
Even if Rundumreißverschluss usually mattresses salary with Rundumreißverschluss, so you get after the opening two halves (immensely important for the washing process and the washing machines size!), is the manipulation with larger mattresses, above all, often as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath.
They are in bed instead of a Rostes a record?
Get Out!
Or, for a bed for undesirable guests and for a single night.
So should the disk with ventilation holes (if not included) use and mattresses with the skeleton and 15 cm minimum level with the Taschenfederkern and fine cushion.
Polyurethan mattresses are not in such a document.
For not verstellbare Roste setting with 14 to 18 (Lamellen) are Latex or sandwich mattresses (also combinations of Latex and Kokos), always pay Roste with a larger number of standards, from 28 and more to do with Lordosenstütze in Lendenwirbelbereich and the ability to regulate the tough standards.
On verstellbare Lamellen Roste no mattresses with the skeleton, because they do not respond to the workplace ergonomics disguise.
In addition to the suspension of the Steife will be offered special flexible shoulder modules.
This is about a specific fastening the services that makes it possible einzudrücken the pen, or to verwinkeln so that they allow the specific Einsinken the shoulder of the Schläfers.
Especially for men with broad shoulders, an important matter.
There are even mattress manufacturers, which have started, "gentlemen mattresses" Weichzonen for the shoulder area.
The ladies - is intended to give these Weichzonen in the Hüftgegend.
For ambitious customers are punktelastische Flügelfedersysteme (Lattoflex) or Roste with punktelastischen Pads contact with the Multitorsionsfederung.
The pressure will be distributed at several points, thus reducing the tension.
But - if the right mattress and rust a bad (too large and fülliges) used pillow, spent most of the benefits.
Here, too, a rule of thumb: the pillow to prop up the head, his top should extend only to the shoulders, so that the back muscles relax.
Ideal is therefore a 50 x 60 cm deep cushions, as it may, for example, the Scandinavians.
In the pages of the pillow (along with the Schulterentlastungszone in rust or the Weichzone in the mattress) make up the back.
Some of our modern mattresses have something in common with the former (but) straw bags with hay.
Modern companies increasingly use natural materials, or at least their mixtures.
Also in mattresses says the new magic word "organic".
Instead of oil raw materials used in the manufacture of Polyurethan foaming having increasingly naturelle oils - for example, Rizinus and soya oil.
Soya is used well known by all manufacturers.
"Organic mattresses, which says its nuclear materials is purely natural" said Petr Vašíček by the company Tropico Plus.
Naturstoffe but also to be used in the manufacture of mattresses - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
But one can also micro capsules, which spread the sleeping fresh forest or Lavendelduft.
Here is a difference between a man and a woman.
While the men "kühlender" plant extracts from birch leaves, so that the mattress to absorb the heat and cool the body can have the salary for women "wärmende" effect.
Extracts from red Paprikaschoten stimulate the blood circulation, the weaker sex when the sleeping wohlig warm.
And today's favorite?
Mattresses from Kaltschaum (he has greater Poren with destroyed cell structure and is therefore atmungsaktiver than standard Polyurethan and much more flexible).
Through the combination of the various Steife (severity) of Kaltschäumen and Visco foaming having additional zones mattresses, who know exactly where to head, hip and heels.
For a quality mattress, though, has to fork out 7000 kroner and more.
Gesundheitsmatratzen but usually with lower value added tax, since they apply as medical device.
The first Czech companies was Gumotex this advantage.
You see, the mattress and not to save the rust is so easily.
And there are special offers from manufacturers and retailers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
The brand Magniflex the mattress Duofreeze with in relation verstepptem Visco sparkling Memory for 11.990 CZK.
The second you get free.
It was the Tempur material that launched the era of viskoelastischen sparkling substances with open cell structure and high density in almost kosmischem pace.
No wonder, when they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to the launch of enormous excessive impositions.
Tempur will heat in soft, entrenched in a cool environment it again.
So it suits the human body and distributed in an optimal manner the pressure.
It is therefore not only an ideal to prevent fire, but generally increased sleep comfort.
Viskoelastische sparkling substances are not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as the, in particular Fußpolstern, allowing the legs and the factors that facilitate.
Domestic manufacturers, for example, the sparkling substances Eucatherm C, Twin KiwiSaver or similar products.
More and more parents want people controls, in order to have the kids under control
The fear for their own children grow and so are more and more parents to supervise them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented to search cars, people, as well, which would also be helpful in such cases, such as Janatková recently, in whatever the nine-year Anička.
The device is about as big as a packet of cigarettes but soon may not be greater than a wristwatch.
Many people in the case of the missing Anička and so they consider ways and means looking to protect their children.
For the price of one of their privacy.
"We are trying to say that it is by no means Herumspionieren, but an effective way to reduce the likelihood that there will be a tragedy" Petr Pilin Macro by society Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that it can come in individual cases of abuse of such devices, for example, if there is someone in the pocket, without that he knows, but we have had no such case."
"Most customers buy it for security reasons" adds Pilin added.
In his opinion, should know the child should always, what purpose the "box" and how they are used in an emergency.
The child psychologist Dana Bočková notes, however, that a child, if it is not such a thing, it is easy to.
"Even very young children show great creativity, when it comes to certain things deliberately to lose if they do not want to be controlled."
"The mobile phones set initially high expectations among parents, but they can just as easily, as these new controls" said Mrs Bočková.
Their view is also questionable whether such a body in the event of an attack.
"The planned kidnappings controlled the kidnappers controls virtually always whether the child has any electronics, which could be located."
"Today it is the mobile phone."
"If such controls wider use, they also, as their sale would be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals of the police are always one step ahead" said psychologist.
It acknowledges that similar devices in a sudden attack by a paedophile very helpful.
Roberta Čech by society RC monitoring, according to the tracking services for both cars, as well as for people who can help the existence of such equipment, even if it will be destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The machine is so that it is the position in certain intervals."
"Even if it were to be destroyed immediately, at least the final position of the person concerned."
"The more expensive equipment is even a knife, in other words, if you hinfällt and motionless in immediately, the device sends a warning to the position" said Mr Čech.
In his opinion, may have similar services also smart phones with navigation, you need einzuspielen only a special software.
The problem with the current positioning devices is that it is either equipment in matchbox size, the trailers or smaller mobile phones.
There is always the risk that they will lose.
Mr Pilin of the Macro Weil, testing it in the present devices that look like ordinary digital clocks.
"This has the advantage that it must recognize the potential attackers at all that there is a surveillance and tracking equipment.
"Only after a certain time, or he can see what the police a head start" he added.
No matter what the direction of development - to Armbändern or supporters, always use the same technology, such as the vehicle tracking.
The combination of positioning function with the GPS system (as in Ms in the car) and the role of a mobile phone, which the current position.
The army has so many detonators that could umwickeln, the Czech Republic, but only two years
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometres detonators, with bombs.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defence, 224 kilometres but because of the army camp.
It is reassuring to know that ausgesorgt the armed forces for 225 years.
The problem is the durability of the detonators - two, but no more than four years.
The army bought the detonators of the Company STV group, for example, mere 40 million kroner.
In his explanatory statement for the purchase of this huge amount but because of the General Staff MF DNES, the soldiers would consume annually, but because the 60 kilometres.
The research by army Pyrotechnikern, according to the MF DNES out, from the fact that the whole army an intensive pyrotechnic education - all generals and officers of the army commandos, to the secretaries and women.
The defense minister Alexandr Vondra and army General Vlastimil Picek.
The only way to justify the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres Zündschnüren halfway.
This length is 25.000 Detonationen.
But it also would extend this army stocks for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts that educating each new professional soldiers two metres but because completely, then the army by these Neueinkäufe - in the view of the increased needs of pioneering and units - created a reassuring stock for the already mentioned in 225 years.
It complained of Schnelleinsatzbrigade recently when Defense Minister Vondra, they had almost no cartridges for small arms, so register are severely restricted because of the lack of resources.
The underpants deficiencies.
"I am not a, why they buy from such detonators."
But it is ultimately her decision, they will know to what they need. "
"For us, the army is a good customer, we want to get as much as possible" says the manager of the STV Group Děcký Jan.
Jan Pejšek, the Department of Defense spokesman justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometres but because the army would have been so for at least ten years with this "ammunition" heckle him.
Jan Děcký from the STV Group, but only by a four-year duration of the detonators and police and army Pyrotechniker only two years.
"The perfect storage are also mentioned in the four years possible", one of them, who wants to remain unnamed, but not as a soldier accused of criticism of the army.
After the duration of use must be tested thoroughly any ammunition, whether they are reliable and does not threaten the lives of soldiers.
These tests are not in vain, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Defense Department is the amount of rebate for the 445 km but because.
"It cost us sixty percent less than the successful delivery of 244 kilometres" says spokesman Pejšek the position of the buyers of the Ministry of defence.
Only by way of comparison, the annual consumption of Zündschnüren of Pyrotechnikern police, liquidate the munitions from the Second World War or the Soviet army, some years barely 1.500 metres.
And the police are always such quantities of ammunition, which they can use before the end of the period.
The safety of Pyrotechniker, also consider the possibility of flexible purchases more modern and reliable detonators.
The Ministry of Defence has huge problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty, when preparing the zweihunderttausendköpfige Czechoslovak People's Army on its campaign on the Rhine.
The Pyrotechnikern, according to the MF DNES, expects the Czech armed forces in a few years, the same problem with the killing of hundreds of kilometres of old detonators, which today is "good" has bought.
Until now, the contacts that I have won because of competition
The victorious placement in the competition "small entrepreneur of the Year" Lukáš Pytloun in relation to the sale of its hotels.
The winner of last year, the competition "small entrepreneur of the year" was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The history of his success as a film script.
Lukáš Pytloun traveled.
Only abroad was aware that there is a good in Liberec wondering how at reasonable prices.
From the savings from its holiday work abroad and with the help of a loan from a bank he emerged a baufälliges house with five homes.
Given that he was an university student in the sixth semester, this was certainly a daunting challenge.
"The quality / price ratio angered me and so I tried to do something about it" says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he rented to foreign workers.
The profit he immediately back into the house, which he then step by step to pension with 54 beds umbaute.
Since then, it was only seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec four pensions, two stilgerechte restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of accommodation categories.
The komfortabelste of them was until recently the Viersternehotel "Pytloun design hotel".
This year, another first-class hotel.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties on the Pytloun hotels have asked itself" says the business number one last year.
"A large proportion of this licence sales at the behest of hotels had just to win the competition" entrepreneur of the year, "adds Mr Pytloun appreciatively.
The victory gave him greater fame, popularity in Liberec and environment.
"The people saw me on the street, often congratulated me even now and I must say that did really well" he recalls.
I commend all those who want to create something to participate in this competition.
We need to win as well, any visibility is good.
He says that he prefers to date from the contacts and acquaintances, to which it would not.
"With some people who I met because of competition, I still regular business relations."
With the success of glory, in his opinion, a little in any of its staff.
And since he has the seventy.
"I see them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that is the general recognition."
I do not see this as a personal success, no, this is the result of the good work of all of us. "
"My name is only brought to the fore" said modest Lukáš Pytloun.
I wish my successors easier a year than we had in Farmet
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination Farmet has seen the worst.
The price of the first rank of competition Vodafone company of the year last year, Karel Žďárský Karel, holders of Farmet.
The jury acknowledged the efforts, with whom he stampfte from the small tool construction in Česká Skalice a company from the soil, the hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this not only myself, but also all my staff and has strengthened our self-confidence in the fight with the competition" says of last year's winners.
At the beginning of the company's history of Farmet was the effort to do something useful.
And then the state his father, Karel Žďárský as compensation for the communists seized property offered a small workshop to lease, he did not hesitate for long, his career in the company, in which he was busy, ditch And, with a few friends of his father's company the manufacture of plastic tubs.
A short time later began to focus on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years, it is the largest manufacturer of automatic presses throughout Central Europe.
But the success of the aforementioned competition and Medialisierung is not aware of the.
"Not only that our customers the brand Farmet now clear, our foreign partners began the, to be able to work with a company which has won in their country's greatest success to attach greater value" says Karel Žďárský.
Last year was not Farmet but only in the euphoria of victory.
The appreciation of the economic results of the company in 2008 and part of 2009.
And 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, the less the citizens, but above all companies, reached their peak - many companies were forced to suspend their investment projects and the purchase of new equipment and technologies.
"This situation could not escape, of course."
"The sales were reduced by 40 percent, we had to limit production and even resort to layoffs" said Karel Žďárský
A viable companies must take sometimes such unpopular measures.
But managed to get to grips with the situation and to keep the company in the black figures, although with lower profits than before the crisis.
When a company was unwilling to make cuts - investment in research and development.
"The grant we built a research and training center, we encouraged our presentation at international fairs and procured main domestic exhibitions" says Žďárský prices.
Everything indicates that we have overcome the crisis.
The sales are growing, and the number of new staff.
"The new winner, I wish you all the joy of victory - but in more calm" Karel Žďárský.
An opinion poll, which deals with nonsensical rules
The opinion poll, the "absurdity of the year" is the fourth time part of the competition.
Some rules, from the world.
The dubious winner of next year, the poll "absurdity of the year" wake the duty to create documents to authorities, are available online.
For instance, more than a third of four thousand stimmabgebenden entrepreneurs.
So the social security administration a paper excerpt from the trade register, even if the officials could access through two mouse clicks.
The poll is changing now.
"The Czech social Security Administration will in future control of social insurance countries no longer require extracts from the trade register", ČSSZ's spokeswoman Jana buraňová.
The poll "absurdity" of the year, it is all rules and regulations, to meet the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and the absurd.
This is earlier this year for the fourth time part of a business competition, the tsch. Economic newspaper (HN) will be held and enjoyed in the public.
The last year of the three thousand people in the vote, there were four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations, which will only serve to hinder the business.
"For example, the number of income tax forms, we take a front rank in the world" said Karel Havlíček by the association of small and medium-sized businesses and businesspeople in the Czech Republic.
The simplification of the business is in recent years the proclaimed goal of all governments.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic in relation to the conditions of the 74th grade, compared with the previous year, eight seats placement.
The absurdity of the year was the first time in years, and plays each year after the same scenario.
Everyone can rise from April to inject competition at the end of september, administrative and bureaucratic nonsense.
To register the website address is www. firmaroku. Cz. To look beyond the organisers of the competition seven candidates for the "price" and the public on the Internet on the websites www. firmaroku. Cz / absurdita and www. ihned. Cz.
It let the absurdity, gets the most votes.
For this year's poll, more than a hundred, angemeldetVVPP 105 senseless rules and regulations.
The tips are not only of entrepreneurs, but also by professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "Fina lists" of competition, including provisions that maintenance vehicles on highways and have to pay toll expressways or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, must vorrichten two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the sides of the competition.
The announcement of the competition at the beginning of November in Prague's Wenceslas Square is part of a Happenings regularly participate in the political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-sized businesses and businesspeople of Tsch. Republic and Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of Tsch. Republic at the height of the competition with the game.
"Where the state employers spanners in the works, there can be no real economic recovery, it is my aim to lift each year at least thirty paragraphs that today's entrepreneurs are unnecessarily their businesses" said Martin Kocourek, the Minister for Industry and trade.
The efforts to create the orders from the show.
In 2007 disrupted the people most entrepreneurs the obligation to notify the Office of the of their permanent plant three days in advance, with the intention, with a view to an exhibition or go to Kirmes.
This was a revision of the law.
The duty, which received 2007 the second largest number of votes - the obligation to notify the labour office duties of employees in up to 30 days - the law on the so-called "green card".
And - all good things come in threes.
The absurdity of the year 2009 was elected to the regulation, physiotherapists, in a hot room a mirror, a fridge and two people scales.
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the fridge duty fell away.
A new category of socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of economic newspaper (HN) is the category of person of the year 2010 ".
The idea of this competition, it is reasonable and fair ventures.
"We want to support such firms, which are aware of the consequences of your business activities on the environment and socially responsible initiatives support" said Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile phone company Vodafon, the Ausrufer and guarantor of this competition, as well as competition "rebel of the year."
This year's first year of this particular subset of the main competition Vodafon company of the year for the success is not the only long-term goal.
The history of each of them is extremely inspirativ and would provide enough material for a separate article.
Although they differ on the subject of their work, their efforts have a common denominator - support and respect.
It is, for example, governance-challenged people, because of personal problems or the health of its own staff.
Among the fourteen Fina lists from throughout the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software companies Et Netera, not formal sports teams Among its staff, which will take part in many tournaments in a variety of sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the region Pardubice society is Isolit well done, which is already seventeen years main sponsor of a gehandikapte Foundation Fund for governance-challenged children.
A paper factory from Poděbrady cares about their health, disabled people, which make up 70 percent of its workforce, what they called "Verantwortungsbewusste company in the region of Bohemia" was appreciated; Vodafone competition in the context of this region of the third.
In the region Olomouc won the accounting firm MiRyz soft, including a fluid and also to an average of 35 hours per week reduced working time and without proportionate cutting wages.
The jury honorierte on receiving the title but also the fact that the company mainly in Czech manufacturers, citizens' initiatives in their area and works for green principles.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible, the consequences of our business and administration for the environment" said Ryznarová their manager Miluše.
The responsible Enlogit IT companies from the region Ústí nad Labem, in turn, is worried about the health of its staff and therefore has purchased them all to note Books ergonomics armchairs and keypads, also encourages them to their employees work from home and in corporate actions they used carte ring services, by a local sheltered workshop.
"We also support the Foundation" people in need, "the local Roma Kommunität concrete assistance" says Ondřej Suchý, the representative of the company.
Last but Not least is the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlsbad region here, their employees in the form of extra Bonussen contributes to their pensions.
"We offer our employees' contributions to the food, for the work, to increase their skills and for the holidays" says Josef Strapáč by the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winners in the Mährisch Schlesischen region.
The category of person of the year were automatically notified all county Fina lists of competition Vodafon company of the year, the notice of the application of the enclosed questionnaire and post them by 15 August the organisers.
Wrong or incomplete filled in answers to the questionnaire were excluded from the organisers of the assessment.
"If the representatives of the competing firms the unanswered questions, they were excluded from the competition" person of the year ", in the main competition Vodafone company of the year, it does not."
"A separate application only to this competition is not possible, because it is only a subset of the main competition of the year" said Karel Goldman of organising the agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner soil Fund - arrests of police in a public tender
In the building of the land fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police arrests in recent days.
It was the European media entrepreneurs and real estate brokers Luboš g. of the Detektiven in handcuffs.
This had allegedly tried to manipulate a public competition to Restitutionsansprüchen so that the competition offered land a specific interests.
This should have paid Luboš g. for half a million.
"At this stage, I can only confirm that the police a person for the offence of fraudulent practices in a public competition" said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner prosecutor of the newspaper Právo ", further details could provide them with regard to the ongoing investigation.
24 hours later was released the 46 - year-old entrepreneur from the police.
How he was able to manipulate the public competition, we can speculate about the lack of official information.
The speaker of the land fund Lubomír Černá led to the question of Právo, the police have made in the Pilsner soil and this fund actually arrests during a public competition.
"It was a client and nothing to do with one of our staff" she became apparent.
The public competition had Mrs Černá according to the correct name'call for tenders of claims on the transfer of land in accordance with the law "and would take place in cases where bezeigen several applicants offered interest in the land.
"These people value their offer, within the framework of the through the transfer disbursement Restitutionsansprüche, as the in the land value."
"In accordance with the requirements of the order of the potential acquirer, then gives the fund the land to the person with the highest offer" said the spokeswoman.
Luboš g. were apparently information available, who had filed the request and because he was reasonable person, because he had bought a number of Restitutionsansprüchen, he offered a land interests that he is withdrawing from the competition.
Obviously against a fat compensation.
It would also be a sufficient explanation as to why he had such a large amount of money.
Luboš g. had in the past too good contacts with the Pilsner soil fund.
So he played in the issue of the former head of the land fund Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted because he failed to substitute restitution of properties, which have been passed already location decisions.
At the time Luboš g. acquired the land fund, for example, land intended to build public roads, where was the construction of the access to the area Borské pole was planned.
Later he exchanged this very well with the government against a house directly in the historic centre of the city, which far exceeded the value of the land.
The local authority had to Kleinbeigeben was with a heavy heart, in order not to jeopardise the works by blocking the land.
The cost of living rise by several hundred per month
Households are not only from January with higher costs for all types of energy, but also with higher water and sewage charges and for district heating and some grow rents.
Families from January to several hundred more kronor per month from the wallet than before.
Electricity is up by 4.6 percent more expensive gas at 2 percent and more, in some cities will have to pay for up to a tenth more for water supplies and in some places, the district heating supplies.
The electricity costs the housing budgets annually a few hundred kronor.
The Stark electricity prices were reduced by all the main suppliers, it is clear that the promotion of electricity produced from renewable sources, notably from photovoltaic installations.
Gas is only moderately more expensive, but exactly when to inflame the people most and have the highest consumption.
Here, too, with several hundred kronor per year.
While electricity and gas prices across the Czech Republic, the prices for district heating varies from city to city.
Above all, price increases.
It must pay the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové January for district heating per month up to 50 kronor, more than 1000 kronor per year pay families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague, 9 percent higher water and sewage charges and that is the case that the city's infrastructure rent increases.
If the rent, there are only 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague is compared to the Czech Republic is still among the lowest.
In Northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, rising water and sewage charges rise by 7.4 percent.
Enormous rental price increases are expected in 140.000 rental apartments, for example, in January, the rent regulation.
As, for example, the housing companies CPI Byty, in Ústí nad Labem 2500 homes, to increase the rent from January at one hundred percent.
Anyone who is not with the rent increase, wants to prosecute the company.
The regulated rents, which you pay in approximately 300.000 homes, are likely to increase next year by more than 10 percent.
Czech children get drunk with'and rum, beer is out - it is simply too slow
', rum and vodka, for once, a good whisky, has stolen the father of the house from the bar.
These are the drinks, must be drunk Czech teenager under fifteen most frequently.
No exceptions are Children, who must ausschlafen their hangover repeatedly in the hospital.
This comes from the experience of doctors who are faced with similar cases in the inclusion of children's departments of clinics.
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion, because it takes too long to be drunk."
"The current trend is clearly hard alcohol" said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the chief doctor of the children's department in the mittelböhmischen clinic Hořovice.
"A bottle of Whisky, if it is successful, the father of the House bar, and if not, then at least'or vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage that it can interfere with juice, then it is not so much" said the chief doctor.
The speaker of the hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him right.
"Most often refers to Branca or rum."
"This is the current trend of alcohol, particularly in primary schools."
"It was also about slivovice, you take from home", Mrs Jurinová.
Chefarzt Pelikán according to thirteen or -year drinkers in the hospital receiving no exception.
Before the clinic in Hořovice, from which he has been working for this year, he was ten years in the paediatric ward of the hospital, where the Motol ambulances angetrunkene pupils from local and long distance.
"A girl had to be hospitalisiert four times."
"Their career began with 12 years ago, when they first with 3.5 mg of alcohol in the blood and in combination with" Extase "was taken" the doctor describing a particularly severe case.
"It was in the exhibition site in Holešovice on any dance party."
"The interesting thing was that it was not their mother, strange that their daughter home 48 hours" the chief doctor.
The lack of interest to parents or their incredible tolerance toasts with their own Sprösslingen is regarded as one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism by children.
A real dependence in the true sense of the word is not, according to experts in children.
"Alcoholism is a longstanding chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomenon and that is not the case in these children."
Among those who repeatedly alcohol, is mostly a negative family social Background characteristic, "said chief doctor Pelikán.
The Speaker of the hospital Motol, Mrs Jurinová, were trained by mid-November approximately forty drunken children in the abandonment of children and youth.
However, only the cases with severe alcohol poisoning, which made a hospital stay is required, in the statistics.
Drunken children who are taken to ambulatory care from parents or, if necessary, by the police, are not registered.
Apart from the cases in which children just as a bottle of spirits in the school austrinken there are of the opinion of Mr Pelikán three jahreszeitliche Amplituden, which is totally unreliable: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either from distress because of the bad certificate or joy at the holidays."
"In the Walpurgisnacht I have experienced in the opening seven drunken children at once" said Dr Pelikán.
A betrunkenes child who spend the night under medical supervision, paradoxically, is better off than a child, the next day, with a nasty hangover.
The headaches in the morning, can result from dehydration and lack of glucose, is in hospital with a flüssigkeitsspendenden infusion of glucose and nutrients, the organism.
"They are clearly better off, because after the" beautiful "experience in the evening, with good humour, without doing anything to hurt."
"They are just confused about where they are" admits a doctorate Pelikán, although it is polluting the patients at least sometimes the good humour, by listing them the costs that they will cost the treatment.
Because the transport with the ambulances and the night in an Akutbett well and to a few tens of thousand kronor.
"I have used it as an educational tool, if I have calculated directly to children during the visit, which took their drunkenness and that it may well happen that they must work in the whole holiday on to earn the money for a single such Fete" added Dr Pelikán added.
In his view, the health insurance but not procedures, the demand for the trunkenen children any costs incurred by the parents.
Two training aircraft L- 159 for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain
Two light aircraft L- 159 out of a total of five, which has replaced the Czech Defense Ministry against the transport plane Casa C- 295 M, are flown on Tuesday in the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer EADS Casa - married.
It is the first time that machines of this type in possession of a foreign army.
Abroad, they were so far only in exercises or air shows.
It is the flugfähige Zweisitzerversion L- 159 T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The other three aircraft are einsitzige L- 159.
These are still einkonserviert reason Vodochody, the facilitator of this business - the company Omnipol - took it last week.
When they expediert aircraft physically from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, yet known.
The einsitzigen fighter plane L- 159 aircraft were stored in the long term from aircraft and this without further deposits and investments from the department of the ministry.
"The doppelsitzigen L- 159 T1 were exchanged in current condition and appearance" said the newspaper Pejšek Právo.
He added that the army will have to do without zweisitzige fighter aircraft, as the Ministry of Defence in May 2009 with reason Vodochody 200 million contract on the reconstruction of four unnecessary L- 159 to zweisitzigen version.
A new plane took the army in July, the second to take them by the end of this year.
According to pejšek has committed itself to EADS, the fighter planes in the equipment of the NATO countries.
"There is a clear that the company EADS buyer of L- 159 aircraft and that the training of pilots of NATO countries.
"It is therefore up to the customer, he realized the matter", Pejšek.
The business newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L- 159.
The barter of five L- 159 against a transport plane Casa and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion kroner was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence has no tendering procedures, but spoke directly to EADS.
The defense argued at the time, this exchange will support the future export of L- 159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, which used only 24, wanted to sell them.
The purchase of aircraft Casa should also have a legal process.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice. The reason? It would have to choose the aircraft due to a ganzEURpäischen tender and not addressed by a single manufacturer.
The army has already played three aircraft Casa, the last at the Airport Kbely within fourteen days.
A long finger ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men, whose finger is long, as the ring finger, apparently a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is connected with the levels of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that can serve the relative length of the finger as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer and, in particular to sixty" said the co-author of the study, as Eeles, a professor at the cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help to determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health problems, Mrs Eeles added.
In the period from 1994 - 2009 with their counterparts in Britain, more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study was the finger of the right hand is shorter than the ring finger.
For these men had the same probability of prostate cancer, such as For 19 percent of those men whose ring and finger the same time.
In men, whose finger longer than the ring finger, this risk, however, fell by 33 percent, among men and about 87 percent.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers, mentioned the prenatal age, apparently reflects the different levels of sex hormones, which was exposed to the baby in the womb.
Less testosterone is a long finger.
Previous research found that testosterone is accelerating the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, leading Czech geneticists and former chairman of the National Academy of Sciences, said ČTK, he knows that this study on the run, but he believe the relationship between the finger length and the risk of cancer for "proved completely".

As stated on their computers and specialized maintenance giant industries on Wednesday, will move in July next year, 400 men and women from the office buildings on Marienbader place in bad Homburg in the Astro Park, this is a great office complex in Lyons streets in Frankfurt district of Lower wheel.
A spokeswoman explained by Fujitsu, should A further 100 jobs in the medium term of the group, which has spread over the region.
The rental offer was very attractive, and the open-plan offices in Astro Park the workings of the staff better.
Also in Homburg Fujitsu was just tenants.
The responsible manager Bernd Wagner, "with Frankfurt wheel we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent access to the airport is just for a global companies such as Fujitsu is of great importance.
The latest move by a major company within the region called yesterday joy among the winners and disappointment among the losers.
The Frankfurter Wirtschaftsdezernent Markus Frank (CDU) said that it was a "global player" won.
It was a "great location commitment".
Fujitsu was in town, the location is an important boost for wheel.
The bad Homburger Mayor Michael Korwisi (Green) regretted the decision by Fujitsu.
The city had been informed of the management of the intention.
"We have offered the company, of course, our help" said Korwisi.
The friendly contacts could do nothing about the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord's property at Marienbader can change.
Did the economic reasons.
Now is to prevent a long second in such a prominent place.
"I hope that the owners and landlords of the building is cooperative."
The Fujitsu previously unused house on City Hall Square and the neighbouring small "vertical", with the other buildings in the Marienbader place ten years ago to the controversial construction of Kurstadt.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developers arose between city Hall station and a new city way, both because of the massive development of previously partly as a car park land and the buildings for criticism.
2001, the investment advisory and credit rating companies Feri, the software maker for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and he was still with computer manufacturer Fujitsu Siemens houses.
The Fujitsu buildings was acquired in 2006 by the German Real Estate opportunities group along with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold a year later, the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu based in Tokyo Konuzern described as the world's third largest IT providers.
He represents companies such as computers and servers and also makes the necessary service.
The establishment of the rhine, Main area is one of the largest in Germany, more employees, Fujitsu in Munich.
From bad Homburg subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt wheel, the other subsidiaries at this location, Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
Were hired in the office buildings Astro Park 7000 square metres.
In the twenty years old complex - the name plays on his sternförmigen footprint - has, among other things, the National Association of electrical engineering and electronics industries.
Amazon's servers - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is increasingly paranoid.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banished The Enthüllungs platform from its servers.
There is perhaps political pressure following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables.
Wikileaks founder Assange is supposedly in England.
The Enthüllungs platform Wikileaks is increasingly under attack in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent Senator Joe Lieberman, whereas other countries and companies to boycott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on the lists of Interpol, according to a newspaper report in Britain.
"Wikileaks Amazon's server."
"Free speech in the land of the Free", the Enthüllungs activists by text messaging service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before the Internet companies for the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists in the publication of the secret diplomatic cables on the Amazon Web service (AWS) used to cope with the high numbers of access to the documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks to step further: "Prima - our $s are being spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon have such a problem with the freedom of speech, "they should stop to sell books."
Amazon have halted the use of its servers by Wikileaks, having had a staff of Senator Joe Lieberman, told the CNN television, citing the office Liebermans.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security, Amazon had threatened a boycott, told the British newspaper.
"I would have liked that Amazon this measure sooner, given the previous set of classified information by Wikileaks" said the senator.
Lieberman, meanwhile, to deny the platform also in other countries the use of servers.
"WikiLeaks illegal, hideous and thuggery, our national security and around the globe" hießt it lives in a communication of the independent elected senator.
"No responsible companies, whether American or foreign-matter - should help Wikileaks in his efforts to disseminate stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, because rape allegations by the authorities in Sweden, is wanted by Interpol.
According to a report by the London newspaper the Independent, "the 39 - year-old Australians in Britain, the exact location of Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has described the investigations in Sweden always intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there had been threats.
"There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange."
Therefore, Assange rightly fear for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to hide.
Hrafnsson responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that should be tried and executed the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations for treason.
In Canada, said an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper - apparently ironic - on television, "Assange should be killed" and Obama could use of "drone".
Between the White House and Assange while a tennis match.
The spokesman for the U.S. President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had called for the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, if she is responsible for recent high-profile espionage calls to diplomats.
"I am not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a type with a Web site" Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than its a website."
The American government is protecting their databases fully to the test.
As a special envoy to the Deputy Director of the Centre for anti-terrorism measures, Russell Travers, has been appointed, told the White House.
Travers was responsible, "the necessary structural reforms" to develop, after the disclosure of the embassy reports by Wikileaks.
The White House wants to check to see how the whole of government information and.
The American government also announced that for the safety of dissidents and activists, should they get through the Wikileaks publication.
"We have done everything to come in contact with them" said Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them, if necessary."
The ice University
The "Gelato University" in Bologna Eiskonditoren better seasons.
The three-day course for future Gelatieri has the largest gains and visitors from all over the world.
Where does the entire ice?
The Gela animals and the Gelataio.
The Gela animals - in short, the old-fashioned Eiskonditor, the cream of all the rules of the Italian Eismacherkunst.
The Gelataio with a Spachtel ice cream from the refrigerated shelf, cut them in the Waffel and sold them.
In order to know this, we must not Anzola dell Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who would like to know more about ice, which is not the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani over.
The ice University has established the manufacturers of Eismaschinen in 2003, so that the ice cream from its machines across the Italian high ideals.
The three-day course for future Gelatieri has the largest gains and visitors from around the world.
But there are also far Spezialkurse around the chocolate ice and internships in the domestic Eisdiele.
Some dreams in the mid-life crisis of a new career, others venture in the treacherous ice of vague aspirations.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from every continent - from Brazil on Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from california, loves the Slow Food Movement and wants to offer the country's industrial Ice Cream future an European quality product.
Anke from Berlin is corporate adviser and eintüten after years in a nerve-racking job.
Two young Egyptians dream to open in Cairo an Eisdiele.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil would improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian Chamber Mrs Yulia, because their children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro Gela animals Luciano Ferrari said the participants of the ideal attributes of the perfect ice cream.
It is not only good taste, but also the seidige fluidity and good consistency.
Luciano has not forgotten his training but also the icing on the cake of national and even Latin Überbaus: "Italy Gelato is simply the best - and then there is still plenty of romanticism."
The first step to manufacture seems quite simple.
Luciano repeals the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a big Mixgerät, heated with an electronic programme to 85 degrees and then immediately to four degrees.
Then he turns to the machine to tap into, and is a white base pasteurised cream, basis for all Milcheissorten.
The lecturer will immediately bombarded with questions: Can ice cream with natural substances without stabilizer?
How can one's own experimental mood?
Luciano warns against the spirit of the time to be fooled.
Those of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" talk, has used may nevertheless stabilisers - usually a natural product, such as Guarkernmehl from the Guarbohne.
Of course, can produce ice without stabilizer, it must then be sold within a day, otherwise sackt it, and the customer is at the Eiskörnchen.
Some variation on the basic mass are permitted.
It will be more exciting with the flavourings.
For the taste of ice Maestro Luciano distinguishes the ingredients, in the fruit or the sweets section of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powder and Pasten.
"The suppliers will all try to foist onto you dozens of aromatised additions."
"But you should experiment."
Either the Fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or when the ice cream from the white mass, with eggs, cream and yellow with cocoa powder on the basis for all sorts of chocolate temptations offered.
Now, the course participants in the Eismaschinen.
Luciano leaves they each have four different types of vanilla, chocolate, Mokka and hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in the mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additives.
The same experiment will also Fruchteissorten.
More aromas, more fruit puree - taste is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice is not necessarily nussiger, if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi fruit ice, the working group, which uses more fruit, less water and less stabiliser.
Only a balanced mixture to the taste of a Gelato correctly, says Luciano.
Eisherstellung is a purely mathematical exercise: Will used peach puree with high sugar, must be reduced the amount of sugar in the basic recipe.
For lemon ice is an extra dose of sugar.
Luciano a device with which he prefers the sugar content of fruit varieties (so that the Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, facilitate the.
Ice making does not require as much physical effort as before.
Not only the device for the automatic establishment of mass.
There is also a device in which the final ice mixture and at the same time cremig beaten and cooled to minus temperatures.
All automation remain small margins.
The Brazilian Gustavo covered and his colleagues rate from top to bottom with fruit puree, as he puts the oversized hand blenders spirals out of control.
"In every direction" said Maestro Luciano, "it is only a matter of time before something happens."
Controllers in the twilight zone
The European Food Safety Authority Efsa with Crops experimental industry.
Now the group of experts test biotech formulated this accusation, which sees itself as an independent institute for the study of the impact of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well" said test biotech boss Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa expert group on genetically modified crops, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert for years the lobbyists Ilsi under contract.
The will of companies such as Monsanto, Bayer Nestle or paid.
Kuiper contributed significantly to the Efsa testing requirements for Crops and worked in a clear conflict of interest, Then.
The Efsa rules are absatzweise word for word, with the Ilsi position papers and had the hallmarks of the industry, which is controlled by the authority in Italian Parma.
It was the second time that indication test biotech a conflict of interest.
It should be a high-level Efsa manager recently without conditions or transitional period for the Swiss agricultural company Syngenta farm - and have changed sides.
The German radio (MDR) had recently personal links between exercise and industry lobby, which has made the Federal Office, as well as suspicious.
The Efsa can see no conflict of interest.
We refer to all serious data, also in the industry, as long as they are of high quality, says in a statement.
The experts who work for Efsa, we do not demand that they have no contact with the industry.
But They have to disclose.
Kuiper gives his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United states.
This describes himself as a neutral forum for experts from academia, industry and policy - among other things, the risk assessment for biotechnology without lobby.
In the case of criticising independent experts as Then that genetically modified Crops currently without any attempt to feed animals and shall not tested the response of Crops environmental influences.
"We want to know, for example, genetically modified maize on the field" says Then.
Current practice, only isolated proteins to test but not the whole Genpflanze what am no reliable results.
"If it is not the risks, how do you find them?", asks Then accusing.
It also provides Angelika Hilbeck.
The research scientist since 1994 in the engineering and is currently at the Technical University of Zurich.
The industry is trying in this area, as in the United States in Europe more and more to influence critical scientists or discredit.
There was therefore hardly researchers who are intertwined with corporations.
For business critical studies were published in the rule.
"The industry controls the security research" said Hilbeck.
The trail of stones
Uli Gsell has also worried, around 400 kilograms.
On Monday night he was from Stuttgart, the Tuba station On the back.
It was Demo.
It snowed heavily.
The story is well known: In September, the dredging angerückt and had begun to break off a large chunk of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the of the station.
When it came to freeze, a large part of the wing in ruins.
In 6000, 7000.
Crailsheimer shell, a soft gross stein, between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He has secured a couple of stones.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He fantasise: "a cheaper and poor, simple and erdenhaft."
When he aufsägte, cigarette smoke a rat.
He does not know What he will do with the headache.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell.
The trail of Stuttgart stones in a forest in Tübingen, a former ammunition depot in The French army, which has built a stone Manuel Rongen empire.
The 44 Jährige with old stones.
He has bought all the demolition in Stuttgart fell.
"It would be a shame, it would be Schotter milling or disappear in the landfill" he says in his office, a Holzbüdchen, which was once a cab.
Insulted and threatened him, he is telling, as in September in the newspapers that he bought the remnants of the northern wing of demolition.
But he has with the S- 21 opponents, for days.
And he has told them that he absolutely nothing for the demolition.
And if it is, then it is the most sensible, if used the stones.
Approximately 200 S- 21 opponents took an average of 80 kg, with serious Quader price of 6.50 to 14 EUR.
As memory, but also in the hope to be able to return him to a reconstruction.
500 tonnes had bought Rongen, 25 large lorry loads.
About half is still in the forest, the rest is sold.
Gartenbesitzer, landscape gardener, Häuslebauer.
They come from everywhere, and had weggeschleppt what boot and supporters.
The Stuttgart stumbling stones have been in "Mäuerle" or The limits of Kräuterbeeten.
"This is nothing new" says Rongen.
"It would not be the political component."
In his SUV, a tour through his 20 empire.
He has studied Law and, later, biology, then he is interested in computers and finally traders.
And lovers.
40000 tonnes of stones.
From all over Germany karrt his treasures.
He says that he is the biggest Altsteinhändler the Republic.
He put the brakes on.
In the snow skilful behauene sand stones.
"They were Dresdner Marienbrücke" he said.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he fantasise.
"My favourite stone."
It is the path through the forest.
It shows a bunch: red sand quarry, formerly part of the Karlsruhe station.
And further.
"Beautiful Travertin."
Once the Quader gallery of Stuttgart Neckarstadions.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from Stuttgart police headquarters, rötlicher granite from the cathedral, St. Blasien, Tuff Heilbronner hospital.
The work, effort, the sweat.
If Rongen, think about how to beat the stones by hand and with simple bottles and ox carts, will he be reverential.
"It would be a scandal if schreddern something."
He is not Rich, very Rich.
But 14 people employed by the stone traders today, also have high in the forest Steinmetze, a sculptor, a blacksmith, established a Glasbläser and horticulturalists settled.
"We are working hard, but it is a good one" says the remnants scrap-yard.
He must soon after Cologne.
There are obstacles to save it.
Talentekampf at high potential
There is a strong run at the buffet.
16 students are flocking to salmon rolls, tomato soup and nurturing.
The Technical University of brown whereupon the car makers Volkswagen invited the engineering and design students at a workshop.
In a kind of ideas to fachsimpeln them together with VW Entwicklern on the car of the future fachsimpeln - and incidentally Volkswagen.
In the competition for the brightest now many companies in the Nahkampf and, as VW, in cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as early in the hearing rooms, before they the labour market and courted by others.
And because the universities no data on the performance of their students, trying to spot the exceptional talent in practice projects and to commit itself.
On the second day of workshops at the TU brown be advertises the car company's talent.
A young lady from the personnel department distributed pens, gum and Mappen with VW logo.
They told the promising young talents of training programs and student jobs and show them ways in the company.
Nico Selle by the TU brown be cared for the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "the students come in contact with the industry and gain experience."
"VW can at the same time, students, interesting candidates closer to go and consider, who as a staff member in question."
Such cooperation, Selle, are not unusual.
What is new is that gebuhlt so offensive to the students.
"Otherwise, the focus was on the technical project" says Selle.
The battle for fresh graduates will be even harder.
In many industries can rely on the company's staff more from a large crowd of applicants.
But they must balzen and especially for highly skilled workers.
Above all, graduates from engineering disciplines are in a strong negotiating position.
According to the Association of German engineers VDI remained in October about 40.000 engineering vacancies unfilled.
And the so-called gap, according to VDI forecasts.
For the accounting and consulting firm KPMG novel Dykta on the talent hunt.
He organised elaborate Recruiting events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern meat hunting, in which the participants using GPS coordinates must find their way.
Eight promising students want to send the company's next year across the United States.
At the same time, the participants KPMG offices and the company.
Who should decide in two rounds of selection in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of many applicants flies in the United states.
The cut and thrust of the high potential in universities, according to Dykta.
"We want to deal with the Race for the masses."
"Only a simple Segeltörn was too little."
The bill For talent hunters Dykta seems to be working.
"We have to date with all participants in a similar action last year."
"Some are nearing completion and want to apply soon with us" he says.
In addition to the direct courting on campus, especially small and medium-sized enterprises also classic In professional fairs on the Pirsch.
"We are trying to achieve college at fairs."
"Such as solar" reported Sitha Stübe, head of the solar technology manufacturers solar World.
The Bonn company employs around 1500 staff in Germany.
Stübe offspring.
Currently are advertised on the company website 35 posts.
"It is very difficult to fill vakante positions."
"A lot of time and money" she says.
Another way is the contact on the Uni professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University in free mountain.
"The professors give indications that make us internships or his thesis."
Expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists are not needed.
It is trying to promote the company with other advantages for themselves: Personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"A large corporation often cannot provide" says staff Stübe.
Money is no longer the main role.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good career opportunities are crucial factors.
Solarworld documented in a study of the Great Place to Work Institute's 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The institute an annual league table of German employers.
It asked people how satisfied they are with their work and their Jobumfeld and look at the framework conditions for the workers.
Personalleiterin Stübe hoped for by the placement also points in the Jobsuchenden.
"I think that, especially after external assessments about a potential employers" she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler by the Germans Employer branding academy advises companies who want to build a long-term strategy with a reputation as an Employer.
He advises his clients to more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, particularly internal measures.
"The best way to make themselves as attractive employer, on their own staff" he says.
In the industry jargon that is internal Employer branding, Arbeitgebermarkenbildung within its own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If you do unto his people well and they identify with the company, then selling them from alone with friends and acquaintances for their employers.
"This is like a game with gang" says Kriegler.
Obama stop new drilling
Off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico will be in the coming years, no new drilling.
Such a ban issued by the government in Washington - and to revoke its previous plans.
Also on the Atlantic coast remain banned new drilling.
This Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which will be valid for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon "drilling platform in April.
Before the accident, the eleven workers dead and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama is under pressure from the opposition and the industry's willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Those who want to reduce the dependence of the United States of oil supplies from abroad.
Who is responsible for the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf, is not resolved until today.
At the heart of the criticism of the British energy company BP, with billions of demands.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama to present during the Dezembers their results.
In october, Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar, after the explosion of drilling ban.
Following several oil companies had immediately applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and stricter safety rules to exclude Obama and Salazar another disaster.
Currently, the competent supervisory authority, which was after numerous corruption charges into disrepute, radically reformed.
At the same time, Obama has announced that lucrative tax breaks for the oil and Gaskonzerne.
The industry warns now publicly warning that the level of production in the Gulf by a tighter regulation would be markedly lower than before.
"The government's plans are the biggest obstacle to the growth of the oil and gas industry" is the result of a recent survey by the consultant BDO - before the drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also lamented the uncertainty in the industry: "Nobody knows what will change with the regulation."
Investment in new projects would be delayed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burned off
The water in the rivers is ölbraun, it smells like the petrol station: billion litres of crude oil spills have destroyed the natural in Nigeria's Ogoniland.
The people of theft, corruption and illegal Ölkochen.
Celestine Akpobari mean well.
"Not" haunts, reassured the Ökoaktivist journalists: "you'll still enough slime before the lens."
The 37 - year-old Nigerians has followed the attempt, until the chest in the water watenden boys with the Schlieren around him abzulichten: in the regenbogenfarbenen water to the scene almost nicely.
That are below the surface brown plumes of crude oil, is not.
They have gathered here eimerweise shrimp, Esther Badom on the shores of the Bodo Jetty River.
Now, the lazy river waters completely dead.
Five years ago from a geborstenen pipeline crude oil in the vast wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby city Bodo must row six hours to get in fischhaltige waters: in the heart of the Niger Delta, Ogoniland is regarded as one of the worst verpesteten regions of the world.
On the journey through the river basins criss-crossed mangrove swamps, the full extent of the devastation evident.
Rather than extending water rummages frantically the motor boat brown gruel on his hand into the water, ölige finger.
The roots of the mangrove nurture stand out as black Lakritzstangen, sad, occasionally of their Wedel.
Vogelschwärme, as they are in wetlands customary, in vain: as soon as the External Border, is spreading in the as a filling station's former paradise ghastly rest.
"What happens here is ecological warfare" says Celestine Akpobari gloomy: "we live in constant danger to health."
The war is appropriate.
The area where the Ogoni is a disputed battlefield for decades: there were more than 60 years ago, the first Explorateure from Europe, organised here in the 80 s with the later executed writer Ken Saro Wiwa's initial resistance, it had to stop the Shell group 1993 production, because it was too dangerous for the oil workers.
Even today, the company's return to Ogoniland: while pumping from the delta region of the triple the size of Switzerland, with more than 5000 drilling sources and 7000 kilometres of pipelines daily pumped more than two million barrels of the black gold, broke the oilfields in Ogoniland, the corporation is too unstable situation.
Every few hundred metres of sardines Gestelle as bizarre sculptures from the water, "Christian nurture" the heads of the boreholes far too zärtlich.
They are up to 50 years old, most corroded to the core.
Again and again to stop such drilling, Akpobari, then rinne a constant flow of crude oil into the water.
More than two billion litres experts estimate that in 50 years the ecosystem of the delta: year after year, the amount of oil, as in the "super tanker Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago into the sea off Alaska - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Who is to blame for the continuing environmental meltdown, it is argued.
While the Shell, sabotage and organised Öldiebstahl for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists berstende drilling heads and leaky pipelines as the main culprit.
Shell in Nigeria significantly lower safety standards than anywhere else in the world, accused the U.S. scientist Richard Steiner, 2008, with the rate of defects in the pipes "much higher than elsewhere."
In one place, from a distance, looks like a deserted, littered open-air workshop, from the mangrove figures: you are ölverschmiert splitternackt and up to the neck.
In one of the many kegs, which combined with tubes, partly arbitrary scattered on the site to identify, truce a fire: an illegal small refinery.
In a heated barrel of crude oil on the fire several hours, said Michael, the head of the group.
First petrol through the pipes in the reception, spits later at the end of the kerosene and diesel.
So, Michael and four people on a daily basis up to four barrels of diesel at 300 litres: "that brings us 34.000 Naira" - around $22.
The delta residents use the chronic fuel shortages in sub-Saharan Africa's biggest oil state.
Nigeria has one refinery.
With less than 40 EUR cents per litre ridiculously low price can undercut the illegal Kocher still: their raw material they get for free.
He comes from "Bunkerern", the tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: go to the country, according to experts in the entire Niger Delta lost at least 16 million litres of crude oil.
Only a tiny part of the provisional intermediary raw material illegally shipped: the lion's share of organised criminal networks, including politicians and senior military officers, in tankers and basement him on the world market.
The debate about whether the environmental disaster in the of the population or the lax practices, the activist Akpobari for purely academic.
"The oil companies would not be perceived as invaders and had not destroyed the livelihood of the fishermen so thoroughly, there would be no sabotage, theft and illegal refineries."
Meanwhile, destroying the relationship between the Ogoni mainly to Shell but that only a withdrawal of the group would be: "Perhaps there are other nationalities, such as the Chinese and better."
Since Michael nervous.
"It is high time that disappears" says the muskulöse ".
"Every minute of the soldiers."
The illegal Ölveredler from the special forces, they are not arrest, but a painful bribes.
The soldiers from the country's north, soldiers - like all Nigerians - benefit from the raw material.
"This damned stuff has brought our country in every respect to the dog" says Akpobari.
Investigators found dangerous well in A380 engines
The A380 has a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction defects in the investigation of a notgelandeten machine, which could lead to a "catastrophic failure".
The airline Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturers.
The passengers of the notgelandeten Qantas Airbus in early November had apparently much more luck than previously known: the Australian air safety authority said in their investigation of a major security problem in the engines of some of the A380 engines - and now warns against a possible construction defects.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: a Ölschlauchverbindung he could produce fatigue cracks and leaks, it said in a statement published on Thursday by The authority ATSB.
This could lead to "an appalling failure".
Are affected by Rolls Royce engines manufactured in 20 of the A380 aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, on 4 November in Singapore notlanden.
The Australian airline has launched a legal action against the British aircraft manufacturers.
They filed a lawsuit in an Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which allow him further legal action against the company.
Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said that his airline will demand compensation for the incident in early November.
The fire engine parts and damaged the wings.
Rolls Royce, an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the incident must be changed the world up to 40 engines.
The Australian investigators had said they would carry out further tests on the Superjumbos, which are equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendations were the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security problem had been deemed sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency evacuation of Qantas machine had kept the airline its A380 fleet for weeks on the ground.
Singapore Airlines, three of the eleven A380 temporarily on the ground.
The Lufthansa moves in an A380 as a precaution the engine.
The doppelstöckige flyer is the largest passenger plane in the world.
National snowfall solves transport chaos from
Germany, in white: night fell almost across the country snow.
There has been chaos On many roads, trains and flights.
At least three people were killed In car accidents.
The winter frostet Germany: freezing temperatures is zugeschneit almost the whole republic into the night on Thursday - leading many to transport chaos.
In the north and east of some 15 centimetres thick snow blankets.
On several motorways and many road transport is severely restricted.
On the A7 in Flensburg was the winter service, with the aufwehenden keep snow but not complete.
In addition fegten Böen on the Baltic coast.
The Federal Office for shipping and Hydrographie (BSH) expected on the Baltic coast Schleswig Holsteins from morning to storm tides with levels of 1.2 metres above the Normalstand.
In Saxony, the snow Verwehungen on motorways and federal roads to major problems.
According to the storm center Meteomedia was in the Sächsischen Switzerland therefore alert violet - the highest level.
Some 30 centimeters Neuschnee, fresh and strong winds were responsible for Verwehungen.
There remained stuck in the night, several trucks and cars.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt reported the police major disruption on the roads.
On the A2, snow and wind to stockendem traffic and congestion.
In Thuringia were affected by the snow cases the A4 and A9.
According to Deutsche Bahn in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia, in northern Bavaria to significant disruption.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the rail lines or destroyed and are the main problems.

Thousands mourn the dead buddy
More than 10.000 people have thought in New Zealand the buried miners who were declared after several explosions in a mine for dead.
Still, the bodies could not be recovered, because the security situation in the subsurface, precarious.
Less than two weeks ago, it was in the Pike River mine near the town of Grey Mouth to a violent explosion.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 years were buried underground.
A probe was hinabgelassen accident in the subsurface, had discovered but no trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions have attended a meeting for security reasons, no rescue forces.
After the second violent blasts were the authorities and experts assumed that there was no chance of survival for mates.
The bodies were found.
Now, relatives and friends with a commemoration of the dead.
Ten thousand people had gathered in radioactive sunshine in Grey Mouth were on the southern island of New Zealand.
Two minutes remained silent.
In honour of the buried miners were 29 tables, helmets, lamps and the names of mates.
The pictures and personal items, including clothing and surf boards, found their place.
Before flying the flags at half mast all government buildings.
New Zealand have hoped that the miners' from the depths of the earth "would come back to the surface, said the New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants of the ceremony.
"But they are never came home."
He could not end with the death of his son, as long as he had not seen the body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son was buried Zen in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of victims of several foreign diplomats present at the ceremony.
The first explosion on 19 November had been buried the miners of British and South African origin.
Rettungsarbeiter began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mining on the southern island of New Zealand.
Once the explosive gases, will begin, herunterzukühlen the scorching temperatures inside the mine, said police President Gary know-how to journalists.
To hell, warrior!
Splatter fits the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn testing with his fighters epic "Valhalla Rising" old genre borders.
In the audience may have thought the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn, as he "Valhalla Rising"?
A captured Vikings warriors with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) freed himself from his tormentors and with almost superhuman forces multitudes of his opponents - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody Action, precisely because our hero like rough killing methods and his enemies the Gedärme from the vibrant, if he has a bad mood.
On the other hand, says Einauge, as it is, in fact, is not a word throughout the film, and the other characters at times to one or two sentences or a few painful death cries of.
Otherwise silent and feasted on the hill gruselig beautiful landscape of Scotland, the Vikings world of about a thousand years ago the scene.
Ideal for adult Cineasten with interest for Existenzialismus and very calm camera.
Well, if a film has several target groups, it is a shame, if they are mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn since his wild and gestylten drug dealers trilogy "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, refuses to stoically, his works with more humor the mainstream or something less brutality, Arthouse accessible.
Most art cinema friends may be deterred from around the spritzenden brain mass and the Gedärmen.
The latest action fans die before boredom, if Einauge from freely suspensive reasons with a force of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and an eternity in doldrums and fog, before the team apparently in America and silent.
No wonder, then, that "Valhalla Rising" has been found in Germany No cinema distribution and appeared only on DVD.
This is particularly the magnificent images of a hangover, but also because hiding behind the unpretentious and blood-stained unpretentious and sometimes exciting piece of cinema, which deserves some attention.
In this film is not about dialogues or a stringent action, it is all atmosphere, a filmgewordener fever dream.
And there is no room for the viewer.
Refn give him barely a moment of relaxation and puts him with his icy images and the dark trance of Sound Track very slowly, but above all with the unspeakable hatred of him from the heart of the characters.
Only a small blonder boy, the Einauge faithful to one side, something like innocence, all others are driven by anger.
Most of the einäugige hero, whose motives are never explained, but for enemies and allies temporarily at some point the warriors from hell, perhaps the ambassadors of the devil himself.
But it also means destruction, perhaps only for the Verdorbenen anyway.
"Valhalla Rising" is a puzzling, the film can hate and admire, Ärgern, Aufregen and laughable.
An experience.
The Erdarbeiten
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country, however, to comment on - nor does it controls.
At midnight on 5 and 6 September 2007 are at least four Israeli F- 15 I fighter planes a mystery, würfelförmiges buildings in Syria.
It is on the banks of the Euphrates, the next major city, 30 kilometres, is Dair as Saur.
Her name appeared in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), when it comes to the reactor, built with Syria allegedly with help from North Korea in the Quader, hidden in a valley, the electricity.
According to a briefing of the U.S. foreign intelligence agency CIA at the end of April 2008, also under the name of the near town el Kibar normal reactor to produce plutonium - from which to build nuclear weapons.
For other purposes against the technology from the fifties.
The CIA has produced a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
By Computeranimation it, where the components of the reactor fell before the destruction, the copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear centre.
In addition, the show photographs of the building from the vicinity show or even the atrium.
The reactor was just before the operation, it said, but not yet with fuel prongs peppers.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more than it was then known, the mystery of the time.
The former U.S. President George w. Bush has recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA before the attack was quite sure that Syria in el Kibar built a reactor, but hardly points of reference to ensure that the country, "an active nuclear weapons program."
Some intelligence officers in Europe are still cautious and speak only of a "alleged reactor" even if the CIA presentation for "plausible".
You lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how he was sure to have a reactor, a senior u. n. diplomat in the summer only briefly, the IAEA "enough material to ask questions."
The rubble of the alleged "unused military building", the Syrians eager and planierten thoroughly premises.
Nevertheless, took place in June 2008 an IAEA team under former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el Kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by people.
Also received the IAEA on a Member State satellite images of commercial providers from the period immediately after the attack, the more meaningful than the CIA.
However, to get these recordings on the market, because of the purchaser - perhaps Israel - she has bought exclusively.
The IAEA could not verify their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that has never been a secret nuclear program or built a nuclear reactor.
The uranium came from The Israeli weapons, said Damascus.
But the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely.
Since then, refuses to Damascus to discuss - as well as on the satellite images.
The inspectors also denied a second inspection in el Kibar and access to the wreckage of the bombed-out building.
But Israel maintains an iron.
"We will never comment on" said recently at the time of the attack, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position.
As the investigation of the case has dragged on since June 2008 fruitless and "becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority" a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - after all, is a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is monitored the IAEA.
As a key to progress in the investigation, the IAEA apparently three other facilities, the "functional link" with the alleged reactor - and differently than this.
The inspectors have so far not openly what it is, or what they are or what they seem suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally as Marj as Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, derived from nearby towns.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these places and on satellite images of a building complex in Masyaf, which is probably one of the suspects are objects.
It is probably in or adjacent to a military base - with this justification, Syria, the IAEA access to the three locations.
The IAEA In Vienna, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that will be sent on ahead of the United States, military installations, foiling.
Since the nuclear detectives were turned off by the U.S. secret services to the facilities.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos that was transported between the three locations and the Quader the Euphrates material.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna, could at least one of the plants' in connection with the fuel production ".
But there was "no evidence of sensitive activities" uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes, which are necessary to build nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor will not enriched uranium, which is.
But where the uranium could have come from and where it should be separated from it later the plutonium for the bomb, on these key issues are there any plausible assumptions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could involve the valuable traces, were stored in three places.
As if the burden of hundreds of truckloads have disappeared, nobody wants information on the ground, where the rubble.
Only a few kilometres from el Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, salt mine al Tibni, has studied the Syria 1998 on their suitability as a camp for radioactive waste, the IAEA as unlikely.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had it in a recent analysis of satellite images for the venerable magazine Jane's Intelligence Review with the reactor.
Started from the orbiting show that Syria to the three places Erdarbeiten and large container, after the IAEA access.
This may be a coincidence, but has little to dispel the suspicion.
In addition, they say in diplomatic circles, have used the IAEA several months to develop a plan for inspections, which should allow Syria to maintain military secrets - shows the amount of how much interest the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damascus has smoothed this proposal.
Had reassured Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago, the reactor was destroyed, therefore no urgency, as U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies for a few months so-called special inspections, one of the harshest means that the Vienna nuclear authority to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, these inspections should suggest, has been "an option, for which I am in the future", but he is hesitant.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it needs a majority of the Board of Governors of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries are anything but eager for an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat: "What if they end up with nothing?"
Ladies in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie in the summer with the work on her debut has begun, there is anger.
The script has written it himself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
We do not know - but it is much more.
There is a persistent rumour that the woman, a muslim, verliebe during the Yugoslav wars in their Serb rapist.
Bosnian women's associations have protested immediately, and some in Sarajevo, in the short term to Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film in Hungary and in the post production, but it will still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic by the female victims wrote about the u. n. Refugee agency UNHCR of Jolie and demanded a meeting with the spectacles Rin, has reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is ambassador to the u. n. Refugee Relief and Works agency.
It is not - it has offered the women, weeks before a meeting in Hungary, which rejected the but.
The meeting should be held in Bosnia, Hasecic.
Liebesgeschichten in rape camps have not happened, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims of their enough about the script.
Her organization has recommended that the u. n. refugee agency, according to dismiss Jolie as ambassador, told the Guardian.
But what exactly has written Jolie for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, to read the script, gave after some to-ing and fro-ing a hub for Sarajevo - it is not clear why did not then Jolie.
The young car Rin themselves, they had no political intentions with her film, have worked with a lot of trouble in the Yugoslav conflict, the terrible consequences of war and give all interested parties a voice.
The content remains vague.
The idea of a second Synopsis to film in the network, which is then quite differently: the lovers knew it before war broke out and meet again, as they are, a Bosnian muslim, was kidnapped in a Serbian Camp, where he worked as a guard.
What is considerably different than the sounds of "rape victims in verknallt torturer."
That Jolie film actually begins even before the war - is.
The pressure on them, Jolie, is "unfair and is based on misinformation."
Now can be only the hackers from Hollywood peace: by the script, as so many before it, illegally.
Running here
This evening is finally back right around for the Irish.
No trace of sadness.
For the home team dominated his guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans johlen joy in krachend loud music, they conjure with their feet.
The conference, Bailey pubs in the südirischen Cork, because the players Tischtennisbälle on a Dreimeterdistanz in beer mug - and.
"Bierpong" to the bizarre spectacle, there are 500 victory premium plus tickets to Las Vegas for the beer pong world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a calmer type; this shrill drinking game and the low-key IT professionals, not really fit together.
And yet tries to amuse the 26 Jährige, distracting from the nagging question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not fun game in Las Vegas, he will hold talks in January in New Zealand.
"I have an uneasy feeling" he says.
"It is so far away from home and I have no work."
After all: his girlfriend waiting in Auckland at him - "they had ruck, zuck their desire job as event manager, perhaps a good sign" says the young man and smiles.
Because of poor prospects at home have found two of Tanners three sibling sought their fortunes abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys: How the Tanners looks on the island in many families.
100.000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, say experts of the Economic and Social Research Institute ESRI in Dublin.
By 2015, they even with 200.000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, a big loss.
The predictions come true, a wave of emigration comparable to those suffered by Ireland in the eighties.
After a decade of recovery for the Irish prosperity, is now draws to a close.
The uncertain economic crisis, especially the young, well-educated irish, for which there is only going up.
Jobverlust and social decline appeared in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, money there in abundance.
But now, three out of ten women and men under thirty without work.
In the Irish Times abound reader letters young emigrants who complain: "Everything is in Ireland the edge."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can, and our country will lose a whole generation."
"The last of the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish students union, raise a bleak future, because the government only window dressing, and offer young people no longer prospects.
"They reduce the minimum wage, but they have no strategy on how to create new jobs" says the 20 Jährige.
They watched as their colleagues from an unpaid internship next start.
Their main concern, she says, to emigrate in four years.
"It is sad and depressing."
Try men such as Stephen McLarnon the issue.
Mclarnon organised the "Working Abroad Expo" an exhibition, which offers a Rundumservice on work Abroad.
"For young people work abroad but a great opportunity to make the first steps on the career ladder" says the manager.
On its website show photos server in Australia and Snowboarder in Canada.
The message is clear: The work is not a Galeerendienst, but also freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something else, Mr O Donovan for half a year.
Because it is the 29 - year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen took just a fashion house.
In January it goes after Hanover or Berlin, the next project.
His home is O Donovan now only rarely, since it makes extra classes, in order to be able to the credit for his house at home.
"The situation is a little crazy" he says, as he comes after a long time for the first time on the threshold of his house.
"I should have money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I am almost never again."
He laughs, and goes through ausgekühlte spaces.
The small house is in a residential area with fine leafy front gardens, in the park harbours large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O Donovan bought the house for four years ago for 380.000 EUR - credit-financed 100 percent.
"It was crazy times, it was easy money without many questions" he says.
He fears that it could go wrong with the credit?
O Donovan thought for a while, pours hot tea and says: "I have no children, I have to feed and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The engineer may not, but at the moment he often hears.
"No one should go hungry - our situation is not nearly as dramatic as in previous times here on the island" he says.
"A while working abroad, this is not the worst thing that can happen - perhaps we feel it only when Irish."
He laughs and tells of his father, who in the last major economic crisis to England.
"After seven years, he was back and life in Ireland, was quite simple."
Cian Tanner like this idea.
The future and see how it goes with The life elsewhere.
A few years of work in London, he has also been behind them and why should it not in New Zealand are also good for him and his girlfriend?
One thing is, however, the troubled him in recent days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears that it could turn into a farewell Party.
"Not too many emotions" he says, and drink a big a bite of his beer.
"Goodbye, this sounds pretty scary."
"We call it a Weggehparty, simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The demokatrische routine
The democracy movement in Latin America will be stronger, as the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than the unemployment.
In many parts of the region is the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
These results, the Latinobarómetro survey, conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by the Economist.
This survey will be carried out on a regular basis since 1995 and shows the exchange of opinions in This region.
Two facts in this year's poll in September and october, particularly in's eye.
First, the good mood in Latin America
And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions.
In many countries of the South Pacific coast has increased the democratic movement here (Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy is growing at an annual rate of around 6% since 2002, the number of democracy advocates from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
In Mexico, where the economy since the sharp fall In the last year, is such a trend.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the world's two most populous countries in the region, which, the regional average (. graph 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents said that they will be with the country's democratic practice. As many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (graph 3).
About 34% trust Congress and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but a sharp increase from 2003 (17% or 24%).
Latin American economic crises A decade ago undermined the efforts to bring about more democracy.
Also during the world economic crisis, it may be that the countries of Latin America only a brief recession, and have recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor through a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the u. n. Economic Commission for Latin America this week, 2009, the poverty rate in Latin America only slightly, and has fallen this year at 32%.)
But there are strong differences from country to country (s. graph 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread progress thinking.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession mount was increased violence and crime, this is less the case.
Only the second time since the beginning of the see many respondents in Latin America in the crime in their country a bigger problem than the unemployment (s. graph 5).
Some 31% say that either they or a family member last year, victims of a crime. But compared to 38% last year dropped the values and the lowest level since 1995.
The rising economic performance is reflected in the strong support of the private sector and the market economy: around 71% of respondents at said that the private sector for the development, in 2007 there were 56% (s. graph 6).
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy can bring their country progress, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela this view (and 80% are maintained for a private sector), although their leftist President, Hugo Chávez, nationalized many private companies.
Brazil has had 19% of respondents (18% last year), the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year).
The respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, on the other hand, the most influential country in the United states, and this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua and Venezuela.
An electoral defeat
Nobody had expected that the elections on 28 November in Haiti would be perfect.
But the facts, the fears of election workers, who rushed to help the war-torn country.
Overcrowded ballot boxes, multiple votes cast in the Rinnstein, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only part of the problems.
Polling stations opened with watching late.
Many Haitians, many of whom were displaced by the earthquake in January, homeless roamed around in search of a choice.
Some were then.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged, on the basis of an alleged fraud in the election results.
Across the country, sometimes violent protests.
Nevertheless, Edmund Mulet, the head of the u. n. mission in Haiti, the election as "quite good in many respects".
According to a cautious statement of observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community "these irregularities, so serious they may be, not necessarily the process invalid."
In other words, the show goes on.
The election authority, the supposedly the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jew Célestin, is obliged, the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected run-off is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel, Elly and the former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial marriage annulment proceedings.
If Jew Célestin, with voters have little or no support from the Wahlberhörde declared the winner of the run-off, this could lead to problems.
Because of the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of earthquake victims still living in tents, fear a low turnout.
On election day, many Haitians were prevented by lack of organisation of the vote.
Shortly before the start of the election were approximately 250.000 cards, which are needed, not yet.
There is a lot at stake.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognized as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks after the sudden death of her husband, Argentina's President Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy, their popularity rate by 20 points to 50%. this is the highest value since its election in 2007.
Whether her, but next year to a re-election, depends on whether the visibly in Cristina Fernández may be more willing than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who drew even after the election of his wife's economic policy, often budgets, tax revenues, the economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the president to spend the extra revenue at will.
On paper, the Fernández government last year, the majority in Congress.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27, leading to further rifts.
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling Peronisten rallying around Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (where a member of another in the face and others accused the government of corruption), the Congress failed to pass the budget for 2011.
"I will not discuss it" the President.
The 2010 budget is now for the next year, which the President has more opportunity to spend money as they see fit.
The economy is hot: they probably will grow this year by up to 9%.
The official inflation rate is z. z. at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands from the unions - the value of nearly 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was beset by economic crises, growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, and not the reduction of inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, for the private sector and säuberte the National Institute for Statistics and census INDEC schönte then the official inflation Statistics.
Fernández can take a mäßigeren path?
She has called on the private sector and the trade union leaders to talks.
And according to official statements, wage increases next year to 18%.
The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given a strong boost to the economy.
But the inflation undermined the growth spurt through a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps join Cristina Fernández for this reason Argentina economic terms to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government has an agreement with shareholders, who had rejected the previous rescheduling of the country in 2001.
Now seems to push Fernández on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, which it owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had a review by the IMF, as elsewhere, rejected.
But last month, the Economics Minister Amado Boudou announced that the fund in the drafting of a new national consumer price index "technical assistance". It looks as if this is the first step towards the cleansing of the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández after leaving office without the support of her husband politically active.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which have had enough of kirchnerism.
If the Argentines in March from their summer holidays, the wave of sympathy, which has been shown to be fizzled.
If they want to win another election, must decide whether to lift many political decisions of her husband quietly.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly nearing a close link to the mainland.
What Taiwan from his big brother across the Straits?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of all eligible voters in the city's five districts to elect mayors and city councils. This will be seen as a broad assessment of President Ma Ying jeou.
By building cutting-edge business relations, einschl. A partial free trade agreement, Ma is itself a symbol for relations with the mainland. Its policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese mainland for the first time since 1949.
Ma has passed the test, but only just.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT), three of the five mayors, they received a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates greater independence for Taiwan, almost 50% of the vote, the KMT was 45%.
In a presidential election would mean for Ma problems.
Since his election two years ago was the vote of his party by around 8%.
For the first time, together with the KMT, the DPP even in town councils.
During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as convoys of lorries with rioters, flags schwenkende mass parades and only scantily clad dancers.
There were even compulsory, mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, on the eve of the election in a speech to a KMT candidate.
As a man from the crowd in the face. LIEN was wounded and killed an umstehender viewers.
Bizarrerweiser is not clear whether the shooter Lien kill or wanted to settle a dispute with the candidates.
Regardless of the attack, according to Tsai every whom, the leader of the DPP, the election and the DPP in a bad light, which has brought the KMT more votes.
China was perhaps the biggest winners in the campaign.
It was not the relations with the mainland.
Instead, the candidates have plans for social housing and job creation of jobs.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT their relations with the government in Beijing in the foreground.
But this time, the DPP, the Chinese feelings too much.
They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for its part, would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese its China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy to attract Taiwan with economic incentives in the community.
China sent a negotiator in Taipei, for a summit to investment security and medical cooperation.
Certainly wants a political integration. But first things first.
It is therefore prefer until after the presidential elections in 2012.
The DPP has reinvented itself now.
Two years ago, it was weakened sharply: the former party leader Chen Shui bian sat in jail for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008 he stood for the complete independence.
But under Tais reign, a new generation gemässigter politicians and the DPP is fighting for the votes of the professionals and the youth.
Tsai was adopted as the DPP's presidential candidate, such as Su Tseng chang under Chen.
Their party is doing everything to show that they, too, is in a position to build close relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning a tank as a contact point between the DPP and China. However, this requires broad discussions.
Tsai stated publicly that their party a "credible alternative" to Mas • rapprochement with China.
Chen seems very angry about this change.
From his cell, he said, the candidate of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He urged the pragmatists Su even to renounce the presidential candidacy.
Even without interference, the DPP to choose their possible candidates.

The construction of a mosque in Temecula took place after a five-hour, often heated public hearing the unanimous approval of the local planning committee.
Critics of the project, both to promote terrorism and traffic jams.
But according to a statement by the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious center local rules and will be an aesthetic catch-the-eye.

"It shows that justice will prevail."
"There are only a few opponents" he added.
"They are very loud."
"In this valley are wonderful people."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the centre lasted until almost midnight, the voices on both sides, according to the Press Enterprise fairly evenly.
The debate on the website of the newspaper.
"There is no longer America", was a comment.

Arsenic resistant microbe could new forms of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of an alien species of bacteria, which can live of arsenic, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, it is a sign that a life without the previously deemed as vital elements.
"This organism has two options."
"He needs to grow either phosphorus and arsenic."
"This makes it to something very unusual, although it is almost a kind of'foreign' way of life" said c. w. Paul Davies of Arizona State University and Co author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
So far, have been six main regarded as vital elements - carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But the scientists figured out how, the bacterium in mono Lake even further when it replaced phosphorus, arsenic.
"One wonders what else is possible" said the report's Co author Ariel d. Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, we must recognize scientists and his life forms, Anbar.
The study deals with microbes, which have been found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details were given to the discovery of known, led to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report by the discovery außerirdischen life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that can put in other Planetary systems, with the help of other elements biochemical processes and that the standard elements that are absolutely essential in our opinion, are not necessarily clear" said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research teams.
"This work is a new, because it shows that can be replaced in fundamental biochemical processes and structures an element of another" said Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe Simon from Astro Biological Institute of NASA, who led the study, chose the mono Lake due to the high arsenic content.
As arsenic and phosphorus chemically identical, they assumed that microbes, which are both, can replace may be an element of the other.
"The toxicity of the Arsens based mainly on the fact that it is chemically similar to how phosphorus."
"This is the organisms are difficult to distinguish one from the other."
"But the difference is so large that arsenic acts differently than phosphorus. It in our biochemisches system, where it covered almost everything" said Anbar.
The researchers, the bacterium GFAJ- 1 arsenic concentration. It suited and grew.
The microbe grows in phosphorus better, but that they can survive in arsenic, shows that the way of life, of course, either on the ground or on another planet or moon, on the arsenic.
According to Jamie s. Foster, President of microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that can be replaced phosphorus, arsenic, not new. but so far there has been no functioning example.
Arsenic came in the early Erdjahren more frequently, it says, so the science that early life forms that have been used.
"There is reason to believe that life can also have developed differently than in the early period" Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National health authorities.

Unfortunately, it would also Scarlett Johansson, the bad image that the Chinese city commandos have to improve.

Unlike the police, these officials the urban laws only impose fines or other administrative penalties.

Prosecutor will not Senator Ensign accuse
Prosecutors from the Ministry of Justice, Senator John Ensign acquitted of the charges, after his affair with a former Wahlhelferin and his attempt to give her husband a lobbying against him, the senator's lawyers on Wednesday.
This decision will put an end to the most serious charge against Senator Ensign, a Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, the nationwide headlines and his career, he was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensigns office announced that he was on the judgment after a year-long investigation "delighted".
The ethics committee of the Senate could impose a Disziplarstrafe.
According to the Ensigns lawyers were informed by the Ministry of Justice that stopped the investigations against Senator Ensign and that in this matter any further charges.
The Ministry of Justice did not comment on the case.
The verdict was for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice a surprise. They believe there was sufficient evidence that has ignored Ensign lobbying ban.
Interviews, E e-mails and other documents, for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times open, gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election workers, helped to lucrative contracts to buy his silence about an affair with Hamptons wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was during an election campaign Ensigns as Treasurer.
Ensign, contact with some political friends to give Hampton work. According to the documents and interrogations took for them after the cessation Hamptons lobbying.
Since Hampton recently in Ensigns election team, it was a year no lobbying for his former employer or the Senate.
According to a statement of ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, prior to the incident were chummy, against the so-called ban the revolving door Lobbykratie.
According to the published evidence is apparently a consultation and the violation of the revolving door statutes, "Stanley fire, a Washington lawyer who specialises in the defence of clients who are in the sights of the government.
While the Department of Justice official refused to give the reasons for the decision in the case Ensign, said mr. fire and other ethics lawyers, the Ministry seem very careful in fuelled political charges after a series of defeats, persecuted by the media with great interest, including the decision last year, the indictment against the former Senator Ted Stevens because of misconduct by the prosecutor to drop.
Prosecutors "are obviously schreckhaft" said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the Association of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington "(an organization whose objective is to fight corruption in Parliament and government circles in the United States), a group of lawyers, the various charges against mr. Ensign before the courts.
"This means that, in general, government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them" she added.
Paul Coggins, main defenders of mr. Ensign, said in an interview on Monday that he had a telephone call from a prosecutor and another the next day, in which he was told that the Ministry of any complaints against his client.
Mr. Ensigns defenders had cooperated with prosecutors, in order to convince them that the senator, as his office in a statement on Wednesday repeated again, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused, the legal arguments that he had to the prosecutors, to explain.
"I do not think that, in the details of talks between the Ministry of Justice and me. let me just say this: We believe that made the right decision to have" he said.
Last month the federal election Commission to suspend the investigation of a separate appeal by the group, which has breached a payment of $96.000 from mr. Ensigns parents in the Hamptons against the federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money was something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a big company in Nevada, which for a long time the senator, was one of the firms in which mr. Hampton, thanks to the help of mr. Ensign lobbyists work.
A documented E mail from December 2008 that has helped the company mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, mr. Ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, had a conversation with mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he, of the Interior Ministry because "anklopfe".
Mr. Ensign with mr. Hampton and other customers from Nevada, Allegiant Air, agreed to lunch and asked the transport ministers to a meeting on behalf of the airline, after those mr. Hampton to lobbying.
As of last year, for the first time, information about this affair, mr. Ensign apologize to his constituents and his position in the Senate, where he had been in the order of the Republicans in fourth place.
After he was struck many more months, mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he will seek a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that mr. Ensign will no longer be the target of police investigations, said his press spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, hope the senator that the Ethics Commission very quickly the example of the Ministry of Justice, and einstelle his investigation.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people of Nevada" she said.
Cheshire appeal draws attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them tippten in the riots in the courtroom.
In the minutes verschickten on Twitter their reports on grausige testimonies.
In the end, the defence, there were more than 140.000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and beds gekettete children in a house that go up in flames.
On Thursday, the process closely followed by Steven j. Hayes, who was indicted, three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, to find an official end, if the ruling on the death sentence, the jury.
But mr. Hayes lawyers have already submitted applications to court, the reasons for an appeal and will employ the courts for years.
One of the provozierendsten reasons is that it through the intense coverage of the process - through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporter - to a "circus atmosphere" and such a widespread, swift penetration rebel details, so that the jury had been illegally by the public outrage.
This objection could lead the Appelationsgerichte to deal with the question of whether the new technologies, new rules in the courtroom is necessary.
"As I have seen during this process, I believe that there is a real danger that if the arrival of new technologies in the courtroom to each individual's right to a fair trial" said Thomas j. Ullman, mr. Hayes' main defender.
The presiding judge, Jon c. Blue chamber of the Supreme Court last week the applications by decision succinctly when he said that the new media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion.
But it was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, the appeals court noted that the reporting of famous notorious cases doubts about the fairness of the process.
In his historic 1966 decision, the Supreme Court of the United States the ruling against Dr Sam Sheppard, osteopaths from Cleveland, which is to have killed his wife, lifted and said in its ruling that because of the new Media "a carnival atmosphere in the courtroom".
Some believe that the television series and the movie "on the run" based on this crime.
Some say lawyers, court appeals, which mr. Hayes condemnation for half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules are necessary, the channels of communication from the courtroom, which is currently the case of Dr. Sheppard still inconceivable.
"There is a good reason, on the impact of new media in processes, which will be followed by a public concern" said John j. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut. His report, they is imposed arbitrarily.
Professor said Donohue, some Appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of instant communications from the courtroom, could make the process fairer.
The Twitter is just one of many that The lawyers of mr. Hayes to discuss for years and delay a condemnation.
The defenders claim, for example, that mr. Hayes already explanation, as judges Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential judges, by giving them during the almost-certain selection grausige scene photos.
Some of the judges said that photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke Petit, 48 years, and their Tüchter, Hayley, 17 years, and thanking, 11 years, they would have with disgust.
The defenders say that they would also call into question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judges have exchanged a jury, a critic of the prosecutor's office, and that he had improperly exerted pressure on the ruling, as he had made the unusual decision to ask the jury over on the weekend.
The judges were not isolated.
But their arguments about the influence of the extensive coverage of the process is perhaps the greatest interest.
In a judgment, which they have submitted last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the American Senate candidate.
They argued that the new media continually the flames of emotion on the case.
"Such a crush of media Scandinavia, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom" wrote the lawyers, "has seen it before in New Haven, and perhaps not even nationwide."
Focusing on Twitter's reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists that the assertion that these are rabble-rousing than direct news reports, the slower, a technikfeindlicher, the verarme reporting about future processes verarme.
But some lawyers, Appelationsgerichte would often confronted with the argument that social and technical changes need the Adaptation through the courts.
Mr. Hayers lawyers reinforce this claim.
In their appeal to the Supreme Court's decision of 1966, In which the condemnation of Dr Sheppard due to the reporting and made it clear that the new media, new rules.
"This case" they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can combine courtesy that which divides us?
After a campaign of dirty words and negativity has erupted this week little civility in Washington.
It is the sign of a real Zweiparteienkooperation or a moment of illusion, before returning to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and Congressional produced no breakthrough in the big issues, during the so-called "lame duck" session, the meeting at the end of a government, in which no decisions had to be.
After all, what we hear, it was neither to govern a polite discussion between two sides of a consideration of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partisan collection points.
The public meeting of the deficit commission's president on Wednesday was very civilised, despite the political differences between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months a mutual respect obtained of the ideological divide that separates the members.
This is hardly enough to claim that it has entered a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other signs of cooperation and willingness to compromise, while trying to weigh up the limits of public opinion and the voters' patience following a new parties warfare.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday and his assessment by the participants at a minimum requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep for a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed in the past two years, might have been expected.
Whether it comes to taxes, donations, health or benefits, the two sides are miles apart.
Last but not least, the November election, at least for a short time mild.
"No question, the tone has changed" said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, which is now for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center" works.
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections give partisan passions.
And that is a good thing. "
In some areas, particularly In those who are on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution. "
Bush's tax cuts end up at the end of the year, and no one advocates.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, either temporarily or permanently.
It is expected to reach a compromise over the increased unemployment benefits, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that supported the idea of tax cuts for the rich, while denying them unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House has increased optimism that these issues during the "lame duck" session and at the time to ratify the new START treaty.
But warns William glass tone of the Brookings Insitution that a successful cooperation in urgent issues of the lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to a lasting cooperation between the parties, if the new 112th Congress convened in January.
Instead, he says, is a period of Nichtübereinstimmens likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that need to be done, done, will turn this short-term psychology in confrontation" he said.
Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - the courtesy to gain their cooperation.
"I do not see much of what happens between now and 2012, when preliminaries, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012" he said.
The reasons have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the Teeparty voters who were their education.
As the Republican leaders may be concerned that they vie too high, they know that they must try to their promise to cut government spending and to repeal the health care reform.
This party lines are already in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include a tax reform and raising some taxes and raising the retirement age and reduce government spending.
The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have assumed that one of the toughest jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, so that the deficit issue on the public agenda that can be ignored no longer.
But they need within the Commission in 14 of 18 votes, in order to make its plan to official recommendation and they are struggling to come even close to this figure.
The biggest opposition in the elected representatives of the body, as in financial matters, today at least, there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises.
Galton says two phases in the battle between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first battle will be held next year in the form of party clashes, if the Obama Republicans in the state budget, defying the taxes and the health system, then followed by a phase of greater zweiparteilicher cooperation.
What will this change?
The public opinion.
It is shown that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still hopes that the two parties together.
If confrontation in a cul-de-sac, as happened in 1995, both parties must have a careful look at the public reaction.
Whoever is doomed to lose, will change the course and must seek compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than in the mid-1990 s, and they seem more ideological divide between Obama and congressional Republicans than at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a much broader election in 2012.
So it may be that the courtesy which will be taken this week, will be welcomed by many americans.
But it will require both sides very much more difficult to find a common denominator in the issues that divide the two still.
Durchgesickertes U.S. document portrayed Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and they are a part of the bribes and protection money, out walking, to the Kremlin. As reported in february, the American Embassy in Russia in a memo.
Both police and the state security Service, high protection money, so that they can keep their standard of living in Moscow, it says.
They collect money not only legitimate business, but also by organized criminal gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy - Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has described as "vertical of power" - takes its part of the money that moves up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent under the name of John Beyrle ambassador to Washington, was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks published on its website.
The memo is based on sources, whose names have been edited.
It was written, while Yuri Luzhkov, Moscow's Mayor, and accused him of corruption.
In the meantime, He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence that would have been sorted out.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a construction company, known for years have rejected accusations of corruption, and he has won numerous libel against such accusations.
In september, he said a Russian television, when he was asked about an article, which suggests that he is corrupt: "it is crazy, it is bad, it is dirty."
Take The believe an incredibly large number of Russians that their corrupt society. The surveys showed.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the report of the ambassador, individuals, and it is unheard of that happening by a diplomat from a foreign country.
"The government's direct link with the crime has meant that some of them as" disturbing "and conclude that the government is more like a Kleptokrat acts as a government" the memo.
"Criminal elements" kryshna "(a term from the world of criminals and the mafia, which literally means" umbrella "or protection), the police, state security (FSB), the Service Supervisory Authority (MVD) and the Office of the Prosecutor, as well as by the whole of the Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a dreilagige structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is paramount."
"The FSB and MVD, the militia are on the second stage."
"The least reduced criminals and criminal inspectors at the bottom."
"This is an inkompetentes system, in which criminal groups in some areas a gap, because the city offers no help."
The report also says that the FSB money from the largest firms and arrested by the police small businessmen.
A source, is, "said that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to the protection of the FSB and MVD (and not by organised crime), because they are not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law."
"This is why not ask the protection by criminal gangs as before."
The memo noted that, while the collection of funds, the protection of very modest, no; even those who pay, are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay, closed their business very quickly - on the basis of one or other Vorwands.
Medvedev has spoken on several occasions, to combat corruption, said that he has made little progress.
The memo contains descriptions of men who with suitcases, who were probably full of money, in the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption must rely on the bureaucrats" said Georgy Satarov, director of by, a Moscow think tank, in a recent interview.
"But it is part of the bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class, because there is not a political class in Russia."
Without politicians, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, by the corruption, costing more than $300 billion per year.
The country ranks 154th on a recent investigation into the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organisation Transparence International (countries of "most corrupt" to "most corrupt" listed).
The revelation of the memos of the American Embassy, which happened after Moscow time late at night, will certainly displeasure within the Russian government, although, as can be accused Luzhkov of Moscow's mistake, it can be for the Kremlin is also an opportunity to assert that will resolve the problems.
In an interview with Larry King on CNN, Putin that could be the WikiLeaks documents a forgery and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats have called him batsman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country" he said.
"But to be honest, we did not expect that to happen with such arrogance, such pressure and unethical manner, you know."
Khmer Rouge forced veterans to confrontation with the past
In a weak illuminated, betonierten class room with dirty and abblätternden walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School to the man who has built, the Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he cared about his people" said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years.
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butchers', the commander in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in the north-west Cambodia's popular, where he built hospitals and bridges, has developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, will be challenged longstanding supporters in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum victims public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June the government a school book that tells for the first time a former child soldiers In the history of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a Community Court of the u. n. and Cambodia for the first time a former member of the Khmer Rouge, the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, sentenced to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, the fear among the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, making their efforts at reconciliation and reintegration into society of Cambodia.
"There are still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything" said Chhang Youk, director of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that researches the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, were executed an estimated 1.7 million people, or died of disease, starvation or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and toppled Pol Pot Ied government, fled the remnants of the regime and its military to the Cambodian border to Thailand.
Here, they surrendered until December 1998, when the last movement.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary's guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok, the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990 s, when an UN-sponsored peace agreement in 1993 to the first democratic elections in the country, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters, joining the government, which led to the Kapitulationen of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of natural causes, and Ta Mok, who had not yielded, was arrested in 1999 by government forces in the Dangrek Mountain.
He died in 2006 at the prison in Phnom Penh, where he was waiting for his trial.
As their patrons they no longer protected, ran most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters from grinding poverty of rural Cambodia and many of the movement in nostalgic memories.
Even if a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge their local government posts, because they laid down their arms, the ordinary soldiers remained poor, illiterate farmers.
"These people have very little of the surrender" said Sok Leang by the Centre for justice and reconciliation, in Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng, public forums,
"They are enshrined in the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They grew without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55, who had joined in 1974 as a teenager, Rhmer Montrouge, fought in the jungle Anlang Veng, before he niederließ 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good" he said.
"TA Mok each has something to eat."
"But now life is difficult, because we have to take care of itself."
The current Khmer Rouge tribunal has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court will try, Nuon Chea, Khieu samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge ministers.
It is the task of the court, the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities, to condemn, but it is not said whether it will pursue further beyond these four cases.
This has done little to assuage the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation have focused on the Chaem, 64 years, during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970 s district in the province Manteay Meanchey.
In 2007, she had told representatives of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, In which the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project that killed thousands of forced labour probably died.
On a hot night in Chaem from work in the fields of her wooden house On a dirty streets outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun long shadow over the desiccated grass, rejected the Chaem refuses to discuss about their past the Khmer Rouge.
The court should call them, so they would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia is living in peace and stability" she said.
"There would be no prosecutions would be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has fled in 1878 by the Khmer Rouge, has also repeatedly warned that the situation is uncertain, would accuse the court more suspects, although experts and historians to discuss this.
"Cambodia needs to dig a hole and bury the past" he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do in order to move forward, said Chhang Youk the Documentation Centre.
"Reconciliation with the Rouge times means to bring together the broken pieces" he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together, so that we can understand everything."
The centre has created the first approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, the 75 page "history of Democratic Kampuchea".
It's book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history books for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
How often in Cambodia know the young people in Anlong Veng little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at the Anlong Veng High school, said that the new school book helps students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book with home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court" he said.
"They are suspicious, because they are not sure how many people convicted by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process is complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school books and the court, and influence, "he said.
Still, the Khmer Rouge is a powerful attraction.
High in the Dangrek mountains of shrubbery überwucherter and with plastic waste verdreckter rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burnt on a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years, a mobile phone sales Rin roadside, said she does not know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray" she said.
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday and later in the day they wanted to go to Pol Pot's final resting place, where they will be a bush ripe bananas - in the hope that he will bring their luck.
Belarus is, not weapons-grade uranium accumulate
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide has announced the government of Belarus on Wednesday that will collect no longer highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting between the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Council.
The U.S. government had tried for years to persuade Russia to collect The more highly enriched uranium and seemed achieved last spring a hurdle.
But the U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that were taken in the past two months, two secret agreements with Belarus to remove about 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research Institute.
This was the scene for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material, according to an official staff, which is due to the sensitivity of the issue of anonymously, about 500 pounds.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Nuklearem security summit of 47 nations" in April, the had ruled Belarus.
And it was obviously well enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited by the fact that they have a seat on the nuclear Security summit (2012)."
"This proves that it works" said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Partnership, a group for the promotion of nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague, to secure within four years all vulnerable nuclear material.
Since then, has helped the U.S. government six countries, to be its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George w. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuklearem security summit, the White Russian President Alexander Lukashenko said that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally waffenfähig, and less enriched uranium" Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our commodity. We are not dirty bombs, and we will sell it to anyone."
"We use it solely for research purposes, that is all."
Belarus approached, however, a few months ago, the United States, when it signaled interest in meeting an agreement.
The first attempt to remove the uranium Belarus in October, was particularly difficult because the material was easily contaminated by radiation, officials say.
It was loaded into a Spezialzug load, the more than 1.300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal of, say officials.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the officials by plane.
The U.S. government is paying for this $14 million, with much of the money flowing into the research with low-enriched uranium, which can be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was a coordinated and, in order to build confidence" to the agreement, which was signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy, which is working on the global threat reduction.
The James Martin Center for Nichtweiterzugebende studies that Belarus this year at least £88 waffenfähhigen uranium, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus wants to dissolve the joint agreement be camp until 2012.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But the statement Wednesday suggested a possible rapprochement.
"The progress of this global security issues, heißend, the United States of America and Belarus announced that a greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a key issue in the improvement of bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens" she said.
No objections to the Spanish Government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners on Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as a telegram from the U.S. a. Ambassador in Madrid.
This reflects the Wikileaks enhüllten and the daily newspaper "El País" (via cable) the documents. It adds that the former deputy leader María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, the Spanish Government should be informed, "to show that foreign aircraft flying over Spain, are monitored properly."
In June 2006, after the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which the aid to human rights practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, was indicted, discussed the former American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The deputy leader admitted that the report of the Council, "Zapatero met on the sidelines" and Spain have nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega, Spain have no objection to the secret flights via Spanish territory."
"They want to be informed simply", not "unprepared to be surprised" said Aguirre via cable.
The former foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, the ambassador pointed out that the Spanish government "did not want to pay great attention to this matter, although the government has little influence, since these are in the hands of the judges."
The prosecutor Vicente Gonzalez was in January 2007 the message that the judicial initiative, the declassification of documents from the Spanish intelligence headquarters (CNI) and to request would not block the defence minister on the CIA flights.
"These reports contain no burdensome or sensitive information" said the ambassador after a meeting with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the United States was on the "apparent coordination between the Spanish and German prosecutors' more than on the deklassifizierte information of the CNI and Department of Defense.
"This coordination between independent Untersuchern will complicate our efforts to discreet handling between governments" bemoaned Aguirre.
At a lunch in March 2007, attended the ambassador of the United States and the Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, commented that "although the Spanish judges incredibly heavily on their independence and do what they think is appropriate" he gave his staff instructions, "sexed up" to avoid rhetorical comments to abate the tension. "
The ambassador also expressed his concern about the way the PP in this matter.
"Despite their generally pro-American stance our experience teaches us that will no doubt the PP, a sign that the government's actions of the United States, which could be interpreted as a possible human rights violations, have deliberately ignored or tolerated, will propose capital, even if these revelations could have a negative effect on the government of the United States" he says.
The Kindsmörderin admits that it has on the Internet about the "burdens" complained of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child, as this was already dead and she had a blog: "terror in Galician nature"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname from a very young age, she with a Kusine and at least one friend contact. Both are from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, in which she was born.
The communications are from The year 2008.
In order to understand this, we must know their love lives, the ABC newspaper on the basis of testimony reconstructed In their families.
The 30 - year-old Galician Mrs 1998 adopted a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialists.
It was a year.
Shortly after their relationship had vanished, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know whether the baby from him, but his former allowed him to carry out a DNA analysis.
In short, it is a different relationship.
The chosen was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighbouring municipality.
They lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman in the Balearic Islands, and on the labour market, the Little at her partner that she was even a week after Palma.
But from the content of their news that their love relationship disintegrated and they separated.
In March 2008, she writes on Menorca and: "Alberto is very strange and annoyed, because I am here to work."
"When I told him that he found it well, but now says he, of course, what it means to be with the boys all day long alone and not to be free to do what he wants."
Later she mentions a communication that it has received on the phone: "I would like to see you this month zurückkommst or an address, I can send you the boys."
They complained: "if I do not like him that I am the boys in my mother, I would bring him, if I am."
In May it speaks of the return to their village: "This week I will go there, but I will only until 19. remain there, because I am 20. must present a work, if I do not want to lose it."
They said that they take their first born, if all goes well.
"It will be, in which he must be, that is, to me, never in life will let him back to anyone except for my mother" a dubious intention, if their bad relationship.
In July, there is another Mail.
As she writes, it is assumed that the boy, the 1th of the month on the island and allegedly was murdered, is dead.
"On the one hand, César, not on the other."
"On the one hand, it is with me and the place like him a bit, but on the other hand, he must go to school every day."
She speaks of a move to majorca.
"There will be (the boy) visit a summer course, I have less spending on the girl child."
On 17: memories and complaints.
"A giant kiss of César, asks me, when you."
"Alberto says, he sent me any videos of E Mail. You see, if he wants, he finds me, so a dung."
30. one more: "the boy is doing well. He is in a summer course to learn Catalan."
By Víctor, her current partner, there is a: "he shoots me money."
On the Internet, in Anime and Mangablogs, there are communications.
They even had its own blog on MySpace, which is now closed, and in which they called "Muki, the Gefängnisentlasserin."
"Terrorism a la gallega (title)."
The last man, with her zusammenlebte, a vereidigter hunting Aufseher, said to have guilt, because he felt guilty.
He can not everything that happened, because they had not told him that she was single mother.
Mónica was transferred yesterday by the Centre for court prisoners to Menorca, provincial prison Palma.
The defence counsel, Carlos Maceda, said that she could not remember the expiry of the facts, "and they had no intention of harming the small."
Previously, they had, however, César drowned in the bathtub and stowed his body in a suitcase.
Defense and prosecutors requested a psychiatric assessment.
The Popular Party won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November could the PP in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona play a decisive role
After the major votes and the increase in the last regional elections the PP is focusing on the parliamentary elections - or not. their expectations are more positive, because the number of votes, the party achieved in these elections, is normally twice as high as in the elections in Catalonia.
So the Catalan People's Party (christian Democrats) and European Democrats 610.473 votes in the parliamentary elections of 2008, while this paragraph in the regional elections in 2006, 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC 384.091 votes.
If this rising trend - the result of the voting shares of the PSC and the capture of the electorate the PP - should continue, analysts predict that the PP that could rise in the parliamentary elections PPC from 8 to 12 members of Congress, while also CiU four (it now has 10) and the PSC at least 9 members (25) would lose.
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party would lose the ERC a Member - currently has three, while ICV keep Members or could make.
Should the election calendar, however, the next date with the municipal elections in May 2011. Even then, the People's Party (PP), the of the scales, in order to put an end to the socialist hegemony in four provincial capitals and with their majority in the city Council is Barcelona, one of the city with the largest budget: 661 million for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party (christian Democrats) and European Democrats agree that the PSC cities Barcelona, Tarragona Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists do not reach a majority on its traditional allies and ICV (ERC), will lose.
After the Republican debacle, it is not unreasonable that this party their representation in the municipal council is Barcelona, where 5% of the vote, will lose.
The PP, on the other hand, an increase in their share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could be decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that we can play the main role in Tarragonas turnaround, they had before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
The PP en Lérida lies only 500 votes behind the PSC. the mayor, Àngel's, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign, it several times.
Also in other important areas, such as in Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party (christian democrats) and a significant increase.
Currently, the PP in 34 municipalities of Catalonia and the creation of lists in so many places as possible.
The Catalan cell of Al Qaeda thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven of the police, the Barcelona police arrested Pakistanis and the Nigerians were managed from Thailand, dschihadistische cell, the different Al Qaeda groups, including the Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and "Laschkar e Tauba" (Let) - car Rin the attacks in Mumbai, with 2008 106 deaths - supplied with passports.
The Spanish Interior Minister, these studies of great importance, so much so that he assured, with the "operation Kampai" the counterfeiting of Al Qaeda-type worldwide "weakened" and "so their ability."
The researchers estimate that in the two years in which the cell in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where these falsified and then to the groups that make up the criminal Galaxie Al Qaeda, have been sent out, so that their "fighters" with impunity would cross the borders of European and other Western countries.
The any cell is not the only one of the jihadist network, which was active in Europe. In addition to the Thai investigative bodies, other European police units to the research. It is not inconceivable that in the field of the EU in the next few days to similar for example, the last Tuesday in Barcelona, will come.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerians Babatunde Agunbiade arrested) was carried out in Thailand, where the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zee Han Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They had come to Bangkok from the in Spain and other European countries registered cell.

The elderly pet confirmed that the deaths are not due to "lack of action"
The owners of the old people's homes in Olot does not rule out the possibility that their carers on eleven elderly people killed
The responsible for the care home in La Caritat Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference in which they were, what harm the criminal acts Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurses, who during his work at least eleven old people, for which he had killed - had caused.
The head of the care home, Joan Sala, accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada, court and announced, "La Caritat (like those responsible for the deaths)" but "the right and our accountability oblige us to make the process and the civil liability".
The institution must not only a social prestige, because they had not seen the criminal acts of the time, but now also pay a large sum of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the families of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé acknowledged that the first crime on August 2009 and that he had murdered since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - the elderly's former patients - no doctor, because he suspected that the deceased personally investigated, but the formalities due to their age and disease by telephone.
The head of La Caritat writers have flatly and that "could have been a lack of action keinerzeit the reason for the incident."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that it "in the case of circumstantial evidence for negligent acts another person than the accused."
The "angel of death" Getaufte acknowledged yesterday, eleven murders, and the first crimes committed on 29 August 2009 and killed one and a half months later, the second old lady.
In this case he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime, In which he had used a mixture of various sedatives.
The head of La Caritat said that access to medicines is difficult to control.
The injections of insulin and tranquilizers cocktail of nurses in six of the nine crimes, in order to liberate the patients with the death of their suffering.
But the results of laboratory tests to prove whether Vila lying and for his first victims actually chose a less cruel death or whether he ausbrannte this from the inside, they verabreichte Bleichlauge, as he had done according to the confession of three women, between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat if the Pflegers no faith, not even as regards the number of researcher who murders, which could be more. This is justified that had made Vila very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to change its approach after eight successful murders suddenly.
They say that they did it for that reason, and to clarify the scope of these incidents of justice.
From the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors reacted sharply yesterday on the threat of the ECB President Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our response."
The risk premium of EUR Peripheriländer have risen dramatically and the shares of European banks by more than 5%.
But we should be the possibility that can fool the ECB and the EUR has appreciated at points, leading to concern, not underestimate.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market, to the extent that he collapses, recovered, however, as a result of the closure and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investors will lose not far from his fear.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank, to make our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen, according to which the ECB tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably many times in the future, must make.
The Bundesbank called for the lifting of the plan to buy government debt, since these are ineffective, and the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. It should be maintained only an einwöchiger permanent access.
After the Irish crisis, we expect that the current liquidity measures "until at least March" extended and maintain the quarterly contracts with unlimited access to the quarter to provide liquidity until at least June.
We also expect that to continue the program to purchase bonds and will spend a means of signal.
If it does not meet the expectations created, discarded the reaction of the markets yesterday and thrown back if halstarrig insists that we withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As with the ECB meeting in May, when the bank, the purchase of state debt securities not to and the markets collapsed, this history could repeat tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and consistent.
In May, the teeth and on Wednesday said they bought a lot to do, provoking a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday was the auction of one-year government bonds in Portugal was rather weak.
The government's asset management were only 500 million to 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates by 30 basis points in Portugal in the curve and reflected a perceptual changes in the markets after Trichet's words.
In Ireland were published the figures of the debt hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated at around 10 000 million in the short term and possible further 15 000. it is time to February, in order to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has lost its credibility, the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures under the rescue plan acceptable and help to reduce the uncertainty.
However, the government next Tuesday's parliamentary approval for his new budget, since they do not have the sufficient support, Ireland is also a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has a discourse on the summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December. More moderate. There is political unity needed to show that we share the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries of Beethoven's ninth symphony.
The Spanish government President, yesterday's action plan, which will be adopted Friday by the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, reducing the deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures, in the ears of investors as Vivaldis four seasons.
The dual effect of Zapatero and Trichet, why has appreciated the Spanish stock market at 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February was the reaction of the government and the Bank of Spain quickly and convincingly, and we will benefit from the surprise result.
Today there is a crucial auction a three-year bond, which will benefit from Trichet effect. Therefore, we have a strong demand, which will remove all doubt about our ability to refinance.
For Spain would be the application of an aid plan a self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity, which we do not need. The Treasury has EUR 40 billion, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are extremely expensive and access to The markets would notice closed.
Nevertheless, in line with our strategy the Caesar's wife: "now is not only the existence, but also the licence."
Only courage, we create!

Red Bull prevails in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
The car will be improved with a software in real time.
Since the Red Bull in 2004 in the world of Formula 1, their history in this fine universe of the speed of surprises and successes.
Initially, no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his background rising sharply during the last few seasons, the sprint last November at the victory of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso.
Without the skills of the German pilots and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the performance of the engine of Renault, is the "secret weapon", the multinational Siemens Red Bull, and created a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, is a powerful software to simulate processes, the German company 2007 for purposes that have nothing to do with motor racing, on the market.
This is PLM described as PLM computer programme for the development of fitting chains in factories around the world, energy plants and precise instruments used.
It is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process, before this will actually be built, in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
Plm has the development of the cameras, Canon, the aircraft acquisitions and the most famous of Nissan vehicles.
Siegfried Rus worm, head of the industrial department of Siemens, said that with the use of this software in the Formula 1 - factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" the changes and improvements, which are found in the race and the tests can.
In the Russwurm contends that 1992 from an average of ten technicians who could bring in a season at most three or four improvements.
In Red's team are now employs 180 highly qualified young people. With powerful computer equipment they analyses and all sorts of changes to the cars.
The Siemens managers said that the PLM software is able to analyse all components of the cars of Red Bull and to improve, with the exception of the engine, for the Renault.
The materials, the fuel, the reason dynamism and security elements.
The changes can be transmitted through advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclave in less than 24 hours of the virtual reality of the Simulators into reality.
The only border, this crazy is technical perfectionism, the $40 million, a formula 1 - must spend team for his race in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its cars in a place 50 miles from London.
There are two buildings, where visits - particularly of journalists - are limited.
Everything that is happening is Top Secret.
The workforce includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red's true Formula 1 - zweifelslos hero is the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the huge technological resources, which represents the energy drink manufacturers in the service of his participation at the latest, further protagonists, whose support is priceless and whose reputation is zero.
The Technologichef the plant, Steve Nevey, stressed that five years ago to say that the progress in the field of R & D for cars with 50 percent for victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today have changed the share values. The technology accounts for 85 percent of success, while the contribution of the pilots estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey recognizes that can be replaced Vettel and Webber never by computer, because they "are not voraussagbare gladiators'.
It took place in two years of its own shops with local distributors offer
Hewlett Packard (took place), inaugurated in Barcelona yesterday his first exclusive shop in collaboration with its partners Ront Reyes.
It is the first one in twenty shops selling existing network with 80 to 100 square metres, which intends to open the multinational in the next two years in Spain.
The company agreed this initiative with the existing 16 sales in Mehrmarkenbetrieb areas, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The deputy director of took place España, Helena Herrero, described as an example the reconstructed, shop at the Gran Vía in Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, cooperates with the took for thirty years.
The North American business group set up by 2010 in Europe 200 outlets, 20 branches in Spain.
The first was last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) inaugurated. Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not betray the next Neueröffnungen, not closed but that could be the next target.
The deputy chairman, who is also head of personnel system, took place, the philosophy of shop opening is always the same. They draw on a local distributors with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American business group, and the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive tangible products). In Europe will be all the same.
It is responsible for the training of the staff took place.
Helena said Herrero, it is not a franchising system and stressed that the exclusive sales network, "the customer service and the advice of small and micro-enterprises when shopping and to optimise the packaging."
The shop in Barcelona has a pioneering pilot program, which took place with technical problems guarantee.
An online service builds a link to technical centre in Maastricht (Netherlands).

Sabadell wants his rivals in three years, a million customers' steal '
The executive board member of Banco Saba Dell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but first rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the war.
Nevertheless, he sees a drop in interest rate spreads, which the banks with increases in fees and try to balance the prices for loans.
Sabadell expected in three years, a million private customers - and still too.
Sabadell has found a way to use the next three years, and to survive in a very difficult economic environment.
The bank will introduce a new Dreijahresleitplan in 2011.
The goal is to not only survive without public aid from the FROB, but also the market share of about a million private customers - 700 000, if you exclude the customers who will lose the bank - to increase. This is the great challenge facing the bank, because until now it has been to their business customers more attention than their retail customers.
This year it has 250 000 retail and 50 000 companies.
Its market share in retail is 3.5 percent, while the business customers more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011 - 2013 business plan is the increase in productivity of austerity, reducing costs. The challenges facing the bank, will present them with annual report.
Only a few banks dare to publish targets and in these difficult times, as the financial crisis all the plans for the banks are in the world.
Sabadell will finish this year, four years ago set the Optima. This was initially to three years, but the market, he was extended by a year.
The customers who will leave the savings banks, are the main objective of the bank.
In an APIE organized breakfast Guardiola, 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with large scale".
The manager believes that Spain would only "slow" out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" in two or three years' work to create "- essential for the survival of the banks.
Even if he assumes that the war for liabilities - punished the interest margins - will abate, the risk premia, the need to pay banks and savings banks for their emissions to obtain liquidity, to offset sagging profit margins are already on the price of loans.
"The liquidity and funding issues are of a structural nature and they will put pressure on the loans."
"We have turned the tap, but the Zinsdifferenziale are very high" Guardiola.
Banesto on Thursday ordering their Filialnetz, the provision of long-term loans and to increase the Zinsdifferenziale (cf. Cinco Díaz between 22 and 27 November).
The managers also acknowledged that the banks have now Stategie, "to increase the fees" but "within a competitive framework".
Sabadells master plan is based on an organic growth, even if the group does not exclude, as always, corporate business.
Not for nothing that he assured that in Spain "are bigger companies."
"In the coming year will change everything" he assured.
He stressed that the need for capital "increasingly fierce" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions in red.
He is of the opinion that the FROB could replace Kaptitalaufstockungen in the money market.
After he assured that Saba Dell can survive a temporary closure of the markets, he refuted the argument of some bankers who predict a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing can get nothing, but unlike the incidents in June, short-term financing on repo transactions and deal with the crisis.
Ceca fills a second wave of mergers of savings banks from
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday dismissed the possibility that there could be a wave of merger savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry will be restructured.
When the concentration of the Spanish savings banks began, there were several savings banks, in the first phase. They held on the second round.
On the other hand, the Director-General of the Spanish savings banks Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, this second round would take place.
"I believe that most of the merger. The inclusion of Cajasol in the group Banca Cívica cannot be considered a second round, it was rather adjustments."
"The biggest part is completed. It may be that we have in place of siebzehen thirteen and fourteen, but all major processes are completed. They were of Banco de España, which has supported all transactions, controlled."
In a group of business leaders and managers Aragoniens (ADEA) organized breakfast Olavarrieta said that the concentration process "as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timetable, which in the past, not now, within the framework of the business plans with Banco de España" he said.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with assets of 17 with an average of 28 000 million per 75 500 million is a historically incomparably process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62%, and they are now much higher, and we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement" he says.
Olavarrieta said, "there are a number unabgebrachter opinions about the slowness of the process, the Unseriösität and absurdity" revealed, because "Banco de España exhorted us to complete on time before the end of the year."
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain is one of Europe's strictest financial systems and "perhaps" around the world "and added that those who anzweifeltenn" without deeper knowledge ".
The manager said that we are in the current economic climate "no worries" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have a "very significant" have undergone concentration, "as quickly as possible".
He also reminded us that the Spanish banks' stress tests, conducted by the ECB in July, had been very well.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has opted for the keeping the EUR, but at the same time, conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tension on the markets have triggered a two-fold response from the government.
On the one hand, has produced José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero new adaptation measures, ranging from tax reductions for small and micro enterprises, the regulation of temporary work agencies or the lifting of the EUR 426 of support for the unemployed, not unemployment benefits, to the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the management of airports and El Prat and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, supports the deputy leader, Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible for the current crisis herausbeschwört.
How to understand these events?
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is no fault of their public relations.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the EUR.
It is Germany a fundamentally new perspective to shape our future, with the maintenance of the old traditions of much of its partners.
In the face of resistance in Europe begins to spekuliern in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first, a strong EUR with Germany, austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south to leave the EUR area.
Second: the reintroduction of the Deutsche Mark - though it sounds like science fiction - supported by a majority of public opinion, approximately 50 percent of the population.
The third: a restructuring of the EUR under German proposals. This means: more macroeconomic control; strict financial management; penalties for countries that exceed the targets; möglichereweise the default of certain countries, as well as the extension of the costs of potential measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been for some time. Therefore, there is now no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission incentives for deficits and the German government came up with a constitutional reform, in order to prevent this from 2016.
It was the first signs of the polarisation between what Germany (strict fiscal plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign, the Central European country, as hinausschob Merkel's decision to rescue Greece.
At that time was heavily criticised. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published opinion totally opposed to a bailout of Greece.
Finally, Merkel in recent days of October with a clear position. It calls for a reform of the European Union, in order to facilitate the rescue of a country and at the same time, the private lenders to pay a portion of the costs.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, since the Ireland crisis and everything.
But their proposal, if somewhat sweetened, was adopted. In the coming months we will be in the reform of the European union, these measures from 2013 to participate.
Germany has drawn a red line, not to exceed.
It says all that - even if It must be taken now unpopular measures - there will be no of this date the functioning of the EUR.
2013 will be the year of birth of a new monetary area, in which the offending countries be severely punished, may be forced to declare itself insolvent and, in this case, the private sector must play a part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we must take a strong growth rate, high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
The alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as she was led by Spain in boom times, will not be tolerated.
The offer is clear.
And we would do poorly, not to understand it.
It is not only about runterzufahren the government deficit by the year 2013 to three percent.
The demands are much tougher.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions, is to cheat ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence in more calm.
And the opportunities that will be offered, And will use the spring of 2013.
It seems that Zapatero, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures yesterday) points out that, despite the criticism of Merkel's hypothesis, to their own house in order, had their way.
But the Germany of red line is there, and it does not seem that would change.
Among the possibilities is that we should leave the countries with little serious cramped EUR area, cannot be ruled out.
In this case could say Germany still, it warned.
Sport and usually bypassing
Tricks like Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventiveness, but not the desire to avoid a sanction.
The alleged by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos), launched in the game of 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League meant that much ink has been spilled about whether it is an unsportliche act or not and whether it should be sanctioned possibly both players by UEFA.
As is well known, the two players lost a few minutes (her team had already clearly) time and played several fouls, so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, would give the Real Madrid and his group, the two players the sanction next League game against the Auxerre meet and without cards in the next phase of the game.
Finally, punished the Disciplinary Committee of the UEFA club's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different sums of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under these or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often in the world of football.
It is so widespread that they are part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this sport followed rules - is.
Part of the debate about the case that a team of football clubs Real Madrid (in his anthem precious courage and honour and on other occasions his players for similar incidents had punished) played the main role, and the proportion of Mourinho, the episode has added a more to its long history as theatralischer and provocative technicians.
In any case, the debate about whether this is not explicitly prohibited by the statutes behaviour contradicts the principles of sport, that is to say whether these acts of circumvention rule. Indeed, this approach to the statutes of the sport, but seem to circumvent its meaning.
In this matter should be examined In the spirit of sport.
The sporting spirit defended the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect that was not threatened by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the offending players an unfair advantage from the opposing team. That did not happen.
The paradox is the act of players of Real Madrid, that they do not correspond to what we normally under false game or rule, because the way in which the rule was not secretly, in order to avoid a penalty, but they should be as visible as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee.
The players and the sanction happily.
Another question is, what kind of advantage the offender from the deliberate fouls.
It should be emphasised that the rival in a disadvantageous position were still erheischt advantages for the feigned game, was the obvious result of this action was that their team played out with fewer players.
It is also an useful strategy for the next game, because the club is not about these players.
The advantage is that the player the next phase of the Champions League without cards, which could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, up to a certain degree of uncertainty, which could leave the team at some point. Moreover, the players with this approach a sanction and go in the second cycle of cards, the accumulation of cards with a card less than in the first cycle.
It is not clear whether it really is an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices against the spirit of sport, including strategic decisions, in order to derive maximum benefit from the regulations.
In this case the players wanted no sanction (that would be a clear case of circumvention rule), they wanted more, when they do this.
They took a strategic decision, without a penalty or to flee before her.
Although the border between imagination and regulatory environment, I believe that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: because there are two exclusions and because of the nature of the Regelübertragung provoked.
The damage was caused to the principles of sport through these actions, is less ethical than aesthetic.
Angebotoffensive customers fishing for groups Christmas dinner in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar this year an avalanche of reservations on days 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves. They do not want to spend more than EUR 20 to 30.

Since 2008, when the bad times, many companies have stopped the groups dinner for budgetary reasons.
In order not to abandon this tradition, pay for many workers from their own pockets.
As the economy, it calls for the lowest prices, chairman of the restaurant body of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the umbrella group dares predict not until now, how will the holidays this month.
"The people consider it dozens of times before."
"They want to, but they pay much attention to the prices" he said.
The business is doing well, "the quality at good prices, with a good service" he added, and reminded us that save customers in times of crisis, which is why prices at 25 EUR.
According to a survey in various central restaurants it turns out that the evening of 17 Dezembers leads the supplier to collapse.
The group says Soteras, the demand for this Friday, with the intention to spend less than 30 EUR, are booming. The group has adapted its menus with Komplettangeboten between 25 and 35 EUR to the economic situation.
In another political group, Andilana, which has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, la Fonda and others), the uniqueness of the calendar to early bookings, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to last year's prices with meals for every taste from 19.95 to 30 EUR" he says.
In AN Grup, El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 stations, you lose the optimism that once since the second quarter of the revenue to flourish and good, albeit in a few days prospects looked for the Christmas season.
Sources of the group, that the 18th a überaktiver day with groups of friends, the Christmas vorfeiern, will be.
The six groups now there was a Christmas menu for 30 EUR or more than price hit. One has the impression that the customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than the previous year and in return for more details, such as cava.
Some firms see green shoots are growing, and the employees will be invited. This gives the impression that the groups which are on the upswing again.
The umbrella organisation Fecasarm (with mergers such as pubs, restaurants and leisure, Barcelona), the deputy chairman, Enric Gomà, to see the end of the tunnel and noted that the reservations generally "lively", although the customers' wangled a maximum ".
But the celebration was not decreased, regardless of who pays the fun.

The Internet portal Wikileaks revealed the contents of the correspondence between the U.S. embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department confirmed the enormous concern to Pakistan's nuclear program Washington.
On the fringes of clarifying and juicy details, the documents on the content of the talks and the mindset of the accredited American diplomats in Islamabad, reveal that will strengthen the cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear safety, but on the contrary, ", and that the unstable Asian country more nuclear weapons" to Rhytmus faster than any other country ".
In particular, the nature of the Pakistani nuclear program - that is not the weapons are stored, but its individual parts, in order to make it more difficult for a possible attack their destruction - put Washington sleepless nights.
The risks include the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne w. Patterson, in a report before the visit by the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones, said: "the proximity of some nuclear plants under attack by the Taliban, the presumptive scattered nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material."
The large number of people who are in the nuclear arsenals and missile programmes, not only by the United States, but also by Russia as over-burdensome and reason for caution, considered.
"Pakistan must strictly gläubiges staff to take care of nuclear installations, due to the low educational and cultural extremist organisations more opportunities for people who are involved in nuclear or missile programmes to reklutieren" said the expert Yuri Korolev by the Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with his North American counterparts. NONE.
What is new is the by Julian Assanges Internet portal suicide-bombing documentation that the cooperation between the U.S. and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation and the increased pace, in which Pakistan nuclear weapons.
In May, from an office of the message that the communication with Pakistan as "frustrating" explains: "often there is no transparency; the assistance we received no answers or they will be rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, officials of the state intelligence service for South Asia that produces "despite the economic disaster Pakistan nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country."
The Ambassador Patterson has asked Washington during a visit to the top army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, who is "clear" that "Pakistan's army his tacit and encouraging development of terrorist groups."
In the pursuit of Wikileaks chief
Obama appoints a heavy responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight to prevent new revelations.
Interpol is a red warning and detect Assange.
Everything with Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, who is a complicated maze, in which to investigate the facts only difficult.
Yesterday Interpol "red alert" to "detect and pursue" of Assange.
But it is not a traditional orders to arrest.
In addition, it is not new, it dates from 20 november.
It has nothing to do with the recent revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the allegations of sexual abuse, which must face the Australians in Sweden.
Also assured the lawyer of the founder of WikiLeaks, Mark Stephens, "the police know where and how they are in contact with Mr Assange."
On 20, the international police agency based in Lyon (France) at the request of the order, but it was not until yesterday after receiving the power by the Swedish authorities.
That is the case. The 188 Interpol countries need to identify and locate Assange, "in order to provisionally arrest and extradite him."
Although Interpol arrest of a red warning affected individuals, many member countries according to the organization's red warning as a licence for an Arrestierung - must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreements, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange probably.
The move outraged Assanges lawyers who yesterday published a letter in which they were informed that the 39 - year-old founder of Wikileaks prepared by video conference to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange's exit from Sweden and requested by the prosecutor, with the sagenumwobenen Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the security chief of Stalin, "authorization.
"This is like a hunting, not as a legal persecution", in the letter.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother of Australia from the innocence of their son - Assange himself in an location, but not in silence.
On Monday he was the head of Time magazine by Skype from an unspecified location for an interview. The conversation he requested the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the United states.
"If it can be proved that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to the u. n. to spy on and did not breach of the United States signed international agreements, should resign" he said.
His opinion was yesterday from the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, condemned the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd."
"I am not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website" he told the CNN.
Obama himself has a heavy responsibility for the fight against terrorism, Rusell Travers, tasked with preventing new documents revelations.
The attempt by the spokesman of the Präsidenden Barack Obama, Assange to pay less attention, contrary to the opinions, the conservative politicians and commentators in recent days.
Congressman Peter king, the January chaired the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives, has asked the State Department to investigate the possibility of Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organisations, "in order to seize their money and everyone who supports or contributes to follow."
Tom Flanagan, adviser to the Canadian Minister Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had his statement that Assange "murdered" revoked.
"Obama should it into a target and not use a manned aircraft or what."
Anyone who was not apologized, Mike Huckabee, baptistischer minister, a former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was, in the government information leaked, he is guilty of treason and everything that no execution, is eiine too lenient punishment" he told the broadcaster Fox.
Puigcercós with a nod to the Carod close peace in the ERC
The Republican leader of the party a secret ballot on his continuance in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the General Assembly.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for the umpteenth time an internal rebellion in the ranks of the following the loss of 11 Members and half the votes rudderless ERC.
The party chairman is aware that his resignation to the shoulders of the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod Rovira. But he also knows that weakened the influence of this sector today as her mentor, and he will not bring the same headaches, like other former currents.
Therefore, trying to win the leader of Esquerre with a nod to the new critics, which would secure his position until the next local elections.
For the early announced yesterday that could make the 200 regional members of ERC about his stay in office.
With ballot papers, not with superior.
If the Carodisten the Präsidenen a parking ticket, could they do this without fear of reprisals.
Indeed, the head of both the impression of division, as the submission to his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would not feel with half of the votes plus one, and he added without giving any percentage values, an outcome "In Bulgarian style" would not be good.
The Carod close call by the president, more than just the party office. Gesture, since Puigcercós controlled the supreme body of the congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to further resignations, be it with the board of a policy plan from now until May.
They expect that, in the drafting of the document on strategic direction that the leadership in 18. will be put to the Council, to be able to take part.
Its intention is to underwrite Puigcercós. In return, this promise to bring the Congress in the autumn of 2011, what does the party leader for a fact.
The leader of the ERC is of the opinion that the "Polyphonie" pity the stability and he wants an once and for all, to bring the organization to wash their dirty linen behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article, signed the Conseller Josep Huguet in his blog, symptomatic.
Given the Puigcercós an ideologue, is the holder of Innovació it for a fact that the party chairman "in exchange for various objectives".
He was one of five, two of them.
Firstly, the "restructuring" of the board, so that at least 90 percent of party members that the inclusion of new faces from Carods environment.
The second could be The big news.
Huguet proposes, ERC should abandon the General Assembly principle as the operation.
The verfechtet a reform of the regulations, which should enable the congresses of elected delegates.
By the end of the General Assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - is Puigcercós' team, which has been in the last two conferences, obsessively.
Indeed, on the bebenden Assembly of 2008 the party leadership with the review of the General Assembly at a Congress that should with the reform of the statutes, charged.
This date is yet to come, because infogle was not the internal Aufruhe of recent years tackling this issue.
Now, without the critical sectors are on the lookout, could be the time has come to this matter once and for all.

Such a blockade, which was announced at the 42 Republican senators signed a letter, could affect the vote of the Dream Act - legislation and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
On the blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, said the presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs, he is confident that, if resolved the tax issue, could be a timetable for the rest of the projects.

With literature painful

Finally, after a frustrating rapprochement with the clinical trauma theorists, and it is in the middle of the respiratory raubte, but that is not a scientific term, enthült the psychoanalyst resorts to the mystery: "the wound is really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the narrative includes sighs of relief and that she "learned from the wound that this truly open and does not exist". But it is convinced that the language and their traps.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguans Sergio Ramírez was also an entzückende narrative in which he praised "the invention called, and not in the hands of the wound, but will be discovered.
With allusions to the magical realism he tells of a famed sorceress who touched the clouds, brought far men travelled or by a girl lost virtue. The narrative made an U-turn and reported from America, the great novel, which was not on his own singing, and he cited Bernal Díaz del Castillo, the abundance of the Eroberen told stories.
"Cervantes, all of us (the writer), saved from the false witnesses who appeared in the true stories, but in other ways would have been the story of America never - with imagination, the lost the shame."
However, he stresses, "the madman and liar who imagine things best", and closer to reality and lie, where we no longer know which side is part of the narrative, where the fictitious literature reached the summit.

The evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution is also "the finger of the writer in the wound of the writer" hevorhob.
He said that in a fast-moving world of the intellectual habits and the control of the consciousness of dogma, forgotten and that "behind every confirmation of a small no and behind every denial of a small yes."
"In our thoughts and the fact that we must qualify: Nuancieren is often to put our finger on the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable, if they are in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in ready-made ideas without nuances, harassing and powerful men who prefer the world in black and white said he and invited to rediscover a sense of the letter.

Rubén had two Endspiele with the Diablos presented and Monterrey, his great rival, lost.

"I would like to be champion, I do not want to statistics, this is a club, for my affection, I hingebe, and that is why the title to me, but what has happened before, is the most important thing" commented the tax man, when asked about the lost Endspiele.

To know that could be decided this series by a penalty shootout, not trouble him, because he trusts his players: "You will never misery, we would like to finish in the regular season game, but sometimes there is no alternative, and we must be prepared, in the previous tour, but unfortunately we were prepared over the fate of a bad game, sometimes as a result of nervousness or the intense desire to keep the title in the hands of the left us something for the final, and we hope that it will not happen this time."
It is in Romanso power, not only the second champion and cost for the first time the glory, the title.

"I am strongly against this Charter."

The new unit will take place no unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a new unit, the fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest many observers continue to call for the creation of a public inquiry on the subject.
Robert Dutil, minister of public security, said that this idea come not from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted last january, the New York Department of Investigation on this issue.
The metropolis has since 1870 on a stand-alone unit against corruption.
However, the announcement Wednesday has surprised more than just one.
It must be said that this measure at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebecer police service was discussed on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutils.
It was not that Stéphane mountains Ron, critics and member of the Parti Québécois, this announcement in terms of public safety, "gezaubertes rabbits from the hat" and'will gebastelte solution "qualified.

"You will see the result, if we are announcing" confined to confirm it.
"We are aware of this problem."
According to Réjean'parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the implementation of a public opinion poll.
"The more m. Charest insisted, to prevent the formation of this Committee of inquiry, the more the people like you and I think that he has something to hide" he said.
"The only way to be able to form a committee of inquiry, the resignation of Mr Charest" said Yves Bois Mad, lecturer in ethics and policy systems at the ENA (staatl. 'training high administrative officer).
In order to escape from this impasse, he proposes to Quebec, the audit control a specific mandate, so that we can make this about corruption and collusion appropriate.
"We should be able to extend the mandate of the audit control" he decided.
He takes the view that could give the Quebec of audit control the same power as Commissioners, which would allow people to testify.
The formation of an unity is not the only project in the drawers of the government Charest.
The Quebec will replace in Ottawa, the criminal law, in order to be better adjusted to this type of crime.

Nacereddine Zemmal, Montreal Algerian origin, has taken a very special approach.
The athlete, "Sanda" (full contact Kung Fu), excelled in boxing and boost the Thai boxing, is now in the search for new challenges to the Tatami and Boxringe in the world.
"I started 12 years ago in Algeria with combat sports such as Kung Fu and boost boxing started" said Zemmal since 2008 in the metropolis, in order to develop among the professionals.
Personally, I am the fight everywhere, as for those who fight the soil, presenting him as the joint fight arts, do not like, competitions are scarce in North America. "
Recently gave the as a security officer, and the company UPS employed his rivals bad news, in which he in between 23 and 30 October in Edinburgh, scotland, World Cup, highlight the amateurs two gold medals from the World Karate and boost Boxing Association (WKA).
"I have scored a victory in the categories of full contact Kickboxens and Thaiboxens won" he said.

450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro Quebec has approved by mutual agreement project planning firms $450 million in contracts for the hydroelectric project Eastmain- 1 A Sarcelle Rupert.
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium consisting of the firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, the most important, namely the management of the project, has received a total of $295 million without tender.
The consortium, called "gérance Énergie", was 2004 as a corollary of the decision of Hydro Quebec, the private sector accountability, this important to entrust hydroelectric project amounting to a sum of $5 billion, formed.
In early 2005, earned the consortium "gérance Énergie" the lucrative contract, without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois is resorting to business consortia a serious ethical problem, raising the risk of Wettbewerbsverdrändung and a price increase.
"This is a new way to a conspiracy and refuted the competition."
"This means that instead fixes rather than on the way to open in form" said yesterday Sylvain Simard, member of the PQ, at the press conference.
Early in the morning Simard had raised the issue before the National Assembly, because it seems hard to understand how the public's interest in this way.
Ressourcenministerin Nathalie Normandeau had reacted in the afternoon, when they vehemently deny that this treaty is a stitch-up.
"I remain faithful to my line" lashed out, they confirmed that the PQ "dishonest" and "lack of rigour".
She said that it was "the least" that the PQ apologize.
The model of the consortium is common practice.
It is usually a time such temporary alliance, which allows two or more companies to pool their expertise on a requirement on a tender for a complex project.
The project "East Main" has a high level of complexity with regard to his work.
The construction is under way and should be drawn up until 2012.
However, was awarded the contract without a competition could take place; it had already negotiations.
Furthermore, the model of the consortium in Quebec, with relatively simple projects no longer an exception.
As the newspaper Le Devoir "last week has pointed out, is the model used in the field of civil engineer and advisory services of the consortium of government investigations.
A brief overflying the Quebecer company register allows more than 200 consortia, which appear to be some of steady.
In this way, for example, the company Dessau in partnership with the majority of its key competitors, including CIMA +, Génivar, SNC lava Lin or include Roche and Tecsult, together.
Any link, and there are several dozen, at one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
What the consortium "gérance Énergie", Minister Normandeau that "is subject to the territory of the Baie James a special workforce dynamics and that Hydro Quebec this fact since the 70 s in a particular way '.
Réal Laporte, the major employers of the Société d énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement, which has be turning up their nose on the fact that the Treaty on the project after agreement was approved.
"If you are an invitation to tender, and there are few candidates, will your prices soar."
"You have two options: either you do the people who find themselves in this, and you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea is that the price is crucial, but the expertise of the people" said Laporte.
The consortium "Énergie gérance" approved contract is part of a long list of more than 50.000 of the Parti Québécois received $.
The contracts were either approved by the Hydro Quebec or the SEBJ for the project Eastmain- 1 A Sarcelle Rupert.
After reviewing the newspaper "Le Devoir" more than 100 engineering and consultancy contracts, the companies or their branches, including in particular resources granted to laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC lava Lin had tightened up 22 contracts per se, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without the participation of "Énergie gérance" counting.
All these contracts are negotiated.
They amount in total to 449 783, including the contract with "gérance Énergie" over 295 131 $564.
Sylvain Simard had indicated that the four firms, which make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) the "libéral Parti du Quebec well known".
Minister Normandeau had let it be known that the PQ is also associated with the firms that they "funded" before they clarified that it was their executives.
Barometers verantworungsbewußten consumption - the "green" label is not confidence-inspiring
Green, but frankly sceptical.
The Quebecer consumer has little confidence among the main actors of sustainable growth, however, to the unmarked stamps or the environmental labelling, which his election.
A pity, although basking in an universe where media-oriented abound of information for responsible consumption only: the barometer of responsible consumption has to complain about a lack of credible information, the brake sorts out his commitment, as the first reading, which was held yesterday.
Although they have promoted the use of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, the Quebecer yet those who try to sell it to pay little credit.
Two thirds of the population Quebecer admits, in fact, the commitment of the company, as the green corporate advertising, so does the responsible consumer Centre at the University of Sherbrooke sophisticated measuring instrument.
Another fact: half of consumers is casting doubt on the credibility of the official, the supposedly fair products attached certificates, but also the credibility of the products and brands, as environmentally aware, the barometer.
Following the same pattern is the discourse of politicians on the subject of only 14.6% of the Quebecer population.
The information about responsible consumption appears, however, important to stimulate this consumer segment, which is now being revived by nearly one third of the Quebecer consumers.
In fact, viewed as dampening emptiness and dubious nature of the information the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second after the higher price of the products, the barometer identified brakes.
In addition, a third of the Quebecer indicated the performance of green products and services, which to them is trying to suspicious.
According to a different communication had already changed more than half of consumers in 2010 changed their habits and brand of one or more products, in order to give their conviction.
According to Eurobarometer had preferred it to 61% purchases of dealers in their neighbourhood and the purchase of food grown in their region.
Green and responsible - the index of ecological consumption had reached this year, 64 of the maximum value of 100 - the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to present itself as the king of recycling, which is trying to reduce its traces in the environment, he cares about animal welfare.
But the social and environmental awareness seems to be still in his car, so the barometer: just 28% of the Quebecer have indicated that in 2010, public transport or the Mitfahrzentrale to demonstrate their environmental interest.
Walking and cycling were also 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey, which keeps the stereotypes.
Bond for the takeover of eXcentris
The Quebecer government, the Société Angus and the Parallèle companies to participate financially in the eXcentris cinema complex, with a cooperation agreement, but only in the form of a competitive loan.
The developers society Angus and the company Parallèle, who had hoped for a donation of about seven million $s by the Ministry of Culture Daniel Langlois, eXcentris cinema complex on the Boulevard Saint Laurent, to get these back its cineastischen function, not what they have demanded.
The government has accepted to involve itself in this matter, but on their own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation offers the Quebecer government bond in lower than initially expected, which could create a viable solution to advantageous conditions, at least according to the state of the scaremongers entnehmbaren sources.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected last spring from Quebec, the Bittgesuch has been corrected since the revised downwards.
A proposal, together with an action plan were already by the President of the "Société de développement entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, sent to the St Pierre, the acts eXcentris.
Several days ago, he had a final technical report.
The proposal of the cabinet was sent to the SODEC, on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December to respond to this.
In any case, the premise of the Heads of State donation really seems to have been pushed aside.
Let us remember that had made the Quebecer owners community of cinemas and cinema complexes against a direct government investment to support the adoption of eXcentris by made the argument that the Culture Ministers have to provide financial aid for real estate projects, which also have other cinema.
Several other market participants segment, however, by contrast, substantial economic assistance.
Kinochef Daniel Langlois had after the self-financed cinemas over ten years with great difficulty, the authors cinema in the premises of his cinema complex, which could justify the exception from the treasury.
The lack of cinema, the independent films in Montreal, is more than obvious, and eXcentris knew to keep its clientele.
The Société Angus and the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top, a privately financed campaign in which they hoped for a sum of $700 000, in order to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one screen to show films in eXcentris, Le Parallèle.
The aim of the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the demonstration of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "hommes et des dieux'to reopen.
Christian Yaccarini but has the newspaper "Le Devoir", and it ignores what he and his group of the enviable proposals, which has made them.
The secret of komplexgeschüttelten Canada lifted
The new, American diplomats, which have been disseminated by wikileaks, reveal the mystery about what the United Nations under the Minderwertigkeitskomplex the Canadians to the Americans, but at the same time the latter to Canada.
Consequently, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voters to the ballot kanadisch American relations, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the conservative government to enforce its budget by 2009.
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, the public were told yesterday, offer more juicy details of the substantive content, a very bad.
One of 22 September 2008 carved, i. e. in the period in which the federal Wahlkampage in full swing, reported, which do not join the United Nations more of their political leaders.
The great surprise of David Wilkins, in Ottawa, the American ambassador.
Mr Wilkins offers various channels this situation.
"The Canadians almost economic slowdown Minderwertigkeitskomplex led the Canadian, political leaders have much to talk about the issues of everyday life, as the United States in this election the buck (as happened during the 1988 campaign on free trade)" he says.
The United Nations, he concludes, is "The proverbial Goliath this election: omnipresent, but potentially threatening to speak of him".
The ambassador understands the "deafening silence" the less, since the two countries have close political and economic relations.
"Logically", he said, "should be the ability of a candidate, party and much more of a party leaders to run such a vital relationship, which has the voters at the polls as a key factor in the sense."
The other, this sense of importance is in on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, broadcast communication, to prepare the President Barack Obama on his first visit to Ottawa.
"Their trip will help the government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget at the beginning of February, which will give Canada its first deficit after more than a decade, on the basis of a recovery program in the $30 to $40 billion" Breese.
Nowhere he had mentioned that the government had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas, in order to ensure that Parliament would throw the coalition of opposition parties and would have an impact on the quality of the proposed recovery programme.
Further, in January 2008 and carved from the ambassador Wilkins written communication Washington from the increasingly negative image that the broadcast on CBC, dramatic series in the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about how Border, calls Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "no-fly list" can watch or payments for the purposes of Muskelprotze of CIA interrogations.
Yet another communication reported at length about how Hillary Clinton with her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at their first bilateral meeting on whether Europe is prepared to accept some detainees from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered the question, however, on the basis of an individual "case-by-case" decision.
Àm end of the meeting, described as ", he has given the state secretary a paper on Khadr Omar, a 15 - year-old Muslim Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has pledged to look through the acts again."
Finally, we note that the mood on the Web site WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very closely related adviser on CBC, said that the person responsible for this massive leak "should be killed".
He had talked to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
A Global plan to renew the lighting

This ambitious plan adopted its position in the steps of major projects, which hopes to implement the u. n. in Cancun, in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments by developed countries.
After yesterday's plan would be the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the lighting of the earth, CFCs, if the weißglühenden pears, which has a monopoly of between 50 to 70% of the market, by fluoreszierende or, better still, replaced by light-emitting diodes (LED).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of global vehicle fleets.
In Copenhagen last year, the big emitters like the United States, china, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans, which should lower the global CFC emissions from 53 to 49 Gt.
This review should, however, still 5 Gt to stabilize from today until 2020 climate increase of 2 degrees Celsius, in order to prevent this out of control.
In the weißglühenden pears are like 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reduced energy consumption by 75%, with the new LED bulbs this reduced energy demand once again.
The Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen keep on average between 6000 to 10.000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those expressed by the manufacturer Philips this week on the market, the company has also participated in the u. n. study - have a life expectancy of 25.000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a weißglühende pear, a suggestion the savings of the replacement plan, which should be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that iese completely new light bulbs very little heat, they can work with a set of resistance.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several experts have pointed out that Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reserves, because they contain mercury, and that they must dispose of it as a hazardous waste dump, which is not always possible in the developing world, except the producers are an adoption agency.
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, however, the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit more mercury to produce the weißglühenden pears wasted electricity.
In the United States alone, these coal plants 25.000 tons of mercury annually.
The report sets out in detail the profits, which each country thanks to this international program.
Indonesia, for example, a billion $s a year in the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power stations, whose edification Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion.

Affair even Reiss: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its mediating role for Syria
In more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of even Reiss, a young French researcher who in Iran for "espionage" was detained, the French public gasping for breath, the diplomacy in alert and focused the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the attentive eyes of diplomats from the United States.
The WikiLeaks and obtained by the newspaper Le Monde durchgesehenen American documents give some background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée the Americans his strategy, which went as far as this advice for dealing with their own crisis of "hostage-taking" in Iran (a small group of Wanderern).
They show how the French authorities have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young Frenchwoman the release of Majid Kakavand, have an in France, and by the American justice due to trade with material in favor of the Iranian nuclear program Iraners wanted to Gegeleistung.
Finally, it is the way in which the French Presidency has tried to manipulate the media to make this the idea that the Syrian President Bashar Al Assad have played a central role in the liberation of even husk rice, in a harsh light.
In truth, he had done nothing in this regard.
An on 12 August 2009 in Paris redigiertes diplomatic telegram entitled "iran: French comments on the way of dealing with hijackings."
François Richier, Elysée adviser strategy, accompanied by reason Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They said the French method.
The advised The Americans to do everything from sending their own nationals who were forcibly detained in Iran.
"Noise", they said, "is loud and clear" the words' basic human rights, "innocence", "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary in order to bring the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"This is all the more so, since you ask the Iranians not to do so."
Because "silence solves nothing" over the discussion about attempts to unauffälligem routes, the Iranians are "masters in time-wasting tactics".
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners a "normal" Iranian tactic: "hostage to political blackmail".
He announced the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (on 16 August, on the day they take refuge in the French Embassy) "demand the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians' (230.000 EUR bail).
And he said, the Elysée am anticipating further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that "will become even more acute."
The Iranians could "in the near future, another of the roughly 1.800 French citizens who live in Iran" he said.
28 August 2009.
Even Reiss is twelve days ago, will continue to have been released from prison in Iran.
The information was circulated: the Iranians Majid Kakavand, whose extradition to the United States due to illegal trade in empfindlichem electronics materials to Iran, has been sacked after the decision of a judge in Paris.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, questions on this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, the illegal Iranian networks of the nuclear programme material, the release of Majid Khakavand bad news.
France has taken a horse-trading?
The liberation of the Iraners against the French?
During a meeting with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assured that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, not only was "completely surprised by the decision of the judge", but have also tried, guts.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision" he says.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remain under "strict" supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée adviser chooses a telephone number, then informed the American diplomat, the Iranians "are currently in the chair of the Iranian embassy buildings in Paris."
While not without damaging the detention of even Reiss in Iran spares the Elysée his efforts, through statements and by the media, "flight testing" believe that the Syrian President Bashar Al Assad playing a "significant" and "influential intermediary role".
The Americans are watching this activity is not without irony and that the manipulation, as several press articles in the official French version.
A 25th of August 2009 datierendes telegram "the media, the French authorities'.
Why there was so much "expression of thanks to Mr Assad, the Paris embassy.
"Despite their declarations of Lobpreis, the French authorities that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians".
The document also deals with the reasons that have brought the Elysée to indulge this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "aims to confirm Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria" he analysed.
A 2008 policy, which was "was perceived by many critics votes in France and abroad as premature and undeserved."
"The Syrian role aufbauschend" Paris "to Syria, can achieve what we laud by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "discord between Syria and Iran."
The American Embassy know from good source.
On 11 August, François Richier her, "of course we do not know whether the Syrians whatever".
"But we have with them."
"This should at least confusion on the part of the Iranians".
Even Reiss, on 16 May 2010 in France.
Nicolas Sarkozy in the Elysée.
In a communiqué would like to thank the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role for the release of our compatriot."
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law, known as the'cinderella', that it will ban the youngsters to play after midnight online Games, by giving them access to the officials.
A draft law, the online gaming operators, young people under the age of 16 after midnight to deny access to these games, will be presented to Parliament in December, painted representatives of education and family ministries.
"Many children play Games all night long and then have difficulties with learning in school and also to lead a normal life during the day."
"We are of the opinion that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep on it" said Jo Rin, with this bill betrauter ministry, the French news agency Agence France presse.
The online Games were then again from 6 o'clock in The morning.
The companies had a year's time to prepare for the application of the law, he clarified.
The government fasser equally, to ask the manufacturer, the daily for access to these Games time limit those young people whose parents to ask, the officials added.
Those who want it, it will Gratisprogramme that make it possible to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "wired" countries, and the newspapers regularly report by different, with intensive use of events.
The country is also undisputed champion in global online Game competitions.
In November, South Korea with 58 other nations won four gold medals In the World Cyber Games.
World Cup 2018 - 2022: FIFA appoints the host country
In a corruption suspect appoints the executive committee of FIFA on Thursday the host countries in the world championships in 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice, in which the Rangeln for influence and threaten to push the lobbying the technical criteria in the background.
One thing is certain: the 2018 edition of the grasp of the FIFA will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold, (the 4 candidates: England, russia, spain, Portugal, Netherlands, belgium).
The 2022 edition will be something exotic; hopes the International Football Federation, after the premiere on the African continent in 2010 new countries (Australia, Qatar) win for himself, or its subsidiary in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea) to pursue.
The list of personalities, the delegation of (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Prime Minister, Zidane, Beck ham, Cruyff) is the degree of economic and political use of the World cup.
The machinations behind the scenes are threatening to stop until the last minute.
Otherwise difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
After the evaluation report of FIFA, the English, Spanish, Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts bessseren arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be for the 22 members of the Exekutifkommitees the election so important.
The Sunday Times, with the establishment of the suspension of two members of the Exekutifkommitees (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the revelations, might as well as opportunities for their own country, cradle of football, can ruin, which only once the World Cup, in 1966.
The BBC asked the breeding ground again on Monday, a documentary broadcast report, the three senior members of the Kommitees, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou under fire.
Reason enough to upset the FIFA and the English authorities, which had operated primarily with David Cameron in the last few weeks of intensive lobbying.
The government hopes for a repeat of his predecessor Tony Blair successful chess train, which was made in 2005 for London, the organisation of the Olympic Games in 2012.
This would be sufficient intensive use, in order to enhance the image of England before the Committee again?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain Portugal does not lack assets with its already finished stadiums, his expertise (82 World Cup in Spain, the Olympic Games in Barcelona in 92, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and his football culture.
But the economic and financial dark side of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, the chances of russia, which despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport) has become the weighty outsiders, increase.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided, however, the unumwundenen hint at the Bezichtigungen the English press "unfair competition in the run-up to the vote" denounced by the Committee members.
"They bewirft with dirt, trying to embarrass them" Putin lashed out.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seem to be the logical favourites.
First world economic power, FIFA headquarters of the main sponsors, the country seems a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have drawn up a very good project.
But these new nominations seem premature for two countries that had co-organised the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the FIFA long-expected awarding the 2026 World Cup in China, the Asian opportunities to 2022 lapses.
With Australia and Qatar, With the leaders futuristischer stadiums had pulled out all the stops, FIFA to pursue its expansion into new areas, however, these two countries a greater risk because certainty.
Australia might as well as Japan and South Korea among the European countries akquittierten weakness of television rights (due to the time difference), the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: the intensifies
De Gaulle had clipped.
Mitterrand had to believe that he stutze.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed not the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than that.
A mandate in the Elysée, the next.
The current head of state will be so candidate in 2012.
But the intensifies the side of the Mysteriums, with the presidential function, not good.
So we have to do So, as if the doubts.
In one, as well as in the other direction.
2006, Jacques Chirac, a third mandate is not excluded, without believing themselves.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy in a severe manders, his decision "at some point in the autumn of 2011".
He on Tuesday evening in the Elysée before the UMP parliamentarians of "two mandates" would, therefore, had spread a little Fieberhaftigkeit.
This was the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The President was simply remind you that the constitution of 2008, the number of five-year terms to just two.
He made a statement that no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentioned the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have the worst case, seven and a half years with me, or at best" he told them in July 2009.
In a May 2010: "do not think that I do not think about the stage."
His words of yesteryear make him more candidates than the previous day, but no less.
They Should comments, then from a double.
The acceleration of the Wettlaufes the candidacy with the PS on one side.
But it is not the start of the competition with Ségolène Royal, Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal themselves.
On the contrary, it is obvious his candidacy in 2012, many members of the PS earlier than to the challenge.
The bad opinion polls on the other side.
For the first time the voters of a candidacy by François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to survey the BVA L Express).
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions with the UMP" responded immediately and cautious in the context of the Prime Minister.
"If he would be a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate" said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe they can win" corrected, Alain Juppé, who has gone along with the intensifies.
Euro: the ECB is forced to retain their purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB last year should provide an opportunity to show how exiting from the crisis, or at least the layout of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures, the end of the year to its conclusion.
The crisis of European government debt obligation, the Central Bank in Frankfurt cannot afford no doubt, even today, more than tense situation in the European bond markets, not to cause the deterioration.
The political costs would be far too high.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said yesterday at a press conference held by the ECB, active role for the state budget debt welcomes.
It has not dared to say whether they believe that the central bank could do more, for example, by boosting its programme of purchases of government bonds.
"I reserve my reasons for my European trading partner (.)".
Jean Claude Trichet, President of the ECB had the previous day in Brussels during his hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament is not very eloquently about his project, but rather to point out that the programme of purchases of government securities on the secondary market "dismal" and that we in the Assembly on Thursday "to see how the decisions".
The only certainty is that the ECB will keep its main interest rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB's bond purchases the treasure chamber last week doubled to around 1.35 billion EUR.
According to leaks and some traders yesterday new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government securities.
Overall, the central banks of the Eurosystem since May 2010 purchases of 67 billion.
Among the dealers will be questioned the anticipation of a further implementing the purchase price in any way (see page 29).
The economists expect no significant change.
If the bonds of over three months from the arsenal of the ecb, will be the full cash reserves to freigiebige type, over a period of a week for up to three months.
The economists are bracing themselves today that this measure will extend for some months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will amend its programme on essential nature".
"Otherwise, they run the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term" Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"For the first quarter of 2011, progressive withdrawal seems more likely" anticipates, Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In its intervention in the market for government debt, "the ECB should aufrechthalten such a purchase volume of bonds, which revived the sluggish market" adds Norbert Bräms added.
In view of the relevance of the exposure of European banks on the markets of the national debt in the EUR zone, the central bank has no other choice than to maintain their presence in the market.
"They must at any price to the Steller investors to enter the market and act as the premature enthusiasm about the weakest states paid to prevent returns" Mugabe yesterday an important bond holders.
Because if interest rates are soaring, would prevent the states even more, to reduce their debt or to stabilize.
This is the price for the protection of the EUR.
The Berlusconi government in Italy in.
After a disturbing the start of the, the situation for Italy yesterday with the decline of Eckzinsen somewhat eased to 10 years.
A return to the deceptive.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs, the regional chairman Giulio Tremonti, the situation as "unentzifferbar" qualify him with a "unpredictable" weekend, expect to hear what they have, however, immediately denied.
On Tuesday, however, the gap with the German interest rates his record of 210 basis points, and the prices of contracts to cover the bankruptcy risk had risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain Kopflosigkeit in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out in his Council of Ministers that the discrepancy of Spain to the German interest rates by 400 basis points.
His right hand, Gianni letta, had "seriously concerned" by the "market turbulence" and a possible risk of contagion from the direction of Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the EUR zone, is not as Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy and Portugal" said Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In other words, the problem is the absence of economic growth and the attendant, schwindsüchtigen tax receipts, the state is In danger of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
The future, an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and by 1.4% in 2012. Even before the Senate for consideration this budget with 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, calculated as the EU Commission, will make up the budget deficit next year to 4.3% of GDP (contrary to the governments of the predicted 3.9%) and 3.5% in 2012 (2.7%).
Therefore a new budget, which could be used after the holidays to a sum of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, must be adopted new austerity measures" said auditors Olli Rehn.
Now Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are settled, we already have for a long time" said Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustees of the International Monetary fund, the IMF is entrusted with Italy.
"At the moment there are no problems, not on short-term or long-term view because of Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, a. r.) calls for lower stabilisation progress than from other countries" observed Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
The question remains as to the political Unstetigkeit.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure of the Chamber of deputies, as the elections at the end of March.
It is therefore a little good period for a decision on a serious crisis.
Europeans think about the development of the crisis-management measures
Christine Lagarde stressed it yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "i believe that it has on Sunday afternoon and evening: The Europeans think clearly, are ready and committed to its currency and to defend its currency area".
Although completely relatively - the withdrawal yesterday in the interest of European government bonds was grist to the mill of governments and the ECB.
From the beginning, however, is not.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's has announced that it will be the debt of Portugal, the most effective target of speculators nowadays, lower.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, particularly on the banking systems" the economists of the Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, given that "the political time passes much slower than the markets".
The European countries, both this gap and the danger that, are well aware, intensify the discussions to strengthen the existing crisis-management measures.
The informal discussions between the most directly affected by finance ministers and, with their counterparts of the G20 is progressing well.
And in terms of the Groupe and Ecofin early next week.
The ECB meets today.
The plan is the lot of unconventional measures aimed at stiffening the resolve of the countries in the EUR zone in the crosshairs of markets (see below).
As the EU Stability Fund, has begun its Executive Director Klaus Regling, on Tuesday in Singapour his Asia tour to inform investors in the Far East on the developments with regard to the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of his visit to express fund-raising, as he put it on the ground.
The first Werpapierausgaben part of the EU Stability Fund are planned for next month.
Yesterday, an official representative of the Reuters news agency, the United States supported a possible increase in the additional, direct involvement of the IMF mobilized funds.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first series, for its part, structural reforms, particularly in the area of labour organisation.
Reforms, in addition to the austerity measures, however, show an effect in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid take a different path, as did Greece and Ireland.
Both the one, and the other is to avoid at any price, ask for international assistance to before they set up their own budget, corrective and decided on essential structural reforms, which they in the long term.
The European investors, in turn, chatting about the options available, in order to speed up the process of the markets of bonds.
Axel Weber, who was in Paris on 24 November in transit, as the first had the idea that if the 750 by Europe and the International Monetary Fund mobilized billion enough, the Union would not hesitate to back into their own pockets.
The economists at Barclays Capital, the market of European government debt is at the forefront of player, an extension of the EUR 100 billion would be enough, "preferably" in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
This means that the European financial stabilisation mechanism funded, which currently stands at 60 billion EUR.
An advisory board, which has every chance to be examined closely in European capitals.
Above all, if the market conditions.

Métro Grand Paris: first financial vignettes
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport economy on the Ile de France is in full swing, it rains billion.
At least in the discussions.
Recall, in particular, the 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro, which should be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to guide the construction of the SGP, has declared the state of $4 billion.
In theory, this is the amount that would allow the SGP and to on the part of the financial markets to their Zweifachen.
Today it is finally to first projections.
The supplementary budget for 2010, looked at this morning by the Finance Committee of the National Assembly, which contains the measures, the first part of this money.
There are two measures: the creation of a special tax to Erschließund and higher taxation of office on the Ile de France.
The former, remove Article 15 of the draft law, "to the benefit of the public service broadcaster Société du Grand Paris".
This is: "the product of this tax amounts to EUR 117 million per year."
Zweitere is an overhaul of existing corporate taxation: "to modernise it, in order to increase the product resulting from it, and this increase the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it?
A mystery.
This amount is calculated not in the text.
Of the 4 billion is far away.
"It states that the fiscal resources to the 4 billion EUR capital allocation, which will be paid by the state and the Société du Grand Paris for the project" says the explanatory statement.
The SGP is not this system at all offensive.
"Since the moment when we recorded revenue (the two taxes, that r.), the design over three years and then from the 4 billion" he said.
"This will be noted in the budget and gradually withdrawn".
The SGP estimated that will be launched in 2013, taking 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, which will be able to seek 4 billion promised, is in danger, a very turbulent, parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Rachsüchtige hackers and is spies
The affair WikiLeaks has a double meaning.
On one side, it turns out the obvious scandal, a scandal, which is simply a scandal in Sinner hypocrisy, the Beziehunge between states, the public and the press.
On the other hand, it has announced major changes at international level, and is a foretaste of the regression, future.
But we are moving in the right order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each of the intelligence produced acts (x) exclusively from any nation Zeitungsausschnitten.
For months, American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi's "extraordinary" nothing more than what we read in each x Journal (except for those whose owners Berlusconi), and the appalling karikaturierte profile Gaddafi's Kabarettkünstlern already for a long time for their skits.
The rule, not the secret files from previous news, is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go into a library dedicated esotherischen publications, you will see that each station (via the Grail, the mystery of Rennes le Chateau, the Templer or the Rosenkreuzler) repeated exactly what has been written in previous works.
This is not, therefore, that wants to publish the author occult texts (no research yet that he did not know where news about exist), but because those who dedicate themselves to the Okkultismus, nothing else than to believe what they already know and what they have learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
As the secret files.
The informant is lazy, lazy (or limited mental) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise could be, for example, editor of Libération), the only by what he considered a true.
The Top Secret information on Berlusconi, who had sent the U.S. embassy in Rome, Staatsdezernat, were the same as those who had published Newsweek published the week before.
So why was such a fuss about the revelations of this dossier?
On one side are those that know any educated person knows, and that the messages - can call at least since the end of the Second World War, and since then the Government each other or take a plane, in order to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of some small tasks, have turned into espionage centres.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that pretend to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact that to repeat it publicly, the task of hypocrisy and serves the American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second: the idea that can tap a x any hackers geheimsten the secrets of the most powerful country in the world, poses a significant blow to the prestige of the Staatsdezernats.
In addition, the scandal less victims, rather than the "executioner".
But we are giving the profound nature of what happened.
Formerly, to Orwell's time, all power as a Big Brother, every gesture of his subjects are controlled.
Orwell's prophecy could prove as absolutely right, where every movement, thanks to the telephone, each made transaction, visited the hotel, the elected motorway and so on; the citizens would become the victims of the eye of power.
But if you consider what is happening today that can escape the secret Krypten power over the control of a Hackers, listening to the control of, unilaterally and will zirkelförmig.
The power controlled every citizen, every citizen, or at least the hackers - chosen as an avenger of the citizen - can bring the secrets of power.
How can a power that is no longer able to maintain their own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel said that is a real mystery a hollow secret (and an open secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi's or Merkel's basically a secret free of Geheimis, because it exposes the public sphere; in the styles of Wiki Leaks openly that the secrets of Hillary Clinton empty secrets, to deprive them of power.
WikiLeaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wronged, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this grievance, which has caused a huge power?
It is obvious that the Member States in future no longer reserved information online - which would amount to angeklebten posting on the street corner.
But it is also clear that the current technologies is to be able to keep confidential reports on telephone.
Nothing is easier than figuring out whether and when a head of state in a plane and has contacted one of his colleagues.
How could be maintained in future private and only for certain ears relations?
I know very well that my prediction on science fiction and romanhaft sounds at the moment, but I am compelled me to imagine the government agents, on secret way actively to uncontrollable march routes moving their communications than anywhere else in the mere memory in order, and the few written information that they, in the footwear (verbergend.
The information would be stored in a single copy in locked drawers: basically the espionage attempt by Watergate had less success, as wikileaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is like a cancer, namely backwards.
A century after the Telegraph wireless communications, reconstructed the Internet with A Telegrafen (telephone) wire.
The (analogue) video cassettes had the film, a film for auszukundschaften enabled researchers spulen and reveal all the secrets of the assembly, while the (digital) CDs nowadays nothing other than to jump from chapter to chapter, macro portions.
With the high-speed trains within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this requires by plane, including switching three and a half hours.
It is not unusual that return policy and communications technology on car and horse.
One final observation.
In earlier times tried to understand the press, which have been forged between the embassies were forged.
Currently, there are the messages, the confidential information from the press.
Climate: France as its financial promises amount
A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to comply with the quickly resolved financing promises (also known as "fast start" funding or premature), which were carried out by the developing countries.
And the rough French blandishments.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has pledged EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France 1.26 billion EUR (420 million) per year.
At the opening of the COP16, the EU out all the stops to convince their partners of their commitment to the fast start funding: detailgetreuer report of its Member States, press conference, great side events, distribution of brochures.
The operation transparency is remarkable and I feel valued for their actual value: the developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries do the same thing at the same level of precision.
The EU announced, released in 2010 2.2 billion EUR, what they are on the right path to Respektbezollung its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
If you look in the detail, things are a little more complicated.
This money should, according to the Copenhagen Treaty "new and additional" to ensure that has been tabled an additional commitment, without having to the detriment of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed a harmonisation, certain members states, including france, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark, which he believes is best.
The EU Commission has chosen, for example, a benchmark for the year 2009: the international financing will be retained, and within the framework of the "fast start" funding over three years to 150 million.
Other countries have similar standards, either on or about conditions at the level of public development aid.
In return, France was of the opinion that the financing of new projects, "2010" new and additional ".
In other words, there are no benchmarks In the spending of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
In practical terms, the total amount of French support for developing countries remain stable (or decrease) - France, his commitment to the "new and additional" funding.
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is still no rule, and each elects its calculation method.
Some, such as France, 1 Euro borrowed the equivalent of 1 Euro donated.
This is hardly defensible: the trouble is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often linked to the emission reduction projects, which are based on maximum technology) can be justified, it is wrong to present the EUR, the captured as equivalent to a donated EUR. They should be counted only the cost of borrowing for capital commitment (i. e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing other than the following observation: "respected" its commitment of EUR 420 million, 91.5% of loans (389.8 million) and donates 8.5%) 36.1 million EUR) - see also the EU document, in order to convince themselves.
France is the only country in the EU that loans to a great extent.
Germany calls for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among others) to 100% with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union In 1 Euroto fulfil their obligations, France just 10 cents and means, a comparable effort.
Beautiful hocus-pocus.
All in All, France in his fast start funding with a double deception: part with a Weiterentwicklkung the action over time and partly with the reality of financial support.
France will succeed, believe that there are 420 million "new and additional" has spent millions in accordance with its promises and save 36.1 million EUR.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it appears that it was Bercy, who carried out the arbitrage) could be a double negative effect; once the EU (why the other member states with the donations, if there is enough to lend?) and then in the negotiations, because the developing countries are not completely fooled.
The chapter on premature, only a small issue on relatively short time compared to the entirety of discussions on the climate.
But it could be the straw too much in the vast machinery of the UNFCCC.
We hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever the truth of the matter, it is essential to learn its lesson from this first year premature funding.
Primarily France could announce a change in its accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, and in a spirit of respect for his commitments and the redistributive justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all it could bring the discussions on the subject of long-term financing forward (another, decisive and currently topic): you can escape the question of "Verrechenbarkeit" or the recording its loans.
France could change its position, in order to be in the same way progressive issues, as it is in other areas.
The hope is based on the new environment minister Kosciusko Morizet, will arrive next week in Cancun.
A surprising announcement on the fast start of France and his vision of "Verrechenbarkeit" and the use of loans would inherently increase the international trust, which is necessary for further discussions.
The alarm - of children's pesticides
A child of 10 years, on the day 81 different chemicals, so this Wednesday by the Association of Générations futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect generations) published study.
The association, said that its results ", given the small number of analyzed samples no statistically significant value, but the nature of the problem", between July and September, usually within four, bought from a child to the meals consumed food plus a meal in the supermarkets in Oise bought and Paris.
This typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as biscuits from laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The authors review is stunning: 81 chemical substances, including 42 as possibly or probably carcinogenic and five as safe karziogen classified, as well as 37 substances with Endokrinin glitch, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
"Even if in the virtually all of the cases the legal limit for each chemical, individually's substance, to remove this collection is very good that the reality in which the consumer may be carcinogenic chemicals or substances with Endokrinin glitch, is worrying" said the association.
At the breakfast included the butter and milk tea with more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three as carcinogenic proven safe, as well as more than twenty residues, which can affect the endocrine system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as an interim meal for the study, traces of six chemical substances, including one in France banned fungicide.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including the lunch, where the study traces of a strictly banned in the EU Insektizids.
It is also the Hacksteak, the tuna from Pandora, even the Baguette and chewing gum of pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water brought the analyses the presence of nitrates and Chloroform.
Dinner was the salmon steak with 34 identified, chemical residues in the "richest", and even for putting the meal in the microwave used plastic plate was not free.
The schlußendliche risk this pollutant "cocktails" for consumers "will probably undervalued" according to the study.
"The Alliance Europe Ecologie Les Verts" (EE LV), "given the urgency of the situation" proposed to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides, "the increase in diseases of civilisation".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) regarding the presence of residues 365 different, in fruit and vegetables identified pesticides, which are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
