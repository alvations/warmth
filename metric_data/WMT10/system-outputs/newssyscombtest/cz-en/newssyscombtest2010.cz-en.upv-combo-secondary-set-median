The lack of snow in the mountains worries total
The barren slopes don't worry about just krkonošským vlekařům.
The lack of snow discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and boarding houses.
It is therefore in the Giant Mountains still get free rooms for all winter dates, including the Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a large number of visitors at our website.
People pass through the offer shall record prices, but so far they fear made a firm order.
And if we call, so just ask if we think will be this Christmas in the snow or mud, "said the operator information portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Who wants to stay in the New Year Spindleruv Mlyn exactly according to your wishes, I it said the order did not hesitate.
Those who prefer saving money and quality of accommodation with him up to second place, he may still try a couple of days to wait.
Špindlerovští hotels we offer on New Year's Eve mostly just weekly stays.
I think they will try to indicate a moment, but then they go and allow for a shorter period.
And then they will be available rooms quickly disappear, "he estimated Jandura.
Free beds in all winter dates still offers and vrchlabská travel agency Ingtours.
Now you most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
Even so, half of the seats in our offer remains free.
That is why we have set a cheaper holiday stays at the last minute, "said the director Petr Ingtoursu Schiefert.
New Year's Eve in Giant Mountains vrchlabská travel agent can still offer, too, but there are fewer vacancies.
Well i sold it the first fourteen days of February, the other winter dates are sold on average.
This interest in winter stays adversely affects that in the Giant Mountains is still not snow.
People take a wait-and-see approach, if you want.
No one wants to spend the end of the year without the snow on the mountains.
If during the week, snowy slopes, vyprodají, even Christmas, "says Schiefert.
On the contrary, slightly better than last year, the hotel rooms boast Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou.
We're on it about five percent better.
New Year's Eve and on Christmas we have the last couple of places.
The big concern is about the Polish holidays in January and February also sells well, "said the director of the hotel peckého Karel Rada.
Of the eighty percent of the New Year holidays and the hotel occupied by Omnia in the central parking lot in Janské spa.
On the contrary, Christmas remains in the latest hotel janskolázeňském even half the beds available.
Pleasantly surprised us this year in January, which we have at this moment occupied by some of the sixty percent.
A little weaker is February, but as soon as the mind of snow, interest in stays in the Giant Mountains must still rises, said the hotel manager Omnia Eric Sporysch.
However, the larger presents the snow krkonošští hotels, meanwhile, must have come taste.
On Thursday, it is cool, if there are any reductions, we should be snow on the mountains.
But then again, he has come to the warming, said Jiří Jakubský hydrometeorologického from Hradec workplaces of the Czech constitution.
The US is the mother of wisdom retries:
It is as ridiculous as the schoolgirl snaživostí Barack Obama, the president with a reputation as the smartest, repeated in Afghanistan's ruling the strategy of his predecessor, whom he regarded as the stupidest.
When finally vypotil his eagerly awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out that it copied over kopírák of Bush's Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only in the text itself uses the word several times turnover as in Iraq, "but did not hesitate even to use the name of Bush's declaration in January 2007 as the name of their own declaration:" The new way forward ".
Three years ago, at the same time, he criticized Bush's idea to send a fresh military reinforcements to Iraq beset by civil war as "irresponsible and in the aftermath of catastrophic decision".
The subsequent months have shown , however , that the Bush strategy based on a recommendation from the field commanders , was the only possible and , so much so that today in the intelligence on Iraq at all .
Bush's reputation improvement, but objectively left his successor a much passed the default position than it was to be expected.
In Afghanistan he hopes Barack Obama in that the miracle repeats.
The increase military contingent asked him again a field commanders, in particular the supreme commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, which even despite subordinačním harshly criticized the practice hesitant shooter in the White House.
He asked 40 thousand men in order to break the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but nothing better accrue, so at least fool the general 10 thousand soldiers.
From Europe could squeeze out the promise of further 5 thousands, although he was initially charged with at least 10.
Most problematic for the whole Obama's strategy seems to be his intention to begin withdrawals of troops from Afghanistan as fast as 18 months and terminate the process within three years. Obama's whole doctrine raises more questions than provide answers.
Many doubt that the increase in half-baked fruit gives the same procedure as in Iraq.
Despite the internecine wars of recent years is the Iraqi society relatively well organized, its leaders honor the agreement.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the opposite sign - the one shall not count and no agreements have not been honored.
Wrong, under these conditions, prepare the Afghan security forces used day to change the master in as far as it suits them.
Political institutions, even if they are formally based, will remain just potěmkinovou village, which will continue to could spread patriarchal tribal relations.
Balancing the interests of various ethnic groups is extremely difficult due to clutter ratios, which further complicate the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Neither the establishment of "akceschopného state", which is a minimalist goal of the entire operation, it doesn't look like all too real.
Obama's strategy at the time horizon .
For the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan deteriorated only, and is now on the verge of explosion.
Believe in that sending soldiers into a war in order to 'return home early' cause there made a miracle, can only truly romantic soul, the fact untouched.
From a political point of view is to set a date for withdrawal of troops by nezodpovědností, since the Taliban, it will be seen as an implicit admission of defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is nearing minus.
European politicians can not and do not want to explain to voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the foothills of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically to intervene in the situation is developments around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and intensified sanctions on the Iranians does not produce arises from the United States přetěžká question is, will not try to solve the problem of the use of military force.
To reply to it, it will be in a time when under Obama's America to the vítěznému withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Any such solution, however, will mean a dramatic turn in the Afghan situation.
The only politics for Barack Obama is that the remaining presidential election three years away, so there's still plenty of time to come up with another strategy, if this proves to be a total flop in.
managers of banks Goldman Sachs , you don't get the rewards in cash
Senior managers of U.S. banks Goldman Sachs get this year pay in cash.
Announced that the company, which responds to the harsh criticism of its pay practices.
A group of 30 leading managers will receive cash in lieu of shares that could be sold as soon as possible in five years.
In addition, the managers of shares may be taken in the event that will be excessively risk.
Goldman Sachs, according to the Reuters agency put at the forefront of efforts to link bonuses on Wall Street, with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction that needs to take, said a former investment banker JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after the the first three quarters of this year set aside nearly 17 billion dollars (almost CZK 300 billion) to pay.
The total amount of remuneration in the company this year , according to the Reuters agency likely despite the measures now exceeds 20 billion dollars .
High remuneration in the banking sector, with the arrival of the financial crisis, in a number of countries have become a hot political issue.
Britain on Wednesday announced that it intends to bankers ’ bonuses in excess of 25,000 pounds (about $712.000 USD) in a lump sum to a 50% tax.
Similar steps preparing and France.

Janota Minister is considering resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus shall take on Friday morning, Finance Minister Eduard Janota, which is considering remaining in the government, because it does not match with the form of the budget for the coming year, as in the centre of the approved by the Chamber of Deputies.
It is assumed that the budget and maybe even Janotovo remain in office will be topics of their Friday's meeting.
The budget also criticized Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too high, further deepening the crisis in the public finances.
The meeting informed the president's spokesman Radim Ochvat.
On its next term in office Marek Alexa wants to act on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischerem.
According to the law of the budget, which now gets Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
But the House of Representatives on Wednesday approved the proposals of the left on the movement of money and raise money for the salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the suggestions of social democracy that secretly by increasing the budget deficit.
Left on one side and the Government, Klaus and the right wing, on the other hand, a dispute has arisen because of a sharp vnitropolitický, which begins to raise a question mark over the additional exposure habitually Fischer's cabinet, which was agreed in the spring-making the ODS party, the Social Democrats and the Green Party.
Critics argue that the budget, as it was adopted by the House of Representatives, practically destroyed a package of austerity measures that Fischer's government has imposed in the fall, and that has to stop borrowing state.
Klaus, a law on the state budget may or may not sign on today's breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs said that politicians have neglected for a long time "serious problem" that is "unsustainable deficitnost" of public finances.
Today, he said he no longer has a good solution.
Improve could bring only strong government, which, moreover, could rely on a broader consensus of political parties, says the president.
The chairman of the ODS Mirek Topolánek said that the budget is scary, and the government should consider the further existence.
ODS-Petr Nečas said that the concept of habitually cabinet, with the support of the Social Democrats, the Greens and the ODS has obviously doesn't work.
Prime Minister Fischer, in response, called similar words for "strong statements".
The head of the Czech Jiri Paroubek on Topolánek responded that the budget deficit, which the former Topolánek government prepares for this year, which is more than 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday identified the CSSD approval of the state budget for next year a success.
They were also satisfied .
Mandela in the novelty of Clint Eastwood played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans say that a new Hollywood film Invictus: Undefeated is denounced by the world a lot about the country, about her fight and win despite some critiques that the main role ztvárňují American actors.
The story is about a sport, racial proportions and Nelson Mandela.
The indefatigable warrior against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa as its first black president, Nelson Mandela in his life story represents oscarový American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he jednadevadesátiletý Mandela asked whether he would be in the movie Eastwoodově reproduce.
Another important role in it plays Matt Damon.
I told him: 'If I play, I'll have to have access.
72-year-old actor, who won the prize for her role in the drama of the environment of the boxing Eastwoodově million Dollar Baby, enacted, for example, the leader of the Movement for the abolition of slavery, which ultimately became a slave, a fictional US president and even a god of the goddess Evanovi, but it is rare for someone who is still alive and is so important for many people like Mandela.
Former South African statesman was 27 years in prison for his active work after the end of apartheid in South Africa.
The freedom of the redundancies in 1990 and four years, then became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel prize for peace.

Freeman had been working for several years to Mandela's story on the screen.
I had no other purpose than to play this role, so as not to approach her as much as reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was that to speak as he did.
The actor said that if he and the world policies were in the same area, he would've tried to meet with him, to have dinner with him, be backstage before his utterance.
The most important thing was that Mandela wanted to shake hands.
I found that if I wrapped around his hand, take your energy, transfers, and I felt that I know how you feel, "he said.
It's important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon in the film , the captain of the national team , in which white players .
The actor said he had six months to prepare for his role in the tough world of football.
The big surprise for him, it was when they first met Pienaarem in his house.
I remember I rang the doorbell, he opened up to me and the first thing I Francois Pienaar in his life he said was: 'In the film look much more'.

The secret of glow over Norway : the Russians were testing the rocket
In Norway, it was possible to observe a special light effect of unknown origin.
Russia's Defense Ministry yesterday acknowledged that near the Norwegian border wife, an intercontinental ballistic missile.
It was the Start menu, but again failed, and the shot known as type "Bulava, which originally was supposed to be the envy of the Russian army is slowly becoming a nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
his presence at the tests missiles on the success of the test flights .
The majority of all Bulava nevzlétla or damaged in the air.
In Russian newspapers are already on the "Bulavě" writes as "rocket, which don't fly".
The rocket , which doesn't fly but shines
This, in order for the 13th experiment took place at first normally.
And at the end of the flight was again to technical damage to the apparatus.
Apparently, the engine exploded in the third stage of the missiles.
This time, "Bulava" taking off from a nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij, which went below the surface of the White Sea.
This type of rocket that can be fired from the vessel, which is on the move, and at the same time submerged.
It is therefore likely that the mysterious light above Norway, caused by the unidentified flying object was actually broken "Bulava".
Indeed, the Norwegians from the first time they had no doubt that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals this time , and that we cannot speak clearly about failure .
The first two missiles , and an accident to hit the third .
In previous cases, the porouchaly engines in the first instance.
Although completely flawless or may not have been a test start, the failed leadership of the Ministry of Defense considers that only six of thirteen.
Almost fifty percent success rate so filled with optimism and generals and still maintains that the "Bulava" would one day fly without problems and even hypersonických can carry up to ten nuclear units with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.

Hyundai unions upheld. Cancels all overtime
The management of the aid Hyundai with the unions agreed to cancel all of overtime.
It is because of the often nařizovaným overtime declared unions on Monday strike emergency.
It confirmed Hyundai spokesman Petr Vaněk.
Management, however, wants to trade union leaders to agree even on a Saturday this year's shift.
We can ’ t resign on our production schedule, it is vital, therefore, was designed to be voluntary overtime on Saturday, 19 December, with the result that would have made two shifts, said Vaněk.
The server Sedmička.cz wrote that company employees who work Saturday shift, offered a bonus of CZK 400.
That will get people back to work Saturday, 28 November.
The company is under Vaňka decided to change the way motivating employees for the proposed overtime.
Either you leave to pay extra for overtime or compensatory time off may choose 28th December, and thus about the day to extend the Christmas holidays, said Vanek.
In addition, all the staff Saturday shift will get paid for the fare and lunch.
Whereas the overtime was a point from the point of view of comments and complaints , and employees of protesters , last week halted production , so the management yesterday afternoon decided with immediate effect , the abolition of all the overtime for the month of December , he said .
Staff car companies were last week forced to virtually every day after an eight-hour shift work in a two-hour overtime.
After the signing of the agreement, the union stávkovou emergency appeal
Further negotiations between the management and the union is to take place on Friday morning.
The union chief Petr Kuchař on Wednesday said that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign off on a joint document, they are ready to revoke the emergency stávkovou.
The situation came to a head last week on Wednesday , when about 400 employees spontaneously stávkovalo because of the constant .
Also protested against the wrong grade conditions and the alleged bullying.
Duct lived that overtime workers must do for the sake of the requirements for the supply of cars.
The union, in its Monday announcement strike ER also requested that they weren't any sanctions postihováni employees who last Wednesday cut production.
In the field of overtime unions after the company required in order to stem the overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, the estimated cost for this year to pay a reward of 5,000 crowns.

Czech discovery: a substance which works on 'hardy' viruses HIV
A team of Czech and German scientists testing the new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of enhanced substance is that it works and the viruses that have won against drugs immunity.
This fact is , in some cases , that the compound to a normal variant of the virus is not as strongly as some already available medicines .
The disease AIDS still cannot be cured.
However, patients can significantly extended the life of a combination of drugs that prevent the virus replication of HIV in the body.
Their use, however, is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Partial suppression of propagation of the virus has also resulted in the development of the so-called resistentních viruses against which the drugs are ineffective.
The work of experts from the three institutes of the Academy of Sciences, Institute of Chemical Technology in Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with resistance to the virus.
Proved that a substance called metalokarborany acts on a protein responsible for the reproduction of HIV.
Metalokarborany are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds are blocking the spread of the virus otherwise than all today used drugs, and therefore may overcome the problem of resistance.
In his work, scientists have come with the new 'improved' compounds prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to viral protein.
Metalokarborany a unique three-dimensional structure: two polyhedral cages formed by atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon atom are linked metal, in this case cobalt.
Treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is a protein of HIV, which is necessary for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV proteázou caused by the fission of HIV would not ripe infectious virus particles.
If we stop HIV proteázu, and stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the researchers explain in a press release issued by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In work published in the scientific journal Journal of the medicinal Chemistry scientists describe a series of compounds, in which they are two pairs of cages (see table) interconnected short organic chain, which is also systematically revised.
A slightly weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of anti HIV protease was tested in vitro and also against the resistant (resistant) variants derived from patients infected with HIV.
The effect of the variant of the enzyme to normal metalokarboranů is not as strong as that of clinically used drugs, but its effect does not for resistant variants against which are used drugs are often ineffective.
A unique mechanism of action and its other characteristics such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of another chemical treatments of metalokarboranů makes interesting compounds for further research leading to the design of effective drugs against HIV, says Pauline Mobil, head of the lab Structural Biology Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics Institute of the Academy of Sciences.
The argument for the sake of the budget. The CDP has embarked on Fischer, that will prevent
In this sense Mirek Topolanek marked by an approved budget for next year as "appalling" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer, he should consider the further existence.
Expression of the Czech prime minister called for a strong statements.
He said that the time for analysis.
The ODS vice-president Peter Nečas said that the concept of the cabinet with the support of the Social Democrats and the Green Party , the ODS now apparently doesn't work .
President of the Government by Nečas must decide whether it intends to support in the House of minority, which regards the fight with the growing deficits, or him to remain in office, with the help of parliamentary left.
The ODS and social democracy on the issue of public sector deficits is fundamentally different, "said Nečas.
The House on Wednesday adopted the 2010 budget, but with leftist amendments for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House had raised the money for the salaries of state employees, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
Criticism of the Government's proposals to address social democracy was still hidden by increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
Before the vote , left the hall , to comply with the wishes of the government , so that the revised budget is less bad than the budget .
disappointment and frustration
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and frustration, Czech Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will assess the current situation yet.
Nečas is convinced that if a mazivy seriously threaten leaving functions in the case of the adoption of the amendments, the situation could be different.
According to the Czech television Janota ordered on Monday after the government of Prime Minister.
He suggested that is considering further remain in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment of the negotiations on the budget.
If the Fischer speaks for another fight with the deficit for the budget, they are increasingly in demand, according to minister Nečas in government to do nominanti Social Democrats, who pushed through changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also be sure to say that the demise, if the House approves the additional laws increasing the deficit, such as those relating to health, income, or the amendments to the Staff of the law.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated ODS guilty
It's a matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ODS party nominees ministers haven't done anything wrong, "Topolanek stressed in a text message from the US.
He reminded that on several ministries are in náměstkovských functions people hlásící to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if the Fischer has decided to resign from the principle of the fight with the amount of the government deficit, "it is completely logical and correct that, against a leftist majority that is currently in the House's".
He said but can not count on support from Democrats and civil tolerance.
I hadn't thought about it, and when it is the current, so that you can spend, he told reporters in the House Defense Minister Martin Barták, whom the government was nominated at the Civic Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer afternoon flew at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
At the request of Prime Minister withdrew ODS
Necas also stressed that the ODS would be on Wednesday in the House apparently voted against the budget amended, if the Prime Minister Members of the Civic Democrats explicitly requested to ensure that the adoption of the budget allow.
Nepřipadáme as orphans, we're not children, then responded to the question of whether the ODS party in political negotiations over the budget speechless absence of the Chairman of the parties in parliament and the Czech Republic.
I have not noticed that my voice was missing.
When I was giving the mandate, so I knew that in the coming months, it will be a member of the House bolševizaci and destruction of all positive, "he said.
According to the new rules of procedure will be less čd trains for almost the same fares
The Czech railways from 13 December will cancel or reduce some of the less frequent and , other joints , on the contrary , will strengthen .
The total range of transport from the date of application of the new timetable will be reduced in comparison with today , up two percent .
Most of the tariffs, including the basic and customer fare will not change.
More options for a connection to the capital gain, for example, residents Ostravska, track on this route add one set of Pendolino.
On the contrary, the high-speed train stops to ride to Bratislava.
Less express rides also along the route Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, significantly reduces the direct connections Praha - Letohrad.
The regions are planning to track the largest reduction in traffic in the region, evidently, a total of eight percent, to increase, on the other hand, can look forward to Prague and its surrounding areas.
Removes the two night trains on the route Prague - Tábor - Czech Budejovice and operation of several trains on the route Prague - Pisek - Czech Budejovice is limited to certain days of the week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of new direct flights to Prague from Milovice today Milovičtí have to change trains in Lysa nad Labem.
The fifteenth line of peri-urban system of Esca, its opening is possible due to the completion of the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovic.
Remote connections to the capital city will go in the destination station Prague Main Railway Station.
CD introduce more SC Pendolino trains between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperka / Jeseníku will go at two-hourly intervals.
Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December passengers already.
This year's bill for the regional rail: 200 million more
Fast trains ordered and paid the Ministry of Transport, were called to cover the loss can be proven runways next year, four billion crowns, as well as this year. Local ordering region, total pay for them next year, eight billion crowns, while almost three billion edges will become.
This year are regional trains about 200 million more expensive.
I have had great influence on the runway rychlíky newly signed a ten-year contract, has always been a contract for one year.
The runway system pochvalují, and therefore presumably to increase the stock price of an overwhelming majority of tickets.
Changes will occur only in day-old network tickets ČD Net and cheap Internet tickets eLiška.
For passengers without the customer card, the price of CD Net increase of 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
Price eLiška will now depend on the distance traveled, yet was for regional travel between any cities uniform and was 160 crowns.
Philippine militants are still holding back more than 50 people, children released to freedom
Today, militants in the south of the Philippines was kidnapped 75 people, including several of primary school pupils and their teachers.

About 19 of the armed men allegedly used hostages as a shield during the run from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree on the issue of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP police originally kidnapper pursued because of the violence, which has cost a settling of accounts between two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maguindanao was because of the recent massacre, in which were killed 57 people, declared martial law.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November associated with the election to office guvernérského was 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre was arrested the governor of the province, and his father Andal jihofilipínské Ampatuan, an influential patriarch of the genus Ampatuanů.

The story of JAR applies to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next few days comes into U.S. theaters, a new Hollywood film of Clint Eastwood Invictus (the official name in Czech sounds Invictus: Undefeated), which is a part of the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the warrior against apartheid Shevchenko , Morgan Freeman , who had called for his portrayal of years ago chose Mandela himself .
The secondary male roles of the legendary South African champion in rugby Francoise Pienaara the Matt Damon.
With the slide into the cinemas are arising from the critics and the public .
Nelson Mandela
Full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in South Africa, Mvezu.
In 1988, received the Sakharov Prize for the freedom of thought, in 1993, then together with de Klerk Nobel Peace Prize.

Vaccination against will be free of charge and optional
Vaccination against since January .
to be the first family for free , and at the same time .
But there are voices , that it would be compulsory vaccination more effective .
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumokokům peak.
Ústav lékový already set the maximum price for vaccines, which will pay for health insurance companies.
Experts have also have clear in the procedure for vaccination.
The new vaccination
The vaccine free of charge for children in August
From January may be free vaccination against pneumococcal children who were born last year 2nd August and later.
The only condition is that he still does not even one dose of the vaccine.
Who began to vaccinate last year or earlier, he must pay for himself and other booster vaccination.
The first dose of vaccine should be made between 3 and 5 month the age of the child.
Last year, voluntarily left their children vaccinated against pneumokokům a quarter of families.
Parents yet paid 1600 crowns for one dose and more.
The vaccination of the youngest children are the need for four doses.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies to get on the vaccine dose of 300 to 450 thousand crowns a year.
Saves but treatment that children without vaccination needed.
Not worth all the area vaccination of children gave about 500 thousand a year.
Reimbursements vaccination was introduced so-called Janotovým package.
The pneumococcus causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also serious infections including brain fever and blood poisoning.
The pneumococcal infection in our country per year die in hospitals under investigation to 28 children under 10 years.
In addition to the Czech Republic introduced by the vaccination of children against pneumococci around in 40 countries.
The vaccination will be mandatory?
At the same time but there are views that the future could be the vaccination mandatory.
From January to be paid by insurance companies and optional.
It would be better to vaccination, indicated as the head of the civic association Unmute Rudolf Kalovský.
His association pneumococcal vaccine in the long run .
Experts at the international conference that our association took part, were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we have a voluntary vaccination.
It's not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have managed to push through at least this.
I think that's the road that now we have to step in, said Kalovský.
The Ministry of Health but the vaccination against pneumokokům wants to change.
At this moment about it at all, said his spokesperson Vlastimil hornet.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, says doctors
The President of the practical paediatric doctors Hana Cabrnochová recognises that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all the children have been vaccinated, it might seem that a reduction in the number of booster "For a situation where this vaccine costs so high amount, rather we understand the political decisions that vaccination was started as a volunteer," she says, of course, Cabrnochová.
Experts expect that their infants to vaccinate against pneumokokům from next year, more than 80 per cent of new parents.
Vaccination against pneumococcal is a breakthrough even that it was the first area vaccination of children borne by health insurance companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should be spending money on prevention, thus saving on further treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy yourself substance
But it is worried about the practical children ’ s doctors involved in purchasing vaccines.
According to the original intent of the vaccine should buy insurance and doctors would receive just as they become available substance to other vaccinations.
Some Members , however , feared that they could give insurance companies " money from the health insurance " .
Doctors will therefore have to buy the substance and wait until they are insurance companies .
According to estimates will individual praktičtí child doctors to invest in vaccines 40 thousand per month, which is a significant sum.
It will not be easy at all, says Cabrnochová.
Still they and we
It may be a Muslim Frenchman?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when the Swiss voters called for a ban on the building and minarets and generally spread alarm reports of alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a brief, whether they are allowed to integrate Muslims - and whether they will integrate - into one of the continent nejotevřenějších secular society.
Some of the readers, after reading this book admirers became the artist's final works, "Why the French do not like scarves on the head" (2006), this elegant and diskutovanou study on the issues that divide and employ the country for over a period of 15 years and whose impact is still felt today.
The last book of Mr Bowen has a broader and much more ambitious in scope.
Like a good anthropologist wants to know not only what the politicians and the media said about Islam in France, but what actually happened in the base.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which are now taking care of 5 ÷ 6 million French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen called 'Islamic areas'.
Is a good listener, reproduces the debate between teachers and students on issues that most concern.
Should a Muslim enter into matrimony in the mosque or at the town hall (or in both places)?
It should be taught about the development of young Muslim and gay rights?
It may be a Muslim marry a man who is not a Muslim?
He has the right to use of a Muslim zájmově oriented banking system, if it wants to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues, which are being discussed, and which are part of everyday life, rather than a political drama, which employ media.
Author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among other well-known people, including the Tarik Ramadan, Arab, Muslim scholar and academic, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open a discussion on how you can simultaneously be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They have arguments for all their custom.
The conservatives are suspicious of the actual idei French or European Islam.
Philosophers and activists that Mr Bowen conducted interviews, on the belief that they are the counterpart Selafiho purists — supporters of Sunni Islam, combined in Saudi Arabia — this group is small, but it affects the European Muslims.
Mr. Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But the adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
It wonders how far they are French politicians (and intellectual elite that so obstinately defends the general public) actually committed to the idea of pluralism.
He is of the view that Muslims are in matters of faith may have less experience than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to make the historic compromise with secular republikánstvím.
Rather than the development of pragmatism found "tightening the screws values."
It may be a Muslim Frenchman? After reading this book, someone may have a tendency to say "yes, but not now."

The Arctic is changing more rapidly than the rest of the planet's environment .
The ice is melting edged an alarming rate, which affects animals and their survival as anywhere else.
The interests of olejářských, plynařských and fishing companies must be focused on new natural water resources, together with diplomats, lawyers and the writers in their wake-up call.

Mr. Ellis draws from the works of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that the hunters threatens the survival of the species.

The irony is that it takes place in the water to the north of these two fishing nations and that ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book "The Ice" Alun Anderson, former editor of New Scientist, has a clear responsibility of the dismal science in the Arctic and interesting glimpse of how it can change the future.
Not at all, researchers are answers.
Neither the meteorology and oceánografové do not have an adequate response to the speed of change.

The US government contractor jailed Cuban government officials
The Cuban government has enveloped the American government contractor, which imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, according to officials from the Foreign Ministry on Saturday.
The supplier, which has not yet been identified, he worked for the company Development Alternatives, Inc., headquartered in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with a U.S. interest section in Havana sought access to the boarded, who was arrested on December 5.
Certain charges has not been made public, but according to the Cuban rights may be a Cuban citizen or a stranger imprisoned for almost anything that are designated as "dangerous".
All of the so-called kontrarevolucionářské activities, which include mild protests and critical monographs, raise the risk of imprisonment.
Anti-graffiti and language are considered a serious offences.
In Cuba, there is a young blogující community, led by the popular commentator Yoani Sánchezovou, who often writes about how she and her husband followed and harassed by government agents.
Mrs Sánchezová repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country in order to be able to accept the prize, but was denied permission.
The detention of an American contractor may be the result of the growing tension between the Communist Castrovým brother, the ruling in Cuba, and the Obama administration, which was tracked as a "delaying tactics" in improving relations with the island.
As the first report on the arrest of the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasized that if the Cuban government has taken concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and create more space for the opposition, the United States take reciprocal steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, even though they are new and sought-after commodity in a country where the average wage of state employees is $15 per month.
The Cuban government has granted an ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile telephones in just this year; these are used mostly for sending messages textovýchg because 15minutový phone call would cost more than one daily wage.
The use of the Internet on the island is mimořádn limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and on certain government přípojkách, such as universities.
The Cubans, who are often want to log on, must notify their names to the government.
Access to many of the Web page is disabled.
American detention in Cuba is a rarity.
Most of a handful of citizens of the US in the prison in Cuba is behind bars for the tresné actions, such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbenová, press the section for american interests in Havana.
Mrs Berbenová said that it could not provide more information about the prison.
His arrest and detention were clearly immoral.
Such activities, which would in any other open societies were legitimate - say, a free mobile phones - there is a criminal offence in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the group For Human Rights Program, recently published a report on the freedoms in Cuba, titled "New Castro, the same Cuba," as a reference to the installation of Raul Castro as the leader of the country and compensation for the sickly older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He said that any solution would have been more political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries seek to extensive dialogue.
Pakistani civil servants rozkrývají conspiracy relating to the posting of men in Afghanistan.
The Pakistani authorities on Saturday, uncovered the alleged leader of the plot, involving the deployment of five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill members of the American forces, and said they hope that such a case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorists verbířů that he's on the internet and finds radikalizované young men.
Investigators said they searched the gray rebel personality, known as Saifullah, who invited the men into Pakistan after it first appeared, when one of these men published a commentary officer terristické attack, internet videostránce YouTube.
Saifilláh assumed leadership of these men as soon as they came to Pakistan, he tried to help them get into remote areas of Pakistan in the zone of indigenous tribes of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaida and its camps for training terrorists.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who submitted a report on the case, said on Saturday that Saifulláh usvědčování was unsuccessful in al-Qaeda commanders, and that the men were part of an attempt by the CIA infiltration into the terrorist network.
As a result, they are dumped after a few days in the eastern district Sarghody, far from the forbidding mountains in the north-west, which has become a haven for terrorists.
They were seen as a squad.
That is why they disembark, said the official, who spoke on anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.
The official said that the men were not deterred and still trying to obtain consent to gain access to the camps of al-Qaeda, were arrested when Pakistani power law.
In this case, the five - which remained in Pakistan and the FBI vyslýchána - highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, which is much more important to determine who is trusted.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001 the U.S. Secret Service attaches the highest priority on the location of attempted human resources to al-Qaeda.
Recruiters organizations function as a guard, eliminating those who are not sufficiently serious in its commitment to holy war and those who might be spies.
American recruits were subjected to false for al-Qaeda specific aspects, said analysts.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group, because due to their potential access to U.S. goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at Nef Foundation, based in the US, said that the terrorist group has also become, in recent years, significantly more cautious in Koh demonstrates that came up to them, because the American intelligence agencies to recruit experts on their recruitment methods.
If you try to penetrate the groups, there is no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which was already much-watched? Said Mr. Kohlmann.
This model is one of those which is far more based on the web.
Tens of thousands protested in Copenhagen, called climate 'action'
Tens of thousands of protesters marching through the streets this Saturday and pressed for stronger action on climate change negotiators from the convention center in the city's Bella.
The protesters reported by the number of many hundreds of thousands of participants in this event, but the police odnaduje that number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively calm and a handful of masked activists placed several small bombs near a group of government buildings in the centre of town.
On the day when the minor incident occurred in the talks on climate change, sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists walked through the town, carrying banners with the English inscription "This is not a planet B" (ie, secondary) and one in španěltštině that proclaimed "Land says 'enough' .
Protest attended several celebrities, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, said that she traveled to the birthplace of his mother in Peru and provide me information about the bleak state of the country, which contributes to the impact of climate change, which still occurs.
It's part of the reason why we decided to connect to this great march -- through the world, and to appeal to leading figures in the world to present a fair, ambitious and binding treaty, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it is necessary to carry it out, can not you still avoid.
Police prevented protesters to converge toward the center of Bella and stated that it arrested 19 persons, primarily because they either deployed or masks or carry a pocket knife.
These activities are under Danish law during demonstrations banned.
According to one of the other spectators, who did not wish to be identified, because it is involved in rohovorů about climate change activists masked as athletes and in black suits placed several pipe bombs near the main Copenhagen, which is located near several ministries.
Agitovali buildings, said zahajivali lights, but followed by "a few large explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest is likely to be entered into the consciousness of key officials, such as Su Weie, the main Chinese negotiator on climate change.
When he was asked whether the demonstrations still had a constructive impact on the international agenda , said the English " , that is something that I was not aware of " ( actually it's something ) .
He continued čínčtině and said, "Because the venue is large, I can not hear what's going on outside.
Monitor whether the march of pain or helpful, depending on the outlook for each.
You can see the concentration of the general public and various sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words: "We can also say that it is a distortion of the hearing or the freedom of others.
The date of the test revealed the persistent racial disparities
The federal certificate from last week on the knowledge of mathematics, it was a welcome element of good news about the public school district of Columbia.
Although the district lags far behind the country's high-performance systems, the certificate showed more progress for pupils in fourth and eighth classes for the last two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the last numbers of the National atestačního Centre for progress in classes are persistent differences in the knowledge between afroameričany and white students and both after the page after page of local and national.
The average result of white pupils fourth classes District of Columbia for the last two years has increased from 267 to 270 points (out of a possible 500), but in their african-american peers nrůstu occurred only by three points of 209 to 212.
The difference in the knowledge economy actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
Progress on the African-Americans in the eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with the departure of a statistically insignificant one point of 245 to 245.
The average result for white students was not included in the results of the test because the sample size was too small.
Image in term of six years is not very encouraging.
The difference between white and black pupils in fourth class in 2003, when the NAEP was first performed in the district was 60 points scale (262 ku 202).
Although this result in children from oboiu groups improved during this period, the difference is hardly near 58.
Some advocates of education in the county in the last week indicated that the results, the secretary oslavované Michelle A. Rheeovou and Mayor Adrian M. Fentym (D) were for white students generally stimulated where there were already high results.
That would imply that we increase the total aid for those at the higher end of the scale, which is difficult and disturbing, "said Jeff Smith, executive director of DC Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equality vdělávání in the district.
Neskáču up and down due to the scattering of two or three points, "said committee member DC Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in fourth grade elementary school in Eaton.
Often criticized the style of management of Mrs. Rheeové, Mrs Brown said that a report on the results of the test means secondary education in the town is in a desperate state and requires attention.
It is clear that we always want to see the pros and I respect that.
But what is frightening, that we are paying almost no time and energy that had to be paid to our middle schools.
Mrs Rheeová said that the district is continuing in search of better ways of addressing the needs of the students with low results.
Thus, for example, are some of the teachers trained in the use of the new curriculum is read, Wilson of reading, aimed at students in higher classes in primary schools and secondary-school students who were unable to master the basics of reading before in his kolní kariéřea significantly lag behind their peers.
The day-to-day math curriculum and teaching math to sixth grade, emphasizing the game and experience of real life that came into the district as a former Director Clifford Janeyiho is attributable to the progress of the NAEP, which has been the subject of a report last week.
And I think we should continue to work and carry out the best possible interventions for those students who remain below the level of a class, said Ms. Rheeová.
Others have suggested that the results of the NAEP clarify the question of whether Ms. Rheeová svyšování can continue in the overall system performance and to provide more money and resources for schools with low performance, which is necessary for reducing the difference.
It's a definite dilemma Mrs Michell Rheeové, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, where she studies the results of the tests in urban areas.
Conventional procedure axles is to focus resources and administrative reform at the school, located in the worst parts of the District of Columbia.
So it can focus on generating the political repercussions, which is directed against the important agenda.
But the complaint but also includes other city managers who are trying to keep the mean diameter between white and black.
We have to focus on the establishment of a system of large schools.
We have utužit affinity of our schools, so that all families, regardless of where they live, they can rest assured that their children will be provided an excellent public education.
Mr Janey, now the director of schools in Newark, he said in an interview this week that a fundamental element of the reduction in the difference between the results achieved is an extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the county to take the legitimacy of the schools.
You have to get up to 200 days in order to push through changes, said Mr Janey, who has entered into a contract with the teachers ’ union last school year in the length of the 185 days, which is considered to be the "flag" for the search for a greater increase in the next year.
To make higher education part of a better future
Tour bus pulled into Gettysburgské track with a loud breathing.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, got out and rested for a moment the white pillars, brick facades and emerald green grass ..
Parents Gracielini hardly attended high school in El Salvador.
Yet Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never entered the land track.
Now she and other pupils eighth grade in the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition was 38690 dollars per year, their position was rather than scared visitors enthusiasm for potential students.
Yes, that's it! "She exclaimed Graciela, which would like to study medicine, if the wizard offered to enter into the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? she said thoughtfully, when they revealed a low ratio of professors to students.
Pennsylvánská track was one of the seven, who visited on his three-day trip, and now they are preoccupied with the message of the future: The question is not whether you enter the house.
The question is where.
Of course, it is a soaring problem dealing with a high number of children born in the US, Spanish immigrants who are excluded from the universities or pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who get the college education, and then enter into the middle class.
In fact this fifth "Duhem generation of Spanish students from college - remarkable achievements indicate that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and people of Central America, arrive in the United States without having completed high school.
Their success story is important, researchers state, because it underlines the point the way forward for the generation that played a marginal role in the field of labor of the country.
Those who have achieved higher education say that they have a natural náklonpost to the school and congenital assertiveness and desire to succeed.
Many also had parents who set their children high objectives and looking for ways to replace the ignorance of the american education.
But the school programmes also play a special role in helping Graciele and millions of children who would like to have track - especially if these efforts in time persists.
If you take into account that children come from groups with low incomes, whose parents do not have the experience and ability to help them norientovat in the system, free from any interference in each point is resolved, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California at Davis, where she studied students from Latin American area.
We have to think about it, to provide these children of reference network in preschool age in all ways to pročšly high school.
The federal program that funded the trip graciela on rails, is a useful example.
Known as Gear UP (připtravit), provides more than $300 million a year for the local school systems for starting college preparatory programs that used for students from families with incomes of middle schools and continue until these students quit high school.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, of which more than% entered the college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
The Iraqi Ministry of Oil industry has reached agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Regardless of the fears of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to get a major oil company to rebuild their anemic infrastructure in two auctions, which took place on Saturday.
Ten of the agreements concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil, with foreign oil companies, suggesting that the Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play a major role in the reconstruction of Iraq ’ s oil industry, paralyzed decades of war and sanctions.
American companies left with equity participation just two of 10 fields auctioned.
Seven US companies pay for their participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one has lost a bid.
Two U.S. companies have reached agreements on the field, which was auctioned in June.
The paltry participation of American oil giants in an open Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened the door after six years of war and U.S. companies here in the first place on the path of Asians and Europeans, said the Rube Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
It will be a long time before something else will be in Iraq for sale.
Concerns about safety, highlighted by massive coordinated bomb attacks on Tuesday, and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the U.S. military is likely to discourage U.S. companies from more intensive business activities in Iraq, which has the third largest proven reserves of raw materials, analysts say.
American companies have in some cases at a disadvantage, especially Chinese and other government-controlled energy firms have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to taking risks, because they are not responsible to shareholders.
The companies Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. is the only U.S. companies, which have entered into an agreement with the Ministry.
Leading American companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintained close contacts with the Iraqi oil ministry and offer technical assistance in recent years, left empty-handed.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the top shareholder in two of the contracts that have been committed at the end of this week.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp. contributed to the menus at more contracts than any other company, and left with large stakes in contracts for the two main fields.
We all know that China is seeking to become the main economic, as well as technological power, said a spokesman for the Ministry of Oil Assam Jihad.
We believe that the Chinese company will be comparable to the competition and to honor their commitments to Iraq.
The companies, which have been pre-selected for the submission of tenders, which were then compared to the price of a barrel and the Treasury is willing to pay to boost output above the current level in every field.
A top al-Qaeda planner may have been killed in Pakistan.
When the impact of U.S. missiles at the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week was apparently killed a top planner of al-Qaida operations, as announced on Friday by officials of the U.S. counter-terrorism department.
What is confirmed, it would be the second fatal attack on one of the top leaders of the terrorists.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs who were killed when several rockets fell in čtvrtrek on their car near the town of Miran Shah in the province Sevverní Waziristan, according to U.S. sources and pakisttánských officials in the area.
Local authorities ounámily that rockets were launched from unmanned aircraft type, which operates the CIA in the zone of illegal indigenous tribes.
Those were targeted in a white car, which was heading to the Afghan border, when it was hit, said the official, together with pakistánskou cicilní intelligence agency, who was on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said that the local militants the approach to a point, and quickly zabavilito, what was left of "totally devastated".
Local authorities have not been able to verify the identity of the victims, but the two U.S. officials NYPD nespecifikovaného department had cited a witness who said he was a Somali Show poi death.
Somali has been cited as a high-ranking al-Qaeda planner military operations, who drove the operation of groups of terrorists outside the area of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in zosnovávání throughout the world, said a senior official, who did not wish to be named, which featured the sensitive nature of U.S. air strikes on the territory of Pakistan.
If he held a central position, may have been involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from al-Qaeda's top leadership, and on the basis of them planned for possible terrorist attacks.
Another American official said that the Somali rapidly advanced in the hierarchy of al-Qaida and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He did not need to be widely known person for some Americans, but that was in no way neponižoval in front of us and our allies posed for it, said another official.
His death was confirmed, the Somali should be the second high-ranking leader of al-Qaida or the Taliban were to be killed since September, when he was killed in a similar attack Najmudin Jalolov, leader of the militant faction in the Gaza indigenous tribes and three other top poperativní leaders.
The pace of attacks launched by pilotless CIA aircraft has decreased since the summer from an average of approximately six transactions per month to two, according to Long War diary entries, web sites, managed by non-profit group.
The reduction may be the reason for the improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability by also ruthlessly killed persons which should have suspected that they were informers , said Page .
Summit delegate of the United Nations in Kabul has resigned.
The top delegate of the United Nations in Afghanistan , Kai Eide , said on Friday that he wanted to withdraw from his of his duties in March and end a stormy term of office which was allegations of massive corruption in the election of a president in Afghanistan , supported by the UN .
The Eide departure occurs because the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN delegate said he supported the surge, but expressed concern that the timing of the US for a reduction in the state, which starts in 18 months should be a challenge for the government of other NATO nations to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of Afghan security forces and send the right signal Afgáncům that they have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
Norwegian diplomat also pressed for the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian staff to assist in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase of the armed forces must be copied to the civilians, he said.
Eide's Comprehensive Review said that nerezignuje, but that simply fulfilling a promise he had made to his family in March 2008, in Kabul spends only two years.
He said he wanted to report to the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is now said that he needed time for a replacement.
As I said, it is time to look after the dauphin, "said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to officials of the UN Ban began searching for refunds.
Officials said that will be decided between Staffanem di Misturou, which has a Swedish-Italian origin and previously headed the United Nations mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhennem, a Frenchman who, before the UN-led peacekeeping operations.
Eideho position in Afghanistan was tested by his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraithovi, who was accused in September President Hamidem Karzáím, who won the presidential election of camouflage, the presence of a massive electoral machinations.
Eide has denied those allegations, but said that the allegations Galgraitha - which was released - "definitely harm the mission, because there was a high degree of skepticism with regard to international intervention" in the election.
Eide's Comprehensive Review stated that the proposed a meeting with the chief representative of citizens for the coordination of relief efforts for the leadership of US forces in Afghanistan.
Also urgoval the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more workers in the United States and other Western countries, which could be borrowed for the Afghan mission, because, he says, wanted to strengthen their confidence that their money is spent properly.
Eide has expressed disappointment over the limitations of its efforts in Afghanistan and the UN , said that the cumbersome regulation on hiring undermine its ability to use the powers .
The UN rules are such that I had the opportunity to obtain since May, only one person, he said.
This is a disaster and I can not continue.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers soon impose on Iran “significant additional penalties ” because of a lack of involvement in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to a group of about 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq during a weekly trip to areas where there is conflict in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospects of military action against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good option for Iran, said in response to a question of a soldier on the likely evolution. ¨
One of the things that depend on me, is whether or not I learnt about something from Iraq over the past six years, [that] is a wide distribution unpredictability in the war.
The Obama administration will be decided on a package of sanctions which could hit iránskou military and political elite, but Gates signaled that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iránce.
He said that "a package of incentives and restraints" would require "iránskou that forced the government to actually feel less safe with nuclear weapons" because "its inhabitants will be extremely suffer" sanctions.
According to Friday's opinion issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has engaged a European leader in warning that Iran will have serious consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program into full compliance with the Committee of the UN's nuclear safety and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes only.
In talks in Geneva 1st October indicated that he wanted to return to talks on reducing their nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial portion of its stocks of enriched uranium in return for urgently needed fuel for the reactor to carry out medical research.
The administration has dealt with such an agreement as a way to build trust between the two sides and to allow time for negotiations.
But since then, it seems, Iran withdraws from the interim agreements - partly because the expert, because irámské leadership is divided views on whether to engage in the United States.
Frankly, as regards the iranian obstinacy against the international community, in the case of certain proposals, which was agreed at the beginning of October, i think that it brought the international community, including the Russians and Chinese together on the path that is not on the terminology of additional sanctions against Iranians, said the Gates.
President Obama set for 31 December deadline for Iran to reply to the proposals before returning to search for other options, including monitoring, which Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton had called "degrading penalties.
In its opinion, issued in New York, Iran, the mission at the United Nations on Thursday condemned what it called "groundless and unsubstantiated allegations" against certain members of the Security Committee on the Iranian nuclear activities and said it wants to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve a reasonable long-term solutions.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met this morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before he flew to the area of Kurdistan, rich in oil, to meet with troops in Kirkuk, and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
There is still a high tension between Kurds and Iraq's Arab majority, mainly because of the border, a proprietary rights and the distribution of income.
Gtes insisted on both sides to reduce the potential for conflicts to zabránlo presence of US plans to reduce the number of American troops from 115000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to allay concerns about the Kurdish from persistent depression. Official cited by the US space Gates when he told Massoudu Barzáanímu, President kurdistánské regional governments: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomiji in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you. "
In an ageing China, change course
Weijia Wang and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters, on which read that "Mother Earth is too tired to fund more children" and "One child also means a grave also.
Then they got a lesson that when the official government in Shanghai, alarmována low birth rate and ageing of the population in their city, suddenly changed course in this summer and began to encourage young couples, their response was immediate and determined: never.
We have always spent all their time and energy just one child.
We have nothing left for the second, says Wang, 31 years, the human resources, which has 8měsíčního son.
More than 30 years of China's policy of having only one child has been introduced and thus created two generations, only the notoriously boubelatých and zhýčkaných children affectedly dubbed "little emperors", threatening the country's population crisis.
The average fertility rate decreased to 1.8 children per couple in comparison with six than vpolitika vsoupila into force , according to the UN .
The distribution of the population, where the number of residents aged 60 and above, predicts that the 12-year-old will grow from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31,1 percent in 2050. That's far above the average of around 20 percent.
An imbalance is more affluent coastal cities with a population with higher education, for example in Shanghai.
Last year, people at the age of 60 years of age and above accounted for almost 22 percent in Shanghai registered population, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai municipal committee on population and family planning said, many couples have children, "to help reduce the proportion of aging population and reduce the numerical status of the workforce in the future."
He says it's about "being old, it does not mean to be rich - as in developed countries such as Japan or Sweden.
The gradual
As has been inserted into the constitution of the country in 1978, China's one child policy is probably still the most controversial mandate, established under the rule of the Communist Party.
The pair, who violated the policy, face enormous fines - up to three times their annual salary in some areas - and discrimination at work.
China's official places are advocating policies that helped the country avoid critical of natural resources, while human rights advocates were condemned to enforce the policy.
In rural areas, some officials forcing pregnant women in the second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples had to undergo sexisticky selective abortion, leading to an unnaturally high proportion of men against women.
In recent years, population officials were progressively less severe in its opinion on the one-child policy.
In 2004, as a rule permit výce exceptions - including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and in cases where a man and woman were only child - and in 2007 to mitigate the diction of their passwords, promote a hard line.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Beijing Institute of population research universities, said that officials of the central government has previously debated the more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was an only child.
In June, the Šanghai became the first Chinese city, which launched an aggressive campaign for incitement to more at.
Almost overnight, the posters urge parents to have only one child, replaced with copies thereof, describing in detail how it would be legitimate to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration has sent officials to plan families and volunteers, so that they can meet with couples in their houses and vsouvali leaflets under doors.
Also promised to provide emotional and financial counseling for those who have decided to have more than one child.
The reaction was cool, said officials for planning families.
Zarmucující response
Although officials in a rural town near Shanghai experienced an increase in the interest of couples who would like to have a second child after the start of the campaign, most urban precincts were reported changes.
Huinan urban district with a population of 115000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
Frustrated officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign is the number of births in 2010 is still expected to only about 165,000 - slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Juying Feng, head of the committee for family planning in Shanghai čtvti Caol said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why people do not want to have more children.
They want to provide the best first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years, she said she would like to have two children and they are legally allowed to be.
But like many Chinese, who have only a lack of health and life insurance, provided by the government.
Without dociální reception network could be the choice of irresponsible.
People in the west on a one-child policy is wrong as a matter of legal question, says Yang, a structural engineer, whose wife is in her seventh month of pregnancy in volume with the first child.
Yes, we have been deprived of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only in politics.
It is about money.
Other couples show the psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, manager of human resources, says that they want only one child, because she also was an only child: "We focus our families and all of us cared.
We were not used for the provision of care and in fact we did not want to worry about others.
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who vlatní translation company, has put much nepokrytěji.
For dvoukariérové parents of the middle class, who reduced fertility rates, he said, be successful means to be selfish.
Today's 20 and 30letí waxing consult on their parents as in the first days číského probíjející experiment with capitalism and do not want this way of živita for myself, he says.
Just one child places enormous demands on time parents, he says.
The mother must sacrifice for at least two years of my social life.
Then there are issues propstoru - “you have to rebuild your apartment ” - and the strategy -“ you must have a summary prepared at the time when the child 9 months for a good pre-school education.
Most of his friends wants to be content with one child, says Che, but not with two.
We are the first generation with higher živitními standards, he says.
We don't want to make too many victims.
UN group has outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN sponsored conference on climate change -- with a large neukázněnými position and mutual osočováním -- is once again on Friday focused on the release of the document, which proposes ambitious cuts in the amount of greenhouse gases over the next 40 years with industrialised nations, bearing most of the burden in the immediate term.
The text , which may provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases , stresses the remaining obstacles , as well as the way forward .
But it was seen important progress in the negotiations which took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders who come to Copenhagen next week.
UN Working Group created an ad hoc, the text subtly indicates how much money rich countries should give those poor to cope with global warming in the short term and long term.
And provides a whole range of choices for the key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies in order to reduce their output of carbon and what should be the upper limit for the increase in global temperature, which will be political leaders still able to tolerate.
This dodábá process a great deal of flexibility, says John Coequyt, Senior Washington Representative of Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who suggested šestistránkový document zestručnění from 180 pages of text from the meeting to focus on what a top official on the issue at the UN climate change, Yvo de Boer, described as a "big picture".
The outlines of a possible settlement, in which he could be jointly industrial nations to reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent compared with 1990 levels, while the main developing countries could reduce their emissions during this period for 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the country to reduce emissions by 2050 between 50 and 95 per cent.
The European Union on Friday to discuss his promise to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries to adapt to climate change -- from cope with floods and droughts to prevent deforestation.
Still but Friday said the same kind of verbal fireworks which prevailed at the talks in the last week.
The US special envoy for climate change Todd Stern dismissed the speech, calling for mandatory limits on greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries compared with dobrovolností among the major emerging economies, as would not be financed by the developed world.
The shift signaled that the Obama administration established the harder line against China on Bush administration officials just two years ago.
The United States accedes to the treaty without the transfer of major developing countries and implementation of action, "said Stern, who also complained that the text is not sufficient to cover the limitations and should be examined by external observers.
Stern made this comment about an hour after the Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister He Yafei told the US main negotiators on climate issues that either a lack of "a little common sense," or "exceptional irresponsibility" lead earlier in the week to the statement that the United States would help either financially in China, to be able to deal with global warming.
With the future of economic trajectory of the world ’ s major powers at stake, both arguments have erupted in the developing world, as well as between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current fighting is mostly on the conservation of individual economies, rather than on the conservation of the planet, between China and the United States regarding the implementation of their respective commitments, while the poorer nations point out that two of the most influential countries of the world they ignore strong scientific imperative for the implementation of the action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate Costa Rica, he said, it is not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of omezováníí greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in seeking Order to prevent major issuers responsibly in their actions.
It's obviously a game that the new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, which also serves as a regional adviser on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for the international nature conservation.
Some of the countries that are most zranitelnelné impacts of climate change have indicated that they wish to continue to promote a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the major participants, said that the best outcome of talks will be the political agreement.
The alliance of small island states, which has a 43 members created a draft agreement 24stránkový last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led the international negotiations on climate change in favour of the European Commission, said that the enforcement of the small island nations, "has caused a political tlkak polirtický on the whole process," partly because they are now united action and demand from growing economies such as China and India.
The negotiations resulted in a new urgency as the delegates focusing on the fact that the majority of the remaining issues must be resolved before the heads of governments compete on the deal.
High-ranking officials, for example, India ’ s environment minister Jairam Rameš and Chinese Deputy Minister stepped out of the aircraft and the attackers halls Bella Center at a closed door meetings and conferences so that they can chart a new claims, which will be considered next week.
Total rozsáhlost Assembly - which 13,000 people on a daily basis přemisťovalo to and from the convention center, on guitar playing activists inscenovali ironizující spectacle of countries in the middle of the night on which they put them forward, and on the transmission of proposals from hand to hand on the paper rather than e-mail -- controlled by the challenge.
The intensity is only extension: in Copenhagen were present almost all of the key ministers and before in the center of the 60 heads of state.
We got into the high category, "said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said the Deputy Minister for global policy for international nature conservation.

The first British train with a speed of 140 miles per hour this Monday feelings
In 5: 13 Monday morning whistle cut through the darkness on the departure of the train, which meant the revolution transport in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country reaches a speed of 140 miles per hour and fly from Ashford in Kent to London St Pancras and beyond the distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Kelly Holmes and got into the first high-speed passenger trains outside lLndýn.
Hopes that the new service, where appropriate, joins Britain with an international network of fast, reliable trains and joins a great urban agglomerations of Midland, the North and Scotland to London.
Disregarded stagnant water should reduce transport times in passenger transport and on business trips and the transition from aircraft and on the rail could reduce carbon emissions and to eliminate the congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties to get for this vision.
But dozens of bilinů pounds needed for the construction of a new national rail network, the inevitable fight for projects and concerns about the deterioration of the environment now přibrzdily building the British high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide a workable government study, submitted its report to Lord Adonis December 30, as stated Times.
Give him a detailed map of the routes of the next stage of the planned High Speed Network.
The new trace links London with the western Midlandem was designed to five metres in urban areas and neighborhoods, where he would be on the propstředí dopat could be problematic.
In open country was scheduled to 25 m final routes.
HS2 also expected to identify three broad options for high-speed network leading to the north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option is konfikurace Y-shaped, with one high-speed line should lead to the West Midland.
The track should share with one near the Birmingham branch, through the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other, leading to the northeast in Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over the Tyne.
One track should lead to Scotland.
"It seems there has been the most effective choice," he said, and a judge of the railways.
Once that is done, journey times between London and Edinburkem shall be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be open before the year 2025, it could enable passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared with more than one hour in the present.
Proposals should enable trains to travel at a speed of 2 250 miles per hour, which would have made of the British network, the fastest in Europe.
The initial line already proposes to hold the trains in the length of 400 m , which would have been able to carry the 1100 .
Up to 18 sets could operate every hour on the route London - Birmingham.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve the needs of up to 20 000 passengers per hour.
Due to capital constraints, it is expected that the existing stations would be extended so that pojmula high-speed network.
Experts from železničníhoprůmyslu argues that only San Pancras International and Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether is or is not going to implement this scheme, but an extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that keč a final decision will not be forthcoming before the general election.
Even if the wheels in motion, the network should build in instalments.
Trains should be first placed into service, not on the high-speed lines, but the existing routes north of Birmingham and maintain the journey times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is regarded as a crucial point of contact for the transition from the aircraft on the trains , a reference point for the revolution on the railroad .
Taxpayers pay the mortgage of $75,000 pounds on oranžérii Toryů
Alan Duncan, the holder of the chair-front benches in the House of Commons Toryů taxpayers paid thousands of pounds in expenses last year at oranžerii, which built up in his home in the electoral district.
A spokesman for the prison, who was demoted David Cameronem, complained that MPs were living "on rations", has increased its mortgage on a £75,000 to build an extension of the oak sandwiched in his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge a special interest, the overall hundreds of pounds a month tax payers.
Village authorities have approved claims in a timely manner and that has not been questioned by Sir Thomasen Leggem, who performed the control of the Member výdajlů. Last night, Mr Duncan said his requirements "menohlo be cleaner and simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of Parliament, its own two-storey houses in the village in its electoral district Rutland and Melton.
Houses have a value of about a million pounds.
It is on the ground floor kitchen, living room and dining room, but the office wasn't agreed that Mr Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he added to the winter garden, which is in the plans marked as "oranžerie".
Neighbors describe her as "a greenhouse for fun and entertainment.
Mr. Duncan was asked to provide some explanation for the increased loan during the last inspection committee for the municipal standards and privileges in the final settlement of the mortgage.
Committee told him last month that broke the rules, after a review of its expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan has changed pupillary security for a mortgage of £ 271,406 from his estate in London at a house in his constituency who had bought in 1991, a year before he became a member of the House of Commons.
Documents released this week showed that Mr Duncan claimed about 1,400 pounds a month in mortgage interest up to March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1800 pounds a month.
RBS mortgage interest repayments of Mr Duncan was unable to change at this time, suggesting that it was intended to finance the loans of $75,000 pounds.
Standard variable mortgage repayments RBS declined in December 2007 of 7.94 percent to 4 percent in March of this year, with the left.
The last document municipal authorities, shows that Duncan continued to nárokování 1250 pounds a month in May of this year.
Mr. Duncan left his job as shadow leader of the House in September after having a secret zpraviodaj filmed and said that Members must survive "on the envelope" after spending scandal.
"Basically, it's znárodňováno, you have to live on rations and are treated with you as a s * * t."
He said: "I spent a lot of money for my garden and claim, and a small fraction of what had to be done.
And I could claim the whole share , but I won't do it . "
Rep., a millionaire from the former career as a businessman with oil, was first asked to explain their issue in May, when it turned out that claimed thousands of pounds for your garden, before the approval of the tax office that it “may be regarded as excessive ”.
One of the activists dug a hole in the shape of a pound sign on the lawn of Mr Duncan in protest after it was revealed that £4,000 claimed for a period of three years.
When he was asked last night to increase the mortgage, Mr Duncan said: "It was the capital increase, which was approved by both the tax authority and then Legge."
He added: "It is not disputed question of hiding and dribbling or violations of rules or something else.
It's absolutely straight line down, according to the rules, and that's all.
Nenohlo It would be many other spůsoby cleaner and simpler."

Jean Arthuis centriste from the Alliance.
At the same time you considered it appropriate to put on their promotional materials and on the welcome page of your website name + Nouveau movement, center +, with the slogan + + UDF today, note the signatories to the letter.
As you are aware, you have no right to use this explains the UDF that asks the NC "immediately removed all references the names of the UDF from all promotional materials, including (their) website".
At the same time, asks Hervého de Charettea "to hand ownership of the trade mark the legitimate owners".
If not, you so the courts to be respected the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, identified the signatories.
In his letter stated that the UDF "is a fully-fledged political hnutíod 1978" and point out that Mr Morin and his friends "elected" retirement in 2007, "in order to create a competitive movement, as well as others in 2002, founded the UMP.
Nouveau movement centre has, therefore, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la democracy française).
At the same time, they point out that the last Congress UDF voted in 2007 to connect to a modem for three years, and for the creation of a committee charged with defending "moral and material interests" association based Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
As regards Hervé de Charettea, the committee continues, "when the registered trade mark", not "for three years a member of the UDF, but the UMP.
Skandálním and fraudulently used the non-existent registration akronyma to do so on its own account.
This indiscretion is starting to convert to a criminal offense, claim, and then the irony of the strategy denominated NC: "It seems to us that both in politics and in everyday life is more valuable to create a name for himself than to withdraw from the anonymity of fraudulent adoption names which we have no right.

The case Liliane Bettencourtové: François-Marie Banier will be tried for misuse of state weakness.
A court in Nanterre, on Friday decided to judge the artist François-Marie Baniera and the judge whether he used state weakness osmdesátileté miliardářky to prepare it for a part of its capital, of which it accuses her daughter Liliane Bettencourtová.
A photographer (62), known for his photographs of famous will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for misuse of state weakness, which is an offence for which a sentence in a maximum of 3 years and a fine of $375 000 euros.
This decision confirms that the process actually takes place in a case that can be characterized as a family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which each attack a mother and daughter struggling with the management of L'Oreal cosmetics empire.
But 15th Criminal court also ordered the medical examination of 87 year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which should make the College three doctors.
Heiress and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such testing, certainly not on the terms offered to the public prosecutor in Nanterre during the investigation.
The doctors, who will be elected on Friday should draw up a report on 10 March 2010, and at the same time submit an expression that Liliana Bettencourtová could be in a state of weakness, and in which the period.
I think that it undergoes.
The things to her speak, said after the hearing Mrs Bettencourt lawyer, Georges Kiejman.
As for the lawyer Francois Bettencourtové-Meyersové, Olivier Metznera, welcomed the court's decision.
It's great news (...). Expertise shows that with this old lady who needs protection, manipulated (M. Banier), confirmed.
Two years ago, the only daughter Liliany Bettencourtové launched criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banierovi, photographer and všeumělci, whom they blame for years to take advantage of the weakness of her mother, in order to obtain the gifts of one billion euros in the form of a cheque, contracts for life insurance, or paintings by masters.
But Liliane Bettencourtová always refused to accept that it would be a photographer, who is regarded as a long-term friend, manipulated.
While the court must assess the legitimacy of an action brought by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, Friday court speech advocates are sometimes changed in the family hour of truth.
The attorney Liliany Bettencourtové submitted three letters that his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) sent his notaries, and in which she expressed distrust for her husband Françoisy Bettencourtové-Meyersové.
In a letter from 2003, according to an attorney Liliane Bettencourtová adds: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote Banierovi over a period of 15 years, once to twice a day.
Ever since you got married Françoise I never talk ' .
The prosecution in Nanterre again found that the negotiations stěžovatelky is not justified, the more that foster the judge in these days of rejected its request for the initiation of the procedure for the issue of legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt is fully able to participate in the court is not under protection or in custody.
No one else for it not to act 'representative confirmed the prosecution, Marie-Christine Daubigneyová.
The court eventually ruled that the justification for Mrs Bettencourtové-Meyersové expressed at the time of the opening of the process.
Managerial revolution or the end of the economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence was unnecessary.
For more than ten years, recalls the behavior management of large company employees access to business-to-consumer marketing before the revolution: the point is to co-identify themselves with the "values" identified from the mountain, as it once was when it was necessary to impose on the consumer products which have emerged heads of the ideas factory technicians.
The fact that the customer has become a hub of entrepreneurial companies, compared the marketing strategy of conquest of the market in the right direction — even if the authoritarian tendencies of the force products different from consumer preferences are regularly.
Passive approach employees can lead to death demoralizaci.
Firms suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only visible parts of much rozšířenějšího general phenomenon, which will fall mostly managerial cadres.
The demobilisation adversely affects the development of all mental functions of the company, including research and development, and, more importantly, the economic intelligence.
And, indeed, E "requires from all interested parties (...) active approach and the ability to predict a" and requires from the staff of the commitments that are inconsistent with the revenue authoritarian management.
Therefore, we call on the managerial revolution, which should aim to include workers at the center of the interest of the company as a client.
The relative usefulness of internal surveys.
Internal polls - as the questionnaire submitted by employees of the company Orange - will contribute to the revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately I'm afraid not.
Mainly because I convinced myself that in the face of new situation, the structure of the various turning back primarily to the ... you always did!
Furthermore, because the authoritarianism, as one of the pathology of power, shall be increased proportionately with the gravity of their own failures.
And finally, because most of the management of workers has simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates for engineers have mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For reasons of convenience take old behavioristickou theory currently again highlighted "neurovědami" from the US and widely operated without too much knowledge of the scientific institutes and other media.
In fact, it is possible to move the "levers" (sic) the involvement of managers, showed a recent survey agency Ipsos Figaro.fr the site, which only strengthens the management personnel in the position of a mechanical procedure, unsuitable for today's world.
To identify and measure the factors mobilization.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution is necessary for the proper functioning of the modern business, provides for the adoption of definitive vision of human behavior.
Lies in the integration of the basic insight of all projects and practice management: For the employee of the firm commitments will be possible only if they will seem like a simple means to achieve their dreams and ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept, the motivation of employees engaged in the study only motivation functional analysis.
These studies have shown that evaluates their businesses on the basis of pre-determined doxy, which will allow them through the image, which the company says, assess what offers them to achieve their goals in life.
Thanks to identify and measure of these factors can mobilize managers to monitor, forecast and pre-empted in its "social performance" and list its management of human resources "on the right path".
This creates a breeding ground for the development of a sound and effective economic intelligence.
Manifestation of the Oslo "just war" Obama has earned praise from the right.
The American right on Friday welcomed a speech that Barack Obama delivered the day before in Oslo, satisfied with the fact that the holder of the Nobel Peace Prize for 2009, defended the concept of the "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who have taunted Obama at a price of 9 October, this time a presidential speech clapping, including Sarah Palin, the former candidate for vice-president in an election in 2008.
I liked what he said, said Palin, a Republican muse of the right-wing for USA Today, and added that she herself on this subject "might be necessary" war expressed in his memoirs, which are in the process.
The war, of course, is the last thing that the Americans would like to have a job, but it is needed.
All the terrorists there to be detained, he said.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after its předchůdciGeorge W. Bush on Thursday in Oslo justify the deployment of forces and used the speech to explain his decision to send another 30 000 troops to Afghanistan for nine days before.
Another Obama's opponent, Newt Gingrich, evaluate the president did in Oslo "a very good job."
I think that the speech was very good, and a former chairman of the House of Representatives, which particularly appreciate the president's reference to "the existence of evil in the world".
In a way, I felt that the speech was historic, Gingrich said during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
A former MP, whom some consider a possible Republican candidate in the presidential elections in 2012, was thrilled to see "leftist president," noted committee members for the Nobel Prize, "that they themselves would not be free and could not pass the price for peace, if the use of force exist.
According to Michael Gerson, a former author of George W. Bush, now editor of the Washington Post, Obama made "very American speech".
Not only is presented as a "cosmopolitan" as always, but "speaking as an American President" and reminded Europeans that "they live in a safe bubble they created themselves and that they do too much for it to keep it" evaluated Gerson.
Among the handful of discontent among the ranks of the Bush-era hawk, former ambassador to the UN, John Bolton, who described the speech as "humdrum, pompous and without the inspiration," he said on the website of the National Review Online.
To the left of the president, for example, a favorite Democrat Dennis Kucinich is horrified by the sight of Barack Obama, justifies the use of force.
"When the war packed into a container of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, moderate-leftist press is of the opinion of the President of praise.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to award the Peace Prize Obama premature reviewed his output as "nadvýkon" and orator known for his talent.
The Oslo speech should serve as a guide for the international decision in conflict resolution, in the fight against poverty and oppression "rendition places a California newspaper.
Obama "keynote speech what had to be done," said the New York Times, and a sign marked "for the simple and instructive".
Road carriers: three maratóny to the agreement, which will save the supply of stocks at Christmas.
After three procedural maratónech unions ran out of road hauliers and TLF, only employers ’ organisations, who remained until the end, Friday night to the Agreement, which ended the call to strike, and the threat that hung over the supply of inventory at Christmas.
The Secretary of State for Transport Dominique Bussereau at Friday's signing of the Agreement expressed "joy" and that after some negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of discussions with negotiators on Friday morning soon broke up, in the hope that the text of the agreement will be signed as soon as possible by the end of the morning.
Despite the fact that three of the employers' organisation (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) from the negotiations have each withdrawn.
But it was the need for more than six hours of meetings, which began in 11 hours to all agreed and in 18 hours podepsaliznění agreement.
This conflict " would be very hurt " and " there would be a danger that they will be distorted by the holidays at the end of the year , " he said .
The text contains wage increases by 4% for the lowest salaries (for local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest salaries (international transport).
Hourly wage for the lowest salary increases from € 8.72 to 9.06.
It's not much, but it's in a lot of effort, he explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight we command our members to avoid blockades, no blockade of supply centers.
But it can occur for a few opponents, who are not satisfied, "he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed the "right deal", although it was hard to admit to an increase in salaries relative to the international competition ".
According to him, an increase of 170 euros per month for the lowest wages and about 100 to 120 euros at the top.
It is a deal of common sense and respect for employees, said CMaxime Dumont (the CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement".
According to Richard Jauberta (CGT) is a "reasonable compromise".
The agreement also involves revalorizaci travel expenses of $3% and a report on the situation of the state of the road in the first half of 2010, which will also focus on the issue of the 13th salary and the modernisation of the collective agreements.
Bussereau said the " reduction of EUR 100 million in taxes from wages " , which was the subject of a proposed amendment to the government on the draft law on the budget for the year 2009 , which voted in the night from Thursday to Friday , the National Assembly .
The government will ask the Senate to "identical" vote.
The signature enables that this agreement will apply as soon as possible to the companies that are members of the organization, later on the field, in the case of the extension of the Ministry of Labour.
Take place "as soon as possible," assured Bussereau.
The whole process can only impede the opposition of employers' organisations.
Enterprise FNTR speaks of "bad market" for 100 million "sector has already been offered in the context of the compensation part of a carbon tax".
Secretary of State for Transport forced us to emergency negotiations, not as a result of the analysis, but the Super nerozhněval jedlíky turkeys at the time of the Christmas holiday, she complained Unostra.
For your organization Otre threatens to an agreement over the next 12 months, "to bury a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises from the scope".
RER suburban trains A: interruption of traffic on the weekend, unions unhappy with the proposals of the transport company RATP.
Abortion services on the line of suburban RER trains A, which is the largest line of the city's public transport in France, will continue over the weekend because Friday's meeting between unions and management of RATP on the second day of the strike to yield concrete results in otázcežádosti on the premium.
On Saturday and Sunday, then held on for an important shopping weekends before Christmas, trains will run only between 10 and 20 hour, on the main stage (between La Défence and Nation) will run every second train outside of this section of the train was only one of the four.
Interconnection with SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre and Prefectures, passengers will be forced to transfer to another train.
commercial houses Galeries Lafayette , which expect every day over 200 000 customers welcomed the fact that " the RATP tried to talk about with large commercial houses " .
The RER line and leads from the west to the east of Paris .
The section of the managed RATP leads from and to the Nanterre Boissy-Saint-Léger and .
On Friday, he was at the top of the train in the operation of one of the two, and virtually no didn't during off-peak hours, as planned.
As on Thursday, the residents of the Ile de France managed differently at landings and confusion reigned.
So early in the morning was at the centre of Saint-Germain-en-Lay (Yvelines) far fewer people than usual, inter alia, also because devoid of pupils and students.
Jack Nbakina, engineer, 29 years from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that stood for "an hour and a half early to be sure they arrive on time.
The station of Saint-Lazarus was not overcrowded, announced the state railway SNCF predicted a larger number of ushers and security guards.
The RER commuter trains operated by SNCF in the direction of A or Cergy model-Le-Haut came or departed from the station, Saint-Lazarus with přípojem on the subway.
For the General Assembly strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will assess the results of Friday's afternoon meeting with management and unions that are rated as "weak".
The management of the RER proposes negotiations on a special protocol for suburban RER trains and in all respects, the organization of working time, the course of his career, etc.
That is not, however, drivers who require a well-earned premium, according to Thierry Garon (OdboryJih).
In the meantime, RATP even extended proposals on bonuses, which hurt the CGT, with the result that the leadership "was not able to solve the problem, while roaming carriers and SNCF about it".
The new meeting, which is scheduled for Monday, "closer to review the terms of the occupation," said RATP transport undertakings.
Which was the reason why trade unionists believe that the company "makes fun weekend travelers.
In the morning hours, about 150 drivers busy enterprise Committee in its Paris headquarters.
Leadership, which until now odmítalo any discussion during the strike, is therefore in the interest of the "appeasement" decided for the meeting.
There is a danger that the conflict on Tuesday, will be extended to the RER B line, after the Unsa Indepedents and notify stávkovou emergency.
The unions are asking for a premium of $120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros variables (CGT, FO, the CFDT, Sud (South), indépendants (Indepedents)) and make it difficult to get used to the deteriorating working conditions on this line, which carries a million passengers a day.
Drivers earn the RER suburban trains at an advanced time career from 2200 to 2700 euros gross wages and from 600 to 650 euros bonus for irregular working hours and for work on Sundays and public holidays.
The Turkish justice dismissed for the Kurdish side and this decision carries heavy consequences.
Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday decided to cancel the main pro-Kurdish party in the country. The decision immediately triggered a protest demonstration s in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of government , which is trying to to the Kurdish community a friendly hand to attempt to end 25 years of conflict .
For the Democratic Party (DTP), the company was disbanded because it has become a "nest of activities against the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," he told journalists, the chairman of the Supreme Court Hasim Kilic after four days of negotiations.
The decision was adopted unanimously by the 11 judges, when it was needed for the dissolution of the majority-seven votes, said Kiliç and added that 37 of party cadres, including its president Ahmeta Türka Aysely Tuglukové and the ban to participate in the political life for a period of five years.

The decision is a continuation of the process launched in 2007, the chief justice of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahmanem Yalcinkayem, who accused the DTP of obedience to "commands" Party of Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries regard as a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is legal political vitrínou rebels from the PKK .
Page assures that the PKK has no "essential link", but refuses to designate a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court's verdict comes at a time when the government gives the Kurdish community in a friendly hand and offers a range of measures to strengthen their rights and attempting to limit the support of Kurds against the PKK and end the conflict.

After delivery of the verdict, Mr. Türk said that the decision of justice "will deepen despair.
Turkey is unable to this question (Kurds to resolve the ban, he said in a press release.
The government, consisting of a party came from the Islamist movement, also condemned the decision.
We are from the principle against interference of the parties.
It does not solve anything, said Minister for Energy Taner Yildiz.
This Decision is an utter [Democratic proposals, which was initiated by the government, said political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can wait for reaction from the PKK, he said.
On Thursday, the PKK subscribed to one of the most deadly attacks in the north of Turkey, which killed three days earlier seven soldiers.
The new Silicon-Valley
Long years was true for a city, inaccessible to visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one of the 10 districts of the capital city of Moscow, in the Soviet Union, it was a closely guarded location, where they performed a secret weapons research.
Today, it is considered to be the district with 216 000 inhabitants, remote 37 miles from Moscow Center, "Russian Silicon Valley".
There are significant micro- and nanoelektronická research and manufacturing centre.
Since September 2008 established zelenogradští contacts with representatives of Frankfurt scientific centre Riedberg - with the university institutions and firms frankfurtského Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There has been a series of mutual visits and on Wednesday signed in Frankfurt and Zelenograd Ridberg "the Protocol on close co-operation".
The Russian delegation was led Moscow Yuri vícestarosta Rosljak and the prefect of Anatoly Zelenogradu Smirnov in Frankfurt foot the head clerk planning Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, they'll go representatives FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises involved in research on one seminar in Zelenogradu.
Scientific exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZu companies will be allowed to grip the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, the Russian scientific firms want to get a contract in Germany.
Zelenograd is the major russian research institutes and companies.
These include the need for the Moscow Institute of electronic technology, large groups and Sitronics Rossijskaja electronics.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planning" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (the literal translation of the "Green City") acquired its name in the wooded hilly landscape in which they are given a research facility.
Stuttgartská brake
Dimension Stuttgart 21 simply can not adequately prepare.
For fans of the project is quite simply a "new heart of Europe".
Well. S21 is more than running the station, more than a monstrous building, which throws the capital of Baden-Württemberg for a decade building a desperate chaos.
Stuttgart 21 originated from the spirit of the 1980s.
Hlavové station with the rails, which ended in the centre of town, was then considered to be a reach-technical fossils of the 19th century, which acts as a brake modern rail transport, because it had to be enormously much time on přepřáhnutí locomotives from the back to the front.
Go, stop for a moment, go on - so it should work.
And why are disappearing hlavová station: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit station, which lies roughly in the middle of the route of trans-European highway between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - hence the slogan of "the heart of Europe".
Indeed, starting with S21, although the vision of the 80 years are no longer compatible with reality.
Ourselves very ambitious designers know that the Hessen and Bavarian metropolis is the start of construction almost neufinancovatelné.
Since there is a modern shuttle trains in motor vehicles and managing at both ends, they don't have any problems with the train station hlavová zajížděním and vyjížděním.
Still: It starts with the Stuttgart 21, with a new track ICE to Ulm.
Enforce that surface and local politicians.
Track shall cooperate, because of the risk of an individual's biggest infrastructure project in the Czech Republic will be borne by the taxpayer and no public concern.
Urban, the project is still some way to apologize.
A new urban area , which - if we are to believe the computer images - will contain many green .
For rail transport system is S21 harmful.
Transit station and the construction of the line are designed for passenger transport, which - typically in the 80 years - highlighted the huge increase.
Then there was no competition from low-cost flights.
Modern transport policy has to go but primarily for the strengthening of freight transport, because the rail transport is more environmentally friendly than the freight car on the road.
But a new line is not due to a sharp rise suitable for freight trains.
Even more important is that the S21, indirectly affects many other railway projects.
In Švábsku should bury a good six billion euros.
This is the official number.
Experts consider to be the real ten to 15 billion.
It is clear that the next decade will miss the finances for the next hub points and narrow space on the network.
On the list of the Ministry of Transport is sixty larger projects.
One of the most important is the construction of approximately 180 kilometers long route through the valley of the Rhine.
Since 1987, on this route puts the slow pace.
There would be a need for a push.
But S21 will be as a brake.
The track of the Rhine valley will become the neck of the bottle of international freight transport: Directly in the heart of Europe.
The government is studying the judgment on the airport
The government has been left in the open land Wiesbadenském, if he goes against the judgment of the Court of Justice (VGH Hessian administrative) regarding the ban on night flights and allow him to reconsider.
A coalition of the CDU / FDP commissioned experts to legally consider more than 400stránkový judgment VGH, said Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
In Today in writing so that the state would have to , in the case of the planned construction of the northwest of the runway airport newly edit a ban on night flights .
The authorisation 17 flights between 23 and 5 minutes ago, as envisaged in the Earth's government does not comply with the statutory protection of the population against the night air noise.
The coalition must decide on 4 January, if it will require a revision of the judgment.
The opposition criticized the delay and dorážela the representative of the Government to waive review of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The boss of the SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel challenged the CDU and FDP that returning to the promises about the ban on night flights, which began before the election. Otherwise, it is possible to rate as a "violation of the words".
It is a difficult, if you can keep his word, "said the head of the Greens Tarek al-Wazir that alluded to the election slogan FDP" My Word holding ".
The Minister rejected the complaint Posch Schäfer-Gümbel, provincial government is trying through "misstating the law and tricks" to get to their nocturnal flights.
The precise legal control needs their time.
The coalition wants to work on the basis of "quick first impression".
We need a realistic decision, he said Stefan Müller (FDP).
Statements of his faction to ban night flights were never such as made opposition.

Speed Dial
It was a faster than expected.
Station successor unveiled just two weeks after the Board pushed out of office ZDF editor Nikolaus Brender.
Last night, the panel wanted to agree on that person.
For the favorite was called Peter Frey, the head of the studio ZDF in the capital city in Berlin.
Station, but it has not been proven - officially to nepředbíhala process.
The role it could play but also that they did not want to damage the ZDF Markuse Schächtera , if this proposal for the management board has not passed .
Frey, Schächterův, the candidate needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the panel.
The result of the vote was not known before the close of this issue.
Two weeks ago, stranded in the Administrative Board Schächter with its proposal to extend the engineers Nikolaus Brenderem contract for another five years.
Brender voted for only seven members, seven were against him. Brenderova loss of the mandate was for Schachter bitter defeat, although she expected.
Union's majority in the Governing Board of the signal for several weeks before the election, he does not want the office to confirm Brender.
Resistance to the editor organized hesenský Premier Roland Koch.
He refused to remain in office highly weighted the editor of the argument that Brendera fell quota monitoring of the news .
Until shortly before the election were therefore protests, in which he sharply criticized the political influence on ZDF.
The last time in the debate vmísilo even 35 státoprávních lawyers who Kochův process heralded as unconstitutional.
It was no good.
On the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, education and romanistiku.
Then he worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
1983 crossed Frey to ZDF, first to "heute-journal."
Next stop: 1988 to 1990 personnel clerk, editor; 1991 / 92 correspondent in Washington; in 1998, the head of a moderator "Morgenmagazins"; in 2001, the head of foreign policy ZDF; since then, the head of a major studio ZDF.
After she was Brender, which was at the centre of the elected expert periodikem Medium magazin journalist of the year, Green announced that it will report a constitutional complaint.
Kochův opponent in the Administrative Board, rýnsko-falcký Prime Minister, Kurt Beck, said last week that the Land would change the state's contract with ZDF so that the staff of the quartermaster proposals could not be blocked a politically motivated mostly.
Beck but also refused to the exclusion of party politicians of supervisory councils ZDF.
Brenderův presumed successor, Peter Frey, the Administrative Board ordered a chess shrewd move - immediately after the toppling Brendera panel criticized heavily for it.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence would be nominated for the post of editor without losing face as Schächter, so he could be elected by the Administrative Board, without coming into the suspicion that he was straník protlačen into office.
In the party arithmetic is Frey already classified to the leftist liberals.

Now, for the first time, they are filled with specific content.
The so-called accreditation Council concluded that the number of tests, in part, to drastically reduce: "Each module will usually end once the test," writes in a 30-page report, which is due, in part, to re-regulate the approval of academic disciplines.
"Significantly lower zkouškovou burden," said the chairman of the accreditation council Reinhold Grimm, is to be "stopped bad development that significantly limited the performance of the studio."
To be "performance of the studio" in the future, "the decisive criterion" in the implementation.
The modules and contents of the " hard " to " unnecessarily , a student in the choice of
Seminars ".
Students should "be entitled to the space, which allows and encourages its own initiative".
The rules are to apply for approval of the new subjects, after a review, but also for the current academic disciplines.
You need to be "přeakreditovat" every five years – which means, however, that will take until 2015 before they are rechecked all fields of study.
He is responsible for all over Germany ten accreditation agencies, which are subject to the accreditation councils established states.
Ministers of Culture in October called "strongly" Land to the agency, in ways that the content of the curriculum was too big and Examination system was strict.
In the individual Länder are already universities and colleges have agreed with terrestrial ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country in the Rhineland-Palatinate pledged additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
The money should pay for counselling programmes in high school and study advice, and to strengthen the test and foreign offices.
You want to country and high school to spend ten million euros.
At the beginning of the year 2010 wants to submit to the Parliament amendments to the higher education law .
According to her, for the termination of the study of the module should be required only a single test.
The study should be more flexible, it has to be guaranteed by the recognition of tests from other universities and relieve the disclosure of the master's degree.
By the end of next year should be checked performance of all study subjects in the country.
The government and the opposition on Thursday again indulged about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise fell also criticism of resolution.
Federal Board of higher Juso groups called for the creation of education policy in the future neodehrávala "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
at the latest after a strike would " go to talk to at least have a word " students as of the person concerned .
Future scholars also receive support from the president of the Conference of Rectors of higher education (HRK) Wintermantelové Margret: "We need the experience of students," she said Thursday at a meeting of ministers of culture, with which HRK advice on reform of the common report.
In accordance with the departments of Education and Science (GEW Bonn resolution) did not go far enough: They demand a legal claim that would have Absolventovi s bakalářským nástavbové title to allow access to the branch.
Second, the Land must ensure that for today's generation of students bachelor subjects was tomorrow enough seats in the Masters of study fields with what the best study conditions, said the member of the Board of Directors GEW Andreas Keller.
The Federal countries must employ more speakers.
Ministers of Culture , but the free access to the programmes .
More than a footnote to Hertě Müllerové
To get into and out of Germany's nice, almost no control... "is the opening line of a poem poet Werner Söllnera, which in this torn piece of language with experience with přicestováním one dissenter, which gained freedom came at the same time, but for their language environment.
Söllner Werner was born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a lecturer of a child book publishing, 1982 then moved to Frankfurt am Main.
He was honored Söllner different literary awards, 1993 lectured poetry at the legendary Goethe University in Frankfurt, and since 2002, he was the leader of the Hessian fora literature in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
A considerable stir mimoliterární care last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, which were a "German literature in Romania in the mirror and a broken mirror of its security act".
Apparently uncomfortable and left dumbfounded Söllner declaration in front of fellow writers Romanian Germans, including Richard Wagner, William Totokem, Franz Hodjakem and Helmuth Frauendorferem accords to work as a secret informer of the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of the present Söllner won the 1989 German language prize.
Attempts at recruiting apparently began quietly, first in 1971.
I continued Söllner, "meaning someone who wouldn't sufficiently attempts at intimidation by the Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is a secret agent Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize Hertě Müllerové and its bezpříkladným literary dealing with the mechanisms of the dictatorial government's literary scene, and particularly a community of German authors originating in Romania, shaken case that indicates the depths and appalling political system, which is based on the control and špicování.
Werner Söllner is, at least if it can be said, according to the current state of knowledge, as an offender, but is also a victim.
In Acts Securitate secret agent Walter played a role, said after the award Söllnerově Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence on him of a secret agent Walter.
"Cutting" me in all of the important points for him, saying good-by.
Has a moral obligation to make this note.
Söllnerovo statement was in this form and before the audience the unexpected, but very surprising return of former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not.
Herta Müller wrote in July, when reading their own deeds, 914 pages, that Germany was a nice reserve for Securitate informer.
Concerned, it can be assumed to be speculating and in some cases probably know which name is hidden behind the code name Sorin, Voicu, and just as well Walter.
Other than in the domestic, meanwhile, has a way of viewing Stazi, is a relic of the handling of inspections of the Securitate very diffuse.
In the last few years has been marred by systematic education and hampered.
One of the Birthlerových offices, which corresponds to the National Board for processing components of the Securitate (CNSAS), was founded in 1999, the issue of the act was done since more slowly.
Only since 2005, there is a law that governs the management of folders.
That former members of the Securitate in Romania have still a big influence, documented after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller a conversation in which one of the former Securitate leaders from Timisoara, commented on nositelce awards hostile.
Has said psychosis, after all, was questioned only once.
Power potupení here quite openly expressed in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, that the case Söllner, as in the context of zamlčeným guilt, connected inevitable questions.
Why now? Who was marred? Specific response to return, it leaves the audience Söllnerovo expected that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by the desire for knowledge rather than lots are awarded by guilt and shame.
The genesis of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday received the Nobel Prize, it's more than a footnote.
Saturated the Champions League
It looked as if he came clean clothes sales representative from a Christmas party for the sporting goods distributed sweets, getting a quarter of an hour after midnight on C-class Mercedes out a new coach VfBr Christian Gross, followed by orange-colored bag sponsor. ¨
The man with the marked bald spot for him after he had left the ship in a foreign city.
Otherwise he could drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and drunk happiness was 55letý man too little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow will continue to work.
Or is it just started.
In the words of only three days of committed Swiss messenger: "We have reached osmifinále", namely in the Champions League thanks to výhře3: 1 over Unirea Urziceni in Romania, "but we mustn't get dazzled success: It will be brutally tough fighting's descent left."
"Far more important task" facing us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the exercise in Mainz and in the royal class of ordinary league date.
And to prevent the recurrence of an apparent groin after three quick gólech Maricy (5.), Träsche (8) and Pogrebnyaka (11).
Draw lots
Osmifinále Champions League (match 16 / 17. + 23 / 24 February / retaliation match 9 / 10. + 16 / 17 March) will draw lots of 18 December in Nyon.
Joy of třeskavého taking Babbelova successor will therefore be maintained.
Not only the alleged healer is uncertain Stuttgart professionals said during a short period of self-confidence, willingness to deploy and joy of the game.
I went to the players and told them that they should focus on your strengths and urging them to be bolder, explained the healer souls Gross so simple-sounding successful recipe that but for the presence of a therapist Babbela but no longer had any effect.
Spurred on a certain magic, he admitted Babbelův follower Jens Lehmann, "when it comes to new impetus in football, they are sometimes things that you would think of themselves as possible."
A Sami Khedira, who after mnohatýdenní break caused by injury, became, thanks to its dynamism once the best player on the pitch, he tried to describe the observed "phenomenon" proverbial "fresh wind" and the working procedures of the new boss: "He's a man who is radical and requires discipline .
That is what we need in the current situation . "
For Babbela obviously missing.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet saved, warns sports the President Horst Heldt
VfB Stuttgart needs but more stability.
They won't even as top players and managers overestimate the victory against a weakened auto parts and totally overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.
I would have won in Glasgow, then came an ugly awakening after the defeat of 0-4 in Leverkusenu, consider Khedira.
A Sports President Horst Heldt reminded that they have achieved one objective in the season, but the other is still far away.
We're not out of the woods.
He on his 40th birthday celebrated Heldt even after the first domestic victory after three months, was due to víkendovými events, which recently revived in the form of a television interview with the backup goalie Jensem Lehmannem just before the start of the game.
The decision, which makes the others; and not Jens, said Heldt on hard Lehmannovu criticism.
Předhazoval board of weak leadership and decided to change the coach after pressure pubertálních fans.
And that was canceled the day off after the game, Lehmann described as a sign of lack of sovereignty and envy.
Remarks Lehmannovy "mouthing clean egoism," said Heldt and announced the consequences for the goalie.
Both in their 40s will not have probably no joy of life.
In any case, you are the one with the other, that without work sesazeného trenérského hráčsky team would not be so strong and rampant performance.
Babbel and his assistants were "a big share of the success," says Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and a man with a plastic bag agrees.

Case Kundúz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Chief Greens Jürgen Trittin called because of bad information on the affairs of Kunduz Defense Guttenberg a liar.
The SPD and the Linke (Levice) Chancellor invited to submit an explanation.
Hamburg / Berlin -
The minister to a lethal bombing of two tanks in September said "deliberate way", said the chief of the fraction of the Greens Jürgen Trittin in Saturday's news agenda ARD "Tagesschau".
Call it the usual expression: He lied.
Orders for the killing was issued in breach of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the message, which was NATO, he had read Mr. Guttenberg said Trittin.
On Friday it emerged that the attack was not only the destruction of the hijacked truck, but the targeted killing of two leaders of the Taliban.
In the U.S. raid that claimed the German commander Kundúzu Colonel Klein, an investigation by NATO to kill or wound up to 142 people.
Green, the SPD and the Linke challenge on Saturday Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) that immediately expressed before the Federal Energy Saving and also clarify what he really knew Guttenberg about this event.
Mrs Merkel must explain whether he's strategy of targeted killings part of the Afghan policy, the council - and, if the Chancellor, Bundeswehr and Intelligence this new strategy approved, have called Jürgen Trittin, and a colleague from the Greens Renate Künastová.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm firmly rejected criticism.
The Office of Chancellor has no effect on the actual deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.

According to the information, der Spiegel reported both Guttenberga correctly and completely on the background of the attack on the tanker.
There was a Oficielně that they had to deny the existence of the messages of NATO and concealing the Minister of sensitive details.

It is noted that it has not yet received a response.
Ministry on Saturday did not comment on complaints and pointed out that this will be addressed at the investigative committee of the Bundestag, which will be appointed next Wednesday.
The worlds dreams
Some see the images in the waking state and hear voices that others see and hear.
Not only the mentally ill or in the drug influence are the boundaries between imagination and reality.
Until this occurs during sleep, everything is fine.
If we lie to shut our eyes in a dark room, we may surround the wildest imagination and fantastical delusions.
But who is experiencing a dream-like states of vigilance, sees and hears things that others see and hear are at today's Western world mostly a fool or a drug dependent, or at least as eccentric.
But such images and voices are due not only for the mentally ill or in the drug intoxication.
Guilt is our imagination: The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, here and there to take care of that blend the boundaries between dream, vision and reality.
The dreams of the altered state of consciousness may be present in various forms, at best, we call them a vision in the worst delusions.
Even if the initiator and effect may vary, however, vision mystičky Hildegard von Bingen, drug experiences of the Prophet New-Age Carlos Castanedy, estimated that states of delirium, psychoses and hallucinations derived from similar processes.
Delusions or hallucinations arise when the derailment balance neuronálních transmitérů - especially the brain's dopamine, noradrenalin (norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
A comprehensive hallucinations and wandering thoughts occur very often in the schizophrenic psychosis .
Gravity above it does not have the power
The link between dreams and delusions of employed doctors and philosophers since antiquity.
Aristotle understood as a form of hallucination, a dream in the waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, said in 1861 "the great similarity ravings with dream states, the Sigmund Freud was a dream even" psychosis, with all the nonsense, delusion, deception of the senses " .
It is the autumn of 2001, Henning T. is amended in comic figure.
His body is a two-dimensional, and brightly colored.
Gravity above it has no power, hovering near the ceiling of the room.
Feels the kick.
Behind him the winged spirited figures with blood red grimace, cenící teeth.
Chasing him, kick him in the heavy, fiery shoes, throwing him on the wall, feel the pain throughout the body.
Loud, evil voices from the walls and threaten the radio.
We can not tolerate voices that curse and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from the stereo, zauzlí it into a loop and fastened it on a hook on the ceiling.
Stand up to one speaker and you can loop around the neck.
Jumping.
Loop permits.
Learn, a chorus of voices shouting trhajíc his eardrums, "go to the clinic and get help!"
Today's Henning T. 40 years, has seen six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first for nearly 20 years ago.
They were running LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoafektivní paranoická psychosis, moreover, there is a manic-depressive, he takes medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with their disease, three years is married.
In a psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and deep doubts, he says.
The ghosts are a terrible reality
About one percent of people get sick at least once in a lifetime schizophrenia in psychiatric clinics is the second most commonly depression treatment of disease.
An acute schizophrenic psychosis can usually distinguish between the inner and outer world into přebuzeného condition, which can lead to weeks, velikostním, vztahovým delusions or delusions of persecution.
Especially widespread is hearing voices - voices that Command, comment or maintain dialogue.
Neither optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The person is not able to distinguish between the important from the unimportant, the brain can filter spurious signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Just as the dream of psychosis opens the floodgates of a barrage of ideas and fantasies that originate from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the body, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief surgeon general psychiatric Clinic the university clinic in Heidelberg.
A schizophrenic is located in the centre of the stage, it is important směřovaný at him.
At the same time, it is a passive role, becoming, like a dream, overwhelmed by events and cannot is actively shape.
Schizophrenia is therefore often feel threatened, manipulated and controlled.
Comparison with reality is not usually possible for them, they are a terrible reality, awakening is out of the question.
Once in a lifetime experience hallucination
Otherwise than in a dream, says Fuchss, "but still sensual and spatial structure of the fact that one sees in psychosis, substantially preserved."
The erratic thoughts and hallucinations are based on the reality of the experience is occurring in the real framework.
Scientists is still the puzzle as to why our brain is doing exactly the sort of twists.
The exceptional conditions for each person can lead to lose in the short-term relationship to reality, says Fuchs.
Not everyone, however, develop into a psychosis.
It seems that there is a genetic disposition to schizophrenia, but the twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists are based on the fact that disabled people have a minimum damage to the brain .
We believe that in the early stage of development will damage the neuronal maturation of the brain, such as viral diseases of the mother during pregnancy, says Fuchs.
But it remains a puzzle, as there is a failure of neuronal systems, which in doing so for years does not materialize.
The role of the effects of the neighborhood - stress or traumatic experiences can be instigated psychosis, if it is to her disposition.
Also the hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis, because the transmission system.
When our brain tube
Crazy is that psychotronici suffers from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, swallowed expensive medication, others give you money for drugs to be gained, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
If the images we perceive as pleasant or unpleasant, it is often just a matter of attitude.
Kasten collector for ten years, reports of hallucinations and delusions, in the last year interpreted their results in the book "Die Welt irreale in unserem Kopf" (unreal world in our head).
Hallucinations belongs to a typical accompanying phenomena psychóz, but also to the surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to the psychiatric disorders such as a borderline personality or depression also often diseases like a migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer or brain trauma.
Surprisingly halucinuje under certain conditions, and by a healthy person's brain.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, is composed of the contents of the ideas that are normally suppressed.
They arise when the part of the brain, which processes sensory perception, are too active or little repressed; if our brains tube, or when there is a lack of stimulation.
Drugs can run this state as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the withdrawal of incentives, stress, worry about love or other more exceptional States.
In the most recent studies had reported up to one-third of those surveyed reported at least once in your life experienced an hallucination.
In the summer of 2005 is Sarah K. 16 years old, lives in a small town in eastern Pomerania Meklenbursku-front and goes to the grammar school.
In fact, a normal girl.
If there were not the shapes and voices.
At recess, it may be that appeals to her bony with long, dark hair.
When he replies, looking at her classmates with a surprise - no one except her see and hear the boy.
This coy girl as stiff a dreamer, but Sarah K.-eater, knows it.
Is awake, hears and sees the boy, exactly as they hear and see the girl sitting next to each bench.
May even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he has the boy like.
I'm crazy?, asks ever.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and disappears.
In the night are rather depressing .
They are often delusions burden.
Sitting in class, can not how many times monitor teaching, because the teacher in her eyes and ears just represents a new classmate, but he explains all other audibly, and visible on the board of the mathematical equation.
In the night of phenomena rather depressing.
While waiting in his dark room to sleep, which comes rarely and too late, often can not distinguish whether it is awake or if she was asleep, if the images he sees, grimacing, or cutting a girl with bleeding wounds on the hands and feet resulting from her open or eyes closed.
Leave me alone, shouting at the figures.
Parents and friends say anything about it, thought it about her that was crazy.
The autumn of 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
Last year did high school graduation and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted on the internet psychologist Kasten, knows exactly that went mad.
The images are also the art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or had taken incentives will likely hallucinations, says Kasten.
I believe that the brain then doesn't have enough employment and old himself for his own amusement .
Sarah K., an only child, she was a little girl fear of the other children, often played by herself.
Her hallucinations began when, at 13, she learned that the man who says he since she thinks is her own father.
Because the visual and acoustic hallucinations are active the same brain areas that process the real sensations and sounds, for people like Sarah K. difficult to distinguish from one another delusion and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, the reality shows there.
Hallucinations are also images that allow the brain occur, so the real work."
Also the dreams evaluates Kasten as a form of hallucinations.
Hallucinations healthy people does not differ fundamentally from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizofrenikům are mentally healthy people will be able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advise their patients to evaluate the hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
Border state between dreams and hallucinations
In our world, concentrated too much on the minds is an imaginary experience, unfortunately, the majority patologizován, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor in Heidelberg and the Chief Medical Officer psychotherapy and Psychiatric Clinic Hospital-Florence Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is difficult, útrpná disease, but it also provides the positives, creativity - a mirage is also art of despair.
The so-called Schmidt-Degenhard oneiroidní form of experiences, a special form of changed the consciousness of the dream.
Oneiroidní states are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams, which is considered to be the real and can't even re-distinguished from waking.
Oneiroidní state of consciousness arises in extreme situations caused by trauma or illness, such as hepatitis polyradikulárním patients who experience fully conscious motor paralysis.
If a person is threatened by the loss of the world and themselves, to be continued, the complete inability of movement, will be replaced with a life-threatening the real situation of their own, imagined a world that is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
The type of the state between dreams and hallucinations.
Because in reality it is not possible to deal with any situation, there is a change of worlds, the real situation but zpřítomní the idea.
Intensive form of aid senses and the transfer of the senses in an intolerable situation, which allows people to his own ability to shape, change in an instant by a loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, and later in the memories
Also, the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen oneiroidní describes his experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (Replacement Heart) as a rescue of the soul.
He was 49 years old when, after the operation with subsequent heart valves of the heart transplant was his awareness for several days of travel, with his body lay motionless in intensive care.
Claussen sank into a world that had formed, visited foreign time and place: the old man upoutaným on the bed, in the train the sanatorium, the robot guarding his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the aristocracy, which manufactures narcotic substances in the blood.
Greek kidnaps him on the bike to his homeland, in a hospital bed in the Alps or surfing on firnu meets the Korean mobster.
Completely immersed in an imaginary wrong, everything is fair, and later in memory.
These internal path for Claussena fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a different situation, describes his experience.
In contrast to the dreams are memories of the mental pathways across the years and about minor details plainly obvious.
Even clearer and more intense than the actual experience.
The intensity of this experience shatters the horizon of our other opravdivých experience, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, show oneiroidní anxiety, psychosis, hallucinations and drug intoxication, how fragile are also waking up our internal images of external reality.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarises the psychologist Kasten, "can lead to distortion of what we call reality."
The fact that may also be enriching.
The snow may come
Burda
In the 27 to take over the children .
The new head of publishing Kallen is a temporary solution: The long-term wants to Hubert Burda forward his business into the hands of his two children, der Spiegel said.
Holding is also in the future include 100 percent family.
Hamburg - publisher Hubert Burda sees his business in the long term, in the hands of their children.
Both children will inherit in 27 years and have a strong will to join the company, says the man 69letý Spiegel.
The details are to be handled carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company, will be taken later.
And the question of whether to have the ability.
It is not possible to take the 7500 employees their children if they are not sufficiently capable of .
That would be killed as children, so the company.
Burda on Thursday announced that from January withdraws from the presidency of the Board of Directors, and appointed as his successor, Paul-Bernhard Kallen's niece.
Kallen 52 years since 1999 Member of the board of Burda.
First, he was in charge of technology.
Later, with the Cashier section added responsibility for the company's assets and the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfera the direct marketing, Foreigners, Printing and Finance.
For the first time in publishing, none of the members of the family.
Burdovým children are 19 and 17 years, his son Felix, who would today be 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen's niece also serves to "bridged the 10, 15 years," Burda said.
Holding should in future include 100 with the family, says Burda.
Having regard to the cases and Schickedanz Schaeffler, Burda said that neither family businesses do not have confidence in the run-off: "It has always been hurt by companies that have been infected with the desire of capital, which speculated and thought it may become major players.
It has never been my strategy.
He never had "dreams of world power," says Burda.
Disregard the preceptor as the policy of this country, as he was Springer, and I don't want to play the world with "Time", these shops are too big.
Promise FonPeek
Peak is extremely limited, serve only to explore the mail, without the ability to view a type of attachments or surfing in the network.
Enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S., when Time magazine praised it as one of the products of the year.
It is difficult to see out there, but the idea may be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphonů Peak is characterised by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount payable for example, for a data plan for the iPhone.
After his success, the company has started offering two new devices: One is intended exclusively for Twitter, second on the basis of permanently provided free data service, for which it is necessary to pay for the Peak six changes amount.
FonPeek, which was presented yesterday to try Le Web, is a European version of invention, and at the same time, his third transformation.
Is limited, as well as his american counterpart, but it brings a surprise.
The monthly price for maintenance is around 12 euros per month and includes the roaming across Europe.
People travelling with smartphonem already know what it means to lose data services after crossing the border or impatiently seek café with WiFi (or inserting Fon), so they can view the mail.
The idea of having roomingem at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should be put in place for a long time.
Yes, some operators have specific contracts and travel plans, but in my experience, one would need a doctorate in physics, in order to understand them, and very good glasses to read the miniature letters.
The European Commission has sought to reduce roaming tariffs so that they are available for the whole of Europe, which still does not have the desired effect.
There is a reasonable concern on the use of data services outside the home .
The fact that such a machine like FonPeek (interestingly, still has the name Fon when there is no WiFi) reaches this type of fare, means that the operators are starting to think otherwise, and is considering various offers kterýmiby kompenzovali its data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offers downloads of books and other searches on the Internet.
No contract, no complications.
This device is connected and paid for the purchase, rather than months.
And that is exactly what I expect to occur once in případěFonPeek, it is a possibility to book with permanent access as the Peak has already established in the US.
Not because I wanted to buy it.
I am looking through the mail, on the phone, thank you.
I expect it, because I think that it's from the point of view of the consumer boom type.
It would be interesting if the same system used in the computer.
Color, kterouzbožňuje Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly a favorite color of the first ladies .
For Barack Obama for the office of U.S. president chose to dress and coat in the color, the same color can also be chosen when accompanying him on the second most important moment of his life: the transmission of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.

Women, who do not work outside the home, working part-time or have a stable job, starting with a partner to live before, previously gave birth to their first child and generally have more children.
From the other side, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector partner cohabitation and motherhood delay, and have fewer offspring.
"Women from 35 to 49 years with stable jobs have their first child at an average of 3.7 years from the start of living with a partner. The number of 4.1 in the case of the women kterédosažení its stable jobs are dedicated to the greater part of his life, and thus have had to postpone the partner relationship, and the arrival of children.
The type of the profession has also had a strong influence on maternity, even if a smaller effect on the duration of living with a partner, "explains margaritas Delgado, devoted to the research in the CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of the marriage of a child is the level of education .

"There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with basic schooling to marry and gave birth to their first child before they find a stable job, while women with a medium or high education ’ s reverse prefer to obtain a stable employment, before the conclusion of a marriage and the birth of the first child, "says Delgado.

The positive figure is better to put in quarantine since November 2008 is very bad period for comparison and marked 60% reduction compared with the previous year.
The consequence is that despite the rise in the last month, the total number of registered vehicles in the last 11 months are 40% less than in the previous financial year.
Since January was prodáno95.853 vehicles, which includes all possible vehicles falling into the category of light commercial vehicles: Derivatives of passenger cars, pick pneuservis less freight cars and light trucks / chassis.
And not even the gloom which harm the demand, even if it is bought by private individuals, most of the purchases were made smaller and medium-sized businesses, and almost 100% of the cases, it is the financing through third parties.
The limitations arising from the conclusion of bank lending resources should be added and other factors such as the cessation of activity or continuation of poor economic situation.
In the situation, unlike the coaches, support for the purchase of 2000E too.
In addition to private individuals, it is necessary to mention iosoby doing business to business license for small and medium-sized businesses, which they plan to purchase a light utility vehicle to 3.5 tonnes of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday from Ganvamu reminded once again that there is a need to pay special attention to the management of these vehicles as well as industrial cars (trucks and buses).

The system for the handbrake is already mandatory equipment.
As in the case of antiblokovacího ABS system, it will be with the ESP stability control, auxiliary systems of the handbrake, it all becomes mandatory equipment of European cars.
In fact, already form part of the required equipment all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while the other is determined by the deadline for the removal of the shortage, which it is February 2011.
The measures introduced in the EU aims to enhance the protection of pedestrians, the works so that it can help to avoid the many collisions.
Auxiliary hand brake system increases the pressure on the brakes in an emergency, this system detects when the driver presses.
But not always able to keep the pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by an automotive parts manufacturer Bosch, a third of drivers who have an accident, nesešlápli brake before the collision, and half of them did not use the full power of the brakes.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires maximum braking systems, reducing the stopping distance of the vehicle.
According to a study conducted by the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of device, it could prevent up to 1 in 100 fatalities per year related to pedestrians.
A reduction in this rate will be even more marked-based on calculations would avoid one of the four casualties with an impact on a person-following the introduction of the so-called intelligent systems of the handbrake.
In this case, the vehicle is fitted with a system that (using radar and cameras) captures the obstacles and reports them to the driver, except for the light braking.
If the driver responds, it will help to increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not react, even in the event of a collision cannot be avoided, the device will act as a brake on a nejintenzivněji and reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.

On the basis of was, in the first instance, automatic convertible top is on the canvas version with the manual control, thus weight decreased by 21 kg; aluminum doors were used, such as the GT3, which means a further 15 kg less; the elimination of air conditioning, 13; reducing the fuel tank of the 64-54 gallons also contributed to the reduction in weight by a further 7 kg; after their sport seats for the next 12 kg, thanks odlehčeným 19palcovým kolůmdalších five pounds.
And finally , the removal of audiosystému CDR-30 means a further six kilograms less and the replacement of door úchytek textile úchytkami means more per kilogram .
It also offers with dvouspojkovou PDK gearbox, it was tested in a vehicle with manual řazenou šestistupňovou speed chassis, mainly on the road in the second-class in California, on the mountain areas with many tricky curves.
His behavior may be regarded only as sacrosanct.
The weight reduction does not mean that the vehicle to the asphalt .
It's just the opposite: We no longer netestovali so small and light model, which would also let a safety in the movement in the bend, even at high speeds.
It's a little athlete able to warm up the muscles in the short run, after a sufficient period of time until he nenařídíme sprint, braking, and the renewal of the engine.
Whatever we want. Thanks to the proceedings, which is as communicative as accurate, whatever naznačíme hands on the steering wheel is what the car does.
And it with surgical precision.
The sound of the engine according to the will of
Sound V6 boxer of 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is a master-and it is possible to exaggerate the possibility of 'sport' and a system which modifies the sound of the engine, which was previously used for Panamera.
The capacity of the acceleration is brutal, either in the air or recovery.
The curtains are solid, but not hard or uncomfortable.
Asphalt roads, which we pass with the Boxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car well teach potholes.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the journey, and while we are in some corners came at dawn on the ice and gravel, even in late afternoon.
Finally, this ultra-light car is one of the most enjoyable on the market because it was something more than a mere modification Boxster S.
The car will be put up for sale in February 2010 for cenu70.831 euros.

Thank you
After days of wine and roses since last spring, when inflation assets amounted to the prevailing mood in the markets was once again showed the uncertainty in the markets, which should not be surprising, because it is no longer the natural state in an environment where managers receive a decision on the future, which itself is uncertain.
The drug used by central banks to stabilize the market, it was the liquidation of debt through direct purchases of assets and an indirect free up liquidity at a rate of close to zero, so that financial institutions can buy assets to the deduction.
The central bank has already confirmed that direct purchases of assets has virtually ended, and without being questioned its disparate policy of liquidity, start throwing a bit of sand in the wheels as the Spanish Central Bank, with its auctions in the past year.
Investors, therefore challenge the ability of the world economy to keep the economic recovery without the heterodox measures, and participate in the return of risk reduction benefits.
The volatility in stock markets and the differences dluhopisůspolečností re-gain points, although they are still very remote abnormal levels, which have reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk, which again affected the public debt.
Again, the pressure and the quality of the US, Japan and Germany have become a haven for the selected investors, thereby expanding differentiation of euro-zone countries against Germany.
Spain this instability almost was not affected, but at that time came, Standard &amp; Poor's and threatened to new revisions to the reduction in capacity of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is useless for the mute supporters of moral hazard, who were re-tried to pose to the conscience of the persons responsible for the world ’ s economic policy for the application of destructive consequences of reducing the loan on employment, when in fact it should declare a new Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai is a tribal struggle between the Emir to restore power in the Emirates, and as for Greece, we have seen before.
The government, which covers the deficit, the election and the new government board.
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barrosovi.
It makes no sense for the Ecofin Council saving Hungary before the failure of foreign payments at the beginning of the year, and to allow for the country ’ s membership of the euro complied with its obligations.
But what makes sense, it's that the Ecofin forced the Greek government to transparency and obliging citizens to a shared responsibility in the need for emergency measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we find ourselves before the standardisation of premiums from the transitional risk, after some excesech on assisted positions would have been within expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in the public debt will rise, as well as bonds of European companies, we don't have to worry about.
If the European differences will be reduced, and our continued to expand, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. If our leading indicators are forcing most of its services to anticipate the recovery scenario studies and revise your script rise in 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission to return to Japan scenario, for the Spanish economy, it does not bode well for the great hope of survival to comply with this warning.
Once again, it seems that it will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the time being "careful, buddy drivers".

In his view, is "a clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite "accurate" measure, as it's called the president of the Iberdrola.
Whatever the case, Galán believes that the investment decisions, although long, must begin to take now, because their maturation remains and requires a stable tax framework for their initiation.
