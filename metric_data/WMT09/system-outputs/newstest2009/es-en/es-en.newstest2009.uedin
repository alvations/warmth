The Prague Stock Exchange ended with less points at the end of the day 
After the rapid fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses. 
The transactions of the actions of ČEZ reached approximately half of their value in a normal day. 
The stock exchange of Prague, at the start of trading Tuesday, reacted immediately to the fall of Monday when fell about 6%. 
The reduction of this time was due to the collapse of the actions on Wall Street. 
Meanwhile, also expresses the market reaction to the outcome of the vote of the House of Representatives that American refused to support the plan of stabilisation of the secretary of the financial sector. 
Fall of the actions in Asia 
The actions of the Tuesday Asian stock markets experienced a dramatic decline, but throughout the day, the index atenuó finally part of the losses. 
The stock market, the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong over its financial hours was almost a four percent, although later atenuó their losses by reducing the decline in almost a 2.5 percent. 
The Hang Seng index China Enterprises that remains the movements of the Chinese actions in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell by 3.8 per cent, in Shanghai, the markets were closed.

The stock exchange of Taiwan, according to the secretary of the Index fell to a 3.6 percent. 
"The rescue actions planned in the US are unsafe and this affects the financial markets around the world," said the head of the Office of Hong Kong Coin, Joseph Yam. 
Although Hong Kong is part of China, she sóla determines its monetary policy, that is, without dependency on the Central Bank of China. 
Interest rates of Hong Kong are at the same level as those of the United States. 
American lawmakers should meet again as soon as possible, according to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system. 
In another way, threatening that the declines will be felt in other countries. 
The bloody bathroom American actions 
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the plan to help the financial system to which we should spend 700 billion dollars (almost a 12 billion kronor). 
The lawmakers, in that way, ignored the invitation of President George Bush to support his plan. 
For Bush, the plan would solve the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and would help to stabilise the whole economy. 
On Monday, the American actions lived a bloody bathroom and mainly the stock index picked up the biggest drop in more than 20 years. 
The Dow Jones index fell to nearly seven per cent, a fall of volume similar recorded for the last time in 1987. 
The index fell before being announced but as soon showed that the proposal of the assembly not came out ahead, the index began to fall freely. 
The congress is cut: The US government can inject 700 billion dollars in the banking 
The most senior representatives in Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed in a pact in broad terms of financial aid to the American financial system. 
The vote will take place at the beginning of next week. 
American lawmakers led to a gap in the talks on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of aid to the American financial system with the amount of 700 billion dollars (about $12 trillion kroner). 
However, it is still not won. 
The congressmen should sharpen some details of the contract before they can make public the final shape of the law and that it is adopted. 
The plan to help the financial system will be discussed on Monday in the House of Representatives. 
He said Sunday to the Reuters news agency, Barney Frank, chairman of the Committee on Financial Services and the Banks of the House. 
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could make in the Senate not before Wednesday. 
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a primary factor psychologically significant for the revitalization of the financial market. 
Later, however, it will come to the "desencantamiento" thanks to the complex mechanisms which will help the market in practice. 
Paulson: The plan must be effective 
"We have made a great progress. 
We solve our differing views with regard to the way that must have the package of measures to stabilize the markets, "said the Democrat Nancy Pelosiá to the agency Bloomberg. 
According to it, the final vote could still be on Sunday. 
Representatives of the lawmakers met on Sunday night with the finance minister, Henry Paulson, to give a final form the government's Fund. 
This should purchase of mortgage assets that financial companies are not sold to financial firms to severe losses and threaten the stability of the whole system. 
"We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and also to be effective in the market. 
It is necessary to continue with the plan, but I believe that we are already in it, "said Paulson. 
A signal to the Asian business 
The global financial crisis has expressly in the stock market falling rapidly. 
According to the Democratic senator from Nevada, Harry Reid, legislators are doing everything possible to ensure that Congress finally adopted an agreement this Sunday. 
They want to reassure business investors before the market for Asian finance because these are the people who are in the first time zone and where Congress could influence the trade on Monday. 
However, now there is nothing clear with certainty when will the two chambers of Congress and, even, if not stagnate in the last time with a problem. 
Lawmakers believe that it will be approved in the next few days. 
The law, however, will be a series of changes. 
The total amount intended to help the system should be divided into two parts. 
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush. 
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining quantity if I had the impression that the programme does not fulfil its role, it would be another $100 billion and, later, the last 350 billion dollars. 
Bush put the progress of the meetings 
Moreover, the president can veto this decision but Congress can overcome its veto by a majority of votes. 
Despite these changes are retained the basic idea of the programme that was to win financial resources for the buyout of bad mortgage securities whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to finish paying their mortgages. 
"We have worked all. 
The House of Representatives should be ready to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday, "said the Republican senator, Judd Gregg. 
The American President Bush is satisfied with the progress of the meetings. 
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with the progress of the Saturday and values "the commitment of both sides to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy." 
Limitation of the contract armored 
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, head of the negotiators, said that the legislators decided on the responsibility of the money of the programme for the protection of the taxes of the taxpayers of their losses, a closing aliviadora finance plan scheduled. 
The new law must also limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the companies involved in the programme, and creates a committee that will take control of the Fund. 
This would lead the Ministry of Finance. 
"We have worked very hard on this, and we have made great progress in the direction of the convention that will work and that it will be effective for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson. 
The plan has also to help homeowners who have problems with their payments. 
The government would have to agree with the new mortgage payments that buys in order to lower the monthly payments to deadlines of borrowers and enabling them to stay in their homes. 
Marek: Psychological help 
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be but rather ponderous. 
"And it is for this reason that we do not know what mechanism and at what price it will buy distressed assets. 
This will be critical to the distribution of the losses in the financial sector and the government, "said Marek this week, to the server iHNed.cz. 
The plan is now approved or early next week is not, according to Marek, so relevant. 
"Much more important is that, since this week the congressmen to agree on their support and give its approval as soon as possible. 
This important psychological and agree that it reaches that adoption is, at the moment, the most important, "insisted Marek. 
Fight to force: The reproductive MP3 players against the mobile. 
We advise as choose 
While almost all mobile reproduces MP3 files, reproductive any MP3 players manages to make calls. 
What seems clear that it is better to buy only the phone. 
Yet there are sufficient grounds for the man becomes only the reproductive. 
The choice is virtually in the way of their use and the requirement of the future owner. 
Probably will be difficult to purchase the tocadiscos more modern to listen to him the last album of Maxim Turbulenc. 
On the other hand this kind of musical products are the records of LP are no longer, and in terms of its quality there is not a single objective reason to continue comprándolos. 
If amassed on their shelves the disks monomer with music of Article rock, jazz or blues, is probably dreaming, at least, this kind of tocadiscos. 
This is the same with the music that is of course, that is to say, the music comprimida, simplified - the music in the MP3. 
And here there are categories of price and quality. 
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand kroner in reproductive a, the same as for a lover of Pink Floyd hardly probará helmets of bazaar of twenty kroner. 
Two extremes, among which there is enough space for each one. 
The choice is wide. 
Also decides the duration of the battery 
Some of the best players get much more than just reproduce music and even what even the majority of mobile phones. 
No current machinery is as universal as the phone. 
With regard to the most basic functions like telephone, send messages, can reproduce music and video recording the two, has a better or worse apparatus to photograph and can achieve navigate. 
And when we take into account the Smartphone and the PDA are going to have in your pocket a small computer. 
This is a small miracle that no refrigerator knows to a state can parrillada and no television. 
The universality of mobile brings us also disadvantages. 
Few more functions used in the mobile soon will light up the indicator of the screen asking to be stretched. 
And reproduction of music is one of the biggest tragones of energy. 
Few are mobile phones that manage to reproduce music more than ten or twelve hours, the majority much less. 
In this sense, the players of music (especially the most simple) have clearly better performance. 
For this reason, please note that the cheap mobile not start quarrelling again more than two hours. 
If, moreover, above, are constantly consíganse still, for more security, a freighter for work - this also applies to the most expensive equipment. 
Reproductive with MP3 players this problem will not have, because even the worst knows at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a burden. 
Another problem is the recording music in the mobile. 
Unfortunately, only a part of the equipment the universal conector available USB and, furthermore, not all of them can connect directly to the computer without a special software. 
Of course it is possible to record music directly in the memory card, but only in certain units readers without reduction can connect the small memory cards, which are used in mobile phones. 
In the players, with some exceptions (iPod), it is not necessary to any special software. 
It is enough to fill the machine with music via USB of the computer. 
The majority of mobile and players create alone his order in the music library under the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, gender or also according to the assessment of user. 
Some devices are only directors with a structure similar to a tree buscador of Windows and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, the smart phones operating system). 
The reproductive tries to serve, the mobile knows more 
For the election of a specific team interésese by the resistance of accumulator, by the ability of memory, for the quality and the kind of way out of sound and, of course, for the comfort of its handling. 
If you listen, above all, music and the fund will hear every day just a short while ago, as in the trams, then it with any mobile to reproduce. 
What almost gets really any mobile. 
We should not even interested in the format in which the mobile reproductive or reproduce music. 
The MP3 it all and, almost, almost all the music that you will be in this format. 
It is among the most widespread and exceptuándole to give him the absolute majority of appliances reproduce music WMA format. 
The least include the format PCA (format used by the company Apple and its iPod). 
The best mobile also make, for example, the purchase of online music. 
Only by means of the mobile internet visit the relevant pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and bought a song or album. 
This service may be only a weighty argument to buy a mobile to music. 
Unfortunately the supply of operators is miserable and the majority is limited only to the issues of success fleeting of radios. 
The prices are the lowest. 
However, in general, it is precisely this way of sale of music (whether by GSM, Internet and wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry. 
The majority of the people is always a mobile. 
Provided that he likes to hear something, they will find the mobile phone in his pocket, while the reproductive MP3 players will be forgotten at home. 
However, even if it is always with some headphones or, at least, the handsfree. 
If not, can use an integrated reproductive that has virtually every mobile minimum even as reproductive an MP3 players. 
Probably the biggest advantage for many of mobile phones with music will be its price. 
Normally the cheaper cost less than three thousand. 
Between three and four thousand kroner can already buy a good walkman. 
The majority of you will limit the absence of an entry for headphones classics. 
The best, even with regard to the technical part, as the phones equipped with an entry of 3.5 mm for some headphones classics, cost up to fifteen thousand. 
Once again, the advantage of the players is not something that its easy service. 
The players more simple - not necessarily cheaper (see our selection) - the is really any person. 
The minimum functions, its handling similar to previous cassettes or tocadiscos also is obvious. 
It represents a threat in the sense that by mistake we conectemos to the Internet with the mobile and, consequently, giant account for reduction of data. 
For what they apparatus 
Even the cheapest mobile (for example, the Vodafone 527) have generally a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.). 
Even with the purchase of a proper card will come to the two thousand kroner. 
However, be careful. 
The basic models, are usually equipped only with a card of 2 GB of maximum capacity. 
Only the most expensive have a memory of 8 GB. 
If already has a mobile and still wants to buy cheap reproductive an MP3 players, take a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver. 
According to the capacity (as maximum 2 GB) do not need to spend more than 1.1 kroner. 
If it is considered among the most demanding music lovers relied on the more specialised móviles-walkman (Sony Ericsson, Nokia and Samsung). 
These devices have independent keys to MP3 what is a service as comfortable as a reproductive itself. 
The more specialised all is Sony Ericsson, the mobile line walkman have almost identical use as the reproductive an independent MP3 players. 
The same service and the same category in terms of price, on the four thousand kroner, but with more memory (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum capacity of up to 35 hours), the brand that brings them more arria MP3 players. 
The first virtual operator will arrive, this year, to the Czech Republic. 
It probably 
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe. 
However, here we still missing something - the virtual operator, that would force those to be cheaper. 
Probably will not be long in coming. 
That operators Czechs are part of the most expensive in Europe, we have already written in mobil.cz. 
The rest is confirmed the Czech Telecommunication Office (ČTÚ) that warned that the price of the SMS messages in our country is the most expensive of the entire Union. 
After the last steps of the European Commission in the scope of the regulation of roaming rates is likely to come to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the mobile operators Czechs SMS that sent from abroad will be cheaper than if the sent from home. 
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high in comparison with Europe? 
The answer is simple, lack competition that really wants to fight. 
Probably that we seem paradoxical, because we have three mobile networks and its high coverage is of more than 100%. 
On the contrary, the mobile operators like complaining that the Czech market there is an extreme competition. 
It is also the chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, stated that there is no longer any place in the Czech Republic for any other operator. 
It is probably true that for a classic operator with its own network already does not have too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find any frequency). 
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator. 
Precisely the entry of virtual operator in the mobile phone market brought a major drop in prices, which were also reacting to the traditional operators. 
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to the market in Britain heard voices similar both there and elsewhere. 
It showed that there is a place for this type of operators and that may be successful. 
For the rest, you do not need to seek examples too far. 
In February of this year I briefed on the debut of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland. 
Only after half a year, this operator managed to obtain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighbouring country. 
On the other hand, after the group Mobilking penta which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U: Fon. 
The advantage of virtual operators is in the possibility of concentrate on many more specific target groups. 
Moreover, so that they can function effectively, they enough with many fewer customers that a classic operator. 
Not have relatively large expenditure in construction, operation and maintenance of the network. 
In the world of this kind of virtual operator normally emerge with low costs - offer calls and cheap SMS messages, however, are often contrasts with the more tight supply of services. 
So, for example, Tesco in Britain offers mobile SMS at least half of cheap with regard to competition. 
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland can be a good blow the bid for a nothing trivial target group. 
This operator is aimed specifically at the man. 
"The right man chooses Mobilking - is the operator who like and who can be trusted," says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile entertainment Company, which works this virtual operator. 
It is difficult to say whether similar concept as Poland could enganchar in our country. 
This doubt the spokesman of Vodafone, Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is relatively small for access by segments in which are the majority of virtual operators. 
Apart from the point of view of the supply of services is relatively saturated " 
In the Czech Republic, there are possibilities, say the mobile operators 
However, it seems almost certain that if in the Czech Republic will be a virtual operator that will not be Mobilking. 
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the R. Czech seems too hopeful. 
Rather, it is the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region, "said in a telephone conversation to mobil.cz, Jana Studničková, spokesman of the financial group penta. 
Indirectly ensured that the existing mobile phone operators in the Czech Republic definitely not submit to this idea. 
Quite the opposite, trying to do everything possible to avoid any potential competition. 
Interest on the launch of a mobile virtual operator already GTS Novera shows the group that I would like to take a further step forward to become a real competition of Telefonica O2 in the field of customers. 
"We have a great interest in this, to be able to offer our customers not only fixed phone services but also of mobile phones. 
And how much earlier, the better. 
With this possibility we met repeatedly with all the Czechs of mobile phone operators. 
Some of them have managed to make progress in the meetings, "said the group's spokesman, Pavel Kaidl. 
Then, perhaps better times blinking. 
It seems that, by official information, the first official operator would arrive possibly as early as the end of the year. 
But for now its appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence. 
"At this time we believe that the situation is suitable for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market. 
The Czech market in comparison with other market is a very specific. 
So far no one has approached us with a serious and complex project in this area, "he expressed to mobil.cz, Vlastimil Sršeň, spokesman of Telefonica O2. 
The specificity of the Czech market relate to other operators. 
The spokesman from, Martina Kemrová, in accordance exceptional with the opinion of O2, adds: "We have not yet seen any viable commercial project, bilaterally good, can continue to develop." 
And he adds: "In the network from virtual operator will be difficult to find any until the end of the year. 
At this moment we should be on the table a contract that possible study in so short horizon " 
Vodafone directing their attention more to compliance with the requirements of a 3G licence. 
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this in regard to the distribution of costs and infrastructure. 
Precisely what we see as the greatest contribution from the point of view of customers. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this field is in the partner with whom to create a shared network for a fast in the mobile internet. " 
Offices responsible - with the operators breakneck speed and meat 
The progress of the mobile operators can easily understood, but the entry of another operator would increase competition that would lead to a lowering of prices and with it, a decline in profits. 
Then why facilitate the entry to the competition? 
When the operators want to achieve something, are capable of throwing a concert, proof of this is the agarrón when it emerged U: Fon. 
Perhaps the greatest pressure ČTÚ was at the time of the entry of U: Fon by the T-Mobile society. 
Testimony to the public information accessible on the web pages of the ČTÚ. 
But now U: Fon serves as an argument for why not accept a virtual operator. 
Martina Kemrová adds: "In addition, not long ago that the competitive environment in the mobile phone market was opened to a fourth operator. 
In regard to the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player in the market would mean to him and, above all, large requirements for their services. " 
It is for this reason that this access to mobile operators is hugely disappointing due to the total lack of Czech regulatory body. 
Not only is the position of the ČTU, which unfortunately has no authority to intervene in the commercial contracts, unlike Britain and other developed countries. 
This is purely the Office for the Protection of tender Trades (ÚOHS). 
However, it expressed its typical position on this issue. 
"The entry of a virtual operator in the mobile phone market would be possible after ending a convention on the lease of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile phone operator and a virtual operator. 
Until today no agreement has been closed since the supply of potential interested rather was not sufficiently interesting to the traditional operators, "he added to our question Kristián Chalupa, of the department of the Foreign Relations ÚOHS. 
These made statements not surprised by the representatives of the operators. 
For the offices that must represent the interests of the consumers it is something more than a consideration, apart from this must note that nobody to take advantage of its position in the market. 
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad where they operate with virtual operators can see that their entry into the market contributed to the drop in price of mobile telephony services" 
Of course, the pressure on the proper functioning of the resources of the market and the price drop do not fall within the interest of the ÚOHS. 
Really so dramatically shocking in this whole case is the dissonant reactions that are of the three mobile operators. 
The question of whether it is really a coincidence, it offers by itself. 
It is the same as with the price of petrol at the petrol stations because it is clear that it is the work of the accident and a hard fight for the competition. 
"The Office in this regard has not found signs of unfair competition and is therefore reasons for some way to intervene. 
None of the operators has a dominant position so they do not have a corresponding rise of responsibility for their actions in the market. 
The necessary tools to open up the mobile phone market to virtual operators, rather, missing, as well as the telecommunications regulators, "he added to his answer Chalupa. 
The interpretation on the dominant position in the market is one of the many sticking points. 
Of course there is an analysis prepared by the relevant markets ČTÚ whereby telecommunications are from the point of view of the commercial tender a single market. 
In this kind of market operators, of course none of the Czechs has a dominant position. 
But some legal experts have a different vision - for a virtual operator is always necessary to the agreement with the administrator of the network. 
And the mobile phone operator - with all its logic - has a monopoly of its network. 
Therefore, in a particular segment must necessarily be dominant. 
And if this argument not accepted, at least for ÚOHS should be a warning to the fact that three mobile operators are conspicuously similar. 
The current complaints of the interested (inluida this society GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with the operators are clash with many similar obstacles. 
Bear the responsibility in the ČTÚ trick is a fairly common in the field of telecommunications which the ÚOHS washes its hands in this whole matter. 
We met with him because in some cases similar. 
Unfortunately, recently was tabled a new amendment to the law of telecommunications for the extension of the competence of the ČTÚ in the field of commercial contracts that took effect, even when a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve. 
We must know perfectly representatives of ÚOHS, but it is clear that their interests are in another part. 
Everything is going well, when nobody looks 
At the same time, desapercibidamente continues to operate as a carrier pseudovirtual that in the Czech mobile phone networks are already a few. 
Are companies that put their own prices for mobile telephony services, however, only a part are public. 
Normally it is companies engaged in the multilevel marketing. 
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many other offer their own mobile phone services. 
Usually only a few elected to the list prices of these companies. 
The magic is in the company, with regard to the carrier, acts as a classic customer business of the same began a large amount of SIM cards. 
As special customer will receive after special prices and other offers. 
The problem is that trading conditions in all Czechs of mobile phone operators prohibit such resale. 
"If were found cases such as those that quote could speak of infringement in the conditions of contract that could result in the end of the cooperation with the society given," replied to the question on this problem Martina Kemrová. 
But it is highly unlikely that an activity of this kind on the part of the mobile operators were to people responsible. 
Precisely in the case of the three companies involved can be thousands of customers. 
None of the operators is against this procedure. 
With the activities of these companies receive significant gains and, at the same time - unlike the real virtual operator - in any way threaten its own marketing official. 
Miroslav Čepický warns us of the potential problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of this company are used for only a small percentage of customers. 
These, moreover, must accept that the SIM card in your phone, it is not in their name by what cannot be absolutely of him as a client of the operators. " 
This is precisely what I should appear at the ČTÚ slightly strange. 
There is a new question for the ÚOHS. 
If it is that the mobile phone operators entornan the eyes in this type of procedure, why are blocking the entry of virtual operator? 
It is necessary to add that the ÚOHS has sufficient competition to find this type of activities and if it is not going to want to must not be content with the explanations of the operators that have no idea of this history and that its trade conditions do not allow it. 
CUÁNDO will be the most expensive 
As it became clear in the text, the entry of virtual operator in the mobile phone market brought a significant drop in prices for the services. 
At the same time, in virtually all countries where the virtual operator, the traditional operators tried to more or less protected from this outbreak. 
The arguments used by these were virtually all identical - too small a market, possibly too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc. 
In the more advanced countries, however, have spoken the regulatory bodies and in none of the cases defended the operators but to their customers. 
With measures already outside formal or informal pressure ensured that the first virtual operator and with him began to emerge more. 
Unfortunately, the Office of Regulatory Czech all this case is as if it were a nail ablaze. 
For our experience we cannot stop amazed us that the confusion of powers in these cases is best for them. 
But not desesperemos. 
If this information is correct, and behind the scenes the virtual operator reaches these lands, then the Czech market of mobile telephony probably begin to move again. 
If some of the operators are admitted to some mobile virtual operator will be difficult for the ÚOHS can remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of others. 
And perhaps we will draw more expensive than in the rest of Europe. 
The new Czech anthem has four new versions. 
Choose the best 
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official anthem. 
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek in during the day of the Czech official celebrations presented the new recording of official anthem where, my home. 
The new anthem recorded the orchestra of the National Theater under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek. 
There are available to four versions - two versions that are alone, a male voice and another to female voice, another with chorus and other instruments. 
The song is Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka. 
The authors of the arrangements of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček. 
In the server iHNed.cz can listen to the four versions. 
National Czech Bělohlávek considers this song as one of the most beautiful tunes. 
The Czech Radio said earlier that deliberately chose to the young representativamente alone singers with voices that are heartfelt and popular. 
"From the beginning I have tried with the two and then, too, with the chorus to look in the dicción so that the text is understood to have line," she said. 
The Czech official anthem celebrating its 175 anniversary next year. 
The song where, my Home went off for the first time in the year 1834 in the tables of the Theatre of the states in the original Czech labour Fidlovačka Josef Kajetán Tyl and managed with the music of František Škroup. 
He won popularity and the people made. 
The first stanza of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in the year 1918 became, naturally, in a part of the official anthem. 
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent the Czech Republic. 
How sounds the "new" anthem 
The Prague MHD leads us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip 
On Wednesday, 1 October 2008, is written in the history of the Transport Company of Prague, the date by which the first passengers enter the subway, tram and bus with an electronic bonus in their pockets instead of a paper ticket. 
This can be acquired in the moment for almost a hundred thousand people who possess the Opencard chip card. 
Passengers can buy the bond of 30 days, 90 days and the annual (this will be applied from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously load in your card in the chip ’ s InfoCentre, together with similar jobs in the transport company in the Metro stations, Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka. 
You can buy bonds since yesterday on the Internet in the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz. 
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people. 
Those that begin to use the Internet as a form of trade, can begin to forget the sale of tickets in the metro stations, where until now should regularly queue for a normal ticket. 
The bond bought on the Internet, and the card you simply the Opencard in any of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library. 
"In these places are available to passengers a counter with staff prepared to help those concerned with the purchase by the Internet and also with the refuelling of the bond bought in your card," said the spokesman of the project, Martin Opatrný. 
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic bonus in the Opencard in vending vending machines that are in some vestibules underground. 
How are these machines? 
They are red, remind us to a machine of bite notes and passengers probably already have been set in them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská. 
"There is now in the city five but at the end of the year would be 80," completed Opatrný. 
The bonus is controlled by the machine and the driver 
The use of the machine, which will start work tomorrow, is simple. 
It is enough to introduce the chip card and the bonus Opencard previously paid will be charged only in it. 
Electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid, not only in the capital, but also in their vicinity. 
That is to say, in the ring train and bus lines from the numbers 300 to 499 used mainly the inhabitants of the villages of Bohemia. 
"In trains affiliated to the Court of Auditors Prague integrated transport is equipped with a card reading that will help to confirm the validity of the time and the area of the bond", explained the control of notes, Filip Drápal Ropid organization that establishes the timetables for public transportation of Prague. 
The buses to bypass mounted readers have their cards in the driver's box-office. 
To enter is necessary not only show the card to the driver, but it is also necessary to continue with the Opencard in the place allocated to it in the side of the rescue. 
With this, the driver controls the validity of the bond. 
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonds there is nothing more easy for the driver of this information," completed Drápal. 
Passengers not to travel on buses to bypass them and not remember when it ends the validity of the bond can turn to the vending machines which are simply cards. 
Here, the screen of the machine, they will show the information on the validity of the document. 
The south-east wanted to be part of the US in a referendum. 
The Sudeten Germans called in 1945 that smoking were part of the United States. 
This is what is extracted from the letter that is stored in the collection of the Southern Bohemian Science Library. 
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least live under the patronage of the United States of America. 
With this I went, presumably, some groups of Sudeten Germans to the president of the United States in 1945. 
It is of the letters that are stored in a particular file and which today are sitting in the collection of the Southern Bohemian Science Library. 
The Germans of Český Krumlov request in a letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "land Šumava" - occupied by Hitler in Munich Pact - again to Czechoslovakia. 
"We have correctly understood the situation and we really his word that the American units are coming to German not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators," they wrote in the letter, signed with "the people that has been the fate of Šumava in his heart." 
In view that the union of Czechoslovakia with the South East Germans presumably means - according to the Czech national character - a hope only in the brutality, disregard, incomprehension, pressure and slavery, the authors are begging in the letter to the American President to assume today and forever to Šumava under a protectorate. 
"We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants are delivered to a foreign state which oppresses and rejects the minorities and that is working with the victory of the allies," he wrote in the letter. 
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of reprisals from the "oppressors Czechs." 
If the Chairman of the US presumably was doubtful about this idea of Germans šumavos, it would be enough to organise in the land šumavas a referendum on whether they want to be part of the US or live under the patronage. 
Although the text of the letter, with the knowledge we have today's post-war history, we may sound a little children, according to some experts rightly painted the expectations of the Germans in the south-east then. 
Although the Germans Czechs had the slightest sense that it was going to discuss his expulsion of the republic only a few admit this possibility. 
Some waited for the United States and Britain negotiated for the Sudeten some form of autonomy. 
Others believed that it will be in Czechoslovakia. 
What confirms even the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice. 
This was in the war, as German Budějovice, enrolado in the Baltic sea. 
When the end of the war, the British and the apresaron emplazaron in the field of prisoners steer tens of Germans were to him for Czech failures. 
"They believed that to return home, the Czech, I would do well," said Chalupa. 
None of the prisoners who lived in Germany before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, had that on the basis of the Bene? Decrees would be removed from the Republic. 
- you are thinking not pay! 
Drivers emotional campaign attacking 
The most expensive in the Czech history led to safety on the roads. 
This could characterise the emotive Campaign that decided to launch on Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport in the media. 
The office of the minister, Aleš Řebíček promises that will deter drivers dangerous behaviour behind the wheel. 
The campaign of 150 million will be felt on television, radio, cinema, the Internet and in brochures. 
Would deter the driver of the high speed and alcohol at the wheel. 
And also to remind you that before we start strap belts. 
Wants to reach the conscience of all of the young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and in last place also of professional drivers. 
What is it that we can see in the advertisements? 
Fundamentally human stories that embisten to the emotions. 
And for this we witnessed by the announcements "bloody" throughout the campaign. 
- you are thinking not pay! 
The word "No together" is written with large letters on the plate. 
And in a pond of blood is the word "You Pay". 
This should symbolise the man in a time of error can come to pay with their own lives. 
The announcements are to "hands" viewers until the year 2010. 
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign made in Anglo-Saxon land where they can see pictures of victims of accidents. 
This promises to reduce accidents and the number of deaths on the roads of Czech. 
The announcements have been produced by the agency Euro RSCG. 
Sugar and whip for drivers 
"For drivers is the system of sugar and whip. 
Sugar is for him when, for example, is a red light and thus saves time. 
The whip is threat of a fine or accident. 
The drivers they should remember the risks, "says the psychologist on hospital transport Na Homolce, Martin Kořán. 
And that is why we need an information campaign in the press and mainly negative publicity, specifically the psychologist. 
Less effective, for him, are the panels to warn the driver of the dangers. 
"If there is any panel installed warning of danger probably soon will be merged with the environment and the driver does not pay more attention," warned Kořán. 
Olmert referred back almost all the occupied areas in exchange for peace 
The chairman of the interim government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, on the return of almost all the land occupied in the 1967 borders, that is to say, the West Bank and East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights in return for peace with the Palestinians and Syria. 
In the interview that the proposed Monday in the Yedioth Ahronoth daily appeared. 
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we must restore almost all the land (occupied), if not all," said Olmert in the newspaper. 
"I am sure that we will be left with a percentage of these lands, but the Palestinians must cederles a percent similar (of the land of Israel) because without that there will be no peace," he added. 
He admitted that in case of restitution would also include Jerusalem this. 
"Anyone who wants to security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want that tractors or bulldozers go above their legs as he became one of my best friends, then it will have to hand over part of Jerusalem," Olmert said in reference to the two attacks of July in the city in which there were several dead and dozens of people were injured. 
According to the president will need to find "a special solution to the hill of the Temple, sacred place and historic" that is at the heart of the old city. 
"Anyone who wants to maintain the Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs. 
This will not work, "insisted later. 
Of the Golan Heights, 
Olmert is delivered by the withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights which, from his point of view is an inherent to conclude a peace agreement with Syria. 
But this would be a concrete efforts by Damascus. 
"Not propose closing peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan," he warned. 
"The Syrians know well what will have to overcome to win the Golan. 
Should abandon its current relations with Iran, must abandon its relations with the Hezbollah (movement chita), will emerge from the ongoing support of terrorism of Hamas chita (movement), the Al Qaeda terrorist network (the) and Jihad (holy war) in Iraq, "made the first minister. 
Questions after the accident: Is it illegal the stewardesses in buses? 
The law is unknown, cannot walk in a long-distance bus 
In connection with the tragic accident of the bus company of the Student Agency near the Italian city of Padova we the question arises of whether the stewardesses and passengers can move by the bus for the trip. 
"If we strict and formally comply with the law, the activity of the hostess is opposed to the law of road traffic," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident that killed the week the hostess of 22 years, of course it was caused by the lorry driver that the bus sat in the road. 
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting on the side of the driver in the car less safe despite having reserved two other sites. 
However, the bus may have an accident or stop suddenly, and at the very moment that the azafato distributes the coffee or newspapers. 
Here he plays the role is if the bus is provided, according to the technical licence, with places. 
If the bus is not harmonized, the passenger must be granted. 
The buses long distances of Student Agency does not have places to go up, which confirmed the director of the company, Radim Jančura, Aktuálně.cz. 
"What we have settled with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed. 
Finally it withdrew and we agreed that passengers can go to the bathroom still the bus in place if it is to have a seat, "we said his position. 
The hostess does not know the law 
"There is a clear legal interpretation of the role of the hostess - no legal provision clarifies this role. 
Even a legal provision prohibits the transport operators make some service. 
The law of road transport only knows the end of body of vehicles, whose rights and obligations are not defined, "he adds, less strongly, the spokesman Hanzelka. 
The director of the department of Traffic road vehicles from the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, thinks that the law looks sufficiently this problem. 
"It depends on whether the bus is allowed to have the type-approval sites. 
That is all, "he says. 
Buses are divided between the towns, where there are places to be standing and limited top speed, mainline with sites to be standing with greater speed permit and the long distances without places to go up, with the permission of speed and with the seats equipped with safety belt. 
As in the plane, says the expert 
The expert in Security BESIP in transport, Jaroslav Hořín, sees no major problems as the movement of azafato in the bus. 
"During the development of the journey there is not much of a threat of danger, the situation is comparable with the service in the aircraft. 
Even here it is the safety of the turbulence and that the hostess can be hit in the head. " 
"However, if the bus slows suddenly obviously that are valid physical laws. 
The same as on an urban bus or in the trams. 
The safety of the hostess must deal with the internal regulation of the carrier, "says and also thinks that from the point of view of the law, this problem is not solved. 
Jančura is prepared to cancel this service 
Student Agency is the only carrier that provides the service of stewardesses. 
In him to two hundred. 
The director, or after the accident, believes that work risky. 
"However, when we have the impression that the post of hostess is risky, then add it. 
The coffee and newspapers can receive, passengers, to enter. 
It would save even expenditure, "he says. 
In the interests of safety is why Asiana lacks stewardesses in their vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line in comparison with SA. 
"We have no stewardesses, we are against them from the beginning. 
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident, "said less than a year ago to Týden.cz. 
A huge tragedy happened 
In the accident in the line between Naples died a young hostess of Pilsen who had worked for the company for two years. 
A Slovenian lorry that probably turned from the parking lane blocking the move to autobús. without using the flashing. 
The driver tried in a swift maneuver, however, collided with the right way. 
Jančura denies that were sold the two sites that are reserved for the rest of the flight attendant. 
"These places is not possible wanted to travel long distances, are blocked." 
The company intends to sue the driver of the lorry. 
The agency is not going to wait for the verdict of the trial on the compensation to the family of the girl but expected financial expenditure on the part of the blame. 
What reform of the law? 
Not, by now 
The reform of the law could bring greater precision on the movement of the hostess at the bus in which from a year ago that are working 30 experts members of a group of the Ministry of Transport. 
"However, have not come to any conclusion. 
They do not spend too much on buses, but rather the points system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile during the march, "said the expert Hořín. 
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewardesses something so important that threaten the safety of passengers," ending the spokesman Hanzelka, that control of security in buses is a matter for the police and the Security Office in the work. 
The hope of Dusseldorf is based in Frankfurt 
In the letter of the board of the bank West LB for their staff, there is no shortage of big words. 
By the merger of the units of the bank DEKA Dusseldorf with the bank can become "a central market in the capital of the financial group of Sparkassen ', as stated in the letter, published on Monday 
The bank West LB, breaking the "bloco of competition" with sustainable capacity of profits would come in such business. 
Moreover, such a merger could be a start for following mergers in the area of regional banks. 
It comes to understand the text, when a board wants to show the capacity to act in tough times. 
Because as before the West LB is under enormous pressure. 
Not only on the part of the European Union, but also of the federal institute of the surveillance of financial services that recently made it clear to the government of North Rhine-Westphalia that there is little time to find a solution. 
Since some time ago, also on the part of Frankfurt, there is much talk about the union between the bank such DEKA, that customers of Sparkasse known for their investment funds, and the West LB. 
To tell the truth, Franz Waas, the head of the bank DEKA, presenting the data after a half a year at the end of August left knowing that sees no sense in the merger of the bank, located in the street Mainzer Straße, with a regional bank Helaba such as, for example, or the West LB. 
But the board of DEKA, which is now made up of regional banks and associations of Sparkassen, commissioned to board to start negotiations with the West LB on the common commercial activities. 
In this it could try to a business in the capital market, or parts of it. 
Of course, the negotiations have only just begun, so it says in the financial website. 
It is not the first time when it comes to the consolidation in the field of Sparkassen DEKA appears on behalf of the bank that with its 3,000 staff is among the most important companies in the financial website Frankfurt. 
In 2003 at a time the situation seemed so that the bank could merge with the DEKA regional bank in Rhineland-Palatinate and with Helaba. 
This initiative to create a union of three parties was without results. 
But the plans were made public, the government of Hesse expressed against the participation of Helaba in this project. 
The other two banks also not found the same language. 
Instead of that the regional bank of the Rhineland-Palatinate began the dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg. 
But it was always again with the idea of merging of DEKA bank with other regional banks. 
But finally Günther Merl, the chairman of the board of Helaba, stated that he was against the plans of the coexistence with their bank. 
Independent of that seems to be more clear that the union of the various banks of the area of public law is necessary. 
Because, when they are going to turn the elections to the parliament of Bavaria, the union with the regional bank BayernLB of of Baden-Württemberg could make progress. 
For the Helaba that is not necessarily good news. 
If the pressure to continue merging will increase, Helaba I lack the partners to do that. 
In the south, the bank could be only a younger partner, although until now sobresalió much better in the financial crisis that did the property of Stuttgart and Munich. 
On the other hand the Sparkassen - and Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which owns 85 percent of Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided the plans of coexistence with the West LB. 
In any case, it is only the Nord LB. 
But such thoughts are geo-strategic are only a part. 
On the other hand there is the compatibility of the different banking models. 
In June, Merl made a fundamental question on a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the Deutsche Sparkassen- Verband Giro- and gave no response until now. 
In end you can break down the West LB, but that, of course, is not the desire of the bank. 
So, in the letter of the bank's board said that it would try to find a comprehensive solution for all the bank. 
As you can combine the coexistence between unique parts of the bank with the DEKA, this is going to show the time. 
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians" 
Elena is for the first time, to Luca the third or fourth. 
But this time, he attends Elena as his girlfriend, and that is why all feel differently, he says. 
Behind them, on the side of a barrel of 5 litres of beer brands Kaiser is built an enormous tiger bear that shows almost 200 participants of Oktoberfest that sounds low knows produce in his throat.

Three buses are intended mainly to the Italians, a bus is only for Brazilians. 
In a corner of the garage at the side of its flag are singing the South American, they had already begun to celebrate at night. 
With a great deal of noise, says Marco Guarda, what is nothing for the Italians. 
In Framework, wearing a long coat with a fur forro artificial and glasses with patillas of colour of silver, I belong these buses. 
Five years ago they come at the Oktoberfest, bearing in mind that this year alone, there are three trips. 
In the way of night there, during the day in the meadow, at 10.30 the round. 
Spend the night there means only unnecessary expenditure, says Marco. 
The trip costs 75 euros, including the reception of the welcome with a beer Kaiser that was made in accordance with the law of the purity of Bavaria, health insurance and the guide in German - Marco attended a course of language in Frankfurt. 
For night buses are already on the road in the motorway with the direction, "Brenner" 
There is no beer, not yet. 
The tranquillity reigns in the bus, passengers are asleep. 
Is as well, they will still need the forces. 
It for in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with the Italian number plates are a another break in the motorway shortly before 8 in Munich. 
Finally, when the group of Marco has the arrival scheduled at 6.30 a.m. in the parking lot of the side of the Prado of Teresa, there are 50 other CIRCA buses throughout Europe.

First: Poneros a yellow hats.

Second: "When you open the door of the shop of the campaign, that means we go!," shouts Marco in the morning. 
"Go!" March and sit back sites in the shop of the campaign. 
"Don't tomad sites, because we are going to block, and all with yellow hats sentéis not in the same dock, spread throughout space!" 
A litre of beer, roars Marco, costing EUR 8.25. 
Not the windfall olvidad 
I Mostrad to the people of security that we have good tone! 
It barely gets out of his room, he will be occupied! " 
Thirdly: "This afternoon exactly to the ten and a half have to come here!" Did understand? 
And now all are at the Oktoberfest. 
One, to lead the way, ties the yellow hats in the trees, traffic signs and even in a poster of the election of a great People's Party of Bavaria. 
It wants to be able to recognise the way back. 
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest that is known as "the weekend of Italians" 
There are no precise data on the number of people; it is about 50,000 people who make the trip on the Alps and tormentosamente fall in the tents, the 10% of all came especially this weekend in Italy. 
The police in Munich receives support from seven policemen of the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers to help the Red Cross of Bavaria that is a statistic of nations here, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance bureaux, in front of the English (nearly 60 attendance) and the Austrians in the first place. 
The favourite shop of the campaign of Italians is so-called Hofbräuzelt. 
The nights without sleep for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate 
The banking system of Germany is relatively stable, acentuó only last week the German Finance Minister Peter Steinbrück. 
That well, that the political uses the word "relatively" and added that the German banking sector will also be affected by the criticism. 
And this has happened after the end of the week. 
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the financier of property of Munich, which is priced in the DAX index, by a consortium of German banks a loan of billion to resistance to the turbulence in the market. 
On Monday, a person who is very familiar with the situation told Reuters: The credit aid amounted to 35 billion euro. 
The part of capital that the Hypo Real Estate will use must shed interest. 
The money comes as private banks also of the public. 
The cause of this are the losses of the subsidiary Depfa. 
According to a report, the state financing with the money that was given to the long-term projects financed only a brief period of time - which now, because of the lack of confidence in the markets, it is not possible. 
In the first half of the year, the bank's capital reserve in cash has fall in a 95 percent, 2.37 million euro, also the quota of capital held back a little bit of a 1.6 percent to a 1.45 percent. 
In comparison with the same period last year, the ongoing financial investment income and net profit of financial operations fell to zero, the incomes of charging for debtors and some titles of values of the dissolution of the provisions of the credit business have tended to fall more than 70 percent, at 5 million euro. 
Only thanks to high income and many of the reimbursement of expenses of compensation for the restructuring of the Depfa ex-grupo and the reimbursement of interests under the federal tax code and business organised for companies of the consortium, the negative balance could accuse a deficit with about 16 percent more. 
After their privatisation in the 1990 state financial former the principle was lost in speculation industrial appropriations to the property, which served as the reason for foundation Aareal Bank. 
As it could not win much money with the financing of the state projects, the Defa began to work intensively for projects in the field of infrastructure and the financing of the Community projects by private investors and state as well as Private-Public-Partnership (PPP) and diversificó. 
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to make repayments on the value of the subsidiary that will take a "essential material effect" on the consolidated account of losses and gains of the group, says very these thinkers -- often imprecisely. 
It is a fact that have cancelled the dividends. 
As for the year 2007 they were cancelled two thirds. 
After the acquisition of Depfa the Hypo Real Estate became a financial important financial state and in the area of infrastructure. 
As the bank does not possess the customer deposits, he, in comparison with other banks, is more dependent on the refinancing in the interbank market. 
With the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers, what has happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans fell essentially because banks were saving their liquidity. 
Each year the Hypo Real Estate needs nearly 50 billion to finance part of the Defa credit portfolios of their short-term measures to the refinancing. 
According to the report of the Hypo Real Estate, the bank covers with a credit the need for funding the group for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of the international money markets that are now essentially not suitable for work" 
Other sources say that thanks to this money the refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009. 
Georg Funke, the chairman of the board of the Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need the money markets for the foreseeable future. 
The German central bank, the Federal Institute of the surveillance of financial services (BaFin) from the basis that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group from now is secured. 
They have to wait for shareholders and creditors of the bank. 
But because of the dynamic and of the imponderables of the crisis there is no record. 
Even it is conceivable that does not require the funding in its volume. 
But we cannot exclude the case. 
Was the voice of that in the last hour of Sunday, the bank was still almost in insolvency, so the temporary salvation nor can at least reassure people worried. 
The price of action fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros. 
The courses of loan, by contrast, are really well. 
While the priority debts almost unchanged, the courses, according to the position of loans in the registration of property clearly tend downwards. 
Particularly affected are the loans from the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and with the reason the loans whose debt beyond 2009. 
After the remarkable growth of the banking crisis and that affected the Depfa acquisition of Hypo Real Estate, the current value of their loans that were previously an investment for speculation must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system. 
While the central banks, governments and banks are little affected are still ready to support the system, while both can be from the repayment of pensions in time. 
Or will happen something, what is not liable to imagine - the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months. 
But watching the news crusades on the partial estatización, now the security that is already in your limit became a justified hope. 
This is going to be a reason, because creditors will nights without sleep, breaking the head on the decision on its isolation of enthusiasm. 
Yet short-term investors can put the final point and use the transport to consider new losses in coming tax benefits of compensation on the change in the future. 
Sylvana and the secrets of Bent? -Box 
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, girl of 16 years, had to stand in the Highschool of Tachibana girls began to laugh: The German is totally "kawaii"! 
What does that mean? 
Sylvana knows the word of sleeves - in a report on the trade her account Japan. 
"The first day in a school in Japan. 
I felt nervous. 
Before going to school, I was afraid. 
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction and I am Kawasaki in train 40 minutes to Highschool Tachibana. 
One had to find the path, fortunately I lost. 
It seems that the start of classes is not set as rigorously as in my home, in Lower Saxony. 
Of the eight of the morning come pupils, the nine less 20 starts a small meeting with teachers, the 'home' room. 
Before the class began, I had come to stand. 
Furthermore I am not a person who speaks with great pleasure in the public, especially in a class of 40 pupils. 
As they still have a school uniform I falda old of the mother of my family home and also a blouse, blue socks and shoes black skin. 
Therefore, so clothed I came to the pulpit and tried to make everything in the right way: "Sayonara wo she Sylvana..." - I call Sylvana, I am of Germany and in a week will be my birthday. 
In this moment I was very happy because for two years had begun to study this language. 
All 31 girls in the class have cuchicheado, laughed and signalling and the whole time I heard the word "kawaii" 
The knew of my sleeves. 
That belongs to the vocabulary of survival of Japanese girls and means "Mona, borders" 
Then I deslicé quickly in my room. 
The girl in the side, had a big smile, for it was an honour that the girl of exchange had to sit on the side of it. 
The rest of the class was fairly calm, but when the gong rang, I was really pounced. 
All spoke at the time, there were so many questions reían and at the same time, it is very difficult to understand English of Japanese. 
After all, in the recreational brought their Bentos. 
The mother of my family home was also a Lanchbox for my - is something other than boring pieces of bread Germans. 
Have rice with herbs, small sausages, algae and cucumber salad, fruit and something as meat in mass of tofu. 
In most of the cases have no idea what as here in Japan. 
Things are rare and have a taste. 
What is certain is that everything is very rich. 
Therefore, perhaps with the exception of plums marinadas in the salt, bufff! 
In the bentos Japanese schools are not simply a lunch. 
It sometimes happens that a girl prepares a bento done in very artistic for a boy and gifts in hope of being able to know better during a recreation. 
On that I read in my Manga-Comics. 
I am very curious to see if I can see it here. 
"Why precisely Japan?", I have asked my friends, when I said I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend a year of school. 
Then always responded: 
"Good, because it fascinates me." 
Finally, for years I prefer to read sleeves. 
To better understand the comics and culture, one day I began to look a bit of Language. 
For me it was absolutely sure that one day I will travel there. 
Also because I have a disservice by tradition and habits. 
Here they have a great value. 
Part of the Japan is a country of the latest technology and trends, of the other part is a country tough, disciplined and traditional. 
As all is well organised, yet I was not lost here although Tokyo is the largest city that I have ever seen in my life. " 
Also the rats have feelings 
It says that a rat or a cucaracha feeling the danger is fleeing, why has also fear? 
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology is convinced that many animals also have feelings. 
How can control whether they, behaving in a way similar to us, feel the same? 
In an Internet magazine called "Edge" for many years are published the contributions of scientists famous. 
Spiegel online presented in a series the elected answers to the question what it thinks you what is truth without being able to prove it? 
I believe that the animals are sensations and other states of consciousness without which I or anyone else could prove until now, although we cannot even prove that other people have a conscience. 
But in this case at least we can expect because all the human brains have the same fundamental shape. 
But as soon as we spend on other species and include questions about the sense and in general on the conscience, we are entering the field unknown because the hardware is not. 
When a rat is in danger, is the same as the other animals: The dead, sneaks or attacks. 
The people behave in this way, some scientists are conclusions on comparable subjective experience. 
Of course I do not think so. 
Two aspects of the brain structure are difficult to transmit our subjective experience to the animals. 
First, they include the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness of lóbulo lateral prefrontal cortex of the brain (because of their participation in the memory short and in the executive functions that directs conduct). 
This part wide is much more developed in the case of people that the other primates and seems to lack absolutely in other creatures. 
Bearing in mind at least aspects relating to our conscience that depends on the lóbulo prefrontal cortex of the brain, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even the man is different from the other primates. 
Another peculiarity a linguistic lies in the nature of man: As most of his experience is united with the language, that often means that the conscience depends on it. 
In this case it can exclude the animals. 
But even when the awareness not would depend on the language, the impact of the conscience of animals, created how, in many cases would differ from the majority of our states of consciousness. 
That is why it is difficult to explain how the conscience of other animals. 
If that, as something interesting and subjective, nor does it measure because the special hardware, and makes it look through our experiences, so its research we have big problems. 
The majority of my speeches relates to the content of the experience it, but at the same time there is also another aspect of the awareness that ought to be easier for scientific research. 
We could investigate the processes of conscience of animals without taking account of their content, and that is what happens during the studies of memory short of primates, especially in the example of the implementation. 
But with this approach that remained Christof Koch and Francis Crick what is essential is rather the correlatos neutral awareness that the causal mechanisms: The two can be such or not. 
Curiously, this approach highlights the importance of lóbulo prefrontal cortex of the brain to the formation of the display. 
And what is that for the sensations? 
I like the fact that in the emotional system is a part of the brain that is responsible for this, what is happening with fear. 
What are described as fear is therefore a mental state in which we are when the brain activity in an area of the defence system (or their consequences such as the reactions of the body). 
Seen from this point of view the feelings are very set to part of the brain cortex what distinguishes primates and above all the man. 
From the point of view of a linguistic nature still rankings of the fine feeling because we can distinguish and classify the states with the help of the words and grammar to describe the states of others to couple of ourselves. 
For example, Antonio Damascus, on the contrary, he believes that the sensations arise from the activities of simple the parts of the brain cortex responsible for feelings of brain physical and on the stump, the same does Jaak Pankseep, but focuses more on the stump brain. 
As this network has not changed much during the human evolution, it can refer to different types and their feelings. 
For reasons teoréticas cannot go against this, but it is not likely. 
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, possibly that sits in two cases also: But how can control if rats and men behaving similarly feel the same? 
Seeing the danger a cucaracha sneaks, because it is afraid? 
I am of the opinion that the lines of behavior still does not test the similarity of experience. 
It is true that the comparison neural help: Rats and men have floating timber of similar brain, the cucarachas instead do not have at least a brain. 
Is it the stump of the brain that is responsible for feelings? 
Even when it is possible to test it for men: How can you prove it in case of rats? 
I believe that rats and other mammals, possibly also the cucarachas (who knows?), have feelings. 
But I do not know how can prove it. 
I prefer to investigate emotional behavior of rats emotional sensations because their feelings were allegedly driven mainly by us (because the human consciousness relates to special circuits and the language). 
In any case, we expect progress in the field of neurology in both to be measured the same of rats and men. 
As not investigo language and the conscience of rats, as well as sensation, I do not know if they exist. 
We can say that I do not see beyond my nose, but I prefer to move to work permanent without results. 
As well, I am emocionalista practical. 
The president of UEFA Platini: Grace period for Poland and the Ucraina 
Iwan Wasjunik, the deputy prime minister said that the preparations soon found under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister. 
"The government looks at the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as proof of confidence in the ability of the Ukraine to organise the championship of Europe together with Poland," said Wasjunik. 
"But that is not an amnesty for our country. 
Now the work is about to start and in the two countries have a lot to do. " 
The timing of the construction and the reconstruction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is lame. 
Perhaps the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six. 
"We cannot lose more time. 
Now we have to work with great speed, "said the president of an association Ukraine Grigorij Surkis. 
"UEFA will not take the eyes of us." 
In Poland was agreed a step more radical. 
After numerous scandals the Olympic Committee of Poland suspended the management of the Polish Association PZPN and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki. 
The committee was convened at the request of the sports minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki. 
There is "a serious risk that the PZPN is not able to follow the rules," said Drzewiecki to the Polish news agency PAP. 
"In a letter have assured the president of UEFA Platini that the preparation the championship of Europe in 2012 will not suffer from that." 
Only in the last season, many of the first division clubs were sentenced to cause of manipulation in decline to the lower status, finally also the advice of division had to be postponed. 
Of Dennis Quaid outraged counterattack 
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview on the private life and has problems with its ex-marido: The Hollywood star Meg Ryan appointed his ex-marido as a adúltero. 
It angers and Strikes Back. 
The backward war of the two roses in the ex-pareja of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Eight years after their divorce, the two actors in Hollywood publicly show a nasty fight between them. 
Last week, in an interview with the American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time on the reasons for the failure of marriage, "Dennis was much time infidel to me, and that was very painful." 
She knew the size of his unfaithful only after divorce. 
The cause of the disclosure of the private things was the work of Ryan with the press for his new film "The Women" - is a history of failure of a marriage. 
The reaction of Dennis Quaid to the appointment of him as a husband infidel was clear: This is "outrageous that Meg whenever the history of our relationship in a different version," said the man of 54 years to "New York Daily News." 
Among other things it is very "regrettable" that Jack, his son of 16 years, again "is going to remember in public the pain and the changes, which means a divorce for a child." 
While Ryan after divorce are living alone, Quaid is newly married and recently is Pope of twins. 
And so ends with their statements highlighting: "It is my life continues. 
I am happy because I have a wonderful family that is good. "

From April to June prices already fell 3.6 percent compared to last year. 
The trends were more perceptible in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay less than the previous year. 
According to American Express, the reason for this was the weakening dollar, what was the cause of that "the interests of the American tourists in travel fell." 
The decline of hotel prices is also seen much more in the financial centers such as Frankfurt and London that in the points of industrial concentration as Hannóver, Cologne or Stavanger. 
In the Norwegian city hotel prices rose to 26,3 percent and it is fighting a record in Europe. 
In the first quarter the price of tickets also showed the upward trends: 
Because of the increase in the price of kerosene Economy Class passengers had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, the long-distance flights even became more expensive until 29,2%. 
From April to June the ticket prices in the class Economy, compared with the previous quarter, fell by an average of 12.5%, but the price changes for the businessclass and Firstclass were small. 
In Germany the change in prices was more remarkable than in other European countries. 
From January to February rose to 11,9 prices, in the second half fell to 23.6%. 
According to a study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even reduced by half. 
The cause of change in prices is a part of the growth of the economy weak, explains the company. 
In many parts of the market with the plane travel demand is falling. 
On the other hand there are big competition for the treaty liberalising Open-Skies aircraft traffic between the USA and Europe. 
The sign of the situation is tense the cancellation of flights non-profit-making distances in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of the year 2008 declared bankruptcy - only in Europe were 24 airlines. 
The HSV wins against Gladbach 1: 0 
With a goal and simple methods the SV Hamburg becomes the leader. 
Luhukay of Borussia him still fails to make the goal decimoprimero. 
Kristoffer Klein was very well the hard landing of the national team player Marko Martin. 
The player in Gladbach began to play late and failed by a goal. 
All I wanted to say exactly reacting to what happened, you could read out of their lips. 
Only knew that he was right. 
"Necesitamos a second goal," silbaba Hermann Rieger in the entry of cabin of the stadium in Hamburg. 
Not step nothing special in the catacombs, rest time ended and the majority of those in attendance was again on their websites. 
Rieger was almost over three decades physiotherapist of HSV, enjoys a great reputation as one of those who were part of the group. 
That is why his request was observed a responsible person. 
The assistant coach Cornelius Jol asintió with the head and lifted the fingers as a sign of approval. 
Cornelius is brother of Martin Jol, the main coach of Hamburg. 
The order was the same: Oh, the second goal! 
But this was not done. 
"Today it was nice to see," he added later Marcell Jansen. 
Also Bastiaan Reinhard had wanted to take "more relaxed." 
The result 1: 0 (1: 0) the Hamburg owes to Mladen Petric (11) with its impact of head; and also to the situation that the team of Gladbach very weak could not show the full force of the weak team of Hamburg. 
"That was a dirty victory," said in short Martin Jol. 
This Monday, the SV Hamburg will meet its 121 years. 
The Saturday will be the spectators had already celebrated their themselves, the blue sky above the stadium and the changing table in the video screen. 
It is going to be a birthday party without a real. 
"We know to interpret it," said Marcell Jansen. 
Provides that partial ratings of the table correspond to the league hint that the dominance of its HSV. 
The quipo with their players forced late as Brazilians Neves and Silva, the scorer Petric as well as Jansen was removed from FC Bayern need time to come together, but still the quipo cannot shine with its successes. 
"Necesitamos more of the feeling and dribbling," requires Jol.

Dark matter has the record of the space probes 
For many years a phenomenon mysteries cause confusion to researchers: The dark Matters impacts the speed of the space probes during so-called gravity assistance to the manoeuvre. 
Experts fear that the Theory of Relativity of Albert Einstein may not be so right. 
The space probe "Ulysses" spent almost 18 years flying in the universe. 
Because of that the fuel pipes are helándose now a death threat in the cold. 
For years, a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during the assistance of gravity to the manoeuvre, causing confusion among researchers. 
The assistance of gravity is a manoeuvre in the history of the space probes during which they obtain an acceleration using the energy of the field of gravity of a planet, for example of the Earth. 
This allows the space probes to save fuel. 
Cassini-Huygens, the EU-USA space probe used this trick physical as well as it did the Sun's probe Ulysses. 
But what the surprise to researchers for many years: The missiles not behave by 100% as well as they expected, according to the law of the venerable gravitación. 
More frequent irregularities of the speed. 
The vagaries of the probes has more or less speed. 
The physical could not explain this effect until now. 
I called the anomaly during the assistance of gravity to the situation. 
Some experts fear that possibly even the General Theory of Relativity of Albert Einstein which describes the attraction of the matter by the curvature of the area may not be so right. 
Stephen Adler, the US physicist, of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton believes solemnly now as before that Einstein not confused and tries to explain the anomaly during the assistance of gravity with the help of so-called dark Matters, in what were the astrónomos in the universe. 
"The reason for the anomaly can be the dark Matters that can also be very close to the earth," he writes. 
The researchers of the universe are aware of the existence of dark Matters only for ten years. 
Presumably it possesses the force of attraction and their influence can be observed in other planets. 
The dark Matters, on the contrary, it is completely invisible which means that it sends and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially any light visible. 
According to the calculations of scientists the dark Matters for at least a fifth of the total mass of the universe. 
The tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free 
As confirmed the foreign minister of Italy, after ten days in the hands of hijackers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be Freedoms. 
The kidnappers of Sudan had demanded millions of rescue. 
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during the release. 
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt. 
The negotiations with regard to the rescue already began. 
The Germans are always again in the focus of the kidnappers. 
It tells the newspaper Welt online on the most important cases. 
For the European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are Freedoms. 
On the same information presented the Egyptian television state, the Arab television station Al-Arabija and the Italian media. 
After the news of the release of the Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian minister of foreign affairs, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are Freedoms. 
"Now we control his state of health," said Frattini. 
Five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian as well as his eight Egyptian guides are well and are in the security, told the state-run Egyptian television. 
The 19 participants of the expedition in the desert are on the way to Cairo. 
What is incomprehensible reasons of a shooting before the release of the hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard the kidnappers were ready to put an end to the abduction, but the army of Sudan suddenly had killed six kidnappers. 
"The problem was solved. 
They were in agreement with the rescue, "said the guard. 
It was only "to receive the hostages" when suddenly came "this surprise". 
On Sunday the Sudanese soldiers have killed six kidnappers and two of them have been arrested in the border area between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt. 
The kidnappers have demanded the rescue of Germany in the amount of six billion; the money had to hand over the German wife of one of the hostages. 
The newspaper "El Masri The Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that it was delaying the release because the kidnappers had fear of his safety. 
According to the report, the kidnappers have the intention of releasing the hostages femeniles after having received the rescue. 
The men had to remain in custody until the kidnappers had a safe route to flee. 
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected take the position with regard to this report. 
Abuse of foster parent "led to the suicide" 
According to the court, years of abuse by their foster parent led a woman to kill themselves. 
Michael Trerise, 57 years, Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted eight counts of indecent assaults. 
The Royal Court of Truro, through a study indagatorio, known that he regularly had tied to his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years. 
Trerise wrote in a role of confession: "I am responsible for his death." 
The court has known that Mrs Randle committed suicide at his home in Mutley in Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, at the age of 34 years. 
In a season in which the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used atarla vendarle and the eyes before carrying out their sexual acts, while their mother was working in a pub. 
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall. 
His hijastra moved to Plymouth. 
However, the court has known that Mrs Randle, used much of his time working as a voluntary for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse he had suffered two times per week. 
In 2006, the prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that some friends of Mrs Rande had said it, that after having been a great a surfer and cyclist, now seemed "emotionally dead", as if it had "declined to life." 
In April 2007, his real father, Randle terrace, the woman found dead in his apartment in Plymouth. 
It means that Mrs Rande killed itself sofocándose through a plastic bag. 
Mr Randle faced the foster parent of his daughter, who wrote a letter of confession that concluded by saying: "I used to atarla ventarle and the eyes. 
Never was a sexual assault. 
I am responsible for his death. " 
Judge Christopher Elwen to Trerise replied: "You abnormally attached is a very strange, and by his victim must have been a frightening experience, especially when we only had seven years. 
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim to remove his own life. 
Even more clear, is that if she would not have done so, probably the issue would not have ended up in court. " 
And he added: "I noticed the fact that according to the description given by the father and the mother of Stephanie abuse was on his daughter over the years. 
Clearly she would have been able to have a promising future, successful and happy. " 
An officer charged by the loss of data 
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet official who forgot some secret documents in the train in June will be charged under the law on the official secrets. 
The man, in travelling to work by the Ministry of Defence, left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo. 
The documents were past the BBC before being handed over to the police. 
Surely it is the job less serious under the law and there is some indication of the intention to commit crimes. 
The BBC correspondent Frank Gardner referred to the Defence that the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the British administration. 
"They thought that they were an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the cabinet," he said. 
The employee, who cannot be named, is charged under Section 8.1 Law, the clause which relates to the safeguarding of the information. 
The Royal Juríco Service said that the officer should be accused by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Committee of Secret Services. 
Forgotten documents containing secret information on al-Qaeda and the ability of the security forces in Iraq. 
The official was informed of the decision on Monday morning and quickly moved from his home to a secret location. 
Building societies face the price of B & B 
In Britain the construction company could face a price of more than 80 thousand pounds after the rescue of the bank rescue / Bradford and Bingley. 
The government, in effect, provided 14 trillion pounds to protect the deposits of the bank's savers 2.6 million. 
The interest on the loan will be paid by all companies that use the money from savers, including 59 building societies. 
The director general of the Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles, believes "humiliating" that societies and its members have to pay 
Eventually, the loan should be reimbursed after de14 trillion that mortgages of Bradford and Bingley are redimidas. 
However, the interests that they become in the meantime, there are loads every year to the 700 companies which take deposits. 
The plan of the Financial Services Compensation confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building societies are included in that number. 
It is humiliating that the institutions that acted prudently... are called upon to pay the price of the institutions that have been much less cautious. 
Adrian Coles, BSA 
It is to say that each of the companies had to pay in proportion to the bank deposits, and that the societies of mediation had to pay about 18% of the cost. 
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will rise to 450 thousand pounds in 2009. 
This means that companies will have to recover 81 thousand pounds to face the first year of interest. 
Adrian Coles, director general of the Association of Commercial Construction Company, told the BBC that this situation is unfair. 
"It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved with caution in the growth of the real estate market will be called upon to pay the price for those that were much less prudent." 
According to the BSA, there is no data indicate that the failure of any society since 1945. 
"We will have the need to examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to see what options are there to protect the building societies and their members in the face of what could be a significant price," added Mr Cole. 
The interest accrued in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year until the March. 
In 2010, there will be a full year of interests required, that will be almost two times more. 
Still the mutual construction company organisations and not having shareholders, its members will inevitably paying the price, through higher taxes or lower interest on their savings. 
The price of milk rises of five pence per litre 
The inhabitants of the platform of Jersey will have to pay more for their milk. 
The newspaper Jersey Dairy has announced that the higher price of dairy products will rise by an extra five pence a litre from next Monday.

The last time that the higher price of milk had risen before February, was in 2002. 
Denied bail to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh 
A court in Bangladesh has rejected the request for bail for the former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that it can be driven to jail when he returned to his country. 
His supporters said that the court granted bail, accusing it of extortion of 50 million taka ($729.700) a businessman when he was Prime Minister. 
This is one of the several accusations of corruption in his office. 
Its long time political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month. 
The return of Sheikh Hasina in Bangladesh is supposed to be in the next few weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country's government, suportado militarily, given first complete freedom. 
The correspondents say that while it gave him the freedom to go abroad and receive medical treatments, it is not clear now that are the terms of his release or whether it will be able to remain in freedom when it will return to Bangladesh. 
Their lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court. 
"The Supreme Court rejected the request for bail to Sheikh Hasina, claiming that he could not get bail why was already in treatment abroad under probation," said his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq. 
"We are going to lodge an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court." 
Their supporters argued that she needed the bail to return to his country from abroad and prepare for the December elections. 
Sheikh Hasina should return to his homeland after 17 October, according to what was a leader of the Awami League last Sunday. 
She was arrested last year after the interim government, backed by the army, took power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatments. 
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all the charges that are accused. 
The fears for the campaign against polio in Afghanistan 
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan, says the UN - have not podium to take advantage of a recent vaccination campaign anti-poliomielitis because of the violence of the Taliban. 
Last week, the UN has carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country. 
The organisation brings that failed to reach children in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons. 
A UN spokesman said that happened despite the promises made by the Taliban that would not have attacked or hindered to thousands of officials while carrying out vaccinations. 
BSkyB lost a legal challenge in MOT 
BSkyB has lost his legal challenge in the Competition Commission after the decision that required the company to reduce its participation in the MOT rival broadcasters. 
BSkyB has been informed by the court of appeals for Competition that will have to reduce its participation in MOT 17,9% to below 7.5%. 
Precedentemente, the Commission said that the interests of BSkyB hinder competition and allowed it unfair influence in MOT. 
BSkyB bought its package of actions in 2006 under an agreement that effectively blocked at NTL, now Virgin Media, in buying MOT. 
In April 2007, the Office Monopoly Anti resulted in the acquisition of participation in MOT for part of BSkyB whole doubts about the independence of MOT, and carried to the Competition Commission to open an inquiry. 
Everyone, including the head of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the regulator Ofcom opposed to the purchase. 
BSkyB, said that the obligo to reduce its MOT package was not reasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly why, said BSkyB, would have given their voting rights. 
New research in the assumption of the American lawyers 
The Attorney-General of the United States has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine American lawyers in 2006. 
The reason was a report in which the inspector general of the Department of Justice was the action by administration officials. 
The report criticised the officials of the White House, lawmakers and the former Produrador General Alberto Gonzales. 
The investigation was prompted by the fear that lawyers had been removidos for political reasons. 
The Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officials interrogated for research have lied to investigators in the attempt to obstruct justice. 
"Serious allegations of possible criminal acts have not been fully investigated and resolved," the Procurator General Glenn Bellas says in the report. 
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to make their statements. 
The discussion began when nine American lawyers were removidos of their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006. 
In that time, the department led to the decision suggesting that the lawyers had been fired for poor performance. 
But it later transpired that the lawyers had not been evaluated worse than other colleagues, and many observers have led to the conclusion that the despidas would be motivated by political reasons. 
Some of the lawyers in question had worked in the persecution of some Republicans, members of high profile of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of electoral fraud against the Democrat. 
These lawyers investigating judge and court cases to the government 
And they can be dismissed at any time, but not removidos for political reasons. 
Now the head of the Department of Justice, the Attorney-General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure by the redundancies, resigned from his position. 
A number of other officials of the Department of Justice did the same. 
The report of the Attorney-General is very critical of the role played by Mr Gonzales in the matter, and stresses as he had a "primary responsibility" for the layoffs, which "her abdication" of his position of leadership and was "remarkably not colaborativo" in the process. 
Other officials, including Karl Rove, the former Bush aide, were criticised for not having cooperated with the investigation. 
The epic of Meat Loaf of great credit 
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honoured in the Q awards for his anthem epic Bat Out Of hell. 
The singer, who will collect the special award next week at the ceremony that will take place in London, said that getting this recognition will be "an honour". 
The song, which lasts nine minutes and 50 seconds, was the title of the album with that Meat Loaf triumphed in 1977. 
The group of Coldplay are carrying the nominations for this year's awards and doing the classification of the four categories. 
Paul Rees, redactor-jefe of the magazine Q, said: "There are certain songs that transcend time and gender, and Bat Out Of hell is certainly one of them." 
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires an excellent voice capacity as that was used by Meat Loaf. 
A section of almost two minutes opens the anthem. 
The song was known first as a single in the UK in 1979 and came to be number 15 in the classification. 
However, Bat Out Of hell of Meat Loaf remained a nine years in the rankings and went on to sell more than 40 million copies around the world. 
Meat Loaf - real name is Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including a surgical operation by its arritmia cardiac in 2003, after a collapse during a concert. 
In 2007, a acute laringitis forced him to cancel some concerts. 
It subsequently emerged that had a quiste in his string voice. 
Dark streets of the city, often forgotten and perhaps early sales 
The city of New York with thousands of floods, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply of service. 
However, for many people, inclusas taxi drivers veterans and longstanding local residents, it is difficult to find out the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street. 
The small street is in the East Village and extends to the north of the Primiera Calle – before I found the Seconda Calle - between the Bowery and Second Avenue. 
This little street, more or less than 30 feet wide and 120 of long, resembles a polvoriento alley more of an active way. 
There are no signs. 
It is virtually impossible to find on a map. 
The street, however, has admirers. 
For example, there are Avalon Bay, the company which has recently built luxury buildings in the Primiera Calle 
Who wants to repavimentar Extra Place and create a clean corridor to shops and boutiques that is expected to open in the new buildings. 
Other admirers include the neighbours of old data that indicated be delighted by the lane truncated simply because it is one of the last remnants of the past the block before the appropriation of buildings. 
However, the Department of Housing, Preservation and Development of the city, which has control of the street, has no interest in poseerla. 
In the meeting of the Committee of Community of Vencidad for the use of the land that took place this month, representatives of the agency Avalon outlined a proposal to buy the street. 
However, the committee, preferring to the street remained in the city, called for a new plan, which will be presented next month, as Susan Stetzer, the district manager of Community n.3. 
"The city owns very few spaces today and we would like to follow owns Extra Place," said Mrs. 
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the area, but we also want to ensure public access to the street." 
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that he wanted to repair the small streets and install a few seats, including some to be used as coffee, in the hopes of renting spaces. 
The idea that Avalon could buy the street emerged for the first time during the meeting this month 
But Michele of Milly, a spokesman of Avalon Bay, said that despite the fact that the company wanted to use the street, not necessarily wanted poseerla. 
"The primary concern of Avalon Bay is the renewal of this impasse left and the possibility of converting it in a public area," he said, adding that the proposed sale came from the city. 
Seth Donlin, a spokesman of the Committee for the Preservation, confirmed that it was a desire to the city to sell the streets and noted that the mission of the agency is the development of the property more that the management of this. 
In comparison with its surroundings most of colour, the Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark on history. 
Some believe that got its name in 1802, when the great building of ownership of Philip Minthorne was divided between their children and this narrow strip of land was not requested by anyone. 
The back door of the CBGB, the monument of punk rock that closed in 2006, be abriba in Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photograph of the establishment that goes on the deck of the album of Ramones "way to Russia". 
"The atmosphere was excellent," said Danny Fields, the managers - of the Ramones, who took the photograph in November 1976. 
"Was full of rubbish, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes." 
Some residents, including the bloggers to write on the aburguesamiento of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the public goods, even modest, must remain open to the public. 
Others have praised Extra Place as rare piece, virtually unchanged, a raja of the city that should be recognised. 
Jeremiahs Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitulo, "The Book of Lamentations: Bitterly Nostalgic look at City in the process of going extinct"), has made available part of a talk in the history of the city on Extra Place, published by the newspaper The New Yorker magazine in 1952. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a cul-de-sac and a little narrow alley, dark by the day and marked by way of a warehouse of iron corroded and contra-ventanas, with newspapers of old weeks soplados over the canalones." 
With few exceptions, the streets seemed more or less the same on a recent afternoon. 
A rat is curía through the back of the street and close the door standstill because that was used to enter the CBGB and that now is a luxury clothing shop. 
Graffiti in the walls and a bottle of beer nearly empty 22-oz were close to a new batch of discarded newspapers. 
Some interns said that rarely brought attention in Extra Place, but suggested that it could give him a cleansed. 
Mr Fields, for its part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state. 
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark places, humid and nasty." 
The debate on bilingualism: Immersion in the English language 
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates on the bilingual education. 
Lance T. Izumi, an old involved in studies on the California and director of studies of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-autor the book "not as good as You Think: Why the Middle class needs School Choice." 
Draw effectively to Hispanic voters is a difficult business. 
The proposals in the field of education made by Barack Obama are the example of this. 
The campaign of Mr Obama notes that "the Latins afro-americanos and students are significantly less likely to graded white students," and this is a very true. 
To combat such differences in the events of learning, the Obama's education plan specifically calls, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for the alumnos-Inglés. 
However, the open question for Mr Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers in classroom instruction in languages other than English, is effective in the gap in the final results. 
Tomemos, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a primary school officially recognised in the eastern part of the county of Los Angeles. 
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and families with low incomes. 
More than a third of the students, many of them newcomers, are learning the English language. 
However, an incredible 100 percent of students in the fourth year, has been positively assessed in the examination of mathematics of 2008 
And almost an equally astonishing 93 percent has dominated the English language test and arts. 
This incredible success has been achieved by using a different ingredient that favorido by Mr Obama. 
The school Sixth Street emphasises the review and practice, the ongoing evaluation of the competences and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses. 
In addition, and this is where Mr Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the chief of the Sixth Calle, the approach of the school for training of English students is in the "total immersion." 
Immersion in English, means the almost exclusive use of language in the treatment of the contents of the briefing. 
Mrs Mikels, which opposes the bilingual education, I said, "we had extraordinary successes with students as the latter has come from Mexico and that, if in the classroom between 12 months later not serías capable of picking up what was." 
"It works," he said, "we believe that work." 
Will you take Mr Obama a school as Sixth Street Prep as a model of reply for other schools with large populations of pupils hispanos-inglés? 
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the response, but the idea of politicians of his party on the subject of education (Partnerships for the National Education have been for a long time supporter of bilingual education) and his constant support to the bilingual education obscure the prediction of the response from Mr Obama. 
If it is that immigrants should learn English, recently Mr Obama has dismissed the issue by letting the people should stop worrying about the law is written in English, that only 
And instead of that, he said, "you should make sure your child can speak Spanish." 
If Mr Obama wants to improve the system and close loopholes, should carefully consider the models of education that work well, more than despreciarlos or trivializarlos. 
The price of oil falls sharply after the renewed fears economic 
The price of oil fell sharply Monday because of the concern that the American bailout plan for the financial markets may not be able to revive the economy. 
The actions of crude oil fell by 7% reaching 99,80 dollars a barrel in the negotiation of the morning on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
The price has fallen by more than 20 dollars per barrel since last Monday. 
In the last two weeks, the commodity markets have been buffeted by the financial crisis on Wall Street and by a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. 
After reaching a maximum of 145,29 dollars a barrel in July, prices had fallen to almost 90 dollars per barrel at the start of this month, before retreating, once again, because of the uncertainty in the financial markets. 
The anxiety gripped investors, once more, on Monday, despite the leaders of Congress, who said they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the rescue plan, the largest in history. 
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis would end. 
The development in the final episode of the process of merger, confirms that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday. 
Meanwhile, the governments of the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis. 
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, in the hectic weekend, the negotiations that led to the agreement of rescue "seem to have been able to revive the market sentiment." 
As the economic situation deteriorates, is expected in a lower demand for commodities, including oil. 
"The outlook for the global equity, the interest rate of change and will be increasingly uncertain," wrote analysts at Deutsche Bank, in a note to investors. 
"We believe that the basic products will not be able to escape from this infection. 
From the perspective of the products, the most pressing concern is the assessment if the American virus, it will spread worldwide and specifically China. " 
The bank analysts have reduced their expectations for the next year, as oil consumption low because of the crisis in economic growth and a reduction in the price of oil and gas, is of a 20 per cent for 2009. 
Second quarter of madness: Team record set 
After having gone, during the past eight seasons, more time than anyone in the uniform of corporate jets, playing in defence, Shaun Ellis thought they had seen it all. 
Then he saw as things develop in the second quarter this Sunday, when the jets converted a party without note in a game of desinflarse. 
"I have never seen anything like this," said Ellis. 
The second quarter began after the jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played with laziness under the gloom of the clouds. 
In this moment happened that the quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles making a target of 12 yardas and suggesting the harbinger perfect for a late, in that the development of relations between the players took a great leap forward. 
Favre found Coles targets for two more in the fourth, one of these when a cornerback fell and another came with 10 seconds left in the half. 
"I ran out of my way," Favre said of all the steps that were going to Coles. 
"He is a devil of a player. 
Our communication has been great, regardless of what the people may think. " 
While Favre and Coles were carried out in the dam, the defence of the Cardinals maltrataba to the quarterback Kurt Warner. 
The cornerback Darrelle Revis New andante shot a 32 yardas and returned for a touchdown. 
Safety Eric Smith puntó to another pass and the New. 
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to lack for Warner. 
In the last turnover, the failures forced by Bowens, could have been the best. 
The Cardenals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely him a kick from 20 to win a definitive yardas 34-0. 
These are the points higher than the jets never did in a quarter. 
To the team's coach, Eric Mangini, preguntadle described the madness of this moment, said: "The second quarter or the third quarter?" 
When he replied both - the jets allowed 21 points without reply in the third quarter, Mangini said: "I can say that I was much more the second quarter that the terzero. 
Have won a lot of points in a very short period of time. " 
Gebrselassie had tops his world record 
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has shown because many regard him as the greatest athlete of the history, beating his own world record in the Berlin marathon deviniendo this Sunday and the first person capable of running the race of 26.2 miles in 2 hours 4 minutes. 
After the victory in the flat in acomodadiza race in 2: 03: 59, Gebrselassie has destroyed by 27 seconds its previous record of 2: 04: 26, obtained last year in Berlin. 
At the age of 35 years, Gebrselassie has set the world record number 26 in a race of a length impressive so that has set a world championship or a world record for any distance from the race against time until the marathon. 
Last month, Gebrselassie has not taken part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarming, in retrospect - that air pollution agravaran their problems with asthma. 
Instead, they pointed to run in Berlin. 
In sunny conditions almost perfect - and with 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Domingo, using on average a cortantes 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile. 
Since when runners of runway as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have become long distances, the record of the marathon has been reduced by more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin in 2: 06: 05 in 1998. 
After the victory last Sunday, Gebrselassie told journalists who had suffered cramps pantorrilla in the two weeks before and that he had lost a week of training. 
It is clear that the suspension left him fresh, not corroded. 
"I am very happy," Gebrselassie told reporters. 
"Everything was perfect. 
I began again a week ago, and today teñí some doubts, but in the end all was well. " 
The athlete has been the object of some criticism - especially in Kenya, the rival afro-oriental of Ethiopia - to the style of music too their careers, in general, avoiding the meeting with many stars of the world marathon, based on the pacemaker as if it were a career, and putting the record ahead of the sense of competition. 
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of the skills of Gebrselassie as corridor. 
This Sunday, the launch of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached half of the race in 1: 02: 04. 
Two elite runners in Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began to challenge Gebrselassie after its pacemakers fell. 
But shortly before three miles of the goal, Gebrselassie took a final push to secede from Kwambai, who ended second in 2: 05: 36, improving their best record staff for almost five minutes. 
Kamathi came third place in 2: 07: 48. 
In the women ’ s race, Irina Mikitenko, native Kazakhstan but now German citizen, completed a remarkable year, winning in 2: 19: 19, the seventh fastest time in history. 
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2: 15: 25. 
The last spring, Mikitenko, 36 years, was a surprise and won the London Marathon in 2: 24: 14. 
She also took part in the Beijing Games for what was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set his personal best record in almost five minutes into the third marathon that flowed. 
He made a career of intelligent calculation, leaving a quartet of runners Kenyans and Ethiopians do of head and then recuperándoles after 18 ½ miles. 
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won second place in 2: 21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya was third in 2: 25: 01. 
In a separate city, the pride and the evidence of the life of colour 
Outweighed by the expansion of the park to issue of the great Orlando, a few kilometres of the brilliant, vocal and colossal city, is a quiet village, where the pride and the complications of the experience afro-americana are very obvious. 
Eatonville, the first city completely inhabited by black incorporated in the country and place the children of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer so simple as she described in 1935: "The city of five lakes, three areas of croquet, 300 men of color, 300 good swimmers, many guayabas, two schools and not a prison." 
Now it is a place of pilgrimage. 
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and ruby Dee have come to the yearly Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance. 
And yet, in many ways, the city that she described – making it also a tourist stage through its inclusion in the Florida travel guide produced by the Project Federal writers of the depression of the season - remains a place apart. 
The city is independent, dignified and private as it was in the “ 30 years, when Mrs Hurston wrote that rural blacks in the Florida often resistiva to share their real ideas with the white man, "we know so little about us and we do not know what is going to lose." 
Even now, in the year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has drawn attention to start a dialogue on the subject of race, many remain cautious in the face of the stranger. 
"We are very cautious about the way in which our history," said Jones Hortense, 59, a resident of life and a member of the church of the city. 
"Has to be correct." 
Eatonville since has always been defined a paradox of triumph and fight. 
At the same time there is a historical model of the affirmation of blacks and a community of nearly 400 people living under the poverty line twice the national average. 
It is a center of literary, but also an example repaired of rural culture of black South - sometimes overlooked, other praised - which was born of slavery in America. 
It is not surprising, if those who live here are at once proud and reserved. 
And to concern for the image of Eatonville really began by Zora, as nobody here I called Mrs Hurston. 
It introduced his home town at the world through their profound books in dialect as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1937). 
Five paragraphs in the direction of the Florida transformed the city, just outside the map 17, a road that runs through the centre of the Florida often forgotten inward history of blacks and the human tragedy. 
Bearing the face of cement in both life terms in literature, Mrs Hurston led to their readers to the shop of the property of the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then home more private areas. 
"Outside of the road to the left hand," wrote, "there are modern public school marón finished with its white, its well kept jardinos and courtyards of game, care for Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write." 
It also mentions the new husband of the widow Dash and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anyone else is going with transitional rooms." 
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Mrs Hurston in Eatonville relationship with the autonomous government, but also with the illiteracy, the second marriage and sex. 
Of course, this Fodor did not. 
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait. 
"Zora described it as it stands out," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years, one of the girls Johnson that Mrs Hurston inmortalizó quoting men who were singing songs without colour about their beauty. 
He added: "Some people are not liked that." 
Mrs Hurston is still remembered here as a vivacious excéntrica that returned often after his family moved into Jacksonville, Florida. 
Franklin Augusto, 77 years, recalls that when Mrs Hurston arriving in town, it was without notice in a big Chevrolet, smoking and wearing trousers in a city that still prides itself on dress with dignity. 
The majority of residents were fascinated, said Mr Franklin, while many reían sarcásticamente. 
"People are always alegraba much to see Zora," is Mr Franklin. 
But, he adds, balanceándose in his chair in a backyard with view on Lake Sabelia, where Mrs Hurston was probably named, "she never stayed too long." 
When Mrs Hurston died in 1960, was poor and their books were no longer in estampación. 
As the majority of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten it. 
Although it was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only woman of colour in the Barnard College in the years “ 20, was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce - Florida, where he had been living. 
In Eatonville, there was no big memorial ceremonies, or large public readings. 
"Do not believe that their contribution to the world, were seen or his legacy," said Valerie Boyd, author of "In Rainbows Wrapped," a biography of Mrs Hurston published in 2003. 
A turning point came in the ‘ 80. 
The Orange County officials wanted to put a road of five lanes through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-lane road of the labour community. 
The expansion of the area of Orlando had already pushed the Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city. 
The proposal came at a time in which Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history. 
The forced integration, among other things, ended it relatively idyllic isolation of the community. 
In the “ 50, the struggle for racial mixing led the hatred on the community. 
"During this season, a group of white boys, were for the city throwing oranges and every thing against people who were sitting on the side," said Mr Franklin. 
"Also killed a girl, once. 
I launched against a car sandía. " 
In a letter from 1955 to Mrs Hurston wrote in the newspaper The Orlando Sentinel, criticising the forced integration by the Supreme Court, in Brown v. Board of Education "insultaba in place of honour in my race." 
R The residents say today that the desegregation of schools, positive in some aspects, had weakened the cohesion of Eatonville and undermined the confidence of their young people. 
"Black children were used to be abrazados - I agree on this – is used to embrace the teacher in the morning and at night," said N.Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director preserves the Eatonville Community, a non-profit organization. 
This lasted, he added, so that teachers and students not member came from the same place. 
"It is not going to go back to your teacher because white éra - there is a cultural divide there," said Mrs Nathiri. 
Civil rights, however, helped to create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists that went beyond the prejudices, as did she, with buoyant, confidence and lines as: "How can any to deny themselves the pleasure of my company! 
Do not understand. " 
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker was to the unmarked grave of Mrs Hurston and started fighting to resurrect his reputation. 
Five years later, a much-vaunted biography of Mrs Hurston made by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in bookstores, reintroduciéndola in the American charges. 
The project of the road came at the time in which the most famous daughter of Eatonville was once again under the spotlight. 
And this time, the old neighbours of Mrs Hurston the saw as a savior. 
In 1988, the community began to plan a fair to Mrs Hurston to show that the county could ruin with this road. 
Thousands of admirers arrived in the inaugural event two years later, and each January, many returning to the celebration. 
After several years, the county has abandoned its proposal of road. 
"The idea resurrected the road to five ways, would have been put in what you would call speed of curvature, a genuine civic pride," said Mrs Nathiri. 
Mrs Boyd said more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville." 
The victory on the road project has helped to change the image of the city itself. 
People from outside the city as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to come to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to revisit the past. 
Register Eatonville entered into the National History in 1998. 
A new library (carrying the name of Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006, on a repavimentado and may look Kennedy Boulevard. 
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: Only six miles from the center of Orlando, can sometimes sentirte as in a street of past under a barrage of summer, in a city as small as the one that was founded by only 27 black families in the years 1880. 
(90 percent of the black people is today.) 
The outsiders who come in search of the history of Eatonville, its meaning, are still often treated with caution. 
In A permission in advance is necessary to make the most of the interviews, and some things - as the murals in the church of Eatonville, pintados by a white man and showing black men working in the field - may not be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, as Mrs Jones, a teacher courageous and convinced that has a weakness for red brilliant, still fears that its community gives island can be misinterpreted. 
And, however, as the Hurston festival has expanded, has also been a higher level of home pride. 
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville in the same way that Mrs Hurston saw his whole race: Beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and also to the other ethnic and racial groups in America, proud, creative, hard-working, stupid and mixed. 
It is a sincere public-spiritedness that you can listen to the voice of the nephew of Mr Franklin, Edwin Harvey, of 18 years, which is planned to return to Eatonville after the university to work in the local government or by the Police Department, which said it might need some help. 
And even those who are younger, as a lark and Alexia Kenon, two twin 11 years of Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly. 
"The majority of people, in case that dare to go this far, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared with any other'," says lark Kenon after go to church on a recent Sunday. 
"But if you do start and take a moment to look at their history, is a very nice city." 
For here, in New York, all talk corrientemente finance 
On the surface, nothing has changed. 
If tourists in Manhattan remained far from kiosks and of the giant television screens in Times Square, are not realize is in the eye of the hurricane. 
They could never imagine that behind the façade of glass offices to nest of bees that are above their heads, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York face daily with the worst "bad day at the office" for the slump in 1929. 
Home delivery for the kids are doing resonar their trolleys of metal for tea through sidewalks and carrying trays of muffins for breakfast meetings. 
Men still dragging Latins cargodos between apartment buildings, like mules human, with 50 garments estampación excéntrica colgandas a yoke through their shoulders. The office workers still waiting in a queue for their food to wear in the morning, and remains impossible to take a taxi between 4 and 7 by the late in the day. 
Employees expect todavia queuing up for their bagel the trolleys of sellers, and todavia is impossible to find a taxi between the four and five in the afternoon at the Dias of the week. 
I felt as if I had a crisis at all, until this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts that there are, I have decided to open a new account of savings. 
Although had calculated the time needed for the operation coincided with the calm of the end of the evening in my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, a queue of more or less 20 people was already waiting. 
And not ahead of the employee's desk, to withdraw their cash or make a deposit, but in front of bank customer services, where customers of all life ranked their talonarios of cheques, tourists seeking instructions to go to the Macy's stores and new customers want to open up their accounts. 
The majority of these people who preceded me, I was told later by Starr, my "personal banker of confidence", and were in the queue for the same reason that I. 
Unlike me, still, had already withdrawn their savings of the smaller banks in places from where they had conmutados, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the Staten Island. 
They had taken their money out of the so-called savings associations (a little like a society of construction), credit unions and the savings banks from their home town whose brancas only work within the state of membership, and they treat customers as to his family. 
During the past year, 15 of these banks quietly have failed. 
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion of assets, entered bankruptcy, and as the New Yorkers travelled towards their homes Friday evening for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with some savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a buyer of rescue. 
The workers of offices and shops that were in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank in what is seen as a safe haven, what it is doing the majority of rescues on Wall Street. 
The ordinary people of New York have become in recent weeks in experts in finance. 
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking by telephone, referring to Lehman Brothers, the bank failed, and its executive director of aspect afflicted, Dick Fuld, commented on the matter with familiarity as if quejaran of the inactivity of a colleague. 
And Lyn, 50th and something conserje in uniform of my block of flats, has changed the course of our discussions on Brad and Angelina or my shopping at the shopkeeper. 
He said to me, after my visit to the bank, "now I have all my savings in money market funds. 
The reprieve is made, I am not taking some risk. " 
At the time, Muslim graves in which Austria is close to the Right 
Heinz-Christian Strache, the left wing of the party of extreme right to freedom of Austria and Belgian Filip Dewinter, affiliated to the extreme right-wing party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to submit to the organisation "Cities against the Islamisation" in Antwerp, on Thursday 17 January 2008. 
Carry traffic signs that represent the mosques with a red line through. 
The police are blaming a far-right extremists have desecrated a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that the political parties of the extreme right made huge profits in the general elections in the country. 
More than 90 graves were severely damaged in the cemetery of Traun, near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what the police believe was an organized. 
The criminals doused Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David on some of the graves, but researchers think that this may have happened by the attempt to conceal the real cause of the extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants. 
It is not clear if the incident was in some way connected with the elections. 
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply chocados" by the news of the desecration, who came to the Muslim holy month, Ramadan when the was ending. 
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing to a round of soul-searching after the shift to the right in the parliamentary elections yesterday. 
The two far-right parties that are acapararon almost 30% of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had led a campaign encentrada in the vehemence anti-inmigración and some of its slogan were deemed xenophobic by critics. 
Heinz-Christian Strache, leader of the Freedom Party, which won most of the 18 percent of the vote, made his campaign against headscarves and burkas, and moreover, expressed its opposition to the food considered associated with Islam. 
At its last meeting in Vienna, spoke of "a brotherhood" to prevent the emergence of Islam. 
Both parties ententan to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing Islamicisation policy in Austria and Europe. 
Surveys and analysis carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the extreme right as the country's most powerful political bloc, indicate that the change was mainly by those young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union. 
Ban trip abroad for Gary Glitter 
The courts have banned for Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of sexual abuse of children, to travel to France and Spain. 
Glitter to magistrates imposed a ban on six months after he reported to the supervisory authorities who wanted to travel to Spain through France. 
The police in Kent made the ban on travel abroad last Thursday after magistrates had produced evidence of the previous convictions of Glitter for sexual abuse of children. 
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, was not present at the hearing in the District of the Magistrates of Ashford in Kent, but was represented by the lawyer Corker Binning. 
A spokesman for the District's Service said: "The Thursday 25 September in the District of the Magistrates of Ashford in Kent, police called a willingness to prevent Mr Paul Gadd trips abroad as France and Spain until 25 March. 
"Paul Gadd was not present in person." 
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that I wanted to travel abroad, by virtue of being under the register of sex offenders. 
He has to inform the authorities in case wants to travel abroad for more than three days 
And it is also necessary to tell the police the scheduled date with seven days in advance of your departure. 
Kent Police said that it would dispute the individual case or the possible whereabouts of Glitter place in the county. 
A Kent Police spokesman said: "The police in Kent will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad. 
A Kent Police spokesman said: "The police in Kent will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad. 
"From our point of view, it is easier to monitor to someone that remains in the UK because here we have the systems for managing all the possible risks of more effectively. 
"To protect the people of Kent is the main concern of the police in Kent and we are working in close cooperation to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the county and to minimise any risk that may be available to the public." 
Glitter returned to the UK last month after 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, between the ages of 10 and 11 years. 
When he was released Glitter flew to Bangkok, where took a flight to London. 
However, he said that he felt bad and refused to fly to London.

"I understand the master outside the scene to draw their position" Günther Bauer _ photographer 
Neither heels or transporting or costumes of debut. 
The essence of the great masters of the Flemish, deprived of concentration in the interpretation to obtain the relaxed aspect of the man or woman. 
One hand the artist. 
On the other, the person. 
Inseparable except in privacy, in these times outside the public, when find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen or the expresividad of a few hands, despreocupadas because they are not going to get to the scene. 
The German Günther Bauer alternating in "Flamenco-people" teatralidad of some placed on stage with singers, dancers and guitarristas with this less known of these teachers. 
With this proposal, the photographer contains the particular iconography of Fleming from different areas. 
Included in the programming of the Month photograph of the Flemish, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of the Flemish, more every day," explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "may be people anyone but, to see the photos, the observer realises that are not the usual images of artists in the scene. 
This people portrayed "on the street" artists are able to convey in scene passion, sadness, joy... cautivando to the public. 
To attract the personality of these artists not to take pictures of the scene. 
Are in his personality and character. 
What I wanted was to create an intimate atmosphere that I am allowed to catch with the chamber of the personality of the large Fleming ". 
With the taste of the festival "song of the Mine," Bauer began in 1.997 a long journey to portray the cantaores, guitarristas or bailaores with a chamber of plaque. 
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the chamber and the material recall the classic photograph. 
The implementation of various means estilísticos breaking with the traditional base of the image, thereby modernity, idea that reflects how the Bauer the Fleming: "A very traditional music with roots, which develops and surprised every day". 
It is not the action of the dance, sing or the test itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, his art that captive to the public. 
The search for a meeting with the essentials, with the duende made visible in a way to feel, to be and are and have been the constant in this work presented these days in the gallery The Fotómata. 
Well-known figures of Fleming as Diego The lobster, Chano Lobato, Cristina pits, Enrique Morente, The Lebrijano, Antonio channels, Vicente friend, among others, make up this selection of almost 70 artists photograph. 
The project has become a sort of Fleming, who will soon be published in a book on the portraits exposed in the shows. 
The passion for the portraits of Bauer took him to repeat the idea two years ago with "portraits of sportsmen veterans" ("SportARTproject"). 
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, know them and be able to enter a moment in his life, is a moment long or short. 
I believe that within the photograph the portrait is the gender more difficult. 
You find yourself or enfrentas with people, characters, that sometimes or you have, or that you leave only a few minutes to take the photo. 
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas ". 
This collection of portraits of the current Fleming entitled "Flamenco-people" is displayed in the Gallery The Fotómata, located in the number 20 of the streets of the kills, parallel to the alameda of Hercules, which will allow until the next 16 October. 
Vargas Llosa admits that the novel writing is "a recklessness" 
Ambienta in places that are still not known and deals with matters unknown, but even so, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to take forward the new project that works, a novel that has the protagonist of Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalists who lived twenty years in the Congo and moved by the Amazonía. 
The front-runner always the Nobel Prize for Literature confessed yesterday in his step by the Hay Festival Segovia him today that the project is "is a recklessness" and that "everything indicates that should not write" the novel.

The author of "The city and the dogs" was one of the leading figures of the third edition of the works of the floor and fulfilled the forecasts. 
Vargas Llosa, who has won the prize for being the writer Hay Festival more voted for the participants - an ancient version of "Our Mutual groups," of Dickens- filled the aforo of theatre John Bravo. 
Presented by Félix Romeo, found itself in a public that he was handed over to the very short time in which the Peruvian with a memory prodigiosa and with large doses of humour, repasó how was born in him his literary vocation, stemming from the "extrordinaria adventure" of "pleasure to read" and "live more than lived"; how writes of "disciplined way" to fill his "lack of inspiration" with an intensive work of documentation, correcting and rehaciendo much; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas played a part in his vocation and what "images of the memory" are the basis on which underpin their stories. 
The Latin American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and whether the books change life, "but I refuse to believe that the literature is pure entertainment, an experience ephemeral," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people more inconforme", so we asked the writers "not be abandoned to the frivolity" and "shoulder the responsibility" his vocation.

Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of EU to assume their responsibilities in the event Silva 
The general coordinator of EU and Member of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, assured that it will be the regional federation today of the training that will have to take a decision on the case of the former councillor of Youth and Sports in the city of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of making deals in favour of relatives. 
"I am very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organisation have to assume their responsibilities," said Llamazares on the action that the party should take with the hitherto sevillano councillor in the council. 
However, the EU leader defended the need for "transparency" is present in the possible investigations on the irregularities that Silva could have made: "EU has always argued that this kind of issues to have the maximum degree of transparency".

"Blood May ', the gamble of Garci epic 
Drawing on the National episodes of Benedict Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recrea the famous lifting of the Spanish against the French in Blood May, which is the film more ambitious in its filmografía with nearly EUR 15 million budget. 
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and the social analysis" that has always admired in the work of the renowned novelist, has explained today during the presentation of the tape, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a broad range of interpreters. 
Blood of May, with a metraje superior to the two and a half hours, estrena this Friday in the cinema halls, to become the future in a miniserie for Telemadrid of more than four hours' duration. 
A great fan of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci claims to have met this represented "a dream of childhood," we should be thanking Hope Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid charged three years ago got a tape commemoration of the 200th anniversary of 2 May, Madrid, something that accepted if and when the story was based on National episodes. 
The 15 million budget that has brought in its entirety the Community of Madrid to Garci constitute a "unique opportunity" of ambientar decorated with the appropriate costumes and the portrait of a "atolondrada Spain which was wrong to head to fight for, because the fight for independence led people to enormous delay with the reign of Ferdinand VII," he said. 
But the filmmaker regrets not having had a financing as Alatriste or the ghosts of Goya - more than double for the May of Blood, by what has not been able to break some scenes in a script signed alongside Horace Valcárcel, with whom he has cooperated in almost all of his career. 
Therefore, the director of a return to start, has emphasised that it is their usual way of work, the scenario with the players, with the often test before the trial and to those who do not casting, like "humiliating" and that "part of the job of director is going to the theatre and cinema in order to know what is happening in the industry in which works". 
Many of the interpreters with which coincides in Blood repeated in May before his chamber, as is the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén crow. 
Candidate at the Oscar in four times - of which won one -- Garci believes that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year at the Academy of Hollywood, the Blood of May, Seven French ping pong tables and finally selected, The girasoles blind, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "that is to be known," he said. 
With this film Garci not expected prizes. 
"In the beginning you believe trabajas for posterity, then you notice that only trabajas for prosperity, and now you to make a film conformas more," explains Garci after more than 30 years of career. 
Elizabeth Bayón recovered the essence of the dancers sevillana Tórtola Valencia 
A bailaora sevillana going to pay homage to a dancer sevillana too. 
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, father Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and mother Andalusia (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana, and when I was three years moved into London with his family. 
It was a free dance dancer and specialist in oriental dances. 
It was a fascinating life, a pioneer of the release of the woman, as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt. 
It was a Buddhist and vegetarian and called for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women. 
The life of this woman that marked a revolution dancística aesthetic and in Europe between the wars, fascinó to Elizabeth Bayón. 
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character and I thought it was incredible." 
According to the bailaora, "does not intend to count his life but collect their spirit. 
The titles of their dances I have suggested sticks of Fleming. 
As well, "dance of the butterfly" I suggested a guajira, or "dance of the snake," a tangos. 
Their dance was sensuous and I have told me that my dance is also within this aesthetic, "he says. 
The hoax has two exceptional partnerships: Miguel Poveda that cantará again to Elizabeth in one in their shows, just as it did in the case of "The open door"; and with the masterpiece Chorale Matilde, who exceptionally wanted to work with anyone outside their student. 
"Matilde Tórtola makes more, the character of the maturity. 
I am happy because has agreed to act in my work and I am very honoured by this ". 
The assembly also account with music composition and guitarras of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi of Morón; the pistons of The sketch, as well as the breaches of Rafa The Viola and the cooperation of a player, Juanfra Juárez, "which is the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were divas in its entirety, and which are always love them." 
In the film is somehow the life of the woman who developed in places as far away, especially for the era, such as India, the United States, or Russia, and throughout Europe, because they were usually in London. 
"I wanted to remember it because I believe that it is of these women who have a huge influence in a particular period, and now no one knows and much less in value their work," says Bayón. 
The show begins today at the Antis hours in the theatre Lope de Vega. 
The publication of "Journal poet of a newly married" is also the three-year period 
The presentation of the first edition illustrated the "Journal Reciencasado of a poet" at St Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez gave marriage with Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the planned activities by the Department of Culture of the Andalucian to celebrate the "three years Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organised to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of both. 
In this way, the "three years Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the republication of this work, with the International Congress to be held in New York, with the restoration of the House and with the Nobel Museum travelling exhibition, "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That chopo of light", which was inaugurated last May and that, after travelling by the various provinces of Andalucia, will travel to New York during the course of the International Congress. 
Furthermore, the Department of Culture of the Andalucian has acquired a total of 800 copies of "Journal Reciencasado of a poet," published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the post and the work of one of the poets Andalusians more universal. 
America is like less without Paul Newman 
"Sometimes God creates people perfect. 
Paul Newman was one of them ". 
The phrase is the actress Sally field, who worked with him on "absence of malice," and gives the idea of the distress of American cinema, and across America, before the striking idea that Newman has gone. 
Look that cost them to give him an Oscar. 
And that was withdrawn from 2007. 
And we knew that he was very ill. 
It has been a blow to all. 
"Sometimes it feels is beyond any expression, and I have lost a great friend," was mourning Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to its existence". 
No one was afraid to do the ridiculous or exaggerate. 
A father had died of cinema and the country in a particularly dark, with fear of terrorists and markets, with the American self-esteem by soils, desperately searching the grounds for the dignity. 
When so hard is the time and without virtue men and very few beings who admired you are, you do not need be Luis Cernuda to love to Paul Newman. 
Embodied for all an almost Platonic ideal of beauty and truth. 
It was the enemy of Richard Nixon and defender of lost causes and won, from the foundation for combating drugs created in honour of his primogénito died from overdoses until their brand of home and organic food. 
A gift to a country that has spent much recovering from a suicidal food culture. 
The wavelength expansive of the admiration barría Hollywood regardless of nationalities or passports. 
The latest James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, concluded that has killed a man, but an era. 
Another English, the oscarizado director Sam Mendes, said that work with Newman was neither more nor less that the summit of his career. 
The bad boy arrived in Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration. 
"We have left the bar very high at all," concluded George Clooney, perhaps one of the few that today dares to try to live as experienced Paul Newman: Maintaining high the requirement of probity and private life have a serious and away from the cameras. 
This is not always easy or even possible in the jungle media today. 
But there are those who tries to, and Paul Newman is his example. 
It divorció once but then was married fifty years with Joanne Woodward, that was true when there would probably not be good opportunities. 
"But what I am going to eat hamburger outside the home, if within have steak?", used to joke himself. 
In the sky has the pride that in the land their daughters to coincide with its called anoraks, something not so common in America. 
"Of all the major papers that he interpreted, none was as proud as the devout husband, father lover, grandfather assiduous and philanthropist devoted", they say. 
The career of an Olympic Madrid imperfect 
Yes, the dream of many of us is to be held in Madrid a few Olympics and, after the failed 2012, that may be the 2016. 
But I wonder, are we ready? 
If we follow the example of the race yesterday, I say no! 
The race was the perfect, and in my view has been the worst race with much in which I have been. 
A height of absurdities that, of course, if you take into account as evaluation and I look, it would be a very clear. 
But we go for parties and from the outset. 
The outrages begin with the collection of the ganglion, that you just have to go before. 
This does not seem to me wrong, but if you do go to give all (including the chip to avoid queues in the race). 
Because not. 
Here you were going to collect the ganglion (first inanity, go only to that) and (after the relevant queue), surprise!, had only scratch 'S' for the jersey (second inanity, because I need a size XL) 
In what world we live? 
Or is that by the crisis have decided to buy only small T-shirts with less fabric and cheaper? 
Because, well, things as they are minor compared with the day of the race. 
Apart from that have to go very soon to collect the chip, the queue to get is 15 minutes and, furthermore, we must make the rucksack. 
More than 35 minutes lasted until, incomprehensible to a race where it is expected to more than 11,000 people. 
Then, as expected, began the race and we still had not made the rucksack, although once achieved, the collection was worse. 
Moreover, the rain amenizó the hopes of more than 40 minutes, coupled with of popular revolt and assault on the booth. 
I believe that some 500 people pulmonía will probably tomorrow, and some as I, even appearing with the right time in the classification, owing to the chip that gave me that, I imagine, I am not marked out correctly. 
Of course, if I ask for the perfect race, this does not come into my thoughts. 
So I believe that we will continue to dream of an Olympic city well prepared. 
Microsoft seeks virtual (receptionist) 
In the MIT emerging technology conference Microsoft has shown a development of a new system of recognition of image and human interaction, a kind of artificial Intelligence without a lot of intelligence but able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move on the campus of the company) on what is listening in the conversation. 
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of forms and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people in the room, who they are - even remember what have been given - and listen and understand the key words of their talks. 
Also brought to the present, according to the groups of conversation. 
In the video shows the receptionist detects a third person but understands that does not belong to the group that is talking with it and that is not an employee of the company. 
I question if it is there to visit someone and said that I received in brief. 
All without pantallazo blue. 
Very impressive. 
But that, of course, is the future. 
Now the company has better things to focus, for example in the next version of its operating system, Windows. 
This week has spoken very above a change of strategy in Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many related programmes. 
Steve Ballmer, has discovered that if the computers come with the essential instead of full of commercial basurilla, would go five times faster - man, Steve, because it will be for less. 
A discovery bearing in mind that Microsoft, version after version, has added functions and "extras" to Windows. 
The change of direction. 
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and also the software. 
When Google chrome came to the net, was one of those who joined the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows. 
Many rightly pointed out that a navigator is not an operating system. 
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential to the hardware and the software will understand. 
It serves the same function that their wife or their husband when you must say something to his mother-in-law. 
Is true. 
Never go away but we need to think about the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but on. 
What Ballmer has said this week is the confirmation of this idea. 
People ever paid less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser. 
The computer is building only to implement the Firefox or the Explorer - or chrome - and every day we spent more time in the area of windows. 
Why are half of the applications that come in the system? 
Less is more. 
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, that Vista. 
Less cumbersome, less stretched, less complex. 
To Microsoft is more interested in integrate its online services, and that will be an alternative to Google. 
We desperately need, in fact, and I bring a small example. 
The photo of this post the took in one of the rest rooms for employees of Microsoft in Redmond, at the beginning of the month. 
In the machine of soft drinks a poster asked to use its search tool - "Tu search. Our future". 
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of employees of Microsoft used Google to find in the network. 
Last week, incidentally, was also a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7. 
Not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, rather in 2010. 
In Microsoft probably will look at the launch of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7. 
The telephone, after all, is increasingly computer. 
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already in the street, going to happen bill. 
Marcel Fabuleux I 
Pablo Picasso the was in the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio lucía a "blood diamonds" of Edward Zwick, like Al Pacino in "The godfather" of Francis Ford Coppola and form part of the uniform of the parish gay musculada. 
And if we are to list appearances points, we can go back to the image of the forzudo of moustache puntiagudo that lifted weights in a travelling circus. 
In essence, it is more than the typical home male jersey in cotton, tight fit and without sleeves. 
The 'tanks', knocking the anglos speakers, but I Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles express above all others. 
First, by his bombast behalf - although them familiarly is known as' Marcel '- which has to do with the sport because it gets its name, according to the legend, the office Marcel Cerdan, lover of the singer Edith Piaf. 
"The Marcel 'stresses on the other for his excellent cotton, for his court unisex, for its distinctive shield and by the small Belgian flag (barely recognisable) that the most symbolic jersey models are as detail in the neck. 
And attention, because the production of the Belgian firm not only focuses on their tanks tops. 
It also includes sudaderas college, boxers retro, of cashmere cardigans, cotton trousers, T-shirts maritime, babies, mini shorts... 
Clothing designed for the comfort underwear. 
Although it is a pity leave them as underwear. 
Have too much charm.

It was the bomb, almost better than go to the theme park. 
Then, of dancers, always was caring how I vestía. 
We know that the dancers we like very much to our estilismos classes and trials, to look in the mirror and be well. 
And in the role of an actress when the costumes is when you really find the man.

Then, you are thinking in being a mother or not? 
Of course, I know that I am going to be mother because I asked the body and, moreover, I would like to be young mother; I do not like to lose. 
As to the candidate, I am not concerned. 
What I will do is give them a lot of happiness to my son and educarlo with much love.

Good, good, not saying that. 
It is not that I rising to a bridge to make model. 
Quite simply, I called Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, for inviting me to go to London to take part in a parade beneficial for their organisation "Women for a better world" and the clothes that we display - I got two pieces of our collection for shots - subastaba to raise money for the NGOs of Naomi.

The driver wants home with three administrative sanctions for alcohol, have to install in your vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle pulled up drunk, or if it is not blow. 
The initiative was announced last June and now already is included in the annual report of the Prosecutor General's Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last a year.

In this sense, a study carried out in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles fitted with devices to reduce in a 65% offences during the first year of implementation. 
And in Spain it is estimated that could save the lives of 115 people each year. 
The measure is confined to administrative penalties for two reasons: To address these behaviour before they escalate into criminal offences. 
And facilitate its implementation, because the legal reform can be done by ordinary way, and, however, the necessary reform of the criminal law requires a reform in an organic law. 
The device is not yet available in the Spanish market in any form of trade, although it has already been introduced on an experimental basis in some industrial vehicles and public service. 
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies vote tomorrow, an initiative of the PSOE in which it proposes to install in school buses this system, as it has done in France.

Shots has presented the second edition of The Botón-Mango Fashion awards, to enhance the international profile of the new talent to the fashion.

1001, the number antiestrés 
There are 1,000 but 1,000 more a case of forgetting the chaotic and frenzied everyday life. 
And if that were not enough, all are collected in a book that will bring leisure to bookstores on 30 September. 
The despertador almost punished when sounds every morning at 7 a.m. this morning, but it is even worse to imagine entangled in the hectic pace that imposes the current lives. 
The office is called tension and the computer back pain. 
The stress is the evil of the 21st century. 
But there is not one or two methods to combat the daily exhaustion and the problems of disconnect with the world of work. 
No, the number is, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001. 
Regardless of the positions of yoga, the traditional massage treatments Spa 'or', Susannah Marriott meeting in the pages of a book a "menu" of potential adapted to taste and minutes of each one. 
The project is called "1001 antiestrés ways to relax" and his calm will bookshops of the power of the editorial Pearson Alhambra and DK. 
If someone believes that it is not possible to achieve peace in areas such as the work or through personal relations, this "manual" belies this belief. 
In addition, offers other procedures as being in contact with nature and recipes 100% natural that contribute to the relaxation. 
If the adrenalin no longer runs through your veins to restore the balance of the body and the stress has become a problem, it is time to sit down on the sofa, shut down the mind and concentrate on the reading. 
To talk sleepy 
Some children speak for the night. 
I am not referring to those who are very espabilados telling us something that happened the previous day, but to children who are still asleep. 
The first time it happens to the best you take fright, but in reality it is not important. 
It is a benign redrawing the dream that is called somniloquios. 
It is quite rare, especially in children and adolescents. 
Sure that most of you have been told that spoke for the night. 
This phenomenon can be very sporadic (once in a lifetime for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more regularly (every day, once a week, once in months...), the next day the child does not remember anything. 
There is not a single cause that determine their appearance. 
Often they are connected to other changes to the dream as tend to be the nightmares, the night terrores, the night sleeping pis enuresis (be) or the sonambulismo, but it need not be that way. 
As we have already mentioned earlier can also be linked to pictures of foot and very high, at times of stress or sobreexcitación. 
Of all modes is a phenomenon little studied. 
The intensity with which it is also very variable. 
It may be that speaks in a tone of voice calm, words loose, a murmur or otherwise (cries, llantos, long speeches …). 
In cases where the demonstration is very intense should observe the child and consult with a specialist, to see if there is any question that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives way out of this way. 
We have said that it is a benign disruption, therefore has no treatment, except that is linked to another alteration of the dream that we can treat (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or a picture of stress). 
What we can do is to take into account a number of very simple preventative measures such as: 
Try not to excite much the child before they go to sleep. 
Therefore seek games and avoid programmes or television series that are of fear or a little violent. 
With children very nervous and that I find it hard to relax, it can use relaxation techniques to help them to acquire a degree of calm. 
This will be that the child can have a dream more calm. 
Once appear the somniloquias try to keep calm. 
'Remember that are harmless to the child and that the next day not remember nothing of what has happened. 
Useful consejos 
Not despertéis. 
It is pointless, because he is not aware, and I romperéis the dream. 
Although he is talking, he is asleep and is therefore descansando. 
'Remember that if it shows very angustiado for several episodes should consult or find out what creates so much anxiety in the child. 
If we understand what he says (which is not the most unusual), not caigáis in the temptation to an interrogation to coax information. 
Not conseguiréis nothing, because to be asleep is not aware as to organise their thinking. 
In addition you oiréis what he says, but you know what is dreaming to say that, with this very careful in how interpretáis information and with the conclusions that sacáis. 
I would never say the child that you can interrogate evening to know their secrets. 
Even joke. 
That creates a lot of anxiety. 
In short, Don't worry, is not a bad thing, it is an episode that lasts only a few minutes. 
I Illhaeusern on end! 
The football club, Illhaeusern, found the road to victory in his field after a long period of scarcity. 
Without having done a good party, the team created many times of goal and was able to make a goal to win the match. 
The pace was not very constant during this meeting in which the attackers had difficulty to express themselves. 
After a first attempt of the captain Kaufmann that rozaba the escuadra shot by far, Illhaeusern virtual was going to take the "power" and for Question far Fonderflick, then with Hirn, Romain with the tip of the foot or Diebold also came to prevent the defence of Dannemarie. 
In front, not to leave the centrocampista and just leave Riahi in a position to attack. 
The principle of the second time it was crucial, first with two occasions of goal and Temporale Riahi for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the scoreboard for the Illhousiens with the goal of Marais, well placed to collect the ball rejected in a first attempt to Diebold (53 '). 
But the scorer Illhousiens cannot savour a long time their happiness and will be forced to return in the historical cupboards a dozen minutes later and leave their fellow team in numerical inferiority. 
But Dannemarie will not take the time and will not be a problem for the eleven illhousiens that fell slightly to "compressing" their defence, except in the last seconds of game in which, after a major farfulla, the ball went very close to the transversal camp.

The political analyst David Gergen believes that the provision of John McCain, although honourable, was not "quite" brilliant "to enable it to halt its low in the opinion polls to five weeks of the presidential elections. 
The Gallup institute, whose public opinion poll published last Sábato attaches five points of advantage for Obama (49% to 44% for McCain), judges is the democrat who went well. 
Among the undecided voters, which are the that count, Obama came out on top with 39% of respondents, while 25% of them give the victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll. 
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the good provision expected of its member of her own candidacy, Joseph Biden, for the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin. 
"It would be a mistake to be underestimated. 
It has good instincts, "warned however Bill Clinton this weekend. 
The septuagenario McCain revealed his undisputed experience in foreign policy, stressing the "naïve" of his opponent on those issues that were at the heart of this first confrontation. 
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that..." accused in several times. 
"Do not believe that Senator Obama has the experience and the knowledge needed to be president," also assured.

The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former mimbro of the Clinton administration, compared the "good economic instincts" of Obama with those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998. 
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financiario disaster "is the final result of eight years of bad economic policy implementation by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain."

"In Minsk," did noticed the elections in Minsk? " 
Young and protestors demonstrating the Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarussian capital in advance to reject the results of the legislation. 
Some hundreds of Belarusian met Sunday afternoon from the closure of the polling stations in the central square in Minsk to protest against the flawed nature of the legislation. 
While no results had been announced yet, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "The dictator, must resign." 
Some recognize not having voted: "Why, since they will do what they want with my vote," says a young. 
I do not believe that the regime that was good for foreign observers to renew contact with the European Union is prepared to make a democratic change. 
The penalties, among which l interdiction of visas for 40 Belorussian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are regarded as fair to observers. 
Were not according to the opposition. 
"We have been set to the side of the electoral committees and our observers could not participate in the counting of the votes," he regretted Iouri Potemkine, the spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous reunification of 12 games. 
"It is a cosmetic change, stresses Alexander Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the presidential election in 2006 and leader of the movement pro-European, because what is important is who counts the votes, and in our house, is the executive. 
If some members of the opposition in parliament, it is because they have been nominated, but not chosen. 
"But its entry to parliament can mean appearances on television, meetings in the regions and proposals of law." 
The opposition must since entering the political game because "we must begin a dialogue with the European Union. 
Because if our economy, which has many debts front of Russia, is in crisis, and if we do not reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia. 
But we want to be independent. " 
The opposition fears that the Organisation for security and cooperation in Europe that followed the election process does not recognise the validity of the vote. 
Stresses that turnout figures seem too high, and that the extension of the vote in advance (26% of the electorate in Minsk) favored manipulation. 
"Did you see the elections? Mulling the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of two recent political prisoners released in August of this year. 
There was no one in the polling stations. 
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in parliament, the suit that better to power. "

On television, President Loukachenko and members of the central election commission are happy for his success. 
The interview - Blood to be sure 
Yesterday Héma-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its chairman, Francine Décary, had reason to be pleased, because Héma-Québec has returned to be one of the suppliers more safe and effective of blood in the world. 
And above all, reconquered it the confidence of the public that seriously had been vacilada by the scandal of the contaminated blood in the 1980's and 1990. 
As you know, the national reserves administered by the Office of blood transfusion of the Canadian Red Cross have been contaminated by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the virus for hepatitis C during the 1980's. 
Faced with this tragedy and the anger of the public, the government of Canada announced in February 1994 a public inquiry, chaired by the judge Horace Krever, which was intended to clarify the circumstances that had led to this tragedy and make recommendations for such a disaster is not reproduce more. 
While the judge Krever used in presenting their relationship, certain provinces then created a committee that was intended to plan a new management system of blood in Canada. 
In Quebec, the committee Gélineau met this mission. 
As a result of the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Society of blood to supply all the other provinces and territories. 
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began their activities, almost 38% of people still had confidence in the system of blood in Quebec, recalls Décary. 
The situation was grim. 
After many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and much work over the years that followed, have regained the confidence of the public, "says before proudly claim that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the population was henceforth quebequesa confidence in Héma-Québec. 
Dr Décary recalls however that "the confidence is something extremely fragile." 
Since its creation, the 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec applied the precautionary principle. 
In that time, asistíamos in Europe at the birth of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, account Décary. 
And we did not know if the disease could be transmitted by blood. 
Then we support in one of the main recommendations of the reports and Gélineau Krever, according to which when we do not know and when a serious disease can come from that, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is characterised by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to the death, implementing measures of exclusion. 
In April 1999, because refuse the blood of people who had been more than a month in the UK since the 1980s. 
But, a few years ago, it has been proven beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood. 
This episode showed us so that the precautionary principle that applied had the sense. " 
In 1999, appeared on the market a technique much more sensitive in detecting the HIV: The tests that can detect directly nucleído acid in the blood of the donors to the presence of viruses and not of antibodies against the virus, which governed the evidence used until now. 
The acid test nucleído to shorten the period between the moment in which the person has been infected, and the time when the first virus can be detected in the blood of our technical, explains the specialist. 
We were able to reduce this period in less than a week. 
So substantially diminish the risk that some donors are infected without knowing it, and that we cannot detectarles. 
These improvements were significantly reduce the risk of contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion. 
Today, one person every 12 million runs the risk of receiving contaminated blood for HIV. 
"This means that we will have to distribute 12 million blood products before someone is infected with HIV. 
As well as Héma-Québec distributed each year between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products, it will take more than 24 years before that comes along, a case of transmission of HIV by a blood product. 
I believe that we can now receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to regain health without concerns, "says the head of the direction of Héma-Québec. 
"Our challenge for the coming decade is to maintain the safety of our products. 
Never know which pathogen could emerge in the system. 
Last year, appeared in the island of Réunion the chikungunya virus that, for example of the West Nile virus, which is transmitted by an insect in the blood. 
We must be constantly vigilant, "pursuing Dr Décary before stress that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide sufficient supplies. 
"The needs are increasing because the population is ageing. 
Since the carcinogenic anti-Saddam more aggressive treatment, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or plaquetas. 
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors that brings together on average only 3% of Quebequeses admissible in blood donation. " 
All the people with good health, to 18 years and that correspond to the eligibility criteria can however donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year. 
On average, 14% of the people by its blood are not accepted, because suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if travelled in a country where malaria, will be excluded for a period of one year. 
"With this 3%, we managed to maintain an inventory that cover the needs of hospitals. 
The hardships are very rare. 
But we must renew the members of this network of donors as they get older and cannot more donate blood. 
But it is difficult to convince the people donate blood, but above all detaining them and encouraging them to be regular donor. 
Since the current life is very rampant, are rarely the time to spend an hour to donate blood, "it afflicts Francine Décary. 
With a budget of $297 million annual not only Héma-Québec supplies blood products, but also human tissues, including óseos grafting, cardiac valvas, balloons eye and skin that is almost exclusively used to the great burnt. 
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which manages the only public bank of umbilical cord blood in Quebec. 
The umbilical cord that formerly was regarded as a biomedical waste is full of rich blood stem cells that can be used for the treatment of serious diseases such as leukaemia. 
"We have had a few weeks ago, the bank in the implementation of our thousandth of umbilical cord blood and is expected to draw more than one of these per year. 
Tendríamos that begin to propose to grafting at the beginning of next year, "precise Décary doctor who describes this programme of cord blood as very popular. 
"Many mamás are disappointed not to be able to enjoy this," since Héma-Québec has no resources to propose this programme complex and costly in every hospital in Quebec.

Rejecting the limits of our last great northern border ": Such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force in the broad lines, at the end of the Liberal Party's general council of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday. 
Behind him, during his speech, were projected images. 
Desfilaban, in three screens immense, spectacular images of hydroelectric dams, mining, of Quebec seen by "Google previous MGPs", maps, etc. 
Big media as during the election period. 
The first minister thinks that the elections will be held this autumn, although he did see that his schedule was very full. 
The "North approval" is the fourth side of a "vision" that the prime minister intends to take to Quebec, of a "new economy", which includes an agreement on the workforce with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmony with Ontario. 
Often mentioned in the speeches of the prime minister recently, the opening up of the North - the northern territory to 49 ° parallel - have never been the subject of a presentation. 
The first minister was however explain why the North was "a huge potential gem", but did not give a term, amounts of investment, and priority needs in future projects. 
What could be more developed are, above all, particularly the hydro-electricity, the forest, but above all the mining sector, dopado by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure. 
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper and platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond", according to the list of Mr Charest. 
This "territory twice as large as France", "is home our, is in Quebec. 
Not only is home to us, but that is for us, "insisted, as to show that called for a national myth. 
Quebec is built much thanks to its relationship with the North, stressed: The flood into gold in Abitibi, quebequesa engineering, James Bay. 
"We belong, is our future," he added, after a theatrical pause to look at the map vast behind him. 
The North, 70% of the territory quebequés, comprises a part of the Labrador that Quebec always proclaimed, said the prime minister during the press conference. 
"It is a traditional position that all the governments confirmed. 
There is a line of border in which we are in agreement for a long time and, when the time comes, I reiterate the position of the government, "said. 
Moreover, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the north," said about the passage of the northwest, which will open each year due to the magistrates of the ice. 
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that occupy the territory is a duty. 
And the inhabitants of the territory, the United and the Inuites Primeras? 
The first minister said that the government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly to young people. 
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (a former Member of the party's quebequés Ungava), already begun consultations nearly thirty or so communities. 
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and natural Resources) has an important role began some work. 
The prime minister did not rule out an important meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a meeting in which "will be a common vision." 
The development of North would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. 
The North Plan "will be concluded, ordered and respectful of the environment," he promised. 
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with the prime ministers liberals who preceded him. 
"As the liberals who preceded us, we thought of another way to transform the challenges in new opportunities for growth and development." 
This was one of the recurring themes of weekend, which began Friday with a great cocktail to underline the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage party to power. 
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Central Beauharnois Adélard-Godbout in dam. 
"Godbout, which created HydroQuebec, in Lesage that made the quiet Revolution and the nationalisation of the hydro-electricity, in Bourassa James Bay that he was able to shape the future of our party," said John Charest. 
At the press conference, claimed another reference, that conservative, the programme "roads to the North" of John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963. 
On the subject of hydro-electric dam project of Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest stressed that its start-up is scheduled for 2012. 
"It is among us, but I plan to be there," entrusted to its militants, provoking applause. 
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that would not have held elections in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, not ruled out the possibility of launching a vote this autumn, what the law allows it. 
He stresses that his schedule is full, particularly because of a mission of the board of the federation in China and a summit Quebec-Nueva York York. 
The general advice for weekend abasteció liberal chief on a platform that contained resolutions nationalists, particularly "constitutional aspirations" that they had no problems to be accepted: The Liberal Party of Quebec calls in particular for the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution. 
Also wants Quebec name to members of the Council of the Canadian telecommunications and broadcasting and that they have a right of veto on the decisions taken in Quebec. 
The side of the opposition, we welcomed the broad outlines of the plan North with scepticism. 
The head of the party quebequés, Pauline Marois, did highlight the North development policy that the government of Quebec Landry had launched in 2001. 
According to it, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, resigned to apply it. 
If we had done that, "would be made today," said Mrs Marois alongside its candidate on Jean-Talon (vote that was made today), Françoise Mercure. 
The Democratic Action of Quebec seemed to support the adoption of a North Plan of part of the government. 
"But what it wants, is that this is not just a show," said the leader Sebastien Proulx, to replace Mario Dumont, who returns from holiday today. 
Letters - One country brought shame 
It is Mr Vic Toews, former Minister of the "Justice" (oh, irony!) in the cabinet Harper, allowing the summer say that Luisa Arbour was a "disgrace" to Canada. 
Dishonouring this woman who led a relentless fight for justice and that deserves our admiration it says everything about the relations of the prime minister, Stephen Harper. 
We are in the face of a government that is the only, between all Western countries involved, that has not repatriated to their national who is imprisoned in the concentration camp in Guantánamo. 
It is a government that does not take account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager very young when the facts that we are recriminados occurred. 
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, denies its promise and leaves living in inhuman conditions a child soldier. 
The only thing that chonta with a false justice to assess the guilt of the accused. 
Recordemos that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian lawyers, particularly, argue the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order that enjoys the benefit of a fair process in Canada. 
Is this government that closes its eyes on torture: Little care that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, without doubt forever after so many years of violence. 
Yet we realise that, but we are in this moment a treacherous erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", that is the word that Harper continued to repeat and that makes no sense. 
Now the time has come for which there is no moral more: Can the maltreatment, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen and wants the head of government until now a minority (what will happen after the 14 October?). 
Many voters believe that you will find salvation in a party that eulogises Virtue, Law and Order: Not see that this government resigned to what was the reputation and the dignity of our country. 
Mr Toews shame is caused by this resignation and nothing more. 
Opinion free - The Orwellian speech of Barrick Gold 
In its edition of 17 September, Le devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of the Canadian mining Barrick Gold. 
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold asserts that the company in the world's largest aurífera tried a process for defamation of six million euros against three authors and a small publishing house in order to bring about a "public debate transparent". 
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that judge, especially in the case of persecution for defamation, but the law. 
No surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr Garver. 
Why, according to Barrick Gold, the best way to deliver a public debate would damage whoever dares to sustain a position contrary to yours? 
The outcome of the case is of little importance, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir between Canada must spend considerable sums in order to prepare his defence and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers sustained by the pockets almost without substance of the mine. 
The tactic, in these fights unequal, is often consists in ruin to defendants in order to impose a friendly solution that amordazará the opposition in addition to frighten anyone dare to look again at the issue. 
If Barrick Gold really wanted to a public debate, is in front of the public that would have had to submit their vision of the facts. 
Contrary to what is done in a number of countries where works Barrick Gold, the debates in Canada are normally for the exchange of ideas and not beaten with a stick. 
It was enough for mining that opened its books, their files and establish a genuine debate, through the newspapers, the media, publications and financing independent teams of search that would have been able to clarify the issue. 
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust the public and rejected petitions and letters of support for the perpetrators of Noir between Canada. 
Does Mr Garver Posiblemente could explain how can ask for a debate "public" scorning the views of this? 
According to the Vice-President, it seems that this word known only to lawyers and not highly paid for all Canadians; this is a very narrow view of the concept. 
In a democracy, the opponents also have the right to speak. 
What does not understand - or what is not to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public that underpins the authors and publishers of Noir between Canada is particularly because it rejects the mining of the brutal way. 
The public is willing to listen to Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of arguments civilized changes, and not in the context of what many people perceive as a persecución-mordaza (pursuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just put a request with regard to the authors of Noir between Canada intimándolos not to use this word). 
In addition to the surreal speech Mr Garver, the process of Barrick Gold is a direct attack against the university and freedom to search for the truth, essential couple all democratic societies. 
Denied the right to quote credible sources and make a debate on the facts and the interpretation, which represent the basis of intellectual work. 
If it is impossible to study and discuss subject that dislike to rich companies of this world in a country such as Canada, under penalty of many persecution, who can? 
If Barrick Gold truly like a public and transparent debate, could do so following scientific standards used by the authors of Noir between Canada. 
Has a right of reply. 
The university world, to which we belong, known for a long time to administer the debates and the disagreements and resolve conflicts. 
The persecution of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what is, does not want to make a transparent debate. 
It is a loss for the university world, but also to the public debate in Canada, and it is time that governments affix devices that limit this kind of proceedings. 
Rescue operation of Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans agree 
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally came to an agreement yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
The new version of the plan of $700 billion Americans that seeks to stop the financial crisis that is affecting Wall Street for months, must still be approved by both Houses of Congress. 
For particularly: Better control on the part of the representatives of their implementation of new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public money invested, the new provisions to contain the number of homes seized the lack of payment, as well as a right of scrutiny on wages paid to the leaders of the often-quoted companies. 
The American Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the chairman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a marathon of negotiations Che lasted two days. 
"We are making great progress with a view to an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson. 
"Everything has been done to covered the economy and ordinary Americans before the current crisis on Wall Street," explained the democrat. 
"It is the fundamental point: If we do not do this, the trauma, the chaos and the disruption on the daily lives of Americans will be immense," declared the Republican Judd Gregg. 
The negotiations had ended very rapidly in the last few hours because they feared the impact that would lead to a new failure in the mood of investors. 
The last time that had set was the opening up of the markets this morning. 
The two candidates in the American presidential elections, which have rallied late in the negotiations, were more favourable to the agreement, without forgetting however squeezing their displeasure be forced to reach this popularly. 
The Democrat Senator Barack Obama gave him certain provisions to reach the agreement, particularly the that would allow homeowners to keep their home and on the pay of corporate leaders survivors by the state. 
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is welcome. 
But these measures are necessary, "commented on the American television. 
His Republican opponent, John McCain, interrogated in another string to know if I would vote for the proposed plan, said: "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote on it." 
"The important points that I read [show] that is something that we have to digest and with which we can bring. 
He said that the option of doing nothing is not acceptable ". 
The plan to buy up to 700 billion of the taxpayers' money dubious debts, the assets to risks and unsaleable of American financial institutions. 
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of the mortgage credit risk before spreading to other most common forms of debt (PCAA) and provoking a freeze of liquidity and an exodus of banks and financial institutions. 
It is a group of elected Republicans who had changed the first draft of the agreement, the week. 
We believe that we have come out of the stagnation since the Democrats accepted that certain assets "toxic" by companies in difficulty only to be insured by the government, rather than purchased. 
With the aim of iron out the rough edges to everyone in Congress, also added a provision which stated that if the government had to shoulder losses for five years with this programme, could impose new fees that pretenderían help him recover money. 
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion which will be added to the 100 other billion if the president seems necessary. 
The payment of other 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote on the part of Congress. 
In exchange for assistance, Washington will get shares in companies often-quoted that I earn dividends in case of profits and that will be able to sell when the storm will be passing. 
The federal government will have the possibility of postponing the procedures of embargoes which related housing obtained with real estate loans under this plan, as well as setting limits on the pay and compensation in cash paid to the leaders of the companies affected by the crisis. 
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote of the House of Representatives from today and in the Senate next Wednesday. 
Despite all their efforts, it is still not certain that his plan will be approved. 
Some people continued to protest yesterday against this project, both on the part of the Republicans and the Democrats. 
The Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the committee of the finances of the chamber, said their constituents that "with all the evidence, Washington does not want to understand". 
"We have a very serious financial problem. 
There are a few solutions. 
But that is to take advantage of the taxpayers ". 
The Democratic representative Brad Sherman, who is a promoter of a small group in Congress, presents the problems of another way, but comes to the same conclusion. 
"400 teachers of economy, including three Nobel Laureates, we wrote to tell us: We call for Congress not to rush and carefully examine the route to take," said yesterday. 
At the same time, in Europe, we had again proof of the global nature of the crisis. 
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16,3 billion dollars). 
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas renunciaba was known that buy its competitor in bankruptcy since lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) during the crisis in the risky home loans in the United States. 
Fortis employs 85 000 people and form part of the 20 large European banks and the ten largest insurers. 
"This is not lost money, said yesterday of the Dutch finance minister, Wouter Bos. 
Instead, we regain the right to vote in the bank and influence. 
It is just something that savers and the families now appreciate that times are uncertain. " 
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to nationalise another bank that suffers from the financial crisis. 
According to the English press, the government would take charge of all loans outstanding in the bank Bradford and Bringley and more than 41 billion euros (75,5 billion dollars) of real estate loans. 
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and the bank accounts of the British bank. 
The bank Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, which the British government nationalized have since the start of this financial crisis. 
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an icon committed 
His blue eyes were so long its triumph. 
The American player with a charming smile had been released from his hand narcissistic instinct? 
Yes, and not. 
His modesty, their sensitivity and a talent that was also clear we have removed from the register of power that have real sacred monsters. 
But what a great runner of substance. 
Paul Newman, died Friday, at 83 years, because of a lung cancer at his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American films of the years fanfare. 
It is less phenomenal that Brando, who was very much and that was seen for a long time as a rival in the cinema, more prudent in their game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of freedom and the outbreak of the dramatic conventions. 
The blood mixed often children are magnificent. 
In Ohio was born in 1925, German Jewish father and mother in Hungarian origin. 
Of these European roots, a glorious on the faces of the American dream. 
Without ego inhibition, last mark of quality. 
Because it has projected a whole country lover of self made man, the champion of the War of the Pacific, wounded in combat, that the principle of the 1950s studied dramatic art at Yale, then frecuentó the actor's Studio in New York, before succeed in theatre, television and soon in the cinema. 
This man who militó by civil rights was also the pilot car that sweeping in second position in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a member of a couple, shapes formed from the 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward. 
He also desaparecen secret aspects of this star secret, discreet and committed, allergic to the scandals of the world of show that we do not know very well. 
It is a decent man, in the widest sense of the word. 
The death of Paul Newman caused chaos to the cinema goers this weekend, while entrechoquen their large roles in the black screen of memories. 
More than a half-century of American cinema in perpetual moving desfila through him. 
Many memories are returning to memory as the cow-boy with charm of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejected his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in The gata on the roof of zinc adapted to Tennessee Williams in 1958. 
Most of us (1990), we call to its sensitive Mr Bridge, disrupted by a marriage that did not meet all its promises. 
Others such as Paul Newman has gone in the history of cinema. 
This office Rocky Graziano, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up Likes there I (marked by hatred), Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, said after his death, that really launched to Newman in 1956. 
This mangante suntuosa nice in the film The Sting (The coup), Oscar to the best film in 1973. 
Avenging bitter and ping pong player in the wonderful film The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), repeated the character in The colour of Money of Martin Scorsese, which gave him in 1987, his only Oscar between nine nominations. 
This view that changes over the years, it was him. 
Still him. 
The times are changing during his career. 
Young people are Slap Shot mainly thanks to George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of a team of ice hockey little orthodox. 
Its called anoraks returned to see it in 1994 in The Hudsucker proxy of the brothers COas. 
With a final role of godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition Sam Mendes in 2003, the picture was is. 
Contrary to several legends of cinema that left the race quite soon, Newman was much in the world of cinema, denouncing Hollywood, its Oros, its fanfare and their concessions. 
The French film-maker as Bertrand Tavernier, with humour, "as a challenge to live in" the underplaying "and that it deems too supported their benefits. 
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to the roles came during a long time without doing anything. 
But less often misinterpreted the role of young galán of marginal: Neurotic, alcoholics, cabrones or desperate, whose outlines mirrored the rebellion. 
As a film-maker, Newman revealed sides its true sensitivity púdica not very well known. 
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife, Joanne Woodward in the main role, described a female portrayal of melancholy. 
He lost his son Scott because of overdoses devoted his film Harry and Son in 1984, work of shame and sadness. 
"Among the many tributes that were triggered yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former colleague of weapons Robert Redford (had worked together on The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened:" My life and my country were better thanks to its existence " 
Generosity, love of the existence are important features of the deceased actor. 
On the other side of his career of legend, is also a great campaigner for civil rights, the environment, the independent film, a glamour against the excesses of Hollywood. 
We have seen a lot of his face reign on the bottles of ketchup vinagreta, sauces, of biscuits and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although began as a gag. 
The advantages of these sales were given to his Foundation for Children in difficulty. 
Newman, rather than content of his myth, will be compromised until the end. 
I left their five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star. 
It was a privilege to be there. " 
And a privilege for us to have followed the careers of an American artist lucid and so generous. 
In short, a model citizen. 
What is produced at the factory of bills Zuschlag & amp; Co.? 
Very soon, on 8 October, will begin the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and their accomplices. 
It accuses the political and their accomplices to commit fraud of significant damage, by way of business, and in an organised manner and other crimes, among them the falsification of documents. 
According to the Office used to own purposes funds obtained in public tenders justifying on many occasions the implementation of the tasks with false bills. 
The public funds and local councils - in its entirety about 65 million HUF - stop in part in the organisation of the treasury Fiatal Baloldal and in part in the pocket of individuals. 
The method, which was published by researchers also, was to justify the recovery of funds obtained in public contracts with bills false behind which had not actual implementation, the various associations never fulfilled its obligations. 
According to the indictment, the majority of the bills were false. 
This got the talonarios in the market in the District Józsefváros circulars and stamps were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas. 
And the question of who in the name of what company should make the bill falsified decided among others on that tour of the region's highest Balaton where János Zuschlag sent István sides. 
This last confessed that for this purpose was to choose hostales and restaurants. 
Asked bill for their consumption and these served model to draw up the bills that were among other contests in the Department of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as in the city of the Capital. 
These bills were signed in his majority by István sides and his accomplice András Őri, who according to our information rather wrote the reports required to obtain public subsidies. 
During one of their "study" sides chose a beer hall. 
According to two bills issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and their accomplices, this centre food style provided food for a group of 90 people of the Pont Egyesület Biztos Association. 
However, according to the manager of the centre - many people have no place at the time, in this place. 
In addition, the bill issued in the summer of 2002 to the Foundation Jobb Jövőért - later called Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért - was full of formal errors and contextual. 
Because a hostal of the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not move there in a night, however in the bill taken cent and 30 people. 
But the manufacturers of bill of great fantasy also were when pointed at the centre food style Pigal Kft. teneduría because the books of the same - according to the information given to the Office - had not documents on behalf of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá. 
Győző Farkas, the manager of the company, told at hvg.hu that when he was quoted by the prosecutor and I showed the bills, already knew that it was false documents. 
"In the stamp on behalf of our company and the NIF appeared in place incorrect." 
Added: In addition to the formal problems that according to the bill was not housed a hundred people, as we have just 11 rooms in which there is no room for so many people. 
In addition, the bill also included meals, while the restaurant long ago that is not working. 
The enthusiastic manufacturers of bills are not reported either that the travel agency elected in Budapest organised exclusively trips abroad, so that the bill of payment service foolishly identified as a trip in Hungary, which does not correspond with the practice of issuing bills of the agency. 
Moreover, as it transpired over the research included in the document also VAT, despite that travel outside the territory of the European Union were exempt from taxes. 
Among other things the VAT measure also was incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Jobb Jövőért Kft. to the foundation, because services of this company are not laden with a 25 but only 15% of VAT, and employees of the hotel only extendían bills made to machine but the bill was manual. 
In addition to the "shippers" made some mistakes too, as in the case of a company in which they work in the bill as road transport which - it emerged during the investigations of the prosecutor - not the company founded as a consultant of investments. 
Equally by formal differences - inadequate format of the bill, stamp was false - which are false invoices issued to Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, for 21st Kulturális Századi Egyesület and for Biztos Pont. 
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Sports camp of Kunfehértó, whose representatives refused to have issued these bills. 
The counterfeiters nor gave attention to that when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in the process of liquidation, so the commissioned the liquidation process - according to our information - refused to have issued such a document. 
The bills issued 
Another group of manufacturers of false bills are defined by those who were aware that should be issued bills fiction. 
The Foundation Budapestért Esély Alapítvány, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, issued bill of around four million HUF on behalf of the Foundation to Harmadik Együtt Évezredért. 
The manager of the Collab Kft. - according to the accusation - convinced one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, for issuing fictitious invoices. 
In the same way was working with Zuschlag and their accomplices the Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation process, which in 2003 supplied bills with an approximate value of five million to the foundation Jobb HUF Jövőért Alapítvány, to the association and the association Atlasz Egyesület Vörösfenyő Egyesület, without real economic activity. 
There was no movement of capital, because they cancelled after the bills ready but forgot to put on their documents to the body. 
In the next group of manufacturers of counterfeit bills include those who have some link with the accused. 
So for example Ivan Kubatov demandadero of the Ukrainian was the manager of the Delta Trio sl fictitious headquarters in Budapest, dealing with the trade of fuels and vehicles. 
The company issued numerous bills by a value of approximately 18 million HUF in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of IT resources. 
According to data from research these bills were bought by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, that since the 14 September 2005 is under liquidation process. 
The manager of this company was a Romanian who Ivan Kubatov should have delivered the documents relating to the company between 2002 and 2005. 
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation, which was issued on behalf of the company bills for the Atlasz, for the Hoppá and for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány gaining the amount he himself. 
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. was founded by albañiles Romanians to express request Ivan Kubatov. 
However, none of the companies worked effectively due - according to the accused - that did not work. 
But took advantage of these companies, because at the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the registration documents from the company, issued bills on behalf of the societies for organisations linked with Zuschlag: For the Atlasz and for the Y-Generáció. 
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, the Delta Trió, the Fa-Bani Jos, of Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave in total 15 bills to separate entities for a value of 14,2 HUF million. 
The Prosecutor considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the amount of the bills. 
The man took even society in comandita Szi-Beri fictitious invoices for issuing used in the Pont Biztos contest. 
The Y-Generáció and Szövetség to Modern Magyarországért presented a contest in the month of January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (EBA), public utility entity of the Socialist Party. 
The contest got 500 thousand HUF respectively, but did not use the money for the objectives of the contest. 
If this is not found, were the EBA five bills fictitious received of the Works Kft Team. 
These were the bills found during the register office that Árpád Kemecsei had in the headquarters of the Ministry of Education. 
Part of the defendants in the trial probably relatarán - as they did in the Office - the course of falsified invoices. 
The most interesting may be the confession of the accused main János Zuschlag, if it decides to dismantle all. 
Because their confessions until now have not been very detailed and although repeatedly promised to talk of all, this has not done so far. 
The question is: What is it?, perhaps in exchange for the return of the bulk of the money - 50 million HUF - the Socialists came to an agreement with him to Zusi assume all the responsibilities. 
QUIÉN, on the other hand, for these days until he was offended, since to alleviate their prison conditions called house arrest, but I was denied repeatedly. 
While the many authors of economic crimes of higher value, which never returned the money, walk freely or at least can wait in their own home the judgment, he has no possibility for that. 
Of the sobrepuestas psicología: Why spend more money? 
The participants of auctions are likely to spend more money and overstate the product. 
The neurólogos and economists from the University of New York discovered the neurological basis - economic of this conduct known and seemingly irrational. 
According to the study published in the journal Science, the people do not want to lose in authority as eBay auctions, so prefers to pay even overpriced. 
Scientists tried to establish the neurological system of this "game" by means of experimental auction. 
One of the groups of volunteers working lottery, the other was involved in an auction and meanwhile was examined by the system of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) areas of the brain are active participants in the experiment. 
In both games could earn money participants, but during the auction, which is fundamental to bet more than the other, to lose the game intensified the functioning of the complex called layer located below the cerebral cortex. 
This area of the brain, as well as many other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "car prize" of the nervous system. 
So according to the scientists, the rise of the stakes can be explained as a prevention not to provoke a reaction by the body of intense. 
To establish his theory, economists of scientific group also made a study of financial follow-up. 
In this experiment three groups who bet against a person in different circumstances. 
The control group was simply told the real value of the product in question, and their members who bet. 
Another group also promised that if you earn, would receive $15 more of prize. 
In exchange, the third group received exactly 15 dollars before the auction, but in the event of losing the auction the members of the group perdían even money. 
So the only difference between the two groups was that for one highlighting the triumph and for another failure. 
However, tested the hypothesis of the neurólogos, the members of the group that appeared "against the failure" were willing to bet even more than the members of the group and the control group "winner". 
"These results cannot be deducted from any existing economic theory. 
Because those until now explicaban the phenomena of auctions solely with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks. 
Only the methods neurologically impaired helped resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so that now we come to a third explanation "- established Andrew Schotter, professor of economics faculty of the University of New York. 
Hepatitis: When it should go to the doctor? 
In the world around half a million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary the chronic disease of the liver is considered one of the main causes of death. 
In a hundred thousand estimated the number of infected in this country, but only seven thousand receive treatment because many sufferers do not know they are infected. 
The name of hepatitis is the common name of various diseases of the liver caused by viruses. 
The symptoms are much; are typical infection of the liver and the ictericia, but their pathogens and diseases caused are very different. 
The virus of hepatitis in dependence of the pathogen is spread through two main forms: Hepatitis A and E by way of food (for example with water or food contagiado), the hepatitis B, C, D and other virus in the blood and body whims (sperm, humour of the vagina, froth). 
It is advisable to travellers protected by a vaccine against the virus A and B and C are no vaccines. 
The symptoms of hepatitis A contains two or three weeks after eating infected food, manifested by means of a general malaise, weakness, nausea and abdominal pain. 
After that appear on the skin and in the eyes of the ictericia, the excremento is clear, the dark color urine and cure can take as long as two, three weeks. 
A million people die annually in the world in cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of the disease. 
The main reason for this is that according to the calculations, only one in 10 infected receives treatment pharmaceuticals. 
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: Without treatment can cause liver cirrhosis and even cancer. 
The majority of those infected do not know who is ill because this pathological player in gradually destroys the cells of the liver and often the first symptoms are only 20-30 years later. 
Therefore it is very important recognition premature, the systematic medical control. 
This is much more prevalent disease in three groups: Those who had blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and those who have tattoos. 
At present, there are some 200 million people in the world that suffer from chronic hepatitis C. 
As to this disease can discover with a routine monitoring of laboratory, it is worth consult with the doctor of the family to experience some symptom unknown. 
The disease has cured if discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus in the body, then we can stop the spread and prevent the cancer. 
The 30 September is the World Day of hepatitis, which was organised for the first time in 2004 by organisations representing patients. 
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic inflammation of the liver caused by viruses and the importance of their recognition premature. 
You hurts less to those who believe in God? 
According to the outcome of a recent research, religious faith is effect aliviaba also very tempting to resort to the death of the martyrs of Catholicism. 
The scientists from the University of Oxford made an interesting experiment: Considered that religious belief in what way affect human pain - he told the British newspaper Telegraph. 
In the context of this unique experiment applied electric shock to 12 faithful Catholics and the same amount of atheists, meanwhile all were looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary. 
According to the results, the faithful Catholics were able to exclude the greater part of their pain. 
Thanks to the technology of escaneo of the human brain, it was able to verify that the faithful Catholics were able to activate the part of your brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain. 
This experiment is the first of a series of investigations in which the hand of academics also involved scientists, philosophers and theologians of the various departments in the university. 
The analysis was as follows; set a sparkling instrument to the left hand of the patient, which applied the electric shock. 
The researchers asked participants in the experiment that set their sights on two paintings; to the Virgin Mary, site of the century Sassoferrato 17 and the Lady of the ermine of Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century. 
The researchers had the hope that the spectacle of the Virgin Mary would lead to a true religious mood among the faithful, in both that chose the oil because of Leonardo because it was not too different from the other, and thought that he had a calming effect. 
Patients spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, receiving electrical shocks in that period 20 in four successive while saw the painting of religious issue or the other. 
The Catholics claimed that the look to the Virgin Mary felt in "security" as people "protected", "and in his heart was reassured the peace". 
To see the picture of religious issue took a 12% less pain when looked the work of Leonardo. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias also took part in the experiment, believes that with any image so strong it can achieve a similar effect with atheists also, only to find the right image. 
"We should find the portrait of a person for that feel very positively, as for a mother or father" - said the psychologist. 
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright was the outcome of the investigation. 
"The exercise of the faith should and in many cases of true change our personality" - added Wright. 
After these formidable results is just one question: What effect it would have on the regulation of pain if you show the faithful the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of its size? 
The vision of a Virgin Mary of high quality would give even better results? 
You are what you say to you yourself 
In its tenth birthday the Google can say: You can find both in the pockets of the people, as in the sky above his head; knows where they spent their holiday, to what doctors visit and what interests them. 
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the executives of the company, this is still not enough. 
On the other hand the sceptics who make a parallel with the vision orweliana not see the essence of the Web 2.0. 
Eric Schmidt recently declared the Financial Times newspaper that the main objective of Google is bringing the greatest possible number of personal data about their users, and this is necessary to meet the original objectives of the founders of Google: "Meet in a system all the information in the world!". 
According to the leader of Google, the company even after ten years of work that revolvió the world is still in the early stage of the effort to be able to deal with all the information. 
The question that what is going to happen within five years Schmidt replied: I would like the Google could answer questions like "What do tomorrow?" Or "what would work best be me?" - but the software will not be able to answer questions apparently as simple as long as there are not enough information to users. 
Not all Internet users are aware that during their surfing the Web is stored with precision the key words clicked, the IP addresses and pages where they spent at the end of the search. 
Thank you for example to Personalized search that began two years ago, users can store their own record of shipping, can return to consult before it sought, which opened and thanks to this record will be much more personalized searches - in this same logic will be based the Recommendations, in which the scheme will provide products and services on the basis of the preferences previously defined and stored. 
What will happen if use my data against my same, if collected information on my activities? - ask those users who are seeing the monopoly of Google. 
In the majority of cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful, and not the apology, the fear of punishment, the yearning for freedom or rebellion against the power. 
But it is a fact not only have already confirmed that, but in cases also justifiable cede to third all expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing that protects the personal rights of Internet users. 
The example discussed in recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against paedophiles Brazilians, when Google handed the Brazilian government information on its Web site, called Orkut, to identify the paedophiles. 
By contrast, Internet users who are concerned about the rights of the people, in the month of May, when the company aliviaron along with the EFF, organisation for the defence of the electronic rights, showed successfully before the court which was right in its dispute with the FBI, according to the ruling, he will be able to force Google, with none of those parts of the constitution to provide any kind of information requested in secret by the FBI. 
(At the same time, the federal government managed to get on the pretext of strengthening the law on the protection of children adopted years ago, nearly fifty thousand directions of Web and a few thousand sentences sought, but without obtaining the lists of search of individual users, nor full lists of web pages and key words of the last two months.) 
So it is rather contradictory opinion on the Google: We criticize those who fear provide their personal data because they think that it harms their privacy, their private life to begin to use the services of Google, and rebel against it as against multinational companies of conservative image. 
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic supporters, Internet users and users of other countries, see them as the future generation, "corporation of vanguard", not to its rival, the Microsoft, catalogued by its Windows as conqueror of the World, much as both fight for the same purpose. 
This can happen because the Google instead of Microsoft, not calls of users no identification code, or money for their applications, the code is open and the package of free programme, constantly currently and seems more youthful, more cooperative that the practice of official of the software giant. 
But it may also be because the geek are very problematic precisely the relationship that exists between the rights of the people and the Internet that it was precisely one of the key words more mentioned in recent years: The Web 2.0. 
The Web 2.0 is the cooperation, of intentional trace behind us and take the channels of communication available, and while the measures of these various individually, the essence remains the same: To show ourselves. 
A normal girl may have profile in many pages, from Facebook until Xanga, and even can draw them together with other services, such as the Twitter or the last.fm that offers list of their habits of music, then these can be included in a follow-up system as the FriendFeed or the Blip.fm, can have a blog, which automatically appear in the galleries of the most recent photos that was stored in the Flickr and Picasa. 
We know many cases which shows that for example the bride, to see the flow of photographs of the next morning of the common friends, learns with who spent the night before his boyfriend fraudulent or can dismiss the employee of a company because this writes your honest opinion on his blog about the direction of the company, one thing is certain, the definition of the private life is revalorizó completely. 
The life "on-line" of a person is what it shows itself - this is the definition that hides behind the conduct of the youth of our days. 
And who wants to hide something, or at least to dodge the monopoly of Google, can do (starting with example with the Scroogle that uses the system of search to Google, but leaves no fingerprints). 
There are many people who do not want to be registered in the collective pages to prevent the can find, but it can replace the applications "on-line" of Google, since the software of wording of texts to the applications of image and reading of news with alternative versions which did not connect with giant servers or preparing the profile more perfect possible on us. 
The public expect almost that openly on the day that the Google to show their true colours. 
The company with its current value of 156 billion dollars worth more than the IBM (140 billion dollars), the Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), the land of AdWords and AdSense advertising threaten the incomes of the advertising agencies, in both the services that are increasingly rapidly cause severe headaches, not only for the Microsoft, but also many other companies software developers. 
The critical observers, however, will find alarming contradictions: For example, the senior management rejected outright the protest of employees then to double the price of the nursery of the company, considered too expensive the unlimited number of feeding employees, but this is nothing compared with the fact that in 2006 the Google gave in to pressure the Chinese government and the company, according to the agreement leaking information that violated the good morals and the interests of the Chinese regime. 
One of the internal regulations of the company, says that there will be announcing a new service in advance, but only when we were ready to work, what is certain is that if foreseeable problems in the coming months and years will be looking at the World: While some believe that the draft escaneo and shelf of books and magazines of Google will take on such dimensions that the company will soon be cited by the United States Supreme Court, others fear of its health system, because it can create our own profile full health, with previous analysis, with our doctors and our problems. 
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, it can provide a good raw material for the writers of works of science fiction, the Scroogled, popular Cory Doctorow's novel, describes orweliana in the future, in which a man only of data from Google can be described alarmingly well. 
Two minors helped remove traces the author of the double murder of the city of Ózd. 
The police questioned two minors on the double murder of Ózd who, under suspicion, helped remove traces of the crime - said Tuesday the spokesman of the Commissioner General Public Order of the province of Borsod. 
The young people admitted the crime that I was accused, and now they are accused of fautores of crime. 
The two children, according to the information of the Hungarian News Agency is two girls - will be able to defend itself in freedom. 
By the complicity can receive up to 5 years in prison. 
The accused of the double murder of Ózd - a man of 23 years - is in detention since Sunday. 
He accused the crime of murder several people with premeditation and by greed. 
During investigations revealed that the young of 23 years I had a large amount to a man of 53 years. 
The defendant not wanted to pay its debts, so the Wednesday of last week quoted its creditor to the seat of a company of Ózd, where the shot and then killed the daughter of 9 years of the victim. 
According to information from the TIM, the young are prepared to deliver long before the crime, as he committed the murder with a previously hidden weapon in the place of the crime. 
Police analyses with an expert witness the weapon and the circumstances of their use. 
The stock exchange of Warsaw submitted an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange 
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - some five billion kronor Czech - for the 100% of the actions of the Prague Stock Exchange. 
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the offer made by the Poles, the Czechs earlier have excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange. 
The reason is that the stock exchange of Warsaw is in the hands of the state. 
The 99% of the action is in the hands of the Polish state that within a few months, wants to sell the 60 percent of them. 
The Czech economic daily E15 reported that the supply of Poles has been the highest among those offered by the interested by the Prague Stock Exchange. 
According to the Czech press, until now gave offer the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic exchange Nasdaq, the Stock Exchange of New York, the London Stock Exchange, the Deutsche Börse. 
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange said last week that between the interested the worst would be the new owner of Warsaw Stock Exchange and not ruled out the possibility that, in a future collapses the Prague Stock Exchange. 
Experts estimate the value of the stock exchange of Prague in about 5 to 10 billion kronor. 
According to the agreement of shareholders could sell approximately 90 percent of the shares. 
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a stake of about 25 per cent, still the Bank Ceská Sporitelna with only FF 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent. 
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press 
The major European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the increasingly deep international financial crisis talk of a "second 11 September." 
The global financial disaster is due to the US president - believes The Republic of Rome - the chairman has not even been able to get the support of his own party to the bill done in haste, whose aim is to find a solution to this situation distressing... 
In place of a new "Pearl Habor," the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, is more appropriate to talk of a "second 11 September." 
According to a part of the press madrileña, Washington is the scapegoat. 
In view of the world the mistake of the political leadership of the United States was that led to the world economy to the brink of the abyss. 
Growing increasingly the danger of collapse of the American monetary system and this course, will affect the whole world. 
Although the Bush plan was not perfect, after the vote in Congress is the danger that Washington is not a political tool to deal with the crisis. 
The world economy is suspended in the air - precisely when carried out one of the biggest changes to the history of capitalism. 
We cannot ignore this threat - the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva. 
Some states today can still tirarle belt of lifeline to the shaky financial institutions, potentially saving well from bankruptcy with taxpayers ’ money. 
But if, as the sway crumble more bank still, then it will not be enough either the new funds, nor the new improvisations. 
We need long term that the member states of the European Union set aside their national egoism and bring together control over the fragmented financial markets. 
The financial institutions were in crisis Monday more than 100 billion - recalls the vienés Der Standard, adding that are increasingly real concerns that, as did the Americans, also European taxpayers will have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis. 
The EU has not so far taken seriously with the crisis that is as a cúname by the Old Continent. 
The "saviours" will not have to present immediately hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if defined: Where do you justify using taxpayers' money to avoid a greater evil? 
The intelligent imitates the flight of the abejorro 
What would be the best method for developing technologies to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of sensors of existing obstacles in nature? 
For example, the abejorros. 
In a surprising draft presented at the CEATEC Japan, the abejorros gave the starting point for the engineers squeak when Nissan to design the next generation of the system for preventing collisions. 
The squeak when Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the system of robotics direction of cars kind BR23C copier of nature, which gave him the characteristics of the abejorros, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can cope with all the collisions. 
During the flight each abejorro creates its own space particular oval sign that in reality is very close to our contained protector of security - explained in the explanatory Kazuhhiro Doi, director of technology and research and development RP. 
Desempeñan an important role in the eyes of the abejorros compounds that are able to see in all directions in a higher angle to 300 degrees. 
To copy the role of the eyes compounds, engineers used the system of measuring the length of lasers. 
This identifies the obstacles ahead of BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, estimated its distance and sends a signal to the microprocessor of vehicle that immediately becomes a manoeuvre to avoid the collision. 
In a fraction of seconds identifies the obstacle, then the robot vehicle imitating the movements of the abejorros, changed the direction turning in the necessary measure the wheels. 
Unlike any existing system, this is all completely instinctive. 
"If it were not so, the robot of the vehicle could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, chief of the Laboratory of Mobility and the project of the robot vehicles. 
It must react immediately and instinctively, because this technology is home to the most vulnerable of the housing protector of security, in a layer of which now are considered inevitable all kinds of collisions. 
The whole process must reflect what is a abejorro to sidestep other abejorros. 
This process must be done in an open and close our eyes. 
However, unlike the abejorros, the movement cannot go up, down or diagonal, but can only be bidimensional and exclusively in the direction of turn of the wheels 
In this way, in place of the infinite possibilities for the abejorros to sidestep other abejorros, here only used as a possibility for the robot of the car the rotating movement and the acceleration in addition the frenaje. 
The BR23C lítio-polímero used batteries that are lighter and is increasing its energy density, which means that they have a long life span of lítio-ión. 
According to Andoh, what is important is the instinctive reaction and intelligent and not the capacity of processing of data, far less the storage. 
This device in every second only to prosecute some signs of entry and react according to the case. 
It is not necessary to store the data or react with an instinctive logic, based on data from the previous exercises, uses only a few dozen kilobytes of memory. 
We do not need memories of gigabytes very, or megabyte optical fibre cables. 
This is the first step in developing technology to dodge immediately obstacles, which estimates of the squeak when Nissan, within ten years will join the models manufactured in number. 
Another possibility for its implementation is to incorporate the unity of the system of GPS satellite navigation to carry the driver to their fate, sidestepping the obstacles in their way. 
Name this costly child has already 
It has prepared the written version of the law of the financial rescue package of $700 billion to apply in several stages with the aim of buying loans from banks. 
In the first phase will be spent half the money. 
According to the timetable of the eastern coast during the new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders reached an agreement on the financial rescue package of $700 billion in total, after several days of debate - reported the Reuters. 
We have achieved an important progress, said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic chairman of the American Congress, saying that lack only to formalise the agreement on a document. 
The commitment made on the package was supported by both candidates for the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, talking about the outcome of the compromise, said: This programme will work and will be efficient but we need other measures more. According to Pelosi, not save the Wall Street, but to return to the board of the economy. 
The written version of the package was published before the size of the Asian markets, i.e. the Sunday before the 8 p.m., according to the timetable of Washington (or is before the two in the early hours of Monday, according to the timetable of Central Europe), without triggering a spectacular leap in the stock markets. 
On the draft law called emergency law to economic stabilization of the year 2008, on Monday first vote the American Congress and then the Senate. 
President George W. Bush in the night of Saturday consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement. 
We are happy with the progress achieved during the night and we value highly the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and our economy, said Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman. 
The programme is different from the original proposal, the Bush administration to spend all the 700 billion dollars to buy securities of loan fund of poor quality. 
Now only be able to spend half of the 700 billion dollars, using 250 billion that Congress immediately after the vote, probably on Monday, the Ministry of Finance of the fund will buy securities of credit, poor rating and the fate of other $100 billion depends on the president's decision. 
This programme will be controlled by a special body, which will also the chairman of the Federal Reserve. 
The other half of the 700 billion dollars will be spent after a new decision of Congress. 
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can implement a combined tactics: Can buy simultaneously loans, mortgages and securities of substance of credit and other loans to "poisonous". 
The purchase will make in auctions or competent people directly - reported the ministry. 
The law allows you to the companies concerned, to participate in a program where the finance portfolio insurance guarantees the worrying elements, by which companies will pay for the amount corresponding to the damage predictable. 
Henry Paulson said: The law ensures that the necessary financial resources, which can reach even 700 billion dollars to meet the urgent needs of the American financial system, the purchase of financial means bad, of its insurance or prevention of risks that could lead to the collapse of some large financial institutions. 
We all need to be ready to introduce the law as the sign - added. 
In contrast, the Heads of banks that are in distress and expect the state aid will be able to count on the official limitation of their compensation, which simply called American jargon golden parachutes. 
Only in some cases certain payments will be restricted, and the restrictions on the form of aid from the ministry of finance. 
The limitation means that if the ministry purchase in the context of an auction, it will impose an extra tax for the golden parachutes, unless that passes on, the chief of the bank failed. 
The direct loans to buy the government is aggressively to ensure that the compensation of the Heads should not be exaggerated. 
And this is not going to change the existing golden parachutes contracts, the constraints relate only to new contracts to encourage participation in the programme. 
This is the first case in American history that will be in force a legal limit for the income of the directors-general - said that the Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the committee of Congress, responsible for financial services. 
The state also will have the right to buy shares of banks involved in the programme, it will reduce the risk to taxpayers, because ultimately may even gain with the transaction as soon as the economy recovers and with it the bank. 
According to the draft law in the next five years, the president must submit to Congress a proposal on the way back to the taxpayers losses in the financial sector. 
Of course in both sides were those who expressed reservations about the project. 
This is not what we by American citizens, is to say they are protecting the taxpayer dollars - said the Republican congressman from California, Darrell Issa. 
His colleague, Democrat of Ohio, Mary Kaptur said: The measures urged him the same people that are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street. 
Industrial prices are still rising

The next year will no longer require a visa to go to the United States? 
Kinga Göncz believes that there are many opportunities to around 12 January the agreement enters into force norteamericano-húngaro on the waiver of visas, the external affairs minister spoke of this in Chicago, before the Hungarians living there. 
In his view, "virtually everything depends on being built in time on the other side of the Atlantic the electronic system of access and control". 
At the same time warned that in the new system will disappear the premiso of entry, but tourists before his way out of the country of origin must register. 
As of today, the leader of the Hungarian diplomacy discussions in Washington. 
Is having talks with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice entregándole Medina Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and sustained negotiations with the international political advisers to the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain. 
Both Barack Obama, and McCain are in favour of the financial rescue package for banks. 
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two big parties Americans claimed Sunday their support for the bank aid programme of 700 million dollars of the administration, on the other hand there are politicians to demand the resignation of the finance minister. 
The representatives of Congress and the administration, after negotiations for several days of marathon, in the early hours of Sunday announced: It came to an agreement of principles on the financial rescue package for banks. 
The financial package to solve the crisis on Wall Street and unfreeze the credit markets frozen, became the central issue of the campaign for the presidential elections. 
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are more capable than his rival to get the country out of the economic crisis. 
According to the most recent survey, to be put on economic issues, Obama returned to obtain some advantage and disappeared the advantage of McCain that had obtained after the Republican convention with the nomination of Sarah Palin to the Vice-President. 
At a campaign rally in Detroit, on Sunday last, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will approve the law on the package of $700 billion. 
Stressed that the proposal includes those points of consumer protection, that he supported. 
"We must act now and with responsibility (...) is in danger employment, saving Uds. and entire industries and the stability of the entire economy" - he said before a crowd of 35 thousand people. 
Not an opportunity to describe as obsolete the economic concepts of McCain. 
In an interview with the ABC McCain explained that "all we will swallow this to plough (...) but do nothing is simply not a viable path". 
The Republican senator said that in the proposal includes the establishment of a committee of control to Minister of finezas and limits on compensation for executives, he was the one who insisted on this. 
Obama said to CBS that McCain not played any role in the consultations, instead he consulted on a daily basis with the minister. 
The chairman of the House Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that the Congressmen probably will vote on Monday on the bill. 
In the area of press cuttings speaks German 
The group of right is intact, only within the group that became voters more aware - says the Der Spiegel on the weak electoral outcome of the CSU in Bavaria. 
Haider and his supporters are ready to govern in Austria to prevent a coalition rojinegro. 
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de) 
In the electronic edition of the German magazine of left Franz Walter, in your article entitled "The Revolution of Bavaria devours their parents' analyses the cause of the dramatic defeat of the CSU. 
According to the known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU started long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber had assumed office. 
The Christian Socialists for several decades were developing in Bavaria - and now precisely these modern citizens are those that give him away. 
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, also of Angela Merkel. 
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday they ended a process that is already envisaged for almost ten years: Disappeared undisputed hegemony of a state party. 
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU won a 47,7%, for the first time below the 50 percent since the 1950s. 
That occurred three years ago, in the elections of the Bundestag 2005, that is even during the oft-mentioned was Stoiber. 
The reason for this is the modernisation consistent in the province of the CSU devorador of their parents. 
The sociologists already are already predicting that 40 years ago, but in the long wrong. However, the secularization, the results of education and the settlement of the North German in the developed regions of Bavaria had its negative consequences on the loyalty of the voters of the CSU. 
With the modernization will also raise the possibilities and it also has political consequences. 
The group of right is intact, only within the group that became the voters more aware, more critical and more stubborn. 
It is surprising that in recent weeks precisely the conventional groups of citizens were those who walked away most of the CSU; the self-employed, the small industrial, the high school and the diploma. 
It recudió to less than 40 percent support the CSU. 
Die Presse (diepresse.com) 
The conservative newspaper in Vienna: "Who? In your article entitled" The presidents of the parties are very reserved in matters of coalition "- deals with the predicament of domestic policy after the Austrian elections. 
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP. 
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ interference in its internal affairs. 
The BZÖ is open in all directions to negotiate, the Greens in change still do not want to do consultations on the coalition. 
It held elections, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate on public television, the leaders of the parties were hardly see something of their horses. 
Werner Faymann, the chairman of the SPÖ, confirmed that wants to negotiate with the ÖVP. 
The SPÖ wants to show that it is possible the cooperation between the two parties - this already exists in some provinces and social associations. 
Fayman left open the question that if you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molter, the current chairman of the ÖVP, in the post of Vice-Chancellor. 
He said that in any case were unhappy the era of Schüssel-Molterer. 
It is not possible to continue this political trend. 
Mr Molterer reacted cautiously to the red. 
He said that probably will not be successful cooperation if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP. 
Yet if the party is open to elect the opposition or joining the coalition, these issues should be discussed without doubt, within the ÖVP. 
The chairman of the BZÖ, Jörg Haider was opened in all directions. 
"To prevent the coalition roja-negra, we are ready to shoulder the responsibility of the government" - said Haider. 
Járóka: We need to break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation 
Today it has initiated the European Summit in Paris for Equal Opportunities, its host is France that this year is also chairman of the European Union. 
Lívia Járóka, a member of the European People's Party for the Fidesz, in his message to the full, as one of the main speakers of this meeting, drew the attention of segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations afflicting children gypsies and furthermore is also the biggest obstacle to the prevale foundation of their interests. 
This high-level conference was inaugurated - on behalf of the French presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of employment and social affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for jobs, social affairs and equal opportunities. 
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European organisations of protection of social rights. 
Járóka - according to the press bureau of the group of Members of Fidesz in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to the discrimination in employment, the Roma are outside the labour market in the first place by its low level of education. 
"The majority of the young Roma have not finished secondary school and due to the poor quality of primary education, only a negligible part can obtain university diploma." 
Járóka stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a key role in the foundation of the other prevale human rights. 
The investment in the education of children Roma at an early age can strengthen the economies of the Member States of the European Union. 
According to the MEP, is necessary concientizar these issues both between and among the Roma gypsies. 
For while more early start school a gypsy student, more likely will have to become an active member of the labour market; through taxes on income and consumption they will also contribute to the national budget. 
"The Roma, as citizens of the European Union, I assure you the right to a quality education and ensure the abolition of the segregated education and low level" - stressed Lívia Járóka. 
According to the stupidity, unity and objective of the European Union to speed up immediately the processes of school desegregation, for that is of fundamental importance to the correct implementation of the existing anti-discrimination directives and planned. 
"We need to break the vicious circle of poverty, exclusion and unemployment, we must offer children Roma the possibility that ensures the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens of full rights" - demanded Járóka. 
The aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organised annually from the meeting there last year that took place in the sign of the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities, "is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level of the Member States. 
CSU: Grace for a transitional period 
At the end of October, will take a decision on the fate of the failed duo Huber-Beckstein 
Despite the serious electoral defeat, have not yet been severed heads in the Bavarian CSU looked, by the time it has postponed the debate on personal issues. 
Erwin Huber, chairman of the party and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister still remain in their posts, but it is not known how long it will take the grace. 
The fate of the duo, which suffered a catastrophic electoral defeat of 17%, will be decided at a special congress of the party, to be held the last week of October. 
The members of the much criticised duo hinted: Not cling to their jobs. 
It sought to reassure the angry members of his group and its organisation, who a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority. 
Five years ago - but under the direction of Edmund Stoiber that was at the top of his career - the union reached a Socialcristiana 60,7%, instead, now, a year after the coup crowded against Stoiber, managed only a 43.4 percent. 
The CSU for 46 years had "monopoly" in Bavaria that gives the 18% of GDP. 
Although in the southern province of key importance to the Hungarian economy, the Conservatives are dominant in the future certainly must make a coalition with someone. 
As the first sign of the restructuring of the party, the vice-chairman Horst Seehofer, federal minister of agriculture, one of the potential successors of Huber, also has a seat on the small group of intelligence that initiates negotiations with the FDP and with the liberal Free voters right on a possible coalition government in Munich. 
What is strange is that the destination in the list of the Free voters entering parliament he Gabriele Pauli, whose actions against Stoiber was taken to the blow of the duo Huber-Beckstein and then deleted cruelly stage to the ambitious local policy. 
The leaders of the CSU are investing now all their energies to stabilise Beckstein. 
In the transition will receive an active role Stoiber that until now was moving the strings in the fund, the provincial government ex-jefe and former chairman of the CSU described the 28 September as the most difficult day of his political career. 
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion had deserved much more support from the party's brother. 
Other politicians of the CSU interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and for Angela Merkel also. 
After the elections in September 2009 of the Bundestag, Merkel will not be chancellor if they are not able to enhance together the CSU that played a key role in the success of the national elections in 2005. 
According to Merkel that could hardly hide his disappointment at the failure, the CSU losses not will impact negatively on the grand coalition in Berlin. 
Which of course is relative: It will be easier to treat the CSU wounded and the crisis of the Social Democrats continued. 
The SPD with its 18,6 percent reached their worst result since 1946 in Bavaria. 
The opposition of Lukashenko: 110-0 
After Sunday's elections, there will be no Member opponent in the Belarusian parliament. 
According to the Russian observers, this explains the welfare and stability in the country that guarantees Alexander Lukashenko, instead, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this explains rather with violations of the law committed during the tally of the votes. 
The OSCE sent 450 observers from 43 countries, not recognized the election result. 
If the legislature of the country of 10 million inhabitants, integrated percent and ten Members, more than a decade ago has no opposition, before yesterday's elections the opposition united under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped that Lukashenko, that for the fourth time renewed its mandate after the 2006 elections of dubious legitimacy, as a result of the amendment to the Constitution this time "would" the entry of some members of the opposition in parliament. 
So the ODSZ removed the boycott, which originally wanted to do. 
In the bottom of the expectations of the opposition was the that Belarus, which increasingly depends more economically of Russia - which took credit for moderate natural gas imports more expensive for Russia and that contributed to the sale to Russia in Beltransgaz, owner of the pipeline that passes through the country - wanted to improve its relations with the European Union, which gives permission of entry to Lukashenko and other senior politicians to take a political regime considered undemocratic. 
It was a sign of detente when the OSCE, to assess the election campaign, put more emphasis on the positive developments and not on the mistakes - such as the ban to be imposed on a third of the opposition candidates. 
However, the primary report on Monday of the OSCE criticised even the very campaign - in which the opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in the tally of votes. 
With this in view of the opposition is an improvement in the political atmosphere: Were freed political prisoners and Minsk is prepared to a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abhasia in Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - a month ago that believes the two regions as independent. 
- We have taken two steps forward and one back, but what is more important is that it has begun a dialogue between Belarus and the European Union - said to our newspaper Alyaksandr Milinkevich. 
According to the opposition candidate in the presidential elections of 2006 is desirable to keep this situation, despite the fact that "the regime fears allowing the entry of even a opponent in this parliament without weight." 
The opposition does not plan to organise demonstrations in protest at the results, rather trying to reach voters his message on the need to make economic reforms. 
- This clear we cause many problems because we must bring the opposition press in Russia, local authorities put obstacles in their distribution, but even so I see that more and more of those who support the contrast between the elderly - said Milinkevich, referring to the Lukashenko regime, which believes that its primary outcome is the creation of social security, does not consider it appropriate or even pensioners, which officially are the most subsidised by the regime. 
Due to the country's debt and the rise in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time the breakdown of social security that "it seems the silence of the cemeteries" - felt Milinkevich. 
The Russian observers instead of the opposition politician called for democratic elections. 
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in deeds", so that the lack of the opposition is not something that the testimony of the maturity of the Belarussian voters. 
Brunetta: "Now in most desayuna before starting work" 
It has not happened before in the history of Palacio Chigi that bring automatic doors to control the entry and exit of staff. 
But from today begins with this measure against those who file and then going to the pub to take a coffee in working hours. 
This innovation has been tabled today by the Ministry of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and by the Secretary General of the Council presidency, Mauro Masi. 
"The doors automáticas- says Brunetta - are an instrument to work better, more productivity, more and more services," requires the minister. 
"Now it opens a new season of responsibility and transparency. 
This is reformism, "stresses of new Brunetta. 
With Palacio Chigi completes the installation in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council. 
For Masi "the choice of the automatic doors is also important from the point of view of symbolic". 
It has encountered resistance on the part of employees, the general secretary: "Change has been a shared by workers and had the cooperation of part of the same". 
In short, no more breakfast in working hours; no more coffee and medialunas. 
Word of Brunetta, which suggests, smiling, "a good capuchino at 7 in the morning is a holy hand." 
During a convention in the High School of Public the Management 
In Rome, the minister says that "in three months the absences for diseases of public employees have been reduced by 50%, mean 60 000 people more to work in a year." 
And he adds that it is necessary to pay more effective Public Administration 
Italian, "which wage dynamics – explains the minister – in the last 10 years have been double on the private sector and well above the Taso of inflation". 
By now, millions of public employees have united to oppose the rules of the decree Brunetta adhere to the request supported by the Codacons. 
"While the Minister of Public Administration shows the numbers, the absence of work on the causes of disease – writes the association of consumadores – the people of the 'workers vague" is constantly increasing. 
Indeed, in Italy are million employees of public administration correct and productive that have been linked to declare war on the provisions of the decree ilegitimas. " 
In particular, in the tar is glad the exclusion of aggregate economic treatments for disease due to cause of service; the extension of the time fajas in which carried out visits of medical supervision of employee ill, and other points in the new provisions treasured by the minister. 
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Prevention crucial" 
Every day, in Italy, was tested in the work 2 500 accidents, killed 3 people and 27 are permanently invalid. 
For 2007, the data confirm that Inail white deaths have been approximately 1,200. 
Figures indicate the seriousness of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and leads to almost double the number of deaths in relation to the murder. 
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic issue, today the Anmil held in all of the provinces of Italy's No 58 national day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalised in the second Sunday in October. 
"The worrying data disseminated by the Anmil and the same tragic news these days confirm the crucial is the issue of prevention in the work," says the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the chairman of the Anmil, mutilated and disabled national Association for the work, Pietro Mercandelli. 
The head of state exprime its "great appreciation for the constant efforts associative in favour of prevention in the workplace, the protection of the injured workers, the assistance to the families of the victims and the awareness of the public". 
"They said, 'enough is enough', genuinely shared, faced with tragedies that, for their size, raise the clamour of the media and the involvement of the public, the everyday reality is proposing dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamic". 
Napolitano not hide that "there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: It is crucial to invest in training and information. 
Particular meaning take the numerous initiatives in schools, called for a more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work. 
It is a duty to keep alive the attention to the phenomenon, not curb the alarm about the serious social, implement and improve the legislative rules. 
For its part, the chairman of the House Gianfranco Fini has stressed "as the phenomenon of the white deaths are an absolute social emergency, that offends the conscience of each of us to all the institutions and imposes a determined effort to bring an end". 
"The data on accidents at work seem to point to a slight andamiento positive, but this does not mean that the number of deaths women is equally impressive," has pinpointed the chairman of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli. 
"We do not, in fact, that this" trend decline "translates into less attention, because it is precisely when the attention is that exploits the tragedy. 
"We believe that, in general they do too little to compare the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be put into practice through multiple actions. 
They are necessary, to our criterion - has highlighted Mercandelli – more checks and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of school ". 
"It is a further effort - has added - as concerns the communication and public awareness. 
But it is, above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers on a phenomenon that represents a social emergency. " 
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary protection for the victims of the work" and the "derivation of care towards which the system is leading in recent years". 
"The aim is to restore the worker's guarantee safe - has added – because the fate of those who are accidental does not have to rely on the largess prepared by the legislator ever". 
Readers MP3 under accused, put at risk the hearing 
Listening to music at high volume for a long time using portable music devices like MP3 readers can cause permanent damage to the hearing. 
Is the concerns the European Commission, in a statement issued in Bruxel cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee of the emerging health risk and recently identified (Csrseri) of the EU, published today. 
"This scientific opinion – we read the note – arises that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable music devices on a weekly basis for more than an hour a day taking the apparatus missed a high volume risk permanent hearing". 
"I am concerned about the fact that a number so high of young people that often use portable music devices and mobile phones to acoustic levels high can ruin unconsciously their ears in a hopeless," says Meglena Kuneva. 
"The scientific evidence – remains the responsibility EU - emerges a clear risk and we must react quickly. 
What counts, is to raise the consumadores and pay this information in the public domain. 
We must re examine, in addition to the existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, to be fully effective and take the step with the new technology. " 
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the great use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise that creates. 
"The scientists - concludes the executive EU – confirm that is cause for concern and the European Commission will now, together with Member States and stakeholders that measures could possibly do to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise from portable music devices and related equipment." 
Currently, there is already a European safety rule that limits to 100 db the noise level of the portable music devices, but concern is growing as the auditory damage that can lead to excessive exposure to such noise sources. 
It is possible to limit of much damage using solutions such as the reduction of levels and the length of time of exposure to noise. 
In his view, The Scientific Committee EU does present to users of listening to portable music devices volume high (more than 89 decibeles) music for only five hours a week exceed the limit currently in force on the maximum noise acquiesced in the workplace. 
Those who listen to music in such conditions for more prolonged periods, risk losing a permanent hearing after a period of five years. 
It means that affects 5-10% of users of such devices and the number may be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU. 
Rome, Alemanno is the path to the Commission for the future of the capital. 
Opens today, in March is closed, in June will be the accounts. 
Is this the timetable set by the municipality and for employees of the Commission for the future of the city of Rome, "which was set up this morning in his new seat behind the Termas of Caracalla. 
In six months, the president Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission deliberaran the main points to Rome. 
Once closed the doors in March, the board and the local council assessed analysis and projects, in the way of presenting in June the piano strategic for Rome with the "official bollo" of the municipality and its intendente Gianni Alemanno. 
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all the political ideas, social and cultural – tends to emphasise Alemanno – must provide proposals for the development of Rome in which to decide politically, the junta and the local council, will later endorsed. 
There is no spare position of roles, only the desire to have a place where a major project to Rome. 
In March, completed the work will disappear, because this experience must have a temporary end. 
In June – heralds the intendente – we will present the strategic plan using the work of the Commission for the future of the city of Rome ". 
To those who accuse the Commission of futile, given that its opinions are not binding, Alemanno responds: "Everything depends on the work that will be at the level of the Commission and the quality of their proposals. 
If the quality will be present, as well as in France with the Commission Attali and as I am sure in Rome, their contribution will be essential. 
Almost always it is crushing the policy in the day-to-day management and in emergencies that back in return are. 
We, on the contrary, we want to look beyond and in the long term, in a prospective more profound, working with the development of Rome and its future ". 
The Rome intendente tends to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless or a truism: It is absolutely free of charge, coastal not one euro to Roman citizens and will serve to participate and thinking the best minds that exprime the capital". 
For Alemanno, indeed, "it needs to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed nor hovering, to allow the city to make a genuine leap of level, of which we have absolute necessity, thinking in a spirit of unity to its future". 
A future that, precisely the intendente of Rome "is not limited only to the current communal edge but to look beyond" not only in the context of the future Metropolitan city and its legal status but Capital "also considering the role that Rome can and must desenvolver as a capital of Europe and the Mediterranean." 
Does Obama? The first president anti-American American. 
He wrote a note American politician who is interested in moving by independent: "Barack Obama will be the second president anti-Americano. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, with their decisions reduced the US economy and sucks relations (as does today gives private citizen) with the enemy of Islam ". 
The attacks on Obama while on the date of the elections. 
He has written a lady of Miami in a Web: "This person is full of ambitions. 
Obama has a great side of stone: Believes that won the office more high of the nation that has had two governors and five senators black! ". 
In reality are attacks that does not say much; they are attacks of racial nature and not respond to the question of the electorate: It will be a good president? And are also the polls; they all say that Obama won and with a good advantage. 
Also in this case there is anyone who speaks from the heart, but not the brain. 
A daily the Mississippi, in the bowels of the south of the United States, wrote an editorial: Once in the voting booth know well who will vote the American patriot. 
It is a side of the American mindset taken covered until the last. 
"Digan what they want, we shall see us later on where to put the cross, whether about Obama or McCain." 
There are people who swearing-in: If it comes to win Obama, we shall of America. 
These things never before now, that seems almost certain the success of a black candidate. 
However, despite all these considerations, the victorious weapon for the democratic is George Bush. 
They have asked 1500 people: What were the mistakes made by Bush during his mandate? The 89% replied: Iraq. 
Change America. 
In Vietnam this nation has lost 50 000 soldiers and sent home to kicked in the backyard. 
In Iraq are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to make the bags. 
Similarly, Iraq for the majority has been the weak point of Bush. 
Who will assume the post of George W will have a duty to desenvolver. 
Used, the economic collapse is felt to journalists: In the newspapers is time of cuts. Many put the blame on the Internet, "killer" of the printed paper. 
Five hundred journalists Americans have been concerned by Pew Research Center on the state of their mental and control in the future. 
If today, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future. 
However, journalists have not declared openly feel less concerned about the credibility. 
Do not feel isolated as a time. 
The problem for the American journalists is the money, the money. 
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of economic model destroyed. 
In addition to the cuts made in the room where the authors work to make the newspaper, is a major problem. 
It is a problem that must be resolved, according to reporters interviewed, if not the traditional journalism as the majority of the public will be substantially reduced. 
A clear but complex pessimism dominates today on the American journalist. 
Six of ten journalists and executives are convinced that the journalism at national level this following the wrong way. 
In the local area, the group executive is 65%. 
Form against. 
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web. 
The largest publishing houses are opened a gap in the Internet, for many view as the "killer" of the letter printed. 
The "economic pressure" that journalists warning has risen to a 79%. 
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing the technology in the hope "that do something good" for journalism. 
The shattering more great today in the American journalism is among those who directs the newspapers – or is the directors – and journalists working for them. 
The 56% of executives at national level is confident that its journalists share the same values, while at local level the percentage falls to 23%. 
For some this has to do with the "security of work". 
The executives who think losing the job in 3 years are 47% at national level. 
For the staff journalism is 30%. 
As the "safe working" to level staff (our editors, NDR) in America is always on the agenda. 
Only 13% of the journalists working with a contract. 
In a nation vast as the US, with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet employers often offer what they want and becomes a matter of "take it or leave it,". 
The directors are almost always good wages, while the authors can earn up to 10 billion dollars a month, more retirement and social insurance. 
For the holidays, the reasoning is complicated: A total of days the first year, another after the third to reach 15 days complete after a certain number of years. 
But the American journalists, by his own admission, "contract" followed during the year. 
It is all a matter of climate. 
UNIPOL: Court OF ROME, DANILO COPPOLA SE is IN GROTTAFERRATA 
The chairman of the second section criminal court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the property of Danilo Coppola who had asked to move of their city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome. 
Coppola this investigated by bankruptcy in the field of research on the against pact on the escalation Unipol-Bnl. 
In the course of the process of arrest to his office, last week, has gained the release home, transforming it into compulsory residence Grottaferrata. 
Their lawyer, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the property can go the route of the city of the province into a room of the capital. 
According to the court, these trips (for which the pm has given vote contrary) would allow him to influence their society and access to the evidence to charge. 
The elites in 
The phenomenon had already said a few days ago with the vote of the camera of representatives against the plan to save 700 million dollars set in motion by the White House: A significant proportion of Americans was, and this, most interested to punish Wall Street that to save the economy. 
It gives us a confirms the New York Times yesterday informing us that the current crisis is unraveling the Republican party, more divided between his old soul of the East Coast, moderate, favourable to the federal institutions and the business community, and his new soul, in contrast, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington ’, and the world of finance, strong, particularly in the states of Central and South. 
The soul, in fact, that has become increasingly high-handed with the vote of those who spoke at the beginning. 
This barely mentioned is just one example of mutations, of the large mutations, that the ongoing economic earthquake announces: Not only in the United States but in all of the West, and not only here. 
It is in the United States and in Europe for a long time the crisis seems to function as accelerator of incubation phenomena that with the new climate solidifican and come to light. 
The first of these phenomena is re updating the extraordinary revival, the double category estado-soberanía in relation to a kind of re nationalisation of the economy. 
The crisis, it is a crisis of institutions bancarias- funded which have, if financiarías strong relations with the outside world, but especially are committed much more the balance sheets of the families who live in one country and in a single state. 
That immediately create a political problem for anyone who governs: That is how to respond to the difficulty and the protests of those people and of those families that, on the other hand are voters. 
The crisis is global, economically but is politically and exclusively national. 
The political internationalism seems largely out of the game or do not have much to say: The crucial test is The European Union as divided as ever between the various interests and the different state strategies cannot decide no common policy. 
It is the government of each state that all is expected to make a speech, rescue and recovery plans, new rules and especially the subsidy of funds: When it comes to the court is only the state that has the financial resources and the mass financiaros resources to remedy the situation. 
And also have the means and the legitimacy to use them: Two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which any market will probably never have any organisation, and in the same measure. 
This new emphasis on the nation-state puts the crisis is in perfect harmony with the greatest importance whenever the new economic development tends to give him a very coligado factor to this element: The territoriality. 
Paradoxically, while we were convinced have entered into the network of ever more sophisticated technology, the intangible, while we were convinced that the global finance was intended to dominate the world, we realised that our future will be in contrast to the increasingly accounts with little intangible things such as water, crops and oil. 
All things that look, can certainly be transported from one place to another of the land but are equally together at all in a confined space, a territory. 
So who is as sovereign, has certainly many more letters about who is not, and who has the misfortune of living in a place without crops, without oil and without water. 
The second innovation llego that but presages a fracture. 
Who says Territory, state, government, inevitably says and Leadership Policy. 
In this sense, the economic crisis appears to produce two phenomena convergent. 
On the one hand the objective awareness of the need for a leadership, the request that you can take in the situation. 
On the other hand a wave of disrepute to the existing leadership, inadequate relevada economic species with many grey areas. 
And together, something more profound and in a sense disturbing: A discredited, an intolerance, a bad image, a sense of remoteness, which tends to involve the whole of the leaders of the countries of the West in increasing numbers. 
Always seems to move more, in various parts of the population, the conviction that their actions are the same as those of the social elites in boom until now, felt the same way and be, its culture in the exception sympathetic to the end, to have the time and to be more surprising to the views of the majority. 
The demand for leadership, in short, feeds subterráneamente a movement more ramified but powerful de-legitimize the ruling classes and the traditional political structures, which are in a "electoral ’ revolt or sudden changes in the collective whims of recent times, since the collapse of the conservative Austria-Baviera social-democrático consensus in Great Britain, the rebellion of the men of the American Congress against Bush (and also with the victory of the Right in Italy that has something to do). 
One has the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also its rites, its newspapers, their intellectual accredited, its format would say, make it more difficult to understand and then to represent, what right now that is taking shape are the deep layers of Western society and that the economic crisis renewed, and waved potentially in overgrown Tibet. 
To deal with all this talk of a "mass rebellion ’ today is frankly excessive. 
But the eyes open, it certainly is not. 
The super glue to walk on the walls 
Vencer the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in a future walk on the walls as the man webs. 
It is the target of several research centres Americans and now a team of four institutes was close enough. 
With a badge of only 2.5 cm scientists have been able to have brought a body of 100 kg on a vertical wall. 
The study – The American magazine Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, of Akron, of Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory. 
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of the existing structure that use a particular of carbon, so-called carbon nanotube. 
‘ The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a pile of spaghetti ’ explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
Scientists have been inspired to the leg of the gecos, overlaid minuscule of hair that can ensure the animal a perfect adherence. 
The test facts on different materials, such as glass, teflón and role of lija, have shown that the new badge is ten times more powerful of the legs of this reptil and at the same time "easily diverges from the walls, ” explains Liming Dai, investigator of the empowers of Engineering from the University of Dayton. 
Walk for LAS walls? - "This material could be useful as a transitional badge 'adds Liming Dai. 
Layers to walk along the walls exactly as the man webs? Layers yes, but researchers think a use much less fascinating as the connection between electronic equipment, because carbon nanotubes are drivers of heat and electricity. 
Other applications might have to do with the aerospace engineering. 
By the time nothing of superhéroes. 
Other research - also the University of Berkeley, California, is devoted to the pursuit of a new badge. 
In an article for the journal American Chemical Society, scholars Californians have tabled a badge micro fibers and stripped of that car; during the movement of dust on a surface to keep a perfect grip. 
Drugs: Never with exuberance of fruit 
The exuberance of pomelo, the of orange and apple. 
These drinks, implemented especially in summer because they are refreshingly and rich in vitamins, if taken contemporáneamente with some drugs altering its absorption amplifying or declining, according to the case, the efficiency with serious consequences for health. 
To repeat the risk of toys of fruit are packaged that fresh associated with the assumption of certain medical David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, that since the 236esimo national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia to send a new alarm: Just a glass of exuberance of pomelo, in orange and apple to reduce the absorbimiento of some drugs, cancelling the beneficial effects and putting at risk the health of patients. 
The exuberance of pomelo was already been under accused because it was holding up to toxic levels of medicinal some arrítmicos anti-Saddam, antibiotics, ansiolíticos, antihistamínicos and neurological. 
– The same FARMACOS A risks of drug Italian agency had given the news in a newsletter of information two years ago alarmando doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger that sprang from such of this mixture and to bring attention to something they drink in the case is taking a drug like for example the to Diasepam or the Metadone. 
Not only El POMELO – according to experts also exuberance of orange and apple juice contain substances that inhibit the drugs. 
A long list of the active principles inhibited by the pomelo and other jugos. 
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the University of Milano: "These discoveries in general has been identified in the various agencies of national and international drug that eventually brought to change the information notes. 
That is why we must read the leaflets illustrative of the medicinal acceptance and if there is something that we have no clear, will not be dismayed, clearly ask the doctor or pharmacist 'stressed the expert Ansa agency. 
The novel of economy to Paul Krugman 
The nobel prize of economy has been allocated the American Paul Krugman for their studies, their trade patterns and on the location of economic activity. 
Krugman, 55, is a Keynesian neo who teaches at Princeton University and is a note writer for the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the decisions of the Bush administration on the economy and foreign policy. 
A few months after the attacks of 11 September 2001, in those days Che quebraba Enron, Krugman predicted in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second serious event more crucial than the first, in termines of consequence to the United States. 
A forecast desencadeno much controversy and that for several years reprochada wine to the economy, but that has now been revealed. 
‘ I am amazed and troubled by as the memory of the scandal of the collapse of Enron and WorldCom have disappeared from the public eye ’, had declared Krugman to the addition of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the executive committee of the European central banking, Krugman is a "economist of great value, but also a divulgador style with a" very aggressive, particularly critical against the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration ’. 
Open Office, echoed the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft ’ 
It is the day of the launch of the OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source of personal productivity suite that always looks to attract more softly-softly manner, from the house to the professionals in the office of the public administration, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office. 
After a work of almost a year of part of the developers volunteers, of which their backs are guarded by Sun Microsystem, the new Open Office is the public with several innovations: Welcome to the screen and interface magazine less crude, they add other more consistent, as the compatibility for the Apple Mac os X operating system and the support for the new format ODF format (Open document Format) 1.2, the final ISO standard version. 
Also getting attention to the multi operation with the suite Office 2007, Open Office is in degree of open documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx). 
Interesting some specific functions of some modules as that which will reduce the size of the PowerPoint presentation, useful, for example, to send it via electronic fun, or the possibility of importing the PDF have in the drafting modulo grafica, retaining the original aspect of page. 
Always on this front can create documents "hybrid PDF", which are typical of the format of the grafica adobe with the elements of a calculation or of a winemaker of text. 
The partnership is an element that has received various improvements in the internal aplicativos: In the calculation may intervene in various users, avoiding conflicts of the modificas, in the preparation of texts, each partner has been given a colour in the comment on for a better recognition in the phase of revision. 
Some companies are also working to bring some functions of OpenOffice the Web (on the cloud, above the clouds), and in the coming weeks should give the final outcome. 
The Italian version in the direction can be downloaded at http: / / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.html and I would add to the English that was in the Mirror since Friday. 
In addition to for Windows and Mac os, as usually the suite is also available for the Linux operating system. 
Can be sent to asked the CDs of installation at home or at work. 
And if the issue of free can be a punch to the dissemination in houses, is in the business sector that Open Office suite test, tries to the big bet, and could already have several projects in the public administration and in schools. 
And there is even the realities that offer a service of training, consultations and assistance ideal for small and medium-sized businesses, which could open prospectivas of business. 
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the video for writing the Word; Calc, is the calculation that replaces Excel spreadsheet; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of the known Access is the programme that fail to work in the dates basis; and finally draw the modulo grafico. 
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million download, and considering that until today reached almost 3 million already 600 000, with the departure of the new version is likely to exceed the target figure. 
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping 
New case positive in the tour of France: It is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, third classified and winner of the best remera of escalador. 
To give the news is the site of the newspaper L 'equipped. 
Kohl, 26 years is the fourth row positive for EPO of third generation, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, the Gerolsteiner them. 
The analysis of the blood champions of Kohl fall between those made in the last few weeks in the laboratory and Chatenay-Malabry Losanna. 
If the against tests confirm that is positive, the Austrian will lose the third since the Tour and anger against the two years of criticism canónica. 
To confirm the news of doping positive of Kohl the third-generation EPO is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, which has declared to the Associated Press have reported the news to the Austrian authorities. 
The Austrian 26 years has been placed on the podium at the expense of Spaniard Carlos tailor and American's Cadel Evans, the better the remera adjudicándose escalador. 
Immigrants: New YORK Times SE question, Italy ES racist? 
Italy of country of immigrants has been transformed only recently in a privileged destination for immigrants "met with hostility. 
This is transforming the country beautiful in a nation of racists? Is the question that the New York Times in a long article that has devoted to the debate on the issue of racism in Italy on the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso killed the previous month in Milan for having stolen a box of galletitas. 
This case highlights what the New York Times defines the "paradox of the north": The northern regions are at the same time those where there are "more integration and more work" but also the most senior anti-inmigrantes sentiment in the country and the most senior of his North league. " 
As confirms the growing tension between Italians and immigrants in the New York Times quoted the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
Not only. 
The new legislation also loved by the Lega the brake on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as the paradigm of climate cambiamiento in Italy. 
Trend marked by the Pope that the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano finding to 16th, Benedetto Croce in Congress has asked that the state and the church to work together to combat racism". 
Students victims of the rent expensive, up to 900 euros for a room 
The rental market for the academics not know the crisis. 
According to the latest survey Sunia, the union of the tenants, renting a room alone could cost a student EUR 900 in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 to Napoles, 600 to Rome. 
"The phenomenon has already undertaken characteristics very serious to the point of excluding the right to look at a large proportion of young people by the high costs that the family would have to sustain – explains the responsibility of the office's studies Sunia, Laura Mariani – in these cities strong demand has completely distorted the market to the point of starting a process of general increase until for residents". 
In part that in most cases the offers of rent contain a series of violations: Contracts type free, not registered, without limit of canon, sub rents linked. 
Sunia are necessary for extraordinary interventions that, through the revision of taxation, to regulate prices. 
Looking in detail the survey, we see that in Milan, on a bed in area Brianza, serve approximately EUR 450; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (area Bande Nere) to an average of 800 (area Lambiate, Udine and fierce) to a maximum of 900 (in area Victoria). 
In Florence, a bed costs on average EUR 350 / 400 euros, a room approximately 700. 
In Bologna, where the students are concentrated in the areas near the University, serve 250 / 280 euros for a double bed in a room and 370 to 500 by an individual. 
In Rome in central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bologna) you call for approximately 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a double bed in a room. 
Only slightly more low values (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà). 
The economy is only if a peripheral area: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a room in individual area Prenestina, Centocelle and surrounding areas. 
In Naples for a bed you serve 300 / 450 euros, for a room is spent from 400 to 600 euros, with prices in the areas most high Policlínico, Vomero and Colli Aminei. 
In Bari on a bed you serve 250 / 350 euro, at least 350 by an individual. 
In the cities more girls are more low prices in termines absolute, but has greater weight in the economy of the city. 
In the cities and in Perugia, where the phenomenon of non-EU students and the rent is more often, there is a further anomaly: An increase of 25 / 30% of the fee to foreign students to the Italians. 
The old film adiós Paradiso, the cities cancelled the historical 
The historical film rooms are encouraging the Multiplex. 
"A city without cinema halls in a city blind, is as a side without eyes". 
The picture provided by the director Giuseppe Tornatore fotógrafa with effectively what is happening in the big cities Italians and also in the cities of province. 
The process of marginalization of cinemas, that with the birth of the great meticones in the periphery and the consequent loss of the monkey rooms in central areas of the city, is an event inevitable and indisputable with all the characteristics of a real cultural crime. 
To disappear almost always are historic places, full of memory, "it is as if died a friend, a well-known with which it shared a piece of place and so much emotion, the director of the new movie Observa Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won the cousin Oscar and the grand jury prize at Cannes, which had the poetry of a cinema of province and nostalgia for the way they live the cinema that lost perhaps forever. 
The figures given by the ANEC, the main association of traders, speak clear: In the last five years have closed 316 traditional cinemas, and to pay for the most part are sobretodos rooms in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Napoles, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo. 
Among the regions more suffered by closures are as first, Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinemas less, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41). 
It is a demonstration that the head of its disappearance is the avenimiento the multiplex, are own these three Italian regions that have made the greatest number of new cinemas meticones: 195 screens on Lombardia in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany in Emilia-Romagna. 
‘ The Italian exercise has developed irrationally ’ notes Paolo Protti, chairman of the ANEC, "it would be useful to building new structures but would be needed to ensure the permanence of those that already exist, because when a room of town closed, not all its frecuentadores are prepared to be transferred to the meticones. 
Not to mention the lack of funds for traders: The previous debt to the state is approximately EUR 10 million. 
It is shameful from the ethical and moral point of view, that the government does not respect the laws that exist. 
To sustain the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million per year. 
Interesting the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that worried about the closures, decided to be repaired with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and ANEC, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and protect the cinema monkey room is in the historic centre in the periphery. 
Among the rules laid down there are mediated by easing fiscal in favour of managers and advantages for the public in termines of mobility: Viewers will be able to enter the area of traffic limited and will have special tariffs for the deployment. 
“ It is an initiative that I like 'notes Giuseppe Tornatore "and I hope that other cities to follow the example of Bologna putting up other measures. 
It is true, that contrasts the extra power of the meticones, the traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the public today is more demanding. 
The defence of the traditional film is a subject that I was always important: The closure of cinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make the "New Cinema Paradiso", which already thought from 10 years ago. 
I live in Rome from 25 years ago, and when step ahead of the Rialto or the Quirinale of Alleanza route already closed, where I have lived many emotions shared, not to see the cartels ennegrecidos by the dust, I turn to the other side ’. 
Bond between politics and 'ndrangheta, has been arrested the mayor of Gioia Tauro 
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to standardise the elections of the community for interested parties to the cosca Piromalli." 
The acusas that are heavy anti-Mafia magistrates of the Directorate-General of Calabria give intendente and the deputy intendente of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosary Schiavone, and the intendente of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning mafia association. 
Also arrested Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, opposite number of Boss shops, already condemned by Mafia-like criminal association and to compensate for 10 million euros. 
"Regardless of any moral and legal norms, and good sense," write prosecutors, the two local authorities had expressed the willingness to pay consultations the lawyer Piromalli. 
"It would have been allowed to the Mafia family – write the judiciary into internal officially to the municipality facilitating the great possibility of command and control of the public administration". 
The chairman of the regional junta calabrés Agazio Loiero does not hide that "agreements between the bad organised life there are a lot" in the region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in other, where the agreement is almost inevitable. 
But there are so many local politicians to resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, heroes who kept clean ". 
The arrested this morning are added to those of last July after police had announced the court of head of the Mafia family Piromalli. 
Since the end of last April, the local council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved, as in 1991 and always for alleged conditions between organized crime and the local administration, local politicians had been solevados the task of administering the municipality. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, intendente, the UDC at the time of the dissolution, after the balotaje in May 2006, had been elected as head of a centre-right coalition. 
A scandal when the Prefecture Exploto ordeno the dissolution of the municipal council. 
I call on the deputy interior minister who at that time was Marco Minniti, by accusing it of having organised by a political issue, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning to explain that Piromalli had come to call the variation of the A3 road project. 
Of the interceptions ambiéntales made to Dal Torrione, write the judges, highlights "the availability to promote the demands of a businessman, representative of a group very close to Piromalli clan, uniformando elections of public administration on the interests of the Mafia families." 
When the energy is born of the waves, down to the scene large 
This is a field that has wiped out most of the 70% of the surface of the planet and are now discovering, the major world energy companies. 
Waves and currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which look great as Chevron. 
The possibility of raising energy of the movements of the sea is studying for a hundred years and in the 1970s, together with the first oil crisis, investigations into high gear. 
When the price of oil under, in 1980, the idea of marine energy was removed, but now that the cases of environment and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London has estimated for 2007 that the 15 percent of the global power that could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of the waves of the sea. 
This amount would be twice the currently produced by nuclear power stations. 
And would be tides and currents. 
Giants the attack. 
The first company to bet on the marine energy has been Enersis, that the 2005 has sealed an agreement to build a implant in the north of Portugal. 
When the intention was announced was a revolutionary step. 
Two years away to bet on the marine energy are always more and between these companies that have always voted for the traditional energy. 
"Chevron is looking at the technology on ocean energy – has declared the spokesman of a company associated with the US oil giant has the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal – and is assessing the possibility of cooperating with us". 
The cooperation in question is on a permit from the committee for American energy, to carry out a plan to exploit marine energy in Alaska. 
It is a very important signal, if one considers that in Alaska, the US continues to extract oil and recently, President Bush has activated a plan for new drilling. 
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to follow the path of the energy that comes from the sea, the total invested until now, although there will be detailed show an interest in. 
Technology to develop. 
Experts speak of a technology even at the start, because the marine energy, there is no doubt that has a great environmental impact. 
By now the Portuguese as those shocks are Scottish or the small size and does not seem to create big problems in the ecosystem. 
To produce energy on a large scale, we must use a technology with a greater environmental impact. 
And the choices are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of Boas together between them. 
The force of the waves, which does move the Boas upstream and downstream becomes pressure with percussion and hydraulic cylinders at internal to the same. 
The pressure is turning a system which feeds a generator. 
The electricity is sent to the coast through undersea cables. 
By now there are four implants of this kind of developing waiting only for federal approval, part of the energy, could serve to a military installation. 
Verdant Power, in contrast, already produces energy to a commercial centre and for a parking, using underwater turbines in the East River in New York. 
The movement of water when there are tides, turning the paletas of turbines, creating a movement giratorio that feeds the generator. 
Verdant has said that has a long list of customers waiting for authorisations necessary to use energy. 
After the waves, tides. 
A particular interest, say in the Institute for the development of electric power, merita at this moment the potential of the tides. 
If it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tides are more preventable that the wind, the sun and the waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy. 
It is especially on the tidal energy that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others that are close to the coast, have invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and planned a reversal of 35 million in 2009.
