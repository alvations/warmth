The thursday must fall temperatures, and if there is rainfall, in the mountains should nevar.
But then new rise temperatures, jiří reported jakubský of hradec králové, the hidrometeorológico institute the czech republic.
Us: the recurrence is the mother of the wisdom
Is comical that barack obama, the president 's reputation man smarter, as a student diligent afghan echoed in the issue a strategy of his predecessor, which he made by the more foolish.
When finally revealed his approach afghan, expected with hunger, is demonstrated that is a copy of the script used to iraq by bush, created three years ago.
Not only in the same text is used several times the locución "just as in iraq," but not hesitate to use the title of the bush statement in january 2007 to its own statement: "a new way forward."
It was himself, who three years ago criticized the idea of bush to send new military reinforcements iraq, the country that is suffering by the civil war. and that the criticized as "a decision irresponsible, and with catastrophic consequences."
The following months, however, showed that the bush 's strategy, based in the field of captains recommendations, was the only possible today and successful, so that is not speaks none of iraq in the news.
Bush 's reputation not improved, however objectively left to his successor a much more favorable initial of what cabía expect.
In afghanistan, barack obama expected to repeat the miracle.
The field captains became a ask that expand the contingent, particularly the commander - in - chief of the military operation afghan general stanley mccristal. he, even the traditional relations subordinate, put to the fusileros undecided in the white house hard to a criticism.
Asked 40,000 men in order to improve the situation.
President hesitated for three months, but is not happened nothing better, so that the less misled the general about 10,000 military.
Managed to get europe le promised to other 5,000, though he previously counted with at least 10,000.
The more problematic of all the obama strategy seems to its objective, begin to withdraw the troops in afghanistan in 18 months and resume this procedure in three years. all the doctrine of obama raised more questions of the answers that offered.
Many doubt that increase give the same fruit that the procedure in iraq.
Despite wars fratricidal in recent years, the society of iraq is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in afghanistan is different: no is not possible fiarse and is not true no agreement.
Under these conditions is difficult to prepare the afghan forces of security, if they are used to change the head every day, according to its needs.
The political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a people of tribal patriarchal potemkin. after he remain relations.
Balance the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely complicated because a relations confused, even more complicated by the pakistani influences and iranians.
Even to establish a state that is "capable of action," a goal minimum of all the operation, seems very real.
The horizon of the obama strategy clashes by its willfulness.
During the past eight years, the situation in afghanistan has followed worsening and now is a point to burst.
Only a soul romantic, none of the reality that not know, may believe that the military sent a war to "return soon a house," will some miracle here.
Political from the point of view, setting the date of the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, because the taliban see this as a declaration indirectly of american defeat.
Nato 's latest summit demonstrated that the europeans have increasingly less willingness to participate in military operations in afghanistan.
The political europeans do not know, and nor want to explain to their voters, which has the security of germany, or italy relationship with the war with the hindu kush.
The other factor, capable of affect radically to the situation, it is the development of the events in iran.
If the situation continues worsening and sanctions augmented exercise no effect on the iranians, the us will have to take a difficult decision: trying to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to seek answers precisely when, according to obama, opening of the withdrawal triumphal of american troops in afghanistan.
However, each solution so a setback dramatic mean for the afghan situation.
The only positive for barack obama is the fact that we three years for the presidential election, and why there remains much time to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.

The total sum of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to the agency reuters, probably, despite the extent surpass today, the $20 billion announced.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, in a delicate issue in politics.
Britain announced the miércoles that plans to tax of a one - time, with a tax of a 50%, the bank bonuses for that sobrepasen the 25,000 pounds (roughly 712.000 czk).
France is also preparing similar measures.

Critics say that the budget, in the version approved by the chamber of deputies, de facto liquida the package ahorrativas measures, imposed in the fall of the fischer government to stop the public debt.
Klaus can but no has that sign the law on the state budget; now during a breakfast with entrepreneurs declared that the political bore long from "the serious problem," that is, "the deficit not sustainable" of the public finance.

Mandela in the new movie of clint eastwood, interpreted by morgan freeman
South africans claim that the new hollywood movie, invictus: invincible, relata much about the country, their struggle, and their victories, although some criticism say that the roles players play actors americans.
The history speaks of sport, the race relations, and nelson mandela.
The boundless fighter against the regime racist apartheid in the south african republic and its first black, president nelson mandela, is interpreted in his biography by the american winner of a oscar, morgan freeman actor.
Freeman mandela, 91 years, he said, asked that he interpretase in the film of eastwood.
Another important role plays matt damon.
I said: "when they interpreted, will have to have access to you.
The actor seventy and two years, which received the prize for his role in the drama of eastwood on the world of the milion punching bag dollar baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, that ended remain slave, of the fictitious president of the us, and even god in evan all - powerful. but rarely represented a someone that remains alive, and, for many people, is as important as mandela.
South africa 's former statesman spent 27 years in prison for their activities to end the apartheid in the south african republic.
He was released in the year 1990, and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 was awarded the nobel peace prize.
Invictus - invincible is a word latin america and the title of a poem of the author english william ernest henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was speak as he
The movie is a real story about nelson mandela, that united their forces with the captain of south africa rugby team, francois pienaar, to help unite the country. mandela, the new president, he knows that after the apartheid its nation remains racial and economically divided.
Believes that is able to unite its people through the sport, and this is why decide to join the players from rugby, that belong in the world to outsiders.
The south african team manages to the world cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years that the history of mandela onto the cinema houses.
He had no goal to play this role so that outside the more akin possible a reality, said freeman.
Of course, the greatest challenge was to speak like him.
The political actor said that if he and the world fueras of the same, had tried to meet with mandela, dined with him, be between scenes before his speech.
More important was that wanted to estrecharle a mandela.
Discovered that the clamp hand, get their energy, this is transmitted and had the sense of how feels you, he said.
For me is important to treat of becoming a different person.
Matt damon play the role of françois pienaar, the captain of rugby national team, in which dominated the players white.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a hard role in the world of rugby.
A big surprise to he was, when finally met for the first time with pienaar at home.
I remember being called on the door, he opened, and the first thing that i told françois pienaar in my life was: "in the film parezco much more high."
Despite the obvious differences between the people of the actors and their real models, and under the management of the director eastwood, invictus: invincible received reseñas positive and talk also of ambitions to the oscar.
The critical of movies of the magazine daily variety todd mccarthy summed its assessment with these words: "was a very good, a film, well made history."
In the reseñas of films in the web rottentomatoes. com, invictus received a 76% of assessments positive.
The secret of splendor on norway solved: the russians did a missile tests
On norway is observed a effect luminoso special of origin unknown.
The ministry of defense of russia ended recognizing yesterday that about the borders with norway has made a missile intercontinental missile tests.
The failed of new. the missile launch, "bulava", previously rate bound to be the pride of the russian army, is becoming the nightmare of the russian generals and prime minister vladimír putin.
Or even its repeated presence in the evidence of the missile has had the desired effect on the success of the flights of test.
Bulavá, in most cases, no went flying or produced a failure in the air.
In the russian newspapers type of "bulavá" as "a missile that no flying."
A missile that no flying, but shine.
During this, the 13ª test, not came the principle no problem.
At the end of the flight are produced of new problems in the technical apparatus.
Probably the motor erupted in the third stage of missile.
This time "bulavá" was launched from the nuclear submarine dmitry donskoy, flotaba plunged in the white sea.
This kind of missile posibilita launch from a embarcación that is moving and is underwater at once.
Why it is likely that the light mysterious on norway, caused by a object volante identified, not in reality outside the failed "bulavá."
The noruegos equal from the first time no vacilaron of russian try to a missile.
The generals this time is defend claiming that cannot be talk simply a failure.
The first two stages of the missile and the avería came in the third endured.
In the previous cases the engines averiaron immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the attacks passed completely without mistakes, according to the management of the ministry of defense only six of the thirteen were failed.
The success of almost 50% full of optimism, a general, and why still claiming that "bulavá" a day volará without problems and that even will lead to ten hipersónicos blocs, whose weight total maximum is of nuclear 1,15 tons.

A czech: a substance effective even in the discovery 'encallecidos' hiv virus
The german team of scientists czechs and tests of new compounds capable of moderate the spread of hiv in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is the fact that it is also effective against the drug - resistant viruses.
In some cases, this is more important than the fact that the common compound not as effective in a variant of the virus, as some drugs available.
The disease aids was not can cure until now.
However, the life of the patients can continue significantly thanks to a mixture of drugs that prevents the replication of hiv virus in the body.
However, his use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus will not be suppressed completely, create so - called resistant viruses drug; against them, no longer work.
The work of the three experts institutes of the academy of sciences in the czech republic, všcht prague and of the university of heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of dominate the resistance from the virus.
Drugs showed that so - called metalocarboranos have effect on the albúmina, responsible for the spread of hiv virus.
The metalocarboranos son of boro compounds, hydrogen, carbon and cobalto.
These compounds block the spread of the virus of a different way to all drugs used today, and why can solve the problem of the resistance.
In its work scientists are new, ‘ improved ’ compounds, prepared experiencing the molecular mechanism of its link to the albúmina of the virus.
The metalocarboranos have a single structure three - dimensional: two cages poliedros composed of the atoms of boro, hydrogen and carbon are united by the atom of metal, in this case - by cobalto.
A virus traitor and resilient
The proteasis hiv is a albúmina of hiv virus, and it is imperative for the vital cycle of the virus.
Without the proteasis of hiv, is not produce the fraccionamiento of hiv virus infectious and are not create mature and corpúsculos of the virus.
If paramos the proteasis hiv, paramos also the spread of the virus in the body of the patient, explain in a news of scientists published by the press institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry in the academy of sciences of the czech republic.
In an article published in the journal science journal of medicinal chemistry scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pares cages (see the board) are united by a short series organic, that it remains modified systematically.
A little more weak, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of drugs against the proteasis hiv was launched in test, and also on its resistant, obtained variants of patients with hiv.
The effect of the metalocarboranos in the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in the drugs used clinically, however not lose their effect on drug resistant variants, in which the many times do not work.
The mechanism of the single effect, its other biological qualities as the stability and chemistry toxicity, low, and the possibility of other modifications chemical, that the metalocarboranos are compounds interesting to the effective research with the goal of propose drugs against hiv, says pavlína řezáčová, the woman laboratory of the structural in the biology institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and the institute of the genetica molecular in the academía of science.
Fighting for the budget. ods attacked a fischer, he espouses
The head of ods mirek topolánek said that the budget approved for the next year is "hideous" and the prime minister jan fischer 's government should, according to him, think their future existence.
The declarations of ods were suggested by the prime minister like sentences strong.
Say that it is left time for the analysis.
The ods vice - president petr nečas said that the concept of the cabinet bureaucratic with the support of čssd, the civic democrats and the green party obviously no longer works.
According to nečas the prime minister has to decide if in the chamber of deputies wants to rely on the growing minority, trying to fight against the deficit, or if it wants to stay in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Civic democrats and the social democración 's attitude toward the public is completely different deficit problematic, warned nečas.
The chamber of deputies yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however with the proposals modificativas by part of the left, for more than $12 billion of wreaths.
The chamber of deputies increased the money to the salaries of the state officials, for social services, and the direct payments to farmers.
The government reproached ods proposals, already that cubiertamente increase the budget deficit.
The czech republic should govern with the wreaths 163 billion deficit.
Ods before the vote out of the room and thus fulfilled the desire of government, that the modified budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disillusion and uselessness
The minister of finance, eduard janota, spoke of the disillusion and the sense of uselessness; the prime minister jan fischer mentioned that the government return to appreciate the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if janota seriously threaten to the resignation in case of approval of the proposals modificadoras, the situation had been able to be different.
According to česká televize janota called for a meeting with the prime minister.
Pointed out, that is thinking of remain in the function.
The reason is his disappointment by the budget negotiations.
If fischer is agree with another struggle against the budget deficit, according to nečas in the government does not have nothing to do the nominated by the čssd, which imposed changes in the budget.
The prime minister also should clearly say, if dimitirá, if the house adopt other laws that raise the deficits, for example, that refer to subsidies in disease, rents, or a amendment of the law of service.
Topolánek: the ministers nominated by the ods are not the blame
Is the issue of the prime minister fischer, and all the government.
The ministers nominated by the ods have done nothing wrong, underscored topolánek in the news of the text of the us.
Reminded, that in several ministers in the positions of lieutenants there are people that belong to the top 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas underscored, that if fischer decide resignar the principle of the struggle with the rise of the public finance deficit, "is absolutely logical and right, that supported on the leftist majority, that is currently in the chamber of deputies."
However they can count on support and tolerance of members of the ods.
I have not thought about that, when the moment, i ocuparé of this, said a journalists in the chamber of deputies the defense minister martin barták, the government that was appointed to precisely by members of ods.
The prime minister fischer by the late came to a meeting of the european council in brussels.
Ods gave a request of prime minister
Nečas underscored, that ods the miércoles in the chamber of deputies probably modified vote against the budget, if the prime minister no calls for explicitly to ods members of that allow the acceptance of the budget.
No we feel as orphans, we are not small children, reacted to the question, if ods are not concerned by the absence of the chief of the party in parliament and in the czech republic, during the budget negotiations.
No gave me realize that my vote faltara.
Al resign the mandate knew, that the next few months to try especially of bolchevización of the house of representatives and the destruction of all positive, reacted topolánek same.

This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For the trains rapid and local dráhy now have a contract new of ten years, until the contract was always a year.
Dráhy are contentas with the system, and perhaps why not increased the prices of a large majority of the banknotes.
The changes are produce only in of banknotes a day - čd net internet and cheap banknotes in the eliška.

This is michal hašek of the region jihomoravský kraj, radko martínek of pardubický kraj and the hetmán of olomoucký kraj martin tesařík.
Jančura mentioned in 20 minutes in radiožurnál.
The demand has to do with the regional effort of the company, maintain the rail transport in some regions.
All the regions, however ended signing a the long - term contracts with české dráhy.
All three hetmánes we are attacking speak and the fact that we are "taking the pasas of the pie", however trajimos only the supply for what they wanted.
Claim, that we are more expensive české dráhy, what is not true. know the prices of české dráhy, who were set the last week.
So no queda else us to defend.
It is by the slander to the society student agency, said to radiožurnál jančura.
Mention the time have the tests of all the regions. according to him have not taken steps needed in harmony with the european right.
For this is preparing a incentive for the european commission.
Hašek sees as this denounces by the continuation of show medial lord 's jančura, which serves as free publicity for his company and for himself.
Of course i am prepared to defend my good reputation and the of my region and i appeal to the other hetmánes that also do.
I suspect, which also be show clearly in this time, that mr. jančura manipulates the public in the issue of the regional rail transport, and uses arguments liars and, hašek mentioned.

The vaccine neumococal will be free and voluntary
The vaccine neumococal from january will end to the usual customs.
As a first vaccine must be free to families and voluntary at the same time.
However already appear views, that the vaccine mandatory prove more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free neumococos vaccine culminan.
The institute of drugs is already setting prices peaks of vaccines, that will be covered by the insurance companies.
The experts also already have clear in the procedure of vaccination.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in august
From january will be able to receive free the vaccine neumococal the children born since the 2 of august of last year.
The condition is not a dose of have received the vaccine before.
The who began with the vaccine last year or before, have that cover other dose of the vaccine also.
The first dose of the vaccine has to be greeted between the third and the fifth month of age of child.
The last year a quarter of the left families voluntarily to their children against neumococos.
Parents however paid for a doses 1600 wreaths and more.
To inoculate the younger children need four doses.
Generally experts estimate, that the insurance companies spend in vaccines 300 a 450 billion wreaths annually.
However save in the treatment, that is needed for children no vaccinated ones.
Until now the state spent by all children vaccination roughly 500 billion annually.
Vaccination covered was initiated by the so - called janota package.
The neumococo is the cause of the middle otitis, but also of infection serious inclusive meningitis and the septicemia.
Of the neumococales in our country infections each year according to the research in the hospitals 28 children die not increased the 10 years of age.
In addition to the chequia vaccine neumócocal cover in children was introduced in roughly 40 countries.
Will it be mandatory the vaccine?
However a once appear views, that this vaccine could be mandatory in future.
From january must be covered by the insurance companies, and voluntary.
The vaccine mandatory would be better, for example rudolf pointed out kalovský, the head of the partnership nahlas civic.
Their association spreads vaccines neumococales for long.
The experts in an international conference, in which our partnership participated, no were completely satisfechoscon the fact that we have the vaccine voluntary.
Is not entirely ideal.
On the other side are happy, to achieve at least this.
I believe that this is the way that we now need to undertake, mentioned kalovský.
The ministry of sanitation, however does not want to change the neumococos vaccination procedure.
This moment in not think in all, he said its vlastimil spokesman sršeň.
The vaccine voluntary has its disadvantages, medical claim
The head of the society pediatricians odborná společnost praktických dětských lékařů hana cabrnochová recognize, that the vaccine voluntary has its disadvantages.
If all children receive the vaccine, can be reasoning about the reduction in the number of the dosage. "in the situation, when the vaccine costs a matter so high, relatively understand the policy decision to have started voluntary vaccination as," says cabrnochová.
The experts expect, that a starting next year more than 80 percent of the parents young deja vaccinated against neumococos their babies.
The vaccine neumococal is a major change because as well as the first vaccination in children is covered by the state of health, not by the companies.
Insurance companies should spend more money in the profilaxis, to save then in the treatment, explains cabrnochová.
Physicians will have to buy vaccines by themselves.
Yet the pediatricians are worried by the purchase of the vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies, and stretched doctors, just as when the state da other vaccines.
Some deputies however had to fear, insurance companies could "the money out of health insurance."
Doctors by that will have to buy the vaccines and wait until are paid by the insurance companies.
It is estimated, that pediatricians invest in the vaccines 40 billion a month, what is a remarkable sum.
Nothing will be easy, says cabrnochová.
Still them and us
Can the french islam be?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
In a time voters swiss have requested that be prohibited the construction of minarets, and that there is a widespread warning about the supposed islamization of europe, john bowen, american, has written a detailed report an academic and studied about the possible integration of the muslims (who actually are enlisting) in one of the continent 's more openly secular societies.
Some readers come to this new book as admirers of the last work of the author “ why the french do not like the veils "(" why the french don 't like headcarves ") - - 2006), a study elegant and detail argued of a problem that divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects perceive still today.
The last book of mr. bowen has a wider perspective and more ambitious.
As a good antropólogo, wants to know not only what are saying politicians and the media about islam in france, but what is really happening.
Has past months in mosques, schools, and institutes that now provide a 5 - 6 million muslims in france what mr. bowen called “ islamic spaces. "
He is a good listening reproduce among professors and students debates about the questions that more care about.
Should a muslim marry in a mosque or in a ayuntamiento (or both)?
Should they enseñarles a young muslims on evolution and gay rights?
Can a woman, muslim marry a man not muslim?
Is it legitimate that a muslim use a banking system based on interests to gain a mortgage?
Are these issues apparently worldly, argues, things of the daily life, the that concern the means more than the dramas politicians.
The author identifies a new generation of magnets renowned, professors and intellectuals, none of them, with the possible exception of tariq ramadan, an academic and erudite arab muslim born in switzerland.
This new generation is open the debate about how to be a good muslim at the same time and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
Will not entirely get spread this argument.
The conservatives doubt alone of the idea of a french or european islam.
The thinkers and activists that mr. bowen interview tend to be to disagree with their peers of salafi, supporters of the purista sunni islam associated with saudi arabia, who currently have a small but influential among muslims presence of europe.
Bowen thinks that the values muslims, and the french secularism could be compatible.
But the adaptation requires mutual concessions.
Questions to what extent policymakers french intellectual (and the elite that as fiercely for the secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
Suggests that muslims are probably a deal more unfair that, protestants and catholics jews, who also have had to make their commitments historical with the republicanism secular.
More than a growing pragmatism, perceived “ a adjustment of values. "
Can the islam french be? after read this book, one tends to say “ yes, but still no. "
The more bleak picture of world
The arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other habitat of the planet.
The ice that define is melting at a speed alarming, bringing with life that no can survive in no other way.
The interests of oil, gas, trasporte and fishing have focused on waters recently open, with diplomats, lawyers, and now authors, as a result of this.
In “ about ice delgado "(" on thin ice ") richard ellis, a writer, and ilustrador, paints a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bear.
Knowing de la complicated history and the policy of whaling, describe the long tradition of the arctic explorers, that gave tests of value against the bear target.
The meeting of the admiral nelson as a courageous cadete 14 years, fighting only with the end of its mosquete, is certainly a myth, but other are real.
The offspring, captured while nadaban following the bodies of their mothers newly exterminated, were trapped and sent to zoológicos and circuses.
A presentation of circus in the early twentieth century, played a 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, the compounds of the zoológicos still are usually a millonésima part of the area of field of an adult wild. the climate is almost never: a polar bear in singapore was put resident green by fast, growing seaweed within the sin hair areas of its pelaje.

Ellis relies on stories of other writers and historians, and often becomes a the threat that the hunter to the survival of the species.
Although it is forbidden in norway, the us and russia, the slaughter in greenland and canada continues, where the hunter in helicopters and indians esquimales in motonieves use guns of high - assault power to topple their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters toward the north of those two nations cazadoras where the ice last for more time.
In its new book, “ after the ice "(" after the ice "), alun anderson, a former editor of new scientist, offers a story clear and chilling about the science of arctic ice and a sobrecogedora eyes of how it can transform the future of the place.
It is not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither the scientists atmospheric nor properly oceanógrafos may explain the speed of the changes.
It is no lack of challenge.
The travel pioneers of fridtjof nansen in the late nineteenth century, and the early twentieth century gave indications for the first time about the movement of the masses of ice.
Then the submarines of the cold war trazaron a map of the movedizos cordones of ice that circulate below of the masses of ice.
The satellite exploration and extensive series of sondas montadas in the icebergs are a useful supplement, but individuals acampados in the cold still resistant, many tasks.
Mr. anderson looks within the extraordinary, tiny world of the system afluente within the arctic ice, formed by chorritos of water salina that is comprime while stall.
But from the bear on the surface, until the marvels microscopic of the interior, are all condemned once the ice of summer retire, which is believes can happen at some point between 2013 and 2050.

Cuba has a budding blogger community, led by the commentator popular yoani sanchez, which often writes on as she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has requested in several opportunities permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but the permission has been denied.
The arrest of a us contractor can cause probably tensions between the government 's communist castro brothers in cuba and the obama administration, which has been looking for a "approach to slow pace" to improve relations with the island.
The new york times was the first in dar to learn the news of the arrest the friday at night.
The new american policy emphasizes that if the cuban government take concrete steps, as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the united states.
The mobile and portable computers are legal in cuba, even if new products and codiciados in a country where the middle of a worker wage of government is $15 per month.

Pakistani officials desenmarañan a complot to send men to afghanistan
The pakistani authorities neutralized saturday presumptive brain of a complot to send five men virginia north to afghanistan to kill us troops, showing that hope that the case can help disentangling an extensive network of reclutadores terrorists, internet travel in search of young radicalized.
The researchers said they were pursuing a a mysterious insurgent figure, known as saifullah men, who invited to pakistan then discover that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks in the siege of internet videos youtube.
Saifullah to men once that were in pakistan, trying to help to reach the remote area in the tribal belt of pakistan, which is a familiar to al qaeda and its place terrorist training camps.
But a pakistani intelligence official who had been informed about the event, made the saturday that saifullah could not to convince the commanders of al qaeda that men were not part of a complot of the cia to infiltrate in the terrorist network.
Thus, the isolated for several days in the city 's eastern sargodha, far from the mountains northwest. that have become a paradise terrorist.
They are regarded as part of a covert operation.
For this reason were repulsed, the official argued, who spoke since the anonymity because of the delicadeza of the case.
The cio said that the men are not inmutaron and even trying to get the right approval to gain access to the fields of al qaeda, when the pakistani authorities police arrested.
The case of the five men, who remain in pakistan, and are being interrogated for the fbi, underscores the critical role of the reclutadores in the identification of potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, to determine who are of confidence.
Since the attacks of september 11, 2001, the american intelligence has priority principal trying to infiltrar people within of al qaeda.
The reclutadores of the organization act as rangers, no leaving be those that no show a serious commitment to the holy war, and those that could be spies.
The analysts said that al qaeda analyzes with special attention to the americans would recruits.
But for the organization represent a huge attractive, owing to their potential to have access to american objectives and due to its value of propaganda.
But evan kohlmann, a senior to the nefa foundation analyst with basis in the united states, said that the terrorist groups also have become much more cautious in recent years with respect to those who admit, because the intelligence agencies americans have become experienced in their methods of recruitment.
Is if you trying to infiltrar to someone in these groups, what better way to follow the recruitment why so many have already followed model? stated kohlmann.
Has been transformed in a much more model based on the web.
Tens of thousands protest in copenhagen, demand "action" climate

The protesters said that 100,000 people involved in the event, but the police estimated that the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of activists enmascarados placed small explosives nearly a group of government buildings in the center of the city.
In a day in the that little happened in the climate un - sponsored talks, thousands of activists have walked the city saying up in english, saying, "there is a planet b" and a spanish that declared, "the land says" already enough. "
Several famous joined the protest, even the danish model and fotógrafa helena christensen, who said that the travel peru, the country 's native distressing his mother, i made aware of the issues with that country must deal, owing to the impact of climate changes that are already happening. "
This is part of the reason for which he decided joining the great manifestation, to spread word and appeal to the world 's leaders, to submit a fair, ambitious agreement and binding, demonstrated.
This is not an easy task, but it has to do, there is no way of eludirla by more time.
The police prevented a the demonstrators closer too al beautiful center, and said that 19 people had arrested, mainly a cause of the use of masks or by portar knives of pocket.
According to the law danish, those activities are banned during the demonstrations.
According to a witness, who called for not be identified by be implicated in the climate talks, activists with masks sports, and dresses black put several explosives near the main channel of copenhagen, that is about several ministries.
Were by the buildings, said, adding that began as llamaradas, but that were followed by "a couple of large explosions."
Within the center of conventions, people met around the television screens to look at the march throughout the late.

He said that it shows the attention of the public in general, and of different sectors the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "also can be said that affect the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
The data of a test reveal racial differences persistent
The federal libreta of ratings of the last week on the performance in mathematics, was a very good news for public schools of the district capital.
Although the district is still far from the systems with better performance of the country, libreta ratings showed that the children of fourth and eighth graders gave steps to a more rapid pace for the last two years, with respect to cities of atlanta, chicago and new york.
But what is carved in the recent figures of the national assessment of the educational progress is persistent difference of return between students white african - americans and students, both to local level as a national scale.
The average of children blancos scores of quarter degree of d. c. during the last two years, grew 262 270 (on a scale of 500), but his peers african increased only three points, 209 to 212.
In reality the difference in output grew between 2007 and 2009, 53 a 58 points.
The progress of the african - americans the eighth graders remained essentially fixed, bringing a negligible statistically, to 245 a 244.
The average scores of the blancos are not included in the results of the test, because the size of the shows no was quite grande.
A over an extension of six years, the picture is not more promising.
The difference that separated children a white and black of fourth degree in 2003, when the first enpe became known in the district, was 60 points of the scale (262 a 202).
Although the successful scores for children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference is has reduced only 58.
Some education in the district lawyers expressed concern the last week, because that the advances celebrated by the rector michelle a. the rhee and the mayor adrian m. fenty (democrat), were driven in large part by students white, that are already very good students.
This suggest that we have improved the whole looking to those in the superior part of the scale, what is problematic, and conflictivo, displayed jeff smith, managing director of d. c. voice, a nonprofit organization advocates fairness educational, in the district.
I am not giving leaps in joy by a difference of two or three points, the council member of the d. c., kwame r. brown (dem. - - for accumulation), who has a an elementary daughter in the fourth degree of the eaton.
Brown, a critical asiduo of style of management of rhee, said that the message of the scores of the test is that the city 's secondary schools have a desperate need of attention.
Clearly is always want to see the positive signs, and i respect.
But what worry is that we are not spending the time or the energy needed to our schools middle.
Rhee said that the district needs to finding better ways to address the needs of the students of low - yield.
This autumn, for example, is training to some professors to use a new curriculum reading, the system of reading wilson, aimed to students of the superior degrees of the primary school and media, that no dominated the fundamentals of early reading in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
The mathematics of all the days, a curriculum of mathematics from kindergarten to sixth degree, that emphasizes games, and experiences of real life, that was introduced in the district under the former superintendent clifford janey, which he is acredita something the progress informed by the enpe last week.
Only think that we must continue working to offer the best interventions to those students, who are below the level of degree, stated rhee.
Others say that the results of the enpe highlighting the question of whether rhee can continue increasing the general of the system yield and still provide additional money and resources for schools of low - yield, that will be necessary to reduce the difference.
There is a kind of dilemma rocky to michelle rhee here, said bruce fuller, a professor of education in the university of california at berkeley, that investigated scores of urban tests.
The solution to the conventional policy is spending their resources and reform of a schools located in the poorest sections of the administration d. c.
Then the goal can generate impact policies that are against that important timetable.
But the problem, of course, is that, as other superintendents, it comes to cling to the urban middle class white and black.
Our focus is to ensure that built a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our schools barriales, so that all the families, without account where live, have confidence that their children can gain a public education excellent.
Janey, now superintendent of schools newark, said in an interview this week to an essential element to end the difference of performance is delay the year of traditional public school, currently 180 days in the district, to compete with autonomous schools.
There are to reach nearly 200 days for the force of change, said janey, which came to an agreement with the union of their professors in a year 's 185 days last year, which regards it as a "indicator" to seek a further increase in the next convention.
Making teaching superior a part of more future
The bus tourism came to the university of gettysburg with a strong resuello.
Graciela rodríguez, 12 years, descendió and blinked for a moment to the columns, white, the facades brick and the prados emerald.
Parents in graciela only had been graduates in a secondary school of el salvador.
Until recently, graciela itself, who was born in silver spring and lives in riverdale, had never set foot in a campus university.
Still, when it and other children 's eighth degree of group exploraron gettysburg, where the tuition costs 38.690 dollars a year, its attitude was less guests from impressed that the potential of enthusiastic students.
Yes! here is where be! exclaimed graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that had entered the building of science.
Caray, serious in?, said pensativamente, when the guide spoke of low professor share - school students.
The university of pensilvania was the seventh children had visited in his trip three days, and had already absorbed completely their deliberate message: the question is not if you get to go to university.
The question is a what.
Although there is increasing concern for the large number of children born in the united states of immigrants hispanic to abandon the secondary school or pregnant left in the adolescence, there is also hundreds of thousands that shared a university education that need to gain access to the middle class.
Indeed, one of every five of these hispanic "second - generation" gradúa at the university, a remarkable achievement given that many of its immigrant parents, especially mexicans and central, arrived in the united states without finished secondary school.
Their success stories are important, researchers claim, because the way forward for a generation suggest that play a major role in the country 's labor force.
Those who look at a higher - yielding say that a often have a natural affinity for the school and inborn a tendency to succeed.
Many have also parents who set high objectives to their children, and find ways to compensate their lack of familiarity with american schools.
But the tutoría programs can also play a unique role to help graciela and millions of children as it to reach a university, in particular the efforts, if argue in the time.
Watching a low - income children, whose parents are not the experience and the skills to help to navigate the system, deduce that any intervention in any time is not a problem, said patricia gándara, a research of the university of california, david, who has a students latinos - reviewed.
We need to think in providing a network of support for these children, from the garden of child to secondary school.
The federal program that financed the universities tour de graciela is a useful example.
Known as gear up, provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems, to execute the university of preparation, programs that begin when students low - income are in the media school and continue to end the school.
Since 1999, the program has helped to more than 10 million of students, with more than 60% frecuentando university, according to the us department of education.

Take long before that something more is in supply in iraq.
The massive by the security concerns, accentuated by bombing coordinated the tuesday, and the political instability as the american military withdraws, probably prevented a us oil companies risk more forcefully in iraq, which has the world 's third more important of crude oil reserve, claimed the analysts.
The us companies were in some cases in disadvantage, because the rivals, in particular chinese and other energy companies controlled by the government, have considerably lower labor costs, and are more prone to take risks because not respond to shareholders.
Exxon - western and mobil petroleum inc were the only american companies that reached deals with the ministry.
The major american firms, such as chevron and conocophillips, that have estrechado ties with the ministry of iraqi oil, and have provided technical advice in recent years, left hanging.

The preseleccionadas companies to present proposals made offers that are then eye with the subsidy per barrel, the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above the current levels in every field.
The main planner of al qaeda has been, apparently, murdered in pakistan
It believes that a course with missile american attack in the pakistan 's border with afghanistan has killed a principal planner of operations of al qaeda this week, said the friday american officials of counter.
To be confirmed, this would be the second attack mortal against a high ranking terrorist leader of this autumn.
Saleh al - somali was one of the two men arabs thought that has late the tuesday when a couple of missiles impactaron against his car, near the city of look shah, in the north waziristan province, according to sources, and pakistani officials of the region.
Local authorities said that the missiles were launched by a plane no identified, the kind operated by the cia within the zone tribal pakistan 's illegal.
Were leading a car white, in the direction of the afghan border, when the car received the impact, said an official of pakistan 's civil intelligence agency, speaking on the telephone since look shah.
The cio said that local militants suspected precipitaron al place and quickly confiscated what was of the "bodies entirely broken."
Local authorities were unable to verify identities of the victims, but two american officials of counter quoted unspecified evidence that somali was among the dead.
Was to somali described as a high military planner range of al qaeda, who led the operations of the region 's terrorist group outside of afghanistan - - pakistan.
Is spent a conspiring around the world, a high official, said that spoke since the anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of the american air strikes within the pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included attacks conspirativos against the united states and europe.
Had a strategic guide of command superior of al qaeda and translated into patterns operational to potential terrorist attacks.
The second us official said that somali had promoted rapidly in the ranks of al qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups of the region.
May not be a name known for some americans, but that does not decrease in no way the threat that we raised a us and to our allies, the second argued official.
If it confirms his death, somali would be the second taliban leader of al qaeda or leader murdered since september, when a similar attack killed a najmuddin jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal, and three other high - ranking agents.
The pace of the attacks of no pilotados directed by the cia has declined from the summer, an average of about six a month to two operations, according to a recount of the long war journal, a web site led by a non - profit organization.
The decline should be perhaps a a tactic improved by the terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit its vulnerability while murdering ruthlessly a informers suspected, said the siege.
The most un envoy in kabul a point of resign
The top of the un envoy in afghanistan, kai eide, said the friday that relinquish its because in march, ending with a tumultuoso mandate that was damaged by allegations of widespread corruption in the presidential election of afghanistan, backed by the un.
The exit of eide acontece when the obama administration has decided to send a 30,000 additional us troops to afghanistan.
The un envoy said that supports the increase, but worries about that the us timetable for the military withdrawal that starts to 18 months impulse to other governments of the nato to withdraw its forces.
We need to accelerate the preparation of the afghan security forces and send the right to the afghans to sign that can rely on the international community, marked eide in an interview telefónica since kabul.
The commitment has to be a long - term.
The norwegian diplomatic also pushed to the united states and other international military powers to increase the number of civil servants, that associated with the political transition of afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector has that reflect in the civil sector, said.
Eide said that was not dimitiendo, but simply serving a promise that did his family in march 2008, moving only two years in kabul.
Said that sought to notifying the secretary
The un general ban ki - moon, so that would have time to find a replacement.
What he said is that it is better than begin to seek a successor, stated eide.
When i arrived here, was a vacuum of two months between the exit of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has begun to seek a replacement, according to the un officials.
Officials say that have been given a staffan di mistura, a citizen swedish - italian that directed recently the un mission in baghdad, and a jean - marie guéhenno, a french that previously directed the un peace missions.
The position of eide in afghanistan was test to its former proxy, peter w. galbraith, which accused in september favor the country 's president hamid karzai in the presidential vote and cover evidence of a massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminaciones, but said that the charges of galbraith, who was sacked, "certainly damaged the mission, because he had long skepticism about the international" interference in the election.
Eide said that proposed the appointment of a high representative civil to coordinate the efforts of assistance to part of the forces driven by the united states in afghanistan.
Also pushed the leadership of the un to allow his successor hire more staff of the united states and other western countries, lend to the afghan mission, claiming that this would increase its confidence that their money is using correctly.
Eide expressed its frustration by the constraints to their powers in afghanistan, saying that regulations cumbersome of hiring of the un menoscaban its ability to capture talents.
Such is so that the rules of the un me allowed recruit only a person since may, demonstrated.
This is catastrophic and cannot continue.
Gates: iran face additional sanctions
The secretary of defense robert m. gates, said the friday that significant additional soon "the world powers imposed sanctions against iran," by its failure to engage in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, to a group of approximately 300 us troops in the northern iraq, for a trip of a week in areas of war in afghanistan and iraq, le dismissed the prospect of a military action against the islamic republic.
There is no good options in iran, argued, in response to the question of a soldier on the probability of such an event.
One of things that i pesa is that, if we have learned something of iraq during the past six years, is the inherent unpredictability of the war.
The obama administration is considering a package of targeted sanctions on iran 's military and political elite, but gates pointed out that some sanctions could also affect the iranian people in general.
Argued that would be necessary "a package of incentives and disincentives," "to persuade the iranian government that they be really less secure with nuclear weapons," because their "people will suffer severely" sanctions.
The friday, in a declaration of of the white house, robert gibbs spokesman, the administration joined the european leaders to notice that iran will face consequences "credible" if its nuclear program do not fully respected the indications of the un security council and its nuclear control agency, the international atomic energy agency.
Iran insists that wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in geneva the october 1, indicated that come back to negotiate on the restriction of its nuclear program and accept leaving a substantial part of their reserve of enriched uranium fuel, a change that is desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for that, as a way to build trust agreement between the two parties and buy time for negotiations.
But since then, iran appears to have away from the tentative agreements, in part, iranian experts, because the command claim is divided in relationship with the possibility of commit with the united states.
Frankly, i believe that iran 's tightening with the international community on some proposals that in fact accepted in early october, has joined the international community, including the russians, and the chinese, in a way in which they have been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the iranians, stated gates.
President obama has because as deadline 31 of december to iran that responds to other options, the re - think, before proposals even continue with what the minister of foreign affairs, hillary rodham clinton, once called "sanctions devastating."
In a declaration that in new york, iran 's mission to the united nations denounce what he called the thursday "unfounded accusations and non - base," some members of the security council on iran' s nuclear activities, and said that he has the will to continue to the talks with the united states and other five global powers, "to get a properly, long - term solution."
Gates, that was a return to washington the friday last, was found in the morning with the iraqi prime minister nouri al - maliki, before flying to the kurdish region of iraq oil - rich, to meet with troops and kurds officials in irbil in kirkuk.
The tensions remain high among kurds, and the arab majority of iraq, in particular with regard to the borders, the property rights, and the partnership.
Gates, urged to both sides to diminish the potential to the conflict, to avoid any delay in the united states, to reduce the number of american troops 115.000 $50 towards the end of august.
Gates also sought to alleviate the anxiety about the kurdish reduction pending. the american officials quoted the words of gates a massoud barzani, the president of the government 's regional kurdistan: "preservaremos its security, prosperity, and autonomy within a unified iraq.
No abandonaremos. "
In a china that aging, a change of course
Wang weijia and her husband grew surrounded by cartels propaganda that sermoneaban about the fact that "the mother land is too weary to sustain a more children" and "a baby mas means a grave more."
The lesson learned so well that, when government officials of shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and the population aging of their city, changed course suddenly this summer and began to encourage a couples young people have more of a child, its response was instant and firm: of no way.
We have taken as all of our time and energy only for a child.
Nothing we are left to a second, said wang, 31 years, a manager of human resources with a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after that introdujese the policy of a single son in china, creating two generations of children conspicuously rechonchos, children only malcriados, affectionately apodados "small emperors", a demographic crisis in the country is emerging.
The middle of birth rate has fallen into a tailspin, a 1.8 children for partner, compared to the six of when the policy became effective, according to the division
Demographic of the un, while projected that the number of residents of 60 years, and more of 16.7% of the population in 2020 exploit to the 31.1% by 2050. this is well above the average global about 20%.
The imbalance is worse in the rich with populations very cultas, coastal cities like shanghai.
The last year, the people of 60 years, and more contabilizó almost 22% of the shanghai residents registered, while the fertility rate was less of a child by couple.
Xie lingli, director of the family planning commission and population municipal shanghai, has stated that the couples fertile must have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the population aging and mitigate future a shortage of labor."
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries as japan, and sweden," he said.
A relief gradual
In the country 's constitution drafted in 1978, china' s a single - child policy is possibly the mandate to date, more controversial introduced by the communist party.
The couples who violate the policy face enormous fines, to three times their annual wage labor in some areas, and discrimination.
Chinese officials have major politics by its contribution to avoid a critical pressure on its natural resources, while the human rights advocates have denounced abuses in the imposition of politics.
In rural areas, some officials have forced a pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
Moreover, many couples abortions according to the sex of the fetus have done, leading to a high innatural proportion male - woman.
In recent years, the demographic officials have ablandado gradually its stance on the de - child policy only.
In 2004, allowing more exceptions, a rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both the husband and the woman are children only in 2007, and atenuaron many of their slogans hard - line.
Qiao xiaochun, a professor of the population of research institute of the university of pekín, said that the central government officials have been tackling recently even more radical changes, as allow a couples have two children if one of the single cónyuges is son.
In july, shanghai, china became the first city in launching an aggressive campaign to encourage more birth.
Almost the night the morning, the cartels instructed to families have a single son, were replaced by copies of regulations that detailing who would be suited to a second son and as getting permission.
The city government sent a family planning and volunteers to visit a couples officials in their homes and deslizar prospectus as below doors.
Also has promised to provide guidance emotional and financial to those that have elected have more of a child.
The family planning officials say that the response has been very little overwhelming.
Response disappointing
Although the rural a city on the outskirts of shanghai officials argue that a moderate rise in noted applications of couples who want a second son following the launch of the campaign, the more urban indicate no change.
The county huinan, with a population of 115.000, for example, even is receiving only four to five requests per month.
The shanghai disappointed officials say that, despite the campaign, even projected that the number of births in city in 2010 only around 165,000 reach, slightly higher the of 2009, but inferior of 2008.
Feng juying, head of the family planning the county committee caolu in shanghai, said that the financial considerations are probably the principal motive for which many people do not want to more children.
They want to the best to their first child, said.
Yang jiawei, of 27 years, and his wife, liu juanjuan, of 26, said that love have two children and are legally habilitados to do so.
But as many chinese, have only health insurance and inadequate of life that provides the government.
Without a network of social protection, they argue, this option would be irresponsible.
People in the west ve incorrectly de - child policy only as a matter of rights, said yang construction, an engineer whose wife is pregnant seven months of the first child of the couple.
Yes, we are stealing the chance of more than a son.
But the problem is not only a political issue.
Is the money.
Other couples cite psychological motives for their doubts.
Wang, the manager of human resources, said that he wants a son only because it, too, it was: "eramos the center of our families, and were accustomed to a all look after of us.
We are not accustomed to take care of others, and not really want to take care of other. "
Chen zijian, 42, owner of a translations agency, explained in more strongly.
To parents with two careers, middle - class, that reduce the fertility rate, said, is to have enough success as to be selfish.
The people of between 20 - 30 years grew seeing the struggle of their parents during the first days of china 's experiment with capitalism and do not want to this kind of life for themselves, demonstrated.
Even a single child requires much time of the parents, argued.
A mother has to resign at least two years of his social life.
Then there are questions of space, "have to remold its strategic apartment," and the "has that have a currículo prepared to the best as when the child has 9 months."
The majority of their friends are willing to face this chen once, said, but not two.
The our is the first generation with the highest level of life, demonstrated.
We do not want to do too many sacrifices.
A group of the un sketches a plan to reduce emissions
The conference on the un - sponsored climate so far, characterized by positions and mutual recrimination defiant, captured a renewed attention the friday with the exposure of a document that projected ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases in the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations that go about their shoulders most of the burden in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a political agreement final to regulate the remaining greenhouse gases, stressed the obstacles and stressed the way to follow.
But was as a breakthrough in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders that will come to copenhagen next week.
Ad hoc produced by a group of work of the un, the text does not speak of how much money giving the rich to poor countries to confront the short and long - term global warming.
And this offers a variety of options to the key questions, including how the developed economies and emerging the major economies recortarían their output of coal, and what would be the increase global temperature limit that policymakers would be willing to tolerate.
This gives many flexibility the process, said john coequyt, high representative in washington for the sierra club.
Michael zammit cutajar, that drafted the document of six pages, summed up a text of negotiation of 180 pages to focus on what the maximum official climate of the un, yvo of bóer, described as "the great picture."
Shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which the industrialized nations recortarían collectively its emissions by 2020 between 25 and a 45%, compared with the levels in 1990, while the major developing countries reduce theirs during the same period between 15 and a 30%.
Together, the countries recortarían emissions between a 50 and a 95% by 2050.
The european union also encouraged the talks the friday, promising provide $3.6 billion annual during the next three years, to help the poorest countries to adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, the friday the same sort of verbal fireworks was presented last week that have dominated the talks.
The united states, special climate envoy todd stern, rejected the claims that request mandatory emission cuts of greenhouse gases to the industrialized countries, in comparison with the subjects of part of the major emerging economies, if not were funded by the developed world.
The maneuver indicated that the obama administration is taking a more hawkish line with china, with respect to what the bush administration officials only two years ago.
The united states are not to make a deal without the major countries in ways of development proceed and take measures, made stern, who also expressed regret that the text did not enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his remarks an hour after that the chinese deputy minister of foreign affairs he yafei, afirmara that america 's ultimate climate negotiator lacked of "common sense," or was "very irresponsible" by have said before in the week that the united states will not help china economically to confront with the global overheating.
With the world 's future economic trajectory of the major powers at stake, the fault lines have done eruption both within the world in which of development, as between the industrial world and the emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save the individual economies as to save the planet, with china and the united states face on their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the veinticuatro countries of the world more influential are ignoring the scientific to take action more courageous imperative.
Ricardo ulate, a delegate of costa rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are bickering over who should afford the expenditures to limit greenhouse gases, even when the countries vulnerable to have become more aggressive seeking to contain the big responsible emitters of their actions.
This is clearly a game where is developing a new economic hegemony, ulate argued, who also working as regional advisor on climate change of mexico and central america, for international conservation.
Some of the most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that countries continue to press for a compulsory treaty legally in copenhagen, although most of the main participants say that the talks produce a most a political settlement.
The alliance of small island states, with 43 members, produced a proposal treaty preliminary 24 pages later in the morning of friday.
Artur runge - metzger, led by international climate negotiations in the name of the european commission, said that the tip of the small nations island has swept "(political pressure on the political process," in part because they are now unified and demand the action of the emerging economies, such as china and india.
The talks assumed a new urgency while the delegates focused on the fact that must resolve the majority of the exceptional issues before the heads of government reach a close a deal.
The high - level officials, as the minister of indian environment jairam ramesh and the chinese deputy minister, fell from the and took to the corridors of beautiful center, a closed - door meetings and press conferences, to delimit the claims that arbitrarán during the next week.
The absolute the meeting disorder (where each day 13,000 people enter and out of the center of convention, the activists who come the guitarra present shows nocturnos burlándose of the countries that according to them are selling, and go hand in hand in time preliminary proposals of way mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: are almost all the ministers key here in this time, and the miércoles 60 heads of government will be in copenhagen.
We are entering the higher, said carlos manuel rodríguez leagues, vice president for the global policy of international conservation.
The heavyweights are coming.
The first train to 225 kmh of britain redefine that feeling of monday
In the 5.13 monday by the morning, a silbido perforará the dark to point out a way out of train that marks a revolution to travel in britain.
The country 's first high - speed train inter reach the 225 kmh, when shift as a ray from ashford, kent, to the station of st panrcas in london, drawing 93 kilometers in 38 minutes.
A adonis lord, the secretary of transport, it was then join lady kelly holmes, a board of primer service inter javelin outside london.
He hopes that the new international service connecting finally a britain to a network of trains rapid, reliable, and connecting the great conurbaciones of midlands scotland, the north and a london.
The neglectful distant would become prosperous suburbs areas, the times of business travel acortarían and change of airborne and national cars the rail reduce emissions of coal, as well as aliviarían congestion in the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of thousands of millions of pounds that are needed to build a new national rail network, the battle inevitable of planning and the fears about environmental damage, can stop still the high - speed lines of britain.
High speed two (hs2), a firm created a study of to provide the government in january, entregará its report lord adonis the viability of december 30, according to how the times.
This would provide a detailed itinerario of high - speed the next stage, planned to the network.
The new line that unites london a midlands of the west will be drawn within a radio of five feet in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact can be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan be fleshed within a radio 25 meters of a definitive path.
Also hs2 is expected to establish three options for a network of high speed broader runs the north.
Lord adonis respond in spring.
The choice helped that is proposing is a configuration with form of and, in which a single high - speed line arrive at the midlands of the west.
The line split at or near birmingham, with a branch directs the west since peninos to manchester and scotland, and another to the nordeste to sheffield, leeds and newcastle upon tyne.
A single line go scotland.
“ it seems that this will be the option more beneficial, "said a member of the rail.
Once ended, the times of trip between london and edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first stretch, not inauguraría before 2025, allow passengers viajaran between london and birmingham in 49 minutes, in comparison with the current little more than an hour.
The proposals allow trains viajaran a 402 kmh british, turning to the network in europe 's rapid more.
The initial way is devised to withstand trains 400 mt longitude, capable of transport 1.1 people.
At least 18 trains could operate each time in a line of london - birmingham.
This means that they need a terminal of london able to receive 20,000 passengers per hour.
Given the constraints of space of capital, is expected to extend a high - speed existing station to cope to the network.
The the rail industry experts argue that only the station st pancras international or euston offer that potential.
Lord adonis launched if believes that the scheme should come, but a broad public consultation and procedures of planning mean that did not take a final decision until after a general election.
Even if sets in motion the labor, the red should be built in sections.
At the start to force the trains to stop the lines quick by existing lane the north birmingham, keeping the times of trip between london and scotland above the three hours.
This is regarded as the crucial point needed to ensure a change of planes a trains, a reference point for the rail revolution.

Commentator hervé morin announced his intention to recover spell udf, because that sees françois bayrou was not in a position to defend their policy heritage after have tended to the left.
On the other hand, the minister of defense, whose party is linked to the ump, had anticipated confirm the strategy on saturday, to the council 's national nc.
As a his management, received support the help of mp commentator hervé of charette (a former ump, current nc) who claims of the marks udf property, as was the first in registrarla in the national institute of industrial property in 2004.
But the friday at night, the office of the udf association, controlled by the friends of françois bayrou that do not want to be private, broke the silence to launch a requirement for the minister and the deputy intimándolos to give up the - and a transferirles property rights of the mark, so demand judicial penalty.
These past days, you have made many statements hinting that were to propose a its political movement recover spell udf the association, writes in a charter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including a françois bayrou and marielle sarnez of the modem, as well as the senator jean athuis of the centrist alliance.

But the tribunal no 15 also ordered that liliane corrections bettencourt, 87 years of age, was under a doctor in charge of three medical professionals scrutiny.
The heir and principal shareholder de l 'oréal always refused to submit a these tests, even more in the conditions proposed by the prosecutor of nanterre during the research.
Doctors appointed this friday need to delivering a report before the march 10 of 2010 in the that need to do constar if liliane bettencourt suffered states of weakness and for what periods.
I believe that it will accept.
I to talk with it, declared the lawyer of miss bettencourt, georges kiejman, al out of the audience.
For its part, the lawyer of françoise bettencourt - meyers, olivier metzner, the court was pleased by the decision.
Is a great news (…) the peritaje show that he (banier) manipulated to this lady mayor, to whom we must protect, said.
Since two years ago, the daughter only of liliane bettencourt began criminal actions against françois - marie banier, photographer and artist multi - faceted, acusándolo have exploited for years of the weakness of his mother to obtain billion euros in grants, through cheques, life insurance contracts, or works of art.
For its part, liliane bettencourt always denied have been manipulated by the photographer long - term, who regarded as a friend.
The friday, while the tribunal reviewed the come from the action brought by the lady bettencourt - - meyers, the allegations of lawyers were, in some times, a great confession familiar.
In this way, the lawyer of liliane bettencourt had into account three letters its clienta sends (in 1999, 2003, and 2005) to its notario in which said that desconfiaba of husband of françoise bettencourt - meyers.

No other person will be able to appear in their place, "said the public ministry representative, marie - chrsitine daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that pronunciaría once done the judgment of the admisibilidad of mrs. bettencourt - meyers.
Does managerial revolution or end of the intelligence of business?
If nothing changes in the management of the great french companies, our struggle for the development of the business will have been intelligence in vain.
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the leadership of the great companies with respect to its earners reminiscent the position of the companies with regard to consumers before the revolution of marketing: this is that the collaborators adhere to "values" from above as before it was determined to impose a consumer products pensados for the technical of factory.
By putting al client in the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave its place to the strategies of conquest of the markets... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that does not have relationship with the factors of preference to customers repeats itself regularly.
A demobilization of employees can end in a desmoralización killer.
The suicides in france telecom, psa or renault are only the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that affects particularly a executives.
This demobilization uniquely grave the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, above all of the i + d, and even more, de la intelligence of business.
Indeed, the bi (business intelligence) "requires that all the parties involved (...) have a proactive behavior and a vision prospectiva"; it needs to be part of the employees a commitment that opposes fully to the recommendations of a authoritarian direction.
For this reason, convocamos to a managerial revolution, that would be to put the collaborators in the center of the concerns of the company like the client.
Opinion polls have a utility relative internal
Will the domestic opinion polls, as the questionnaire conducted by managerial orange between their earners, incite a revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, fear that no.
- - in principle, because i was able to verify that, with a new situation, and, after many rounds, all the companies stops doing essentially... what always did! b989
- second, because the authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, growing proportionally to the importance of their own failures.
- finally, because most of the managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As come from the large schools of engineers, interpret the psychology mecanicista.
Take, for comfort, the former behavioral theory that the "intellectual neurosciences" americans reactivaron recently, and that the institutes of studies, and the media broadcast widely to their backs.
In this way, to suggest that it is possible to manage the "commands" (sic) of the commitment of executives, a recent research of ipsos published in le figaro. rf affirms managers in a position of management mecanicista, inadaptada to today 's world.
Identify and measuring the factors of mobilization
On the contrary, the revolution managerial necessary for the good functioning of the modern businesses, supposed adopting a finalista view of the human behavior.
Consists in integrate around reasoning or practice of corporate governance, a fundamental fact: to wage earners, the commitment to the company clearly is possible only if it appears as a means to do a reality part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only the studies from analysis motifuncional take this conception of the motivations of employees.
Studies showed that they deem his company on a doxa predisposition that allows them, through the image of the company, assess what this offers them to achieve his own life projects.
Thanks to the identification and a measure of the factors of mobilization, managers of companies can control, forecast and anticipate their "social" performance and move the management derecursos human "in the place."
In this way, create a favorable ground for the development of a strong intelligence of business organized and effective.

According to michael gerson, author of the speeches of george w. bush and current cronista in the washington post, obama made "a speech, very american."
In addition to stand as "citizen of the world," as "as long ago," "spoke as an american president" to remind the european security "that live in a bubble that they do not created and that no much to preservarla," he said gerson.
Between the few not very convinced, a hawkish right - wing of the era of bush, the former ambassador in the un, john bolton, called the "monótono speech, stilted and regarded - inspired" in the web site national review online.
To the left of the president, the democratic representative dennis kucinich alarmed to see barack obama justifying the use of force.
When cubrimos war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocent, warned.
However, the press center - left praised the president.
Los angeles time, though still believe that obama received nobel prematurely, his speech of "superproducción" on all for a speaker known for their talent.
The oslo "speech should serve as a roadmap to guide decisions in the fight against international conflict, poverty and oppression," commented enthuses the californian newspaper.
Obama "made the speech that it was necessary to", estimated the new york times, trial "to the time of bleak, uplifting."

Today, the community of 216.000 people, positioned to 37 kilometers of the center of moscow, is seen as the "russian silicon valley."
Here are major of research and production of micro - and nanoelectrónica centers.

Disincentive of stuttgart
The size of stuttgart 21 not for nothing is placed high enough.
For the supporters of the project is simply of "the new heart of europe."
The law so. s21 is much more than the reduction of a railroad station, more than a monstrous project of building, that precipitate a the capital of the region banden - württemberga a decade of chaos of construction sites irremediables.
Stuttgart 21 emerged out of the spirit of the 1980 's.
With rieles plants, that lead in the middle of the city, they regarded back then fossil engineering the nineteenth century, acting as a disincentive of modern traffic rail, because that formerly was needed a huge amount of time to enganchar the locomotives of behind forward.
Rodar, stop continue the trip; but that should be done in its tracks.
And why should disappear: in frankfurt, and munich plants.
And in stuttgart: a step station, which is roughly a half of the path of the lines of operation trans between paris and budapest / bratislava; hence the slogan "heart of europe."
The s21 really will be undertaken, despite the views of the 1980 's no longer be more compatible with the reality.
Even the designers more ambitious have known that in the capital hessiana and bávara is almost unpayable implement the reduction.
The end of railroad by course nor have more problems of entry and exit, since there are locomotives reversible with extreme unity tractora and slack driver 's in both.
Nevertheless: stuttgart 21 including the new stretch built ice to ulm because will be initiated.
The political federal and communal have willing so.
The rail remains, also because the risks of the great individual infrastructure projects of the republic the leads the taxpayer and not the state.
From the point of view urbanístico, the project is still justifies to a point.
Is creating new urban space, bringing of many green areas, probably graphic generated by computer of the designer.
For the rail transport the s21 system is harmful.
The step and the street are pensados station for the transport of people to be attributed to the huge growth typical of the 1980s.
Back then is not the competition from low - cost the flights.
But the politics of modern transport first must address strengthen the transport of goods, as the transportation, that the green rail is considerably more conducted by trucks in the roads.
Yet, the new tranches in construction we are good for burden trains, owing to the intense gradients.
Even more grave is that the s21 also affects indirectly to many other railroad projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the zuavos.
This is the official figure.
The experts reckon that is more realistic between ten and 15 billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money faltará in other crosses and passages close in the network.
In total sixty projects are on the list of the ministry of transport.
One of the most important is the more of 180 kilometers of enlargement rieles long through the rin valley.
Since 1987 is building the drawn a slowdown.
It would be urgent here the accelerator stepped as it is because.
But the s21 acts as brake.
The stretch valley rin will be the neck of international bottle for transport of goods: through the heart of europe.

The admission of 17 flights between the 23, and the 5 hours, as expected the federal government obligatory, would not be conciliable with the legal protection of the population of sound because of the transit air.
The coalition is to decide to the january 4, if it is to make the appeal against this sentence.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pushed to the representatives of the government to renunciasen to appeal to the court of the nation in leipzig administrative.
The head of the spd group, torsten schäfer - gümbel, urging the cdu and to the fdp to respect their promises of prohibition of air transit night, which had done before the elections. otherwise this could be seen as lack of word.
It is rather difficult, if one le cease fulfill its word, said the head of the green tarek al - wazir, referring to the slogan of the fdp "we keep our word."
The minister posch rejected the recriminación of schäfer - - gümbel, that the federal government would be trying to through tergiversaciones of the law and tricks still get their flights nocturnos.
A research legal full need quite some time.
The coalition not wanted to act on the basis of a "first impression quick."
We need a decision legally intachable, he said stefan müller (fdp).
As well as the represents the opposition, they would not have been never the claims of their group about the prohibition of air transit night.

By that the majority of the union in the council already weeks before the election had suggested, administrative that were not to support a brender in office.
The opposition to the head of drafting had been organized by the president of the government of hesse, mr. roland koch.
Declined other mandate of the chief of drafting prestigious with the argument, that under the leadership of brender the informative zdf would have lost rates audience.
Even before the elections were protests because of this, in that flageló political influence on the zdf.
The final to had intrusive in the debate 35 specialists in public, called the law come from koch as unconstitutionally.
But no served of nothing.

The university careers despejan
Partial for the students success: after a year of strikes associated with the education, the ministers of education, and culture of the federados states finally gave. in a meeting of the ministers of university education and culture with guiding, both sides were set of agreement in trying to improve conditions of study in cases of undergraduates and máster.
Students in a future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example is set to agree on reduce the burden of tests: basically every módulo of the race must end with a only examination.
Moreover are to examine the burden of work of the students, and wants to ensure a "as real and justifiable."
The policy and the universities want to simplify as well as the recognition of results of tests between universities inside and outside of germany.
The federados states will commit to confeccionar more flexible the rules structural together to careers in bachelor and master.
Regulations to the federados states that divergen of this, there must be no longer.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in june the ministers of university education and culture, and the guiding speak continuously of the improvement of power and to conclude with a career success (estudiabilidad).
Now for the first time it spoke of a specific content in.
The so - called acreditación council agreed to drastically reduce the number of the tests: "every módulo finaliza with a only review," says in a document of 30 pages, which seeks to regulate partially the approval of the university careers.
With the "reduction sensible of the burden of tests," are to avoid the development in a wrong direction, which would damage markedly the estudiabilidad, so explained the director of the council of acreditación, mr. reinhold grimm.
Moreover, in a future, the "estudiabilidad" must be the key criterion in the configuration.
The módulos and content must be considered exhaustivamente as a restrictions unnecessary of the students in the election of.
The courses.
The students have "the right to get more space, to posibilitan and promote the own initiative."
These new rules valdrían for careers, but also in the review of careers already existing.
These must be "reacreditar" of new every five years. but this would mean, tardaría to the year 2015 to examine all careers.
The responsible for this would be a level of all the country 10 acreditación agencies, which are under the supervision of the council of acreditación, that is instala by the states federados.
The ministers of education, and culture exhortaron a states federados in october influence of such a way in the agencies, that the number of commodity and the tests are not too strict or demanding.
In some states federados universities and schools are already put techniques of agreement with the ministries to adopt such measures.
Until now only the rhineland - platinada secured provide additional means to development subsequent the bologne process.
With this money universities must implement tutoría programs and advice, as well as strengthen offices student examination and abroad.
The state federado and universities seek to dispose of 10 million euros for these finalidades.
In the early 2010, the government wants to lead to parliament a novel of the university law.
According to it should be enough a only to completing a model of race.
The configuration of the race should be done more flexible, are also wants to ensure the recognition of assessments in other universities and facilitate the accessibility to master.
Until the end of the next year is seeking to examine all the careers about his "estudiabilidad."
This thursday the government and the opposition discussion again on the conditions of study in the state federado.
A part of the praise there was also criticism about the decisions.
In the board to the federal level of the university groups juso (young socialists) seexigía, that the configuration of educational policy is no longer should "behind closed doors" of the guiding ministers and the university.
To the latest behind the strikes of education, the students now as major involved should also power say.
The president of the university guiding board (hrk), margret wintermantel, gave its support to the students: "we need the experience of the students," said the thursday in a meeting with the ministers of education, that the hrk deliberó about a document of reform set.
To the union of education and science (gew), the bonn agreements were not of all enough: the union demands a legal right to each student with the title of bachelor the possibility of access to a career master post.
Moreover federados states have that ensure, to the current generation of bachelor students exist in a future enough squares of study to master with the best conditions of study possible. so a member of the reported gew, mr. andreas keller.
The federados states have quecontratar enough more docentes.
But about a greater access to máster, the ministers of education did not commentary.
More than a note the pie about herta müller
Germany 's "come and go makes it virtually without control" says the first line of a poem of lírico stands söllner on fragments idiomáticos destabilizing, in which tematiza the experiences of germany arrival bottoms by a dissident, which won their freedom, but lost the environment of its language.
Stands söllner, born in 1951 in banat, rumanía, worked the principle as a professor of german and english in bucharest, and then as reader of books editorial in a child, before moving to frankfurt in 1982.
A söllner gave several literature, in 1993 dealt the prizes memorable lessons or schmoozing poetry in frankfurt in the university goethe, and from el2002 is director of the literature in hesse in the mousonturm forum in frankfurt.
Gave that talking rather the past tuesday during a meeting in munich about "literature german in rumanía in the mirror, and the mirror disfigured of their files of securitate"
Visibly insecure and ashamed, söllner read a declaration in the role as im admitted in the romanian securitate against a secret service writers colleagues germans - romanians, among other richard wagner, william totok, franz hodjak, and helmuth frauendorfer.
Together with some of the present in the year 1989, söllner had been the prize german language.
Attempts to recruitment had begun slowly, a principles of 1971.
"therefore i am someone who will not be defended sufficiently in the face of attempts to provocation of fear of the securitate", finally söllner.
The lírico stands söllner is im walter.
Almost at the same time of the granting of the nobel prize for literature a herta müller and his controversial literary without equal with the mechanisms of dominance dictatorial, the stage is shaking literature and special in the community of germans oriundos authors of rumanía by a case that evidence the chasms, and the evils of a political system, which is based on control, and spying.
Stands söllner is, of what is known until now, is not only author, but also victim.
In his dossier of securitate im walter had played a role, said the scientific literary michael markel after the confession of söllner, and remarked for him positive influence delim walter.
It had excusado or defended in all points difficult for him, said markel.
"moral feel the need to do this claim," he said.
The declaration of public söllner in this way and to this was unexpected, the confession of a former - dissident and his work with the romanian secret service, however, is not surprising both.
Germany would have been a safe haven comfortable to spies of the securitate - spitzel gewesen, wrote herta müller already in july in the weekly "zeit", having read their own dossier of 914 pages.
The involved certainly have speculated and will be known in some cases, what names is hiding behind the seudónimos of sorin, voicu and also of walter.
Unlike the revision of the dossiers stasi with a procedure controlled in germany, the deal with the dossiers the control of even the securitate is quite diffuse.
A systematic clarification was boicoteada and dificultada in recent years.
A national council for the elucidation of the dossiers of the securitate (cnsas) was, for the authority birthler, formed in the year 1999, and the delivery of the dossiers da rather rastras since.
Since the 2005, there is a law that regulate the management of the dossiers.
An interview, after the granting of the nobel prize for literature a herta müller, proof that the influence of old members of the securitate in even rumanía is quite grande. this interview a former head of the securitate temesvar spoke disparagingly of the condecorada.
"it has psicosis," to the final the questioned only once.
The infamy of power seemed to order show without rounds in the form of the freedom of opinion.
Of course, questions arise inevitable with the case söllner, as so many times when there is blame silent.
Why right now, a who was caused damage? the quiet of the oyentes reaction to the confession of söllner leaves hope that the continuation of this history regirá more by the eagerness of knowledge and not by both the allocation of guilt and shame.
For the genesis of the work of herta müller, that yesterday accepted the nobel prize for literature, is more than a simple note the pie.
As champions' league garrison to fill the stomach
When the new team of soccer coach vfb of gross stuttgart, christian, accompanied by a plastic bag of color orange of supplier of his team, addressed a taxi mercedes of the c a quarter of class time after the media night, provided the impression that a member of the foreign service gracefully dress was out of a very nice celebration of christmas, in which the manufacturer of articles sports distributed samples.
The man of the bald feature had contracted to a driver, because a that still no knew the city.
For the other, also had been able to lead the car: to end himself, had not alcohol at stake, and was not ebrio of happiness the man of 55 years.
Had been an afternoon, but tomorrow start the work of new.
Or start for the first time.
In the words of the swiss, who had been contracted just three days before: "it is true that alcanzamos eighths of final," namely, in the champions league, thanks to the 3 triumph: 1 against unirea urziceni, rumanía, “ but cannot be blind by the success: we will have to fight the decline brutally. "
The "much more important task “ were expected the next domingo, said.
Then, in mainz will be very repeating the success of the “ real "in the cotidianidad classes in the league.
And remove the weaknesses, have evidenciado clearly of new, after the rapid three goals of marica (5), träsch (8) and pogrebnyak (11).
Sorteo
The end of the champions league eighths (ida the 16 / 17 parties and february 23 / 24 / parties back 9 / march 10 and 16 / 17) sortearán the december 18 in nyon.
So that remained limited delight by the withering entry of successor babbel.
Not only in el salvador course, that in brief time had inspired a the puzzled profis of stuttgart confidence in themselves, willingness to surrender and taste for the game.
I was with the players and i said that they had to concentrate on its strengths, urged to be more launched, explained the reparador of souls gross his recipe of success than so simple sounds, but that with the terapeuta babbel no longer had surtido effect.
He displayed a certain magic, accepted the supporter of babbel, jens lehmann, “ when the football surge a new impulse, sometimes things happen that no would have believed possible. "
And sami khedira, after a pause of several weeks due to an lesions advanced soon into the better local player thanks to its dynamism, tried to describe the “ phenomenon "perceived with the proverbial “ wind fresh" and the form of work of the new chief: “ he is a man who intervenes to fund, and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation. "
And this is what has been missing, obviously, when was babbel.
The vfb stuttgart has not gone still the test, he warns manager sporting horst heldt
But the vfb stuttgart needs on all constancia.
Like gross, also the players, and the manager refrained from overvalue the triumph against a defense weakened by lack of relevos and totally rebasada invited romanians.
Also had won in glasgow, before that four days later in leverkusen with the 0: 4 had come the sad awakening, gave a think khedira.
And the manager horst heldt warned that while had reached a goal of the season, the other still very far.
We still need to overcome the problem.
That heldt did not have mood to celebrate in their birthday number 40, even after the first victory in its headquarters from three months, due to the events of the end of week, that became a actualizarse in the form of a television interview, transmitted just before the start of the game, had given the gatekeeper jens lehmann.
There is decisions made other, and no jens, faced heldt the harsh criticism of lehmann.
He had reproached weakness in the direction of the governing council, who had decided to change coach by the pressure of the fanatics teenagers.
Free also had removed its day after the games he described lehmann as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
The statements lehmann were “ marked by the pure egoism, "repuso heldt, and announced consequences for the zaguero.
Probably will no longer be friends to always, the two cuarentones.
But at least agreed with all the other in that, without the previous efforts with the coach replaced team, had not been possible the spectacle of great game and force of battle.
Babbel and their aides had “ a major participation in the success, "said heldt and lehmann in unison; and was also of agreement the man of the maleta plastic.
Fight of the world 's championship heavyweights
Hot mourning in berna: a and again the retador kevin johnsonn was leading the world champion vitali klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the ukrainian defended its heavyweight title in the version of the wbc.
The judgment of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg: vitali klitschko remains heavyweight world champion.
The champion of 38 years in the version of the association wbc in the night of friday saturday defeated in berna to the american kevin johnson decision unanimous by points (120: 108, 120: 108, 119: 109).
To klitschko was his third successful defense of the title from his return in october 2008.

Klitschko expanded its balance a 39 successes in 41 fights professionals, two times, it took for vanquished owing to their injuries.
The retador johnson had to accept the first defeat in its fight number 24.
To a few 17000 viewers in the sand berna, klitschko, with a stature of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight on all with his hand left.
But lower johnson, once centimeters, that before the mourning had proclaimed the end of the era klitschko, was esquivando time and again of the shocks of the world champion, so klitschko could not bring decisively to his goal its dangerous diestra.
In general, the passive johnson made a retador, and only tried too little to push through the rounds.
While causing a klitschko with words and gestures, their coups only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxeador, after timo hoffmann in the year 2000, he bore twelve entire rounds with klitschko.
Before the fighting, the retador already had produced some scandal in capital switzerland.

This year after defeated in their defenses of the title to juan carlos gomez, cuba, and in september to chris arreola, of the united states.
In this fight alone received a coup, and i am in very good condition physics, had explained klitschko its rapid return to the ring.
But their dream remains raise all four major securities in his family.
His brother vladimir is world champion of the associations wbo and ibf.
However, the belts belongs to british david haye, after that it destronó in november a nikolai valujev, 2.13 meters stature.
In the summer, haye had canceled a fight against vitali klitschko planned to september.
Supposedly, the company that promociona is planning already the fight against klitschko in the stadium wembley, in london.
The case kunduz

The spd and leftist demand a chancellor explanation.
Hamburg / berlin – after the most recent revelations about the air attack kunduz, the opposition has reproached the minister of defense, karl - theodor zu gutenberg (csu), have fooled with knowledge of cause.

Worlds oníricos
In a state of wide awakedness, some people see images and hear voices that other did not see and heard.
Not only in the case of the mentally ill, and in the drug fade the boundaries between the imagination and reality.
While happens during the dream, all is in order.
When we acostados in our rooms dark with closed eyes, we can entregarnos unfettered a more imaginaciones and creations of the fantasy.
However, who experience states such the dream for your, or seen and heard things that other not see or hear, is seen as the majority of the modern times in the western world as crazy and drug addict, or at least as manic.
But such images and voices not only emerge in the mentally ill or in the drogados.
The blame has our imagination: the same neural processes that enable us to design homes, painting cadres or write novels, sometimes make desdibujen the boundaries between the dream, the madness, and the reality.
The states of conscience alert modified oníricamente may appear in the more diverse ways, in the best the call views, and in the worst, folly.
Though can be distinguish the desencadenantes, and the effects, can be referring to such processes visions of the mystical hildegard von bingen, the experiences psicodélicas of the prophet of the new was carlos castañeda, states of possession chamánica, and the psicosis and hallucinations.
The hallucinations or delusions arise when drugs has been descarrillado the balance of neural of communication in the brain – especially the dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and the acetilcolina – and is perturbada the interaction between various parts of the same.
During a psicosis schizophrenic too often complex and thoughts enloquecidos appear hallucinations.
Already the severity has no power on him
The relationship between madness and dream has taken a philosophers and medical since the time old.
Aristotle viewed as a form of dream in a state of the hallucinations wide awakedness, wilhelm griesinger psychiatry, one of the founding of the modern, constataba in 1861 a "great after the madness state with the states oníricos," to sigmund freud, the dream even was "a psicosis, with all the despropósitos, alocadas formations, and delusions of it."
Is the fall of 2001, when henning t. becomes a figure of cómic.
His body is two dimensions, and shockingly color.
The severity no longer has power about it, is floating around ceiling of the room.
He is a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with alas, with muecas red as blood, deformes, rechinando the teeth.
They are pursuing, the patean with heavy boots, and flameantes, lo showing against the walls, he feels the pain in all the body.
Voices strident and malignant resonate since the walls and radio.
Can no longer bear, the voices that the insult and offended.
Henning t. gets two cable of the stereo, the amarra to form a core of ahorcado, and fixed in a gancho in the ceiling.
Is seeps up in a bocina and puts the noose around the neck.
Obvious.
The string loose.
What you serve lesson!, shout the voices in a chorus le revienta the tímpanos, “ sees a clinic and haz that you curen! "
Now, henning t. is 40 years, and has experienced six psicosis sharp, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause that produced was the lsd.
His diagnosis is psicosis esquizo affective - - paranoid, is also maniaco - depressive, making drugs, against the depression, mania, schizophrenia.
Has learned to live with its disease, since three years ago is married.
In the psicosis have experienced the distress more terrible and deeper desperation, says.
The hallucinations are a cruel reality
Roughly 1% of the population falls sick at least once in the life of schizophrenia; in the psychiatric clinics the is as the second disease more frequent after the depression.
In a psicosis schizophrenic acute, most of the times the affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the interior, and drop in a state of sobreexcitación that can lead to delusions of greatness hallucinations,, in the relationship, or mania persecutoria disorders.
Especially spread the hearing voices: voices dan orders, say or dialogan.
Are also frequent magnifying the hallucinations.
The affected is no longer able to distinguish the important of what it is not, the brain can no longer filter the signs disruptive, the awareness is awash of reactions.
As the dream, also psicosis opens the floodgates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deep layers more of the conscience.
The perception of the reality in the psicosis is focused on the subject, says the medical catedrático thomas fuchs, head of the clinical of psychiatry general the hospital 's university heidelberg.
The schizophrenic at the center of the events, all is a meaning aimed at him.
At the same time enters a passive role, as in a dream, feels overwhelmed by the events and cannot organizing of actively.
This is why the often schizophrenic feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general is not possible to adjust the reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, the shifts, impossible.
Have experienced a alucinación once in the life
On the contrary that in a dream, says fuchs space, "the structure and sensory of reality that is perceived in the psicosis remain in such which principle."
The thoughts and paranoiacs hallucinations is support in reality, the estrangement from the experience has place in the reality.
For the researchers still a puzzle why our brain cabriolas ago.
According to fuchs, the states of exception may lead to any person to lose the provisional contact with the reality of way.
But not all the people develop a psicosis.
It seems there is a genetic willingness to the schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that other determinants factors beyond the genes are also.
Researchers assume that the affected suffer the minimum brain damage.
Suspected that the neural maturity of the brain suffers in a stadium later development, such as a through a mother during pregnancy, explains disease vírica fuchs.
But remains a neural unknown how produce this disruption of the system, also no manifests itself in absolute for many years.
Also the influence of the environment plays an important role – the stress or a traumatic experience can be the detonantes of a psicosis when there is already a willingness precondition.
The same way, drugs alucinógenas can provoke a psicosis, because that interfere in the transmitter system of the brain.
When the brain warms
What is illogical of all this is that the people psicóticas suffer with their hallucinations and take drugs very expensive to rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says the psychology catedrático erich kasten, of lübeck.
The perceive a alucinación as pretty or no depends on often of the point of view.
Kasten collects since ten years ago reports on hallucinations and views and has analyzed the results in the book die irreale welt in unserem kopf (the world irreal in our heads), published last year.
The hallucinations are among the typical symptoms follow the psicosis, but also, surprisingly, many other diseases.
Between them are, together a psíquicos disorders such as the limits of the personality disorder or depressions, often also diseases such as the migraña, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, alzheimer 's, and traumatismos craneoencefálicos.
So surprising and in certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to kasten, composed of memories that are usually found repressed.
Arise when the areas of the brain in which the sensory are hiperactivas or are little processing perceptions cohibidas; when our brain hot, but also when stimulus.
The drugs can bring this state of the same way that the brain damage or a psicosis.
But also the restriction of stimulus, the stress, the mal loves or other states of brain exception.
In jüngeren studien gab bis zu einem drittel der befragten an, mindestens einmal im leben eine halluzination erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, sarah k. had 16 years, living in a small mecklenburg city - - pomerania western and acudía a un college of secondary school.
Current a girl.
If not for these images, and the voices.
Sometimes, during the recreo, that a child clumsy with long and hair dark le heads the word.
When it le answer, the other children the look soprendidos; no one, a part of it, hey or is the child.
Believe that the timid is a ensoñadora a little girl strange, but sarah k. knows that he is dreaming.
Is aroused and ve and hears a that child, the same way that sees and hey a girl granted in the bank of side.
Can feel even its presence, at least some instantes.
Is a sense, likes the child.
Sometimes wonders if is crazy.
Also knows that the child and the rest of views are not real and disappear.
By the evening, the appearances are alarming.
The views are often a burden.
When it is in a class times cannot continue to the lesson because the professor – their eyes and ears – is pursued a colleague new, while for the rest explains visible and audible the equations mathematics.
By the evening, the appearances are alarming.
While expected in the dark room to the dream, which many times comes sooner and is scant, no knows distinguish if is kindled or dreaming, if the images that is, the muecas or the girl with courts bleeding in arms and legs, frente appear to their eyes open or closed.
Dejadme in peace, they shouts to the figures.
A their parents and friends no has done nothing, creerían that is crazy.
Autumn of 2009, sarah k. is hoy20 years.
Approved the last year selectividad and live with her bridegroom.
A year ago that hallucinations have disappeared.
Since has entered a through internet contact with the psychologist kasten, knows that he is crazy.
The madness is also an art by desperation.
According to kasten, when a person is isolated socially or suffers a stimulus, it is very likely that restriction, after a time to start have hallucinations.
I believe that the brain is desocupado yse charged the same sought entertainment.
Sarah k., daughter only, had of small fear of the other children, and often played alone.
Their hallucinations began when, with 13 years, he learned that the man al that calls papá from that has use of the reason is not his biological father.
Because the hallucinations visual and acústicas are active in the same areas of the brain that also processing impressions real and ruidos, affected as sarah k. it is difficult to distinguish between views and reality. “ every experience, "says kasten, “ has place in the brain, the reality is projected there.
The hallucinations are equally images that the brain produce, by this seem so real. "
Kasten also classifies the night comics fantasies as a form of alucinación.
The hallucinations healthy people are not in the fundamental of a psicosis sharp differ.
On the contrary that the schizophrenic, people psíquicamente healthier, are able to recognize their views as unrealistic.
Kasten recommends by this a their patients appreciate its hallucinations as a special ability.
Situation boundary between dream and alucinación
In this world too focused on the conscious, the imaginary experiences often by the general patologizarse, says michael schmidt - degenhard, catedrático in heidelberg and medical chief of the hospital 's clinical of psychiatry and psychotherapy florence nightingale - - krankenhauses in düsseldorf.
A psicosis is a disease and painful but that also something positive and creative – the frenzy is an art of despair.
Schmidt - degenhard has investigate the so - called special oneirismo, a form of conscience, who are perceived as if it were a dream.
The hallucinations oníricas are almost dreams very complex and detailed that the person who the experience considers real and later cannot indistinguishable from be awake.
The states aware oníricos arise in extreme situations associated to a trauma or a disease, for example in patients with polirradiculoneuropatía, that experience a motor paralysis are fully aware. die eib vollem bewusstsein eine motorische lähmung erleben.
According to schmidt - degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of self or of the total world due to a inability motor and permanent, that replaces a real situation very dangerous for a world own and imaginary that is decoupled of reality.
A way of boundary between dream and alucinación situation.
As it is not possible overcome a situation in reality, produce a change of world, although the real situation remains in the imagination.
A form of intensive sense and interpretation to a situation unbearable itself that our own capacity of creation allows us hundirnos in the nothing of the loss of conscience.
All is real, even later in memory
The historian of art also peter cornelius claussen, of zurich, describe their experiences oníricas in his book herzenwechsel as a bailout of the soul action.
Had 49 years, when his conscience embarked on travel of several days after a operation of safety valves heart with transplant of heart including, while his body was doomed to immobility in the station of intensive care.
Claussen pushed in a world created by the same and visited places strangers to other times: was postrado in his bed, a man mayor a board of a sanatorio in a train, a robot velaba by its health.
Was in the high middle ages, surrounded by noble that elicited narcotics from blood.
A greek on a moto what kidnapped in their country of origin, did surf on their bed of hospital in alpine with snow firn korean and met with a mafia.
The da all in these facts imaginary, all is real, even later in the memories.
To claussen, these travel interioresson fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is a different state, describe their experience.
On the contrary, the memories of the mentally travel are clear, many years later, vastly more, even in the details irrelevant.
Even more clear and intensive than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience diluyen the horizon of the rest of our experiences daily, adds the psychiatrist schmidt - degenhard.
Finally, the oneirismo, the psicosis, hallucinations and consumption of estupefacientes show the fragile that is the interior reproduction of reality abroad, even when we despiertos.
Each modification of the state of conscience, resume the psychologist kasten, "can lead to a misrepresentation of what we call reality."
A experience that, on the other hand, can be fully enrichment.

The 100% of holding happen to be also in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – editor hubert gross sees his company in the hands of their children in the future.
The two children become heirs with 27 years and have the strong willingness to enter the company, confirmed 69 cheap, of years, a spiegel.
The details have been managed as caution.
The following questions is if participate active in the company.
Also, if they are able to this.
One cannot put under 7,500 to their children, if they are not sufficiently skilled workers for this.
This would end up with the children, and also with the company.
Cheap know the thursday that to be withdrawn from january of the presidency of the board, and that paul - bernhard kallen has been appointed his successor.
This member of the family kallen, is 52 since 1999 member of the direction of cheap.
In a start was responsible for the technology.

The appointment of kallen serves also, "to save the differences of 10, 15 years," according to cheap.
The 100% of holding happen to be also in the hands of the family.
With the look set about the cases schickedanz family, and schaeffle gross demonstrated that the firms are not a salvo the decline: "this has always affected families leave contagiar search for the efforts of capital, which have misjudged and thought that could climb as well as the largest player.
This has never been my strategy.
I have never had "delusions of greatness," says cheap.
I do not see as a political preceptor of this country, as it was springer, and, too, want to play with the “ time "in the world; these league business have become too big.
The promise of fonpeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look the mail, without possibility even some kind of deputy or navigate the network.
Enjoyed his five minutes fame in the us when the time magazine named one of the products of the year.
See it by the street is more difficult, the truth, but the may be interesting idea, especially for young.
Unlike the smartphones, peek has a very low price, and a quota monthly very low, less than half of what you pay, for example, by the plan of iphone data.
Seen the the company has brought two devices new success: one solely thought to twitter, the other with a free service of data for life a change of paying six times more for the peek.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday in the event web, is the european version of invention and its third encarnaciónn.
Is equally limited that the us contrapartida, but comes with a surprise.
The price maintenance monthly, of a 12 euros per month, including the roaming across europe.
Travelers with a smartphones already know what is have to give up the data when crosses the border, or seek desperately a cafetería with wifi (or a connection of fon) to power consult email.
The idea of a roaming a fixed price is incredibly attractive and time ago that would have to be in place.
Yes, some operadoras have special agreements and plans to trip, but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to entenderlas and a good spectacles to read the letter small.
The repeated stresses of orejas of the european commission to achieve tariffs of roaming affordable for all of europe have barely a perceptible effect.
Outside the country of origin there is fear to use the data, and with good reason.
That a aparatito as fonpeek (no ceases to be curious carrying the name of fon when lacks wifi) has this kind of tariffs to say that traders begin to think differently and study different proposals with the that write down its network of data.
Kindle is another good example, including the trafficking of the drop of books and other consultations in internet.
Without contracts, and gaitas.
It is a device attached and pay for this by buy, no month a month.
And this is what i hope to see some day with fonpeek, a choice of buying with access for life as the us that peek already has.
Not because it to buy.
I look at my email in the telephone, thanks.
I hope because i believe that it is a more just model to the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
The color of michelle fetish
The yellow is, indeed, the us tone preferred of the first lady.
If already turned out to the inauguration of barack obama, as president of the us with a dress and a shelter of this color, has chosen the same to acompañarle in, without doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the gathering in oslo the nobel peace prize.
Michelle obama has led a model, very similar in the two occasions: in addition to being a similar - yellow verdoso with brilliant reflexes - color, the two times the dress componía of three pieces - dress, jacket and shelter of the same question - -, and adornaba with a great bordado or collar.
Both is so that in a first glance seemed to that the first lady of the us still the trail of the princess of asturias and had opted for repeat vestaurio.
But the question in the that are established the two suits the very different ago.
If for the inauguration of all un fit fat, in oslo is a privatization with estampado.
The green supplements have also varied: shoes of middle tacón the again, and a similar model, but in golden, now.
And equally different is the forced: a collected on this occasion, melena loose the previous.
The 75% of the madres workers has had problems by their motherhood labor
The discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, especially for women in the youngest generations that want to be mothers.
So reveals the study fertility 'and labor trajectory of women in spain', produced by the csic in collaboration with the institute of women.
The survey conducted between 9.737 women of 15 to 75 years leaves no doubt about: the 75% of mothers workers has seen limited labor opportunities in the field owing to the motherhood.
The study aims that there are many differences in the beginning of the norm in and the number of children, in terms of whether or not work, and the type of work that develop.
The that does not have a activity outside the home, work part - time, or have a work no stable, begin before the norm in couple, adelantan the first motherhood, and have more children.
By contrast, women with stable, mainly employment in the public sector, delay the norm, and the motherhood, and have less offspring.
"of between 35 women and 49 years with work fixed have prime son, media, 3.7 after years of initiating the norm, a figure that increases a 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time of its vital getting trajectory, what has led to postpone the union and the arrival of the children.
Moreover, the kind of work played holds much influence on the maternity though less about the timetable the pairing ", explains the research of the csic margarita delgado.
The level of is another studies of the factors that difference the age of women to marry and al have the first scion.
According to the survey, the greater is the education level, the greater the age to the marrying and a that have the first child.
The difference is also keeps between women of the same generation.
For example, in the group of between 35 and 49 years, that have studies elementary and higher have been mothers for the first time to the 25,1 and 32,1 media, respectively.
"is established and other division between women in terms of its level of studies.
While the that have studies elementary marrying and have their first child before get a stable, the work of media or higher levels invest this sequence and give priority to the development of a stable as a precondition al marriage, and a job the arrival of a "son, quipped delgado.

It does not in the géneros predictable, and temibles (semblance biográfica, life and labor), but looking for something like the core of ignición of character creator.
The trip has its excitaciones and vicent no saves sustos or iluminaciones.
In addition to a exquisite pleasure, the book is a touching invitation to ways and relecturas.

Aggression cowardly
The last week, my mother of a few 70 years of age paseaba by our neighborhood in the county of fuenlabrada when a group of young between 15 and 18 years spent along a it, and to our dog, a copy of race race, rescued of the perrera and with no more than six kilograms of peso, and without mediate word, propinaron two kicked that left the dog malherido.
Our indignation is major because no, we find fun in a free aggression to a animal small and helpless, indeed, was tied themselves.
Add to this the sofoco provoked a a lady that paseaba quietly and that, when lashed to these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, as a energúmeno that attacked a un animal, it is able to do with a woman, a child, an elderly or, ultimately, with whatever weaker than himself.
The event occurred to the five of the late of a tuesday any by a shantytown traditionally alone.
The dog was weeping all the day.
Indeed, we put a denunciation in a protestor close that dudamos that serves much and not to generate sensibilities, only clarify that cowardly were spanish murderers.
The us has led to denounce this fact indignation.
Not understand that is happening among young people to consider funny maltratar free to an animal helpless that a us da love, company and friendship.
We do not know where have been good education and respect for animals and to the people.
Michelin and fesvial together by the use of helmet
The manufacturer of tires michelin, with the spanish collaboration of the foundation for the security street (fesvial), has set in motion a campaign to promote the use of the helmet, mainly among the younger, reported motorist both entities today.
This initiative seeks to concienciar on the importance of using the helmet, because that is the only element of protection able to avoid the head injuries, or even, the death in the case of an accident while rounds in motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of its commitment to the security road, that "is beyond designing and making every day safer products" and said that also contributes to this goal by other actions of character pedagogical and informational.
This new campaign of promoting use of helmet in the motorbike, under the slogan 'to be or not to be', will have a first phase in which allocated cartels in more than 500 anti - motocicletas, with the goal of achieving the highest diffusion.
To complete, michelin stressed that security street "is a constant concern" to the company, for that to be a manufacturer of tires to two wheels vehicles, one of its main fines is to develop a increasingly insurance products.
Rising commercial sale of light
Almost two years after, the commercial market of vehicles light begins to see something of light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9.425 units matricularon in november in spain represent a spike of the 12,6% to 2008, and what is more important, assume the first increase after 22 months consecutive employers declines, according to the numbers of manufacturers anfac and sellers ganvam.
The good, not osbtante, to put in fact quarantined for the reference with the that becomes the comparison - - particularly bad november 2008 - - was, with a decline 60% over the previous year.
Consequence is that, despite the support of the last month, the matriculaciones accumulated in these 11 months are a 40% below the previous exercise.
Since january have sold 95.853 added all vehicles that comprise the shelf units of sastre of trade light: derived from turismos, pick up, furgonetas, furgones light and trucks / chasis light.
Similarly, the storm clouds have not gone away that more affect their demand, as though are also acquired by individuals, most of the purchases are conducted by the small and medium sized firms, that pay in almost 100% of the cases through external financing.
So a restrictions that assumes the tap closed of bank lending, one must add other factors such as the increase in the levels of unemployment, or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
To this and a difference picture of the turismos, little have served the aid to the purchase of 2000e.
A them can acogerse, as well as the particular, the autonomous and the sme that will acquire a slight of trade to 3.5 tons with a level of co2 emissions that no more than 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been testimonial.
Yesterday same, since ganvam returned to remember the need to spend a special attention by part of the administration to these vehicles, and also to the industrial (trucks, and buses).
The association of sellers predicts a 2010 similar the year that has just, to the that estimated a decline in the sales (turismos and 4x4) of a 19%.
The aid to the frenada mandatory emergency is already
As happened with the antibloqueo brakes abs, and happen to the control of stability esp, the systems of aid to the emergency frenada will have to be a compulsory element in the european cars.
Indeed, because they are in all the turismos vehicles and new light commercial enrolment, while for the rest is fixed a period of lack until the end of february 2011.
The extent, imposed by the european union, has meant to increase the protection of pedestrians their way to work, though, may also help avoid many collision of reach.
The assistant to the emergency frenada that it is to increase the pressure on the brakes in case of a urgency, that the system detects by the pisotón da the driver.
But this is not always maintains that pressure to the final.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of bosch, the third part of the components to car drivers involved in a no accident had come to the brakes stepped before the collision and half of them not seized the whole force.
To 1.1 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in exchange, requires al frenada, reducing the distance system that employs the car in stop.
According to a study of the eu itself, if all the cars were equipped with this type of elements, could avoid the year until 1.1 accidents mortal in which are involved pedestrians.
The reduction will be even greater - is estimated that would be avoided one of every four sinister with damage a smart people - - when popularicen so - called system of frenada of emergency.
In this case, the vehicle equipped with a system that (through a radar or a house) detects the obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to act slightly on the brakes.
If the conductor react, it would help increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In case no reacts, and although the collision maximum is inevitable, the device holds the effort to the disincentive to minimize the damage.
General motors sets back to january the plan to opel
While the opel plant workers in figueruelas (zaragoza) have been because avisados by nick reilly, the new president of general motors (gm) europe, that the production of new meriva begin in the first week of april - the day 8 probably - reports javier ortega, the us manufacturer warns that is a need more time to conclude the recovery plan for opel.
What purports to nick reilly, the new president of gm europe, is that every one of the plan points has been previously consensuado for the part affected.
And this can make the final document that will be put to the first workers and after the governments of the countries in which there are factories, to delay until the beginning of 2010.
Instead, from gm ensures that a decision about the sale of saab should take in the coming days.
To this is not strange that the swedish government has increased the pressure on the manufacturer us to take a decision as before.
Gm admits have contact with some new possible buyers.
One of them could be geely, which also aspires to acquire volvo, but claims force the option of the dutch manufacturer of cars sports skyper, that is backed by the russian converg group.
In case of that had not agree with none of them, gm could sell some of saab assets baic china.
Remains the decision to close saab to the end of the year if no sells.
Al volante of porsche boxster spyder
For desarrolar its last, and face jewel, engineers of porsche took the boxster s as base and ensured that adelgazase nothing less than 80 kilograms, which has left the báscula in only 1.275 kilograms.
This les led to do, in the first place, of the ceiling automatic that has been suplido by one of lona with accionamiento manual, so that save 21 kilograms; employing doors aluminum as the gt3, 'fall' other 15; draining the climatizador, 13; reducing the provision of 64 fuel a 54 litros, won 7 kilograms more; staging bacquets sports other 12 and with the llantas slight 19 inches, five.
Finally, giving up the system of audio cdr - 30 provided other six kilograms and changing the tiradores of the remaining doors by a question, the pound.
Although also offers the change pdk of double embrague, the test of on a unity with the box manual of six speed, mainly by roads secondary california, in tranches of mountain with trazados really revirados
Its behavior can only be described as intachable.
The reduction of peso does not mean that the car no pise the asfalto confidently.
Rather, all the opposite: the time that no testábamos such a small and slight model that, once, transmitiese so much security in the way to curve, even a high - speed.
A small athlete, capable of heat its muscles is in a short march during the time needed, until le esprinte, that stopped, that ordenemos to recover and return to eke out its motor...
What le ask. thanks to his leadership, as comunicativa as accurate, what indiquemos with our hands in the volante is what the car will.
And it will do with a precisely surgical.
Sound of motor a will
The sound of its v6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the boxster s) is very achieved and can be leverage with the option 'sport' and through a system that alters the bramido of the motor, already estrenado previously in the panamera.
The ability of acceleration is brutal, whether from perched or in recoveries.
The default are firm, but no harsh or uneasy.
The asfalto that atravesamos with the boxster roads spyder was punished, but the car digirió the bumpy ride.
The aid electronic only made an act of presence in all the trip; and that in any of the curves find the dawn and gravilla ice cap, already well into the morning.
Ultimately, a car, ultraligero, the more fun lead that one can in the market, and that is something more than a simple amending the boxster s.
The car will be the sale in february 2010, with a price of 70.831 euros.

Intimately of karl lagerfeld, image of the line bogeyman cocoon and 'starlette' occasional of the parades of the 'maison', the singer prodiga its face of malota with as much contumacia as their bolsos chanel.

Teletovic already started to excel as the best of their team with 13 points, although the 'less six' of valuation of splitter already made presage that this was not to be the best night of brazilian.
But the party, despite being track the clock, was not determined, much less and the macabeos wanted to remind the vitorianos that in its field no wins anyone, and with 'the hand of elías' tightening achieved into in the party.
Eidson and pnini contributed decisively to the yellow '' gave around the luminoso (50 - 49).
More inconvenient
The ivanovic, wounded but much less dead, needed spinning a couple of stake with acierto to pick up, and air in these the machine came of mirza teletovic, that with three triple almost consecutive and the help of english and ribas returned tag a reassuring income (54 - 67), that they gained tweaked, the local at the end of the third quarter (57 - 67).
The alaveses came to be held the skin in the last partial and english and st. emeterio (60 - 75) because warned that were not stop that no one will quitara what had been deserved for the first 30 minutes.
However, pnini and eidson, the best of their team are not resignaron and tried to maintain with life to his team from the line of three points (70 - 77).
Despite this, and with splitter eliminated by failings, of ivanovic are not precipitaron, advocated well, and even if the israelis closer in the minute final (80 - 85), the party had owner, and the victory escapaba tel aviv for the first in the season.
The injuries make dar battle al unicaja
The unicaja lost miserably in greece to the olympiacos and gave liderato of the group b of the euroliga, in a party marked by the low of the cajistas, especially in the game interior (freeland, lima, and archibald), which provided the greek victory.
The team malagueño are not asustó for the environment of the flag of peace and friendship and by the entity of europe 's rival, perhaps the most powerful and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed only dream of a andaluces. an aggressive defense and three triple consecutive, two of the base omar cook and one of guillem rubio, dazzled the local 12 - 18, minute 9.
The olympiacos was struck by the intensity of the unicaja, although the arsenal of the local in the game interior to bourousis, vujcic and schortsanitis, gave around the tag 22 - 20, minute 13, moment in a action, conato of fight, between the two american bases beverley and williams, assumed the disqualifying of both players.
