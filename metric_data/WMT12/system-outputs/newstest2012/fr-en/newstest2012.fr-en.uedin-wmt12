Parliament has not ratified the amendment to the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament refused, in the framework of an amendment to the criminal law, the cancellation of the paragraph on the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
MPs have refused in second reading of the draft amendment reducing sentences for economic crimes, which could open the door to freedom for the ex-Première Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to seven years in prison for having reached an agreement in principle disadvantageous with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The ruling is not final and the court must rule on the appeal of the convicted in December.
Tymosenko described the judgment of political revenge of the regime and has led to a process of suspicion of bias of the court to the west.
The project to cancel the paragraph 365 of criminal law, on the basis of which the ex-Premère Minister was sentenced, was signed by 147 Members.
Would have required 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan victory in
The release or Libyan rebellion has already its defeated.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to determine the winners.
As is customary in the region, the victors in the elections are the Islamists, but is it moderates and radicals.
The Interim National Council declared the customary law of Sharia law and we already know what it is.
Libya is a country without a crime as a flight is cut out.
Women can forget the emancipation, the disrespectful potential of faith are punishable by the death penalty...
This is the Koran which will unite in place of the personality of the dictator society composed of tribes opposed.
In Libya is such an order as we cannot represent him and as we would surely not.
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best and probably would not be beneficial for the Libya.
It is particularly surprising that the Islamic warriors have accepted assistance with recognition of dogs infidels.
The only excuse is that this is not a américian general who led the NATO bombing but Allah they celebrated the magnitude for each attack.
When it comes to seek the victors in Libya, the West does not
We have participated in the shooting, served Islam and our poilitiques turned away from the dictator as a political ally without brings no benefit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not occupying militarily Libya.
There is no problem for the premises to be rid of the "crusaders".
Do that without tenure, oil companies will have access to the black gold libyien.
Perhaps not as much and the West will eventually boast desintéressée protection of human rights.
If we prevent these followers of Sharia law.

Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They have created a human shield
Hundreds of students graduate schools have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support this gesture the nuclear programme of their countries face a possible Israeli attack.
The students began to pray at noon at the site and then wished the death of the EU and Israel.
Hundreds of students from the universities of Isfahan have created a human shield Tuesday around the Isfahan nuclear technology centre which is processed uranium.
They have openly expressed that they would defend the nuclear program of their countries, risking their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found in its latest information that Iran has not ceased to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
It reported in Israel of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began to pray at noon at the site and then wished the death of the EU and Israel.

Feeding a child obese: Does not include breakfast and takes deli for lunch
More than a third of children ages 9 to 13 have problems of overweight, 9% of écoliersont weight above average and 5% are obese.
As the current research obese children come from families who have unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important the environment in which human beings and models that surround them.
On the tables of obese children for example deli 50% more often than in the families of children with normal weight.
19% of obese had french fries for dinner, according to the survey conducted with an awareness "obesity is not a chance"
In the families of small large sport is also not a habit, which is now the case of most kids today - only 15 per cent said that at least once a week, the parents found time for the active movement.
On 900 children
The survey was conducted during the last school year and participated 900 students of primary schools in the Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of "obesity is not a coincidence," sustained action by the General Insurance and Unilever.
 Since the beginning of more than 12,000 students from sixth to third who have enrolled in the project.
One of the factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of children are overweight or obese, is the lack of adequate food and not enough exercise.
"Only half of the children interviewed indicated, for instance, eat five times a day small déjeuner-en cases - lunch - goûter- dinner, which is a basic principles of good food," said one of the results of the investigation.
Without breakfast and dinner deli
Experts drew attention to the fact that in order to have a healthy development it takes a few basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of the families of students eat at the same time.
In the majority of families each eats breakfast alone.
And the worst that has been identified is only a tenth of the population does not just for breakfast.
Breakfast is the basis of a good daily diet.
The survey showed that the families of the obese children it consumes more often unhealthy fried.
Almost every student - not to mention the weight - drink each day of sugary drinks (70%).
More than 40% of children questioned the sport regularly but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepares you your diet
Another part of the investigation has allowed children selected (204 172 boys and girls of 13 schools) to prepare its own food from options, according to their own and their personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 years are far away, in terms of a healthy diet, the ideal".
Among their favourite meals there are a lot of cakes, meat and sweets.
"The most alarming is such a strong preference for sugary soft drinks," is indicated in the survey results.
For lunch the pasta who took the first place just before the white meat.
The children were not wanted to starch and preference for fish and vegetables was very low.
Course on health
The survey also found that children are ready to change their habits when they receive information ad hoc.
"During a control group of participants in the study who had completed the questionnaire after the session awareness" Obesity is no accident, "it was assité a definite desire to move towards a healthy diet," said the results of the investigation.
The most prominent was, for example as regards the sugary soft drinks because children have begun to give preference to drinking water.
Children are most often checked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as a main dish and reduce the sweet dishes and "knedliky" (Czech spécialté pellets of flour bread or potatoes).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In a presentation on how to learn for the designers, I am a little bit angry because there were many from the beginning.
I did not think about what would happen afterwards.
The presentations of three professionals of the specialty clothing characters and a seminar on what is going on.
And it will be worse.
As we approach the final exams and we expect practical exercises and information.
And even when there are courses on Saturdays and Sundays it is truly "packed".
This time we have with the director Alenka (over there is no boy) Treaty of how to rob the woman who has no standard measurements.
And women of this type is the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a body of boy, without particular curve, another overweight.
The designer should know how optically ammenuiser arms wide, extending a neck or add curves.
We arrived to emphasise nicely the character and also not to dress too showy types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and hips and a slim.
For example, there is a difference between the waist and hips in such a way that skirts or pants are not at all, this is the time to do it.
And you will not regret it because the clothing that is impeccably is invaluable.
In a skirt on extent you will feel much better than in the slips permanently, and is not the belt and so on.
For those who have a masculine appearance can afford a clothing style Tucker, with pieces of fabric sewn, or even embroidery.
Of course, there are many examples of shapes and I am glad that I have all week to sort through all the information received.
But I also fear that what I have to do at home there too.
Each student received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We must take into account the present appearance, the type of mode of personality, and his appearance.
I will have to "pay" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know of the campaign the Victoria's Secret.
At the back of my mind, I am pleased, because it is better than dressed Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, which took almost a hundred kilos lately (don't take my statement, please, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut and sew from magazines or look on the internet, print and graphics.
The Moodboard, as they say in the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with the graphic design.
Also reflect on the graph of the styling is also important.
The designer dresses and did not only the physical but creates productive pages in magazines (on specific products trends for purses, coats, etc.).
Mario known, stylist and designer, spoke to all of this.
But, until Sunday.
The designer must have a general vision
Three guests of the specialty gave a diverse aspect to the meeting Saturday filled with information on the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion designer and Ben Renc, photographer of fashion.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion, and the stylist should know.
And a talented designer is working with a single dress differently.
The variability is for this example.
For example, this trench coats that must be worn with a classic jeans and a T-shirt as a light jacket, but it can also clothe the naked body, with pumps and a picture as a dress.
Or it can trace the sleeves or the neck and immediately have a new look.
"Play with it," he said.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For the work you need to know the rules well."
"You can then begin to break," said Jakub.
Finally, I understand why it is trying to learn the rules, what to do with, what, why, while in fashion magazines are sometimes seen something else.
No statement on the fashion parades.
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the stylist should have much more variants of clothing that those who are photographed.
This is to say that for fashion story that will have a dozen pages (a dozen models) I have to be ready to "retailler" at least a fortnight.
And also, clothing and its combination with other elements are completely differently than in reality.
We must reckon with it during a creation of a model.
The fact that the image and style are sometimes half the success we had been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna, who is not a great singer, but its image and marketing has become a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of services of designers remains cautious.
And the familiar faces the sometimes see as unnecessary (it is enough that I know something, but what I sound is second).
And if someone gets a styling on our part, then we must rely on the fact that he dictates with a high probability a completely different size (smaller) than he has in reality.
We still have to navigate on Google and ensure if the news of boulevard of the celebrity in question, if she has lost weight and grown etc...
Honza and Mario asked us Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the stylist to move in fashion and assemble models.
It must communicate with the people he dresses and thus it is important to be a good psychologist.
Know guess people, not to flatter, retain his opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort out his cabinet and the complete new elements you can't throw everything and say," My God horror. "
"You will find a few cases that you find attractive and conseillerez with what you wear them," said Mario.
He has shown us what that must contain the so-called "placovka" or bag of stylist.
This is the one you hang around the waist and you have on you for everything you need.
In addition to the things clearly defined as scissors, rolls for dépilation or pins to nurse, there is also the nylon yarn (as the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which it closes a garment in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of bar are not utlisables because they could damage the garment) or a sewing kit.
For that we were not only people who listen but who have tried something practical way they taught us how ressemeller properly shoes.
And during the photo opportunity in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could deteriorate, especially outdoors.
And so we glued and stuck.
We did not have the right to receive the scissors to not inadvertently hurt.
It is therefore truly skills.
Mario made me happy when I congratulated for my creation.
The jurisdiction of which I am rule is not for my girlfriend.
This is only a short summary of what we have learned during the second weekend of course
I began to understand that make the styling a profession is not a walk in a garden of roses, everyone says what he wants.
The need for speed The Run is raced across America.
Revision,
Originally a race without problem is due to a series of errors stupid people who have nothing to do with a routine morning shift at work.
It fills up to a certain extent the ambition of everyone but it is no good if nobody wants to do something more.
The new party subtitled The Run produced great expectations before his release.
He promised to take a new direction with the Need for Speed racing series already old and out some sort of game from jouables parties who are not only with points.
We were curious how will be the passages penned during which the main hero out of his car and does what he wants.
As it is already in the series NTS, the result is completely different than what atttendait.
This is potentially racing games arcades, but the overall downward to cause unnecessary mistakes that already exist for several years.
They are not really mistakes, but rather an expression of idleness incomprehensible by developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are caught up in the adventure whose main hero Jack has emotional problems and to resolve them is to participate in illegal racing across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast to San Francisco and your mission is to be the first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten steps and then in more than 50 races.
The result is that each race is on a different route and the steps in different environments that are quite far from each other and are interesting.
The player did not feel a moment that the game is proposing something similar.
Some environments are also quite nice, even if the technical level chart is the same type as the earlier rounds.
This is not the end of the world. "
But driving through the desert in autumn landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very pleasant visually.
The tests are increasingly from time to time with a non-standard element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that you significantly reduced visibility.
Then in the mountains, you have to pay attention to what an avalanche do not fall over.
However the various races are well laid one behind the other.
It has only a small number, but it is enough.
There are moments you strive to exceed the number requested opponents (as in a classic race), then you will be running against the clock (classic duel with the stopwatch) and then still awaits you another duel with an adversary.
From time to time you also have the police entering the game and trying to make the situation difficult.
The novelty is the outside the vehicle.
It is, rather, una interactive event when most of the time Jack fled to someone and you must help him banging on the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type that what you wait (to be concrete, there are only three).
The result is this because this is not likely to hamper and, in the context described above, in the elements that make up the game.
The pattern of conduct is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that currently there is nothing extraordinary, but we cannot say that this is negative.
With regard to the realistic simulation you will have to go elsewhere.
But while we can find better in the conccurrence the pattern of conduct goes very well with the type of design of races.
So everything is ok.
The problems began to emerge after a certain period of time.
Has the diffférence model of conduct, the collisions has not yet been finalized.
We do not expect this game a complicated and collisions, but when you do not, in a collision with any object, any idea how is your car, so this is not completely right.
During the tight overruns sometimes you touch each other slightly but otherwise your car share in crazy acrobatics.
Or is in tatters.
Thanks to the system of recovery that is not really a problem but it really annoys you.
The recovery is so that when you have broken the figure or you are out in the stage the game takes you back to the time of the last point on the route.
But you do just that 5 reboots.
When you have used the 5 reboots you must start the game from the beginning.
It is no longer a tool, if something is not done properly, that old adage that you can really count.
Sometimes the reboots did not help and we must find a solution by remémorrant memory piece of route.
The major fault of this game is that the same actions are in the same places.
For example, there are some turns that it must pass a certain way if it does not.
Otherwise you encounter on a given location of vehicles "civilians" always in the same way that you come first, fifth, 5 seconds ahead or a minute late.
The angry that are the situations when you see the adversary easily switch between two oncoming cars and when you arrive, you, you must be put aside and conturner or brake.
It is if you go to him because it is "calculated" in such a way as to the situation there always comes close to your nose.
Opponents also have other benefits.
During the time of the game, you, you arrive in some places, again regardless of the time, and you always have the same opponent in front of you at the same location.
This irritated the most at the end of the game when you go on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The opponent needs to go before you.
When it comes to you it obstructs the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you enter into a number of times.
It is understandable that the aim of the game is to do something exciting and full of adrédaline, but it is clear that you bored quickly.
And it is a pity, because through a pattern of conduct simple play is interesting and places with both of action that you do not have the time to follow everything that happens.
And it is the same whether it is because of the concept of 50 routes unique, that the next races is such that there was no chance of bored or something else.
The original idea was to change the car during the race.
You must pay attention to the gas pumps on the routes because you can change their car, however, most of the time that you need.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, the big-engined American highways straight and the super sports cars to exotic garb on highly technical, for example on the winding roads in the mountains.
And the mode of challenges, which are races in particular places that you know the adventure, goes very well with the main diet of history.
You are not just medals but also points to add to your profile that is common to the challenges and the adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, various objects are beginning to unlock:
It connects online with the Autolog which among others compare your results with those of other players and you have other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult to understand the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You have your car in the subway tunnel (it is) where you drive in the dark on tracks (it looks like).
Your speedometer tells you between 150 and 200 km / hour (in principle) and behind you is a subway train that sends you the car directly to scrap.
In the preparation we had a discussion for a few days to see if someone actually reflected in the creation of this game or if we really take us for fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the video portion is generally pleasant and in some cases really cool.
The problem is that in more extreme situations, imaging is not the level and in some cases so tragic.
This is especially accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid imagery has more to nothing.
The audio portion is good and the track is the choice.
In order to appeal to the greatest number and particularly to the young audience a new soundtrack was created in the style "I mix everything ', but it can be expected that nobody will buy the stake for music.
Overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is really confused.
If the game had not these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that this is the best production of NTS in recent years.
But this game gives the impression of not be finished.
The fun is really well but prepare you to ensure that the mistakes you type in the eye with the force of a reflector of airfield.

Vicenova, Ambassador near the EU:
The Czechs behave as négativistes and Euro-sceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has radically removed the balance between the institutions'
"I was not expecting a war as hard."
"This will be 5.6 years before the situation is calm and that all players are accustomed to their new role," thus Miléna Vicenova began his presentation at the Faculty of Law the Czech ambassador near the European Union.
When she was able to describe the various EU bodies and their relations so understandable and visible, to the point that a large number of speakers at the Faculty of Law, Charles University might envy, it revealed how she takes her motto "understandable and openly about Europe" very seriously.
Madam Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning, echoed the criticism that it is bland, that sit behind a desk, he cannot rempplir no mission and I must say that it has cut the blows to everyone because it takes its role to perfection."
"This is a man who listens to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction of Europe."
She explained the new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and the defence policy within the framework of an answer to the question: "Who is who in the European Union?" "How do I call telephone number?", as an important step towards the uniqueness and greater visibility of the policy of the EU response to states, such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban our syrecky (cooked cheese that feels very strong)
Madam Vicenova has also refers to the agenda that has lived, lives and live in a time near the European Council.
She described the Czech Presidency of two years of success.
The Czechs have solved the financial crisis, the gas crisis or have organized a summit for an Eastern Partnership.
She described the fall of the Government of very negative and has damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation to the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of Ambassador, "activity reached its full" not only for the presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to resolve even now.
It must also approve the new budget septimal of the Union becomes very complicated due to the current economic situation.
As it would appear that the budget will be thin and economies, which branch will take priority, which countries will be helped the most, the least, everything has to be solved in the framework of future negotiations.
Madam Ambassador recalled its slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For a Europe that is understandable."
"I really don't like the abbreviations, foreign words, the jargon that nobody understands.
As the citizen must understand that it is true that in Brussels no pickles round or twisted, bananas or very large, although nobody has prohibited syrecky. "
It wants to make better use of the environment of the EU and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe we
According to Ambassador Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics and people who do not see things that in their more negative than positive.
In addition it is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault is that several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and a lack of support by the Czech part.
In addition to a Czech presidency to success she then underlined the strength and the cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when it comes to me the Poles, the Magyar, the Slovak, the French said to me: 'Wow, what you do there, that is still the Visegrad group?" And he is not happy at all. "
According to Mrs Vicenova, in the near future that are new rules harsh fiscal policy for member countries.
This is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not at different speeds, which prevails rather than a "new European Federation."
"We have countries in the euro zone and other outside of the area."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the Institute of enhanced cooperation."
First it was said that cooperation among the countries that want it and those who do not wish to remain in their corner. "
"There will be a lot of institutes of this type, and there will be a two-speed Europe really," expects Madam Vicenova.
From this point of view it was also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye determine the foundation on which all the themes that have an impact on the EU must be discussed between all members of the EU and not just a of the eurozone.
Story of a brand:
The innovative IBM begins the second century of his existence
If someone had to look the word that is closer to the IBM strategy, the closest would be "the long term."
For a wider audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm perceived as very current and since its inception it has passed 100 years.
The basis of the long-term strategy was thrown by the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left the slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved if people are willing to consider.
Its slogan "PENSE '!" Became the footprint around which will develop the life of a giant future (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
It was the basis of the culture of the company soignement developed by Watson.
For we IBM means long-term thinking of continuous movements headed toward the future.
IBM has survived a hundred years thanks to the fact that she was always faithful to its core values and yet has not been afraid to change all around it.
This enabled us during our first century of transforming technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will achieve even more "délaré for the anniversary, the current head of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A system prepared
Watson, in the 1930s, began to take care of its employees as Bata in the Czech Republic - people of IBM was the only one of the first U.S. employees to take paid vacations, an employer-paid insurance more a uniform of employee elegant and a well developed system of rewards to inventors and commmerciaux.
In the same way IBM has a system of relations with the customer well developed.
The company was brilliant early in the discovery of talents- as one of the first firms to abolish all forms of discrimination and thus could have the choice.
The current plan is fully in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy because it will be a women- Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano as head of IBM.
It worked at IBM for 30 years and currently holds the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM in recent years is called jamy, the brain- storming online from what is a lot of future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that it has a lot of ideas - in the firm nearly 500,000 people who work.
An institution with a good name
This is the internal and external image of the company which will provide a secure position in the fields of business.
"Since the beginning, IBM had a concept rather than a technology firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, an economics professor at Harvard School of Economics and author of a book about IBM.
"IBM is not a firm technlogique but a firm that helps solve the problems of the world of business using its technology," added Geogre Colony of Forrester Research Consulting firm.
As the firm itself, there is a difference between entering the market and create this market.
IBM - or the "Big Blue", as it is commonly known in the United States with regard to its slogan- in 100 years it has grown to become one of the largest global firms.
It is, of course, the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardwares, infrastructure, lodging, Council at the level of server products to nanotechnology.
She has numerous patents of all U.S. technology firms and five of its employees have received a Nobel Prize.
Among his discoveries stands for example, the distributor of tickets, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the disk.
IBM has found this year with 220 billion in the second largest technology company by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time it passed in 1996 Microsoft.
Overview in advance
Not all innovations and fabrications that have been customer preference and the time - IBM for example has failed the bet on an operational system own OS / 2, the prodigy online service or the IBM PCjr:
"From the moment that your business is built on the movement in advance you cannot émotionellement remain fixated on the past," said Samuel J. Palmisano.
For that IBM has no problem to build its bases on many platforms and when they do not work it is.
Unlike for example of conccurent Microsoft at the base is and remains under the Windows operating system.
A technology perspective
In the IBM, services, who are trained for a fifth by software and hardwares, have a prominent place.
Yet in 1990, it was with more the motié participation, the highest representative of hardware.
From the year 2000 IBM has sold assets for 15 billion during the period we invested $58 billion in buying technology prospects.
It continues in investment and even from 2008, when for the first time surpassed the new financial crisis.
IBM is negotiating according to the precepts of his first chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the economic crisis has also increased its investments.
It appears now that IBM is the current crisis without being disturbed?
The share price IBM progessé from 2008 in a rocket of 120 percent, the net profit of the firm continues to grow.
The company's logo IBM is changing all but not its values.
We can expect this to ensure that this giant flexible command other crises.
Story of IBM: Slices of cheese to flights in the cosmos.
The International Business Machines (IBM) was born in New York a hundred years; she had initially the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
She took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand name used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the year 80 of the nineteenth century.
They possessed of technologies such as the old "pointeuses", the clocks that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint who until 1930 chaired the Council of Surveillance of society.
Flint hired the head of a rival firm Thomas J. Watson to help lead the company.
The leader then shade to the founder of the firm - it is on the ideas of Watson that are up to now the identity and the culture of the company.
Watson led the firm kusqu' in 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began with the production of all machinery for business and trade - slicers cheese and meat registers.
During the first four years during which Watson led the turnover is led up to 9 million and began the expansion of the firm in all parts of the world.
Watson was for the firm if irreplaceable that after 40 years of his son, who took the Chair of director, Thomas Watson Jr.
Under his leadership, IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first language of programming.
In the 1960s the people and computers from IBM helped NASA has direct flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and theft in 1969 on the Moon.
Meanwhile in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM System / 360.
The PC classic that set the standard for computer of the time with the IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sells its computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the company of Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to take advice and services with high added value.
The strategy that manages to IBM in the last three years - is the concept Smarter Planet "a smarter planet."
Its objective is the Intelligent Use of technology in areas not yet exploited such as transportation and management of cities.
In the area of trade IBM has developed a short time ago a platform "Smarter Commerce" that helps marketers to manage the business cycle.
IBM has a strong history on our territory.
She created its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 when first countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic centre of outsourcing of Brno.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe headquarters in Prague, and there is also the research and development team in the world, which handles the speech recognition.
Rychtarova about her husband unfaithful:
Ivette you can keep this donkey, I want more!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years) has said, it is finished.
After her husband Josef Rychtar (53 years) to become a bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45), Darina hoped that Joseph wakes up its dream of pink and return home.
Only it could not wait and established clear rules for the future.
"Pepa can return home, but not as my partner," explained Rychtarova.
When Darina Rychtarova gave asylum in summer to Bartosova in her house, she had no idea that the couple would not.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted move of Ricany, Pepa does not back the singer.
And he admitted in public that he loved.
With time Darina has resigned, has accepted the binding of her husband and has come to say goodbye forever.
Rychtirova is not interested to know with whom her husband layer.
If Rychtar Bartosova separate and there will be no wife to welcome him at the door of the house.
"It is the biological father of my son and if he wants to end his life in our common home, nobody will put out".
"It will not be my old donkey loved and lost, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," leaked Rychtarova showing that she was separated from her husband, but they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina has closed the door is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect the decision of my wife."
"I will remain with Iveta and will not disturb."
"My wife has put in place a marriage on paper and I respect that."
"The company continues, I am dealing with repairs, the garden, real estate, I buy."
"With Darina is completely normal, but we do not lying," said Rychtar to Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love it would not deter him.
"We do not lying together and am not interested to know where it is going, with that and if she had an affair.
I know that it is my fault, I fell in love with "Iveta on me and I take full responsibility," said Joseph.
The worst vices of women: This applies to you too?
If you ask the men to identify defects typical of women, all, both are able to get them out of their game. "
My dear lady, you'll see in the following lines of women who come to pump blood veins of men.
The purchases
Your half you made remarks that you are dependent on purchases?
Should you buy at least a garment per week?
You are simply buying and packet during the sales?
In your case, we can talk of purchases as a vice.
Some women think they should restrict their passion to make purchases.
But you say, which would window shop at clothing stores, to look for yourself pretty clothes and then try all cabin (the ideal of different colours)?
And although for most women buy is a hobby, it may become a hell for humans.
Remind you just how many times have you told your spouse waiting at the entrance.
Constant dissatisfaction
"I am not too big?"
"I need to lose at least 5 kilograms - I should start to make the sport?"
"I like?"
These sentences does not do something?
Yes? "
You therefore part of these women who are obsessed with their appearance.
This is not the question that you should stop you look after yourself, but a large number of men is allergic to the fact that their partner is always complain about his appearance.
The male does not hesitate to say that the frequency of these complaints are rising and more women become empoisonnantes.
The stage and cleanliness in the first place
It is like a merry-go-round.
Wash the windows, vacuuming, cleaning up the soil, dust, scraping the bathroom - and this twice a week.
You made the remarks to your partner that it works with dirty feet on the ground, the children they have soiled the sink, fouled the glass in the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you have precisely this obsession, try to keep in mind that we should not exaggerate and that the order and cleanliness should not be the first place in the family.
This desire harmless cleanliness may spoil your relationships and even family peace.
The work of
"Is this overgarment worn in the garbage."
"You put these old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do with land."
If you are on your partner this undermining this way several times a day, you really the break down.
It is clear that you don't think about bad you want everything to be perfect.
Perhaps if the men knew, women would not have to do so much work to undermine...
Defamation, the persiflage
The defamation, the persiflage but also insults against someone is also the home of some women.
Women are particularly to relations and are happy to deal with issues like that, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps that each of us from a small persiflage harmless here and there.
Hand on heart, yet it is a feature of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persiflent, even despise each other and are for them - particularly at work in a group of women - particularly dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation in the victory of Philadelphia
The attacker hokeyiste Jagr has participated twice in the victory in Philadelphia during the match Monday NHL on the ice of Caroline and is again in top Czech players for the competition.
From the point of view of the star of 39 Claude Giroux, who has been a more and was named the best player of the match, it was in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who played with Jagr has also recorded two goals during the match.
Jagr told reporters after the game of the Atlantic that he had notified Giroux that this would be a great evening.
"I said before the game that he would give his hat-trick."
"I felt."
"Some time this feeling comes crashing down on you," said Jagr after its action Giroux was a goal the first shot of the Flyers.
A moment later there was a second assault on the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the goals for the Hurricanes in the time and the striker Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the start of the second half belonged to the Flyers.
To Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr McGee scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say that he is the best player in the league but it really is part of the top three," said Jagr about its centre.
"I never thought I' d do at the end of their career with a hokeyjiste like him."
"I am really happy with this."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years in the NHL other players on the team tried to play on me, now it is my turn," said Jagr.
Caroline was a tragedy of this match because with a goal of Tuom Ruutu Dwyer and again on a penalty she finished with a difference of one goal.
Matt Read has not ruled out other complications that led to two to one.
"Pronger has done excellent attacks in our area."
"He got the time, I took the speed and (Read) went to the farthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I arrived," describes the last goal of the match from his point of view Voracek.
Philadelphia arrived with this victory at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav Spacek has not finished the game with Buffalo, he went out in the second third because of an injury in the upper part of the body.
The Candiens did not respond to an experienced defender ahead of two butset lost after a pénalty by 2: 3.
Tomas Plekanec has not changed any of their attacks.
It is the fact that the rear line was ill that has mostly been interfering as the local, rather than points lost because they played the game with only five defenders.
"It is zero."
"We played the game only with an experienced player, the rest were young."
"But there is nothing to do, it is like that," said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement on replacement this was not enough and we have not been able to resist."
"We just to simplify the game, pushing the time out of our area."
For this we had limits, "said one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender attended the thirtieth attack of Winnipeg and the victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different gunmen participated at goals for the Jets, who have arrested a series of five matches lost.
How have evolved travel prices since 1989.
Until 1989 there was in Czechoslovakia only 5 state travel agency, Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at the time of travel, especially in the countries of the socialist bloc, as trips to the west were very limited.
Czech tourists were traveling for the holidays in East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A major exception for the period from 1962 to 1972, when he was allowed to travel in Yugoslavia and the regime began to have a propensity for the west and travel to Yugoslavia were very limited in the Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that he was not authorized to citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
In the case where the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually for example in Poland and the Soviet Union he needed a letter of invitation if the individual trip was not allowed.
Travel agents at the time were also travel to the West, however, he had to queue all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that it was not yet won.
The agreement for the currency that was the condition for travel to the west was denied to people "politically incorrect" who could not travel.
The Czechoslovak currency was not, however, it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the agreement of currency (currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs were most often their holidays in the country where there were so many country houses and cottages that Czechs are bought and this habit lasts until now.
The Czechs have since been since 1989 a great revolution.
Although until 1989 vacations in East Germany and Bulgaria were at a maximum, the Czechs have spent the past year abroad 4 million vacation days in the countries of the world.
The great paradox that we are not aware today is that the country is the most popular Croatia where it was not possible to move freely until 1989 as part of Yugoslavia.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s of the last century in neighbouring countries in the west have caused a huge wave of short-term visits to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not long travel by air to the west that everyone wanted to see at least a moment.
For example, in Paris tour operators the Czechs were sleeping in tents in parks because our income we could not afford a hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a journey of Czechs was at the time of transfer its own food cans, sausage, etc... to save.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech koruna has allowed our tourists finally after dozens of years to be able to freely buy the currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average salary rose which caused around the year 1997 another important moment.
Thanks to a growing demand for travel travel agencies have begun since 1997 to prepare towers with links by air charter through contracts have greatly reduced costs compared to what it was before.
In the late 1990s of the last century the Czechs had links without visas with virtually most developed countries around the world to share the EU who later helped our trips.
Another interesting moment in the history of the post-revolution tourism, when was the first air charter to an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year, as every year of direct air charter take Czech tourists in the distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
It is more than 100,000 Czechs who visit the exotic countries each year.
An interesting time in this period, which symbolizes our development post-revolution arrived in 2008.
November 17, 2008, the EU abolished visas for Czech tourists and has allowed our country to be completely in the group of developed countries.
Also in 2008 the Czechs for the first time in history have spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50 per cent) and, for the first time in history have spent more than 15 000 kroons per person for a holiday abroad, including the additional costs. Korunas per person.
The General Assembly must find its President, but this is likely to be completed by a situation without solution "a pat"
Nearly 5mois already Czech football is without President and there is a risk that the successor to Ivan Hasek at the head of the Association of Football of the Czech Republic is not yet known after a General Assembly to be held on Thursday at Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement on what regulation to vote should proceed.
Without this agreement, it is not possible to begin to vote for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the direction of the Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure has called his colleagues has come together and find a strong personality who will lead the football in the future.
Only during the era after Hasek football is back to the differences between the chambers of the Association who cannot agree on a common candidate.
This has fully demonstrated on September 16, when he had to choose a new president.
Delegates to the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiations remained stalled and it has not even been issue to address how to elect.
There was no agreement on who has the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, it seems, the statutory representatives or officials also invested with full powers.
In this single point there was a partial agreement since that moment also with the support of the Office for the state and the law, according to which the representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
The differences are still on the regulation for the election.
It is all too clear that the executive committee, which in its negotiations planned or extraordinary, added nothing to the situation
The opinions on the voting possibilitě have changed several times, but the problem remains the same.
The question is: How to proceed to the third round not to fall into the pat.
"The bone of contention is the following fact: Either proceed according to the statutes or find another model", was one of three vice-presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda who represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the model wins in the third round of the candidates who received the most votes in percentage in the chamber for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is prepared according to what is said to withdraw so that wins the candidate who receives the largest share of votes in both chambers.
And the Czech part is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the percentages of votes.
"Only this would then lose the idea of two previous rounds and this would completely deny the bicameral concept," admits Svoboda, which includes the objections of the Moravian part and that it would be best not to change the regulation and vote according to the statutes in force.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik is also agree even if it believes that the regulation of elections based on the statutes benefit most pelta among all candidates.
"I hope that the vote under the statute of the association."
"So that there is not yet whimsical ideas dreamt up by a representative as during the past general assemblies," said the owner of Victoria Plzen who is a candidate for the first time and in its submissions has defined mainly against pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him at Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively.
"The qualification possible today in European Championship should calm throughout the world."
"Football on a wave of happiness and remaining more drive for cooperation," added the officer of Jablonec which of the three has the most experience in the direction of a professional football at the regional level.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"This is not a problem between the Czech and Moravian, but there are trends to change the regulations to design."
"This may lead to a blockage in the General Assembly."
"I hope that the good reason will prevail," said Rajchl.
There is not much time left for a common agreement to all parties.
Some réuunions should be held directly in Montenegro, but who can say if the whole direction of football will be complete for the match.
The specially chartered flight in which to travel to Podgorice, among other things, the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not departed for technical reasons and it was looking for an alternative to take part of the executive committee on the ground of retaliation.
At the end of the ministerial meeting, which could be held on Wednesday, which should be decisive.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Joseph DOBES would be very happy to receive the parties split within the athletic association the highest in the country and bring them to an agreement.
In the game, there are many: A state subsidies, the credibility of football and the General Assembly of the Czech Union Sports must determine the direction of the sport following the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik is going to fight for the post of President because he sees no candidate correct.
If the head of footballers of Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he asked for a new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) he would not be put in campaign to this high office.
"If such a candidate is my support, I fight for him and I do not come to the election."
"But in the current situation, it has not been possible to find such a candidate," said Paclik the Czech News Agency (CTK).
The motivation of Paclik is to compete with Miroslav pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to try to prevent pelta access to the head of the AFRT who initially would be given a favorite for this election.
Paclik also stressed that if it won the next election he held the position of President only until 2013 target year for a General Assembly.
He would see as a manager and experienced a high level, but that is not connected with the world of football.
"I talked to people who have the profile," he says.
"For me it was terrible when some have told me that they did not want to be identified with the Czech football at the moment."
"I would like to change that image," he added.
This, they say, especially Paclik, it is the relationship between pelta and President of the Union regional football Plzen Roman Berbr, man to traders who is known in the wings as a lobbyist is capable of influencing the vote of the delegates' the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable that pelta occupies the position of President.
"If he won, the state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a trader, this would be even less favourable to football," proclaimed Paclik.
What the still shocking is the fact that the name of pelta was delivered a few years of eavesdropping as part of an investigation into a corruption case, for which pelta emerged without any penalty.
"I don't know what prestige pelta would bring football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said some time ago "if pelta became President, I sell the club of Plzen."
In the case where Paclik triumph in Thursday's vote, it should prove that it could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the General Assembly in September that ended in a fiasco, thinking the same thing.
"He (pelta) would be the first with which I would go."
"He has great capacity"
"It would be able to present such as head of the representation."
"But as manager of the Association it would not be able to."
"I am not the nose in what I do not know," said Paclik who in September has attracted much attention when he spoke to the cancellation of the Referees Commission with Ludek Macela that has replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik says that it would be at the level to lead the Association.
It takes as its capacity to lead private firms and that he also heads since last year the club of Plzen which celebrated with his support last May's triumph in the first division.
"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to make a certain culture."
"I freinerais the influence of some interested groups, for example, tend to affect the Disciplinary Commission and appeal, which led to situations in bad taste," said Paclik chache who do not his dislike for the head of the Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider a harmonization of relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose power lobbying high-level policy would provide for the sport more tax money on games.
"This is one of the key points of the new President should address."
"If it is the tax on gambling as the state political parties, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where the money goes," he said.
Paclik does not take its current bond with the club of Plzen as something negative even if he says that the President of the AFRT should be "above the parties."
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla Prague.
"This is not the ideal."
I see no reason to convey my actions of the club of Plzen to someone if I have to go back a year and a half after, "said Paclik.
Pelta promised new statutes for the AFRT that should put an end to situations of pat.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Association of football, a candidate for the Presidency Miroslav pelta promised that if he is elected, AFRT will have new statutes, which should bring an end to the disputes in the future on the regulation for the elections.
The official in Jablonec is before the meeting on Thursday at Nymburk very optimistic that the success today of the representation of football should calm this squabble before the vote.
Pelta before the election in September, which has not been promised to devote themselves to the national representation and financial resources if he is elected.
It was decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the General Assembly and the delay of two months may allow him to defend his vision of the direction of football and the present in a broader context.
"People at all levels of football for a long time and expect Thursday there is a President."
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take the leadership of the Association," he said, but it is primarily associated with the club of Jablonec, has worked for many years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
It is also why he has enough experience to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the General Assembly in June of the statutes were approved that were not perfect as all have seen."
"If there were not all these various interprétattions we would have already had a president since September," says pelta.
It is precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association who has caught the attention of delegates.
"If I become president, I take it as a personal mission and am ready to take all responsibilities in cases where it does not work."
"It is a principle without which we cannot exist," said pelta.
Then he tries, they say, not to confront his opponents.
He has said previously that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he acknowledged in his training in law and it knows that his adversaire-candidat would be its first Vice-President.
He has not attacked long Tonas Paclik rather does not stop criticizing pelta.
"It is in football for a year and has already had some success."
"Its attacks, however, were not the most honorable and has surprised many people during the campaign."
"This is also why some now have doubts about his character," said pelta to address of his opponent but remains, he says, faithful to the statements he made in September.
His greatest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest level until the national réprésentation.
This should be a vitirne of football.
"And I would endeavour to complete all cases that begin with the Bohémians or the scandal of corruption."
"I immediately entering into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for football," said the Czech News Agency CTK the Tarbes candidate two months ago.
He also added that his appointment as head of football would bring no change people.
"I should get acquainted with all employees," he said at Strahov where there is an understandable nervousness since there is no direction.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes that the delegates will not Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is a single point of disagreement on how to vote in the third round we will surpass it."
"Football needs credibility and it will only be when there will be headed by a new leader," says optimistically pelta two days before the day probably decisive for his career as a public servant.
Rajchl promised that under his leadership the AFRT would begin to work hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected as the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic to the General Assembly on Thursday that would not please many people, apparently.
Rajchl promises, however, that if he is elected will begin to work hard.
He wants to systemic changes and make the Executive Committee members are responsible for different areas of football.
He also promised to settle the case Bohémians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, make football more money and continue the work begun by the predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As president I want to occupy of football in its entirety."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through the national representation of professional football and football well for youth."
"But I am not saying that I will do it alone," said in an interview for Rajchl CTK.
"I am a team player and want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each member is involved in a specific area."
"And I will distribute difficult missions for that football faced a big step forward."
"A lot of people will not be happy, because it will begin to work hard rather than criticize others," he added.
He has said that he would not run as a candidate because of a critical mood.
"For me, it is known that I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if it's worth it, and if I have people behind me that I will ever throw a spanner in the works and will have doubts about each of my actions," explaining why he hesitated.
"A lot of people have said to me that I should not give up because they would also".
"It is a confidence that I cannot betray," he says.
What motivates them, they say, is to continue the work begun with Hasek.
"Over the last two years there has been a lot, and I do not want to let him down."
"There are processes that have been launched which will result in a few years and I would not like someone stopped. '," he said with the fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav pelta the situation within the Union will return as it was before Hasek.
"I believe in a systematic work and this is something that Mirek pelta do not know what to do."
"Behind him are people who fairaient of football in such a way that it would be only for those who have been selected."
"You can say a number of things, but certainly not pay somebody."
"I am trying to be objective."
"I want to play football for all because everyone will be happy not only those who have been selected
And he reiterated that it would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
"And if there are those who say the opposite, I am ready to do its utmost to Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts, one Czech and Moravian rvhvÃtvrÃvÃi winners would be in the first division."
"There would be no situation as currently with only three Moravian team in the division because the problem is to find young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Club of Plzen, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess its own chances of winning.
"I feel an ongoing support of the Czech Chamber who elected me his Vice President and knows that with me there will be successful," said Rajchl contemplating his future success to save tens of millions of kronor on contracts disadvantageous contract negotiations with televisions and on the Gaming Act.
He said that the fact that the Association is not united is a fault common to all.
While he said about pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech footblal would lose its credibility," he thinks the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has much to offer football.
"No one can doubt in Plzen this year that he has done a superb job."
"If he was elected he would surely in what has been started by Hasek and would not change significantly among people in the Commissions."
"He does not want to spoil its success," said Rajchl who has assessed his rivals.
The most beautiful pools of Europe
Jump in the blue
Julia Stanek of
Wading in optical sighting, beautiful pools of Budapest: Who travel across Europe can live his blue miracle - and having turned the city or a long promenade- can leave his legs tired in carbonated water baths.
A book shows how swimming pool you can experience the greatest well-being.
When Iris Meder went in research trip during the past 18 months, there is a subject that should not be missed in his luggage: A bathing suit.
Lying on his back in the water, she watched the domes artistically arranged, and swam against the marbles Putten, who was waiting on the other side of the pool and to admire the Art Nouveau meticulously restored from these pools converted.
If a covered swimming pool was pleased, she noted in his book without delay all the details of interest on the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 pools were surveyed in this way by the architectural historian Meder and presented them in his book published: "Badefreuden (Joies of Bain." Swimming pools covered in Munich, the palace of historical bath in the Black Forest, "concrete buildings Hardcore" in the Taunus.
She led her "trips to the bathroom of Central Europe" in 13 countries. Aside from Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited respectively places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The German 46 years is a true devotee of the culture of the bath.
Meder, explains that it was not much interest in the sport but they feel attracted to water in a completely different way.
It is irritating that supporters of swimming should simply see blue tiles and accommodate the stench of bleach while joggers breathe perfume mesmeric spruce forests or can listen to the birds trill happy the park.
"I asked myself a day why swimming pools must be always so ugly," said the Vienna.
"I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of the water strengthens doubling architecture
A dive in a pool and sauna volatile oils, a factor of well-being in the halls of swimming are enormous because all the senses are awake, Meder.
And if the builders would have given a little more room to swim could be a real treat for the eyes: "Instead of a floor was a surface water in the swimming."
"It is a transparent side, but on the other hand, however, the beauty of the entire building."
All surfaces are optically a twofold: High arches, colorful tiles, springboards.
The volume of image of small format "Badefreuden" is a worthwhile report 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of the historic welfare - it is certainly wish to make a leap in the blue.
The collector Meder discovered copies remarkable during his research in Hungary.
Alongside the splendid baths well-being as bathing Széchenyi aged 100 years in Budapest, she found water containing nitrate in a natural cave in the bath (karst cave in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath which the basins are filled with water containing the alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) and located in a building in the shape of a bottle.
By contrast, the outdoor heated pools of Switzerland and Austria offers spectacular views. While on the roof of the Zurich bath was the entire city its eyes, you can admire the Arlberg snow from a pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which we can observe the animation on the ski area.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool expected swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal resembles an OVNI who has just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rising from three open shelves, while in the background are the mountains of the Ötztal skyward.
Alhambra in the black
The smell of bleach does not come from all pools of the collection Meder.
Many thermal baths are a smell of sulphur, Bekescsaba Árpád-spa in the Hungarian is a strong smell of oil, it is hard to believe, find themselves in a health spa.
The smell of therapeutic alkaline waters containing hydrogen, which is almost black and silt you sticks to the skin as soon as you let slip in the swimming pool, a spa experience.
During his pursuit of beautiful pools, Iris Meder also has suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor swimming pool and outdoor Czechoslovakia, she found herself before a ground barricaded.
The bath designed by the architèque Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was meanwhile closed.
With a look through the window of the immeuble-Art New in rouge-blanc-jaune, she noted the development of weeds between the tiles.
It was an opposite effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: The palace of the Baths of Bad Wildbad.
The building has already survived three phases and can not only discover elements néo-romains out since its conception in 1844 but room in Alhambra Moorish style that has been added in 1900.
Since its modernization of 1995, the palace thermal bath remains the favorite of the expert in pool, Iris Meder - and not just because she is from Schwarzwald.
"This is already a good performance that melt building styles so different in a unit so great," said Meder.
With such a palace, diving into the pool and spa is apparently only a minor issue.
Agricultural speculation
The German bank details speculation on the raw materials
By Christian Teevs
The German bank abandonne-elle his speculation on the raw materials?
According to Spiegel-Online, Josef Ackermann has established a working group to explore the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the leader of the group wants to draw the consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84 percent of Germans find unacceptable that banks are speculating on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two thirds of respondents even require the German bank and other credit institutions discontinuent this avenue of business because it increases the problems of the poorest in the world.
It is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann said in the article that speculation Awards on raw materials, pushing prices upwards and that banks share a complicity to global hunger.
The campaign to protect consumers aligns specifically against the head of the Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if the big banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting in the same way.
Speculation on raw materials was originally introduced to protect merchants against price fluctuations.
But most experts share the view that the bettors have posted offers and demand - and benefit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann responded to criticism from U.S. competitors: He promised to investigate the accusations and said, "no business is worth risking the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
According to information from the SPIEGEL ONLINE an international working group is examining accusations of Foodwatch-Report.
The review should be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the board of directors of the Deutsche Bank must be presented - with recommendation, usually.
In late January, the head of the Bank will indicate the implications.
This could result in a reduction of the commodities market, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann built its Image
The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed its criticism of the financial sector: "Speculation on rising food prices shows a draconian manner, how banks today detrimental to the public interest."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be today particularly under obligation.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all investments in its portfolio, for which the money was invested on food speculation," said Bode.
"It is not important for Mr Ackermann, if it was a question of starving people or if the reputation of Deutsche Bank is at stake."
Awareness of Ackermann may at first seem surprising, but it is clear that the CEO of the group wants to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving office.
Deutsche Bank did announce Monday that the president of the Council of Administration will not change what is planned within the Council of Administration.
Ll could improve its image with the abandonment of the controversial agricultural speculation.
And about potential losses, it did little to bother - his successor will care.
One in two résilierait investments on raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain a strong pressure on the Manager.
So far more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode released the survey Tuesday, November 7 and 8, the Forsa Institute has completed questionnaires from 1001 people.
Just 11 percent found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank proposes investments for which bets on the prices of food products are made.
Many clients of the bank would also personal consequences if they knew that their bank is involved in such operations: One in two résilierait, following the survey, all investments for which money is injected into the speculation on raw materials.
43 percent déconseilleraient of such a bank to their entourage, 49 percent said they would seek to terminate their account for change "bank.
21st home in Vienna
Moved the Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski of
A history of architecture, with ups, downs and a Happy End: The Austrian pavilion for exhibitions in Brussels in 1958, has been a museum in Vienna, remained empty, then fell into disrepair.
Now it is again open and takes the place of home of exposure.
If the enthusiasm for a modern postwar architecture, for his clear forms, its hangars in glass, its bright and bold patterns and its new building materials that are typical of the belief in technological progress, then the flag of the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the Universal Exhibition in Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Pavilion of Schwanzer was once the "Grand Prize for Architecture" for its construction steel and glass, slight and suspended.
The construction is seen today as an important step in contemporary architecture.
He has made so famous architects, he has also built the Austrian Pavilion for Expo.
With its legendary home to four cylinders of BMW and its adjacent construction in the form of a bowl in Munich, it finally became famous at the international level in 1973.
His draft flag as a temporary construction had been exposed after the exhibition in the Garden Switzerland at the station south of Vienna, has been transformed, and in 1962 as a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang the works of art, not a good environment.
However, it was also long used, until the contemporary art gets a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building was empty and has increasingly dilapidated.
Now the architect Adolf KRISCHANITZ has transformed the Pavilion, it is now known as the "House of the 21st century" and will in the future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday night the Belvedere museum opened, which owns the house, the first exhibition - a stroke of luck at any point of view.
The new start was completed by Agnes Husslein-Arco, which has become the new director in 2007 of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, has promoted an art historian to a great career in his youth of skater, subsequently at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as a founding director of the Museum of Modern Art of Salzburg, she led on the transformation work with politicians and the protection of monuments, she received public funds and private sponsorship and established the operation.
Except for contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation has the same name have been exposed, a cafe and a bookstore there, and an office should be built.
Strict monitoring, small budget
The achievement KRISCHANITZ was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and expanded with sensitivity secession of Joseph Olbracht and that he had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that for him the flag was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "virtually every weekend" exhibitions.
He knew the project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness following his trip to Vienna and by his change of use.
During the current transformations, there were major problems: The building was "an abyss in energy," said KRISCHANITZ.
The profiles of glass facade windows were changed, insulating glass fibre reinforced glass was raised and the roof replaced by a glass of security.
The joists thermal bridges have been strengthened or replaced, and coatings filled with asbestos have been rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new operation, a sign of light sifted between home and road provides lighting, a bridge leading to the entrance - this is almost a new construction, but always the slight Schwanzer Pavilion.
The doors of origins remained, the house is painted in a shade protection against rust red-brown color.
And the movie theatre is exactly identical to what it once was.
And all this under close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials that are good and had to be found, and that appeals to the office of protecting monuments," said KRISCHANITZ and it draws attention to a gross floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, the problems and changes, the building has remained flexible and light.
It would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels," said KRISCHANITZ recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City."
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place." Despite "awaken the conscience."
But in this case, the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a stroke of luck for urban construction: Around the Garden Switzerland is precisely the area of the Central Station "newly planned, with offices and apartments.
And another stroke of luck may occur: The House of the 21st century could enjoy the support of another construction KRISCHANITZ, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the centre of Berlin temporary art, and as he said, it is already negotiating with the city to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Garden Switzerland.
Bahn is planning a winter crisis in million.
The railway company has developed a plan-crise, which aims to prevent accidents in winter.
The number of employees is expected to double.
It cost millions.
In the battle against the train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway corporation "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million this year.
The daily Bild "-Zeitung reported earlier, citing an internal group plan-crise, that investments to a total of about 300 million euros would be provided until 2015.
This should allow better availability of vehicles and the rail network, also in the case of extreme weather.
The number of employees, both internal and external to the snow rail facilities and docks should, among other double and move to 16,000 people.
The objective is to rid the docks of snow and ice until early phase of service and 90 percent of track appliances needed to service in a period of four to five hours.
Two months ago, the chief of station Rüdiger Grube cautioned the government and industry at a summit conference of train accidents occurred also this winter.
Last winter, the railway company has had a lot of problems for the transport of users, because it lacks among other reserves in case of severe weather conditions.
As many new regional trains have been waiting years an authorization from the Ministry of Railways.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has for years about what to do, given that it needs to verify the axles of ICE trains significantly more often in the workshop, after a break of axles took place on the ICE in the railway station in Cologne.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties in the US.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann there is something new in the US: The German bank "Deutsche Bank" must pay a fine "of millions.
As if the problems of Deutsche Bank had not been sufficient, the past of this giant caught up in the US: The Institute of Frankfurt pays compared to 145 million (106 million euros) to settle a dispute because of the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is the sale of mortgage documents.
The regulator of financial markets now-closed doors to major banks a series of accusations, and to encourage cooperative banks to make false promises regarding the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risk.
These documents have lost considerable value during the financial crisis and led banks to the bottom.
"We are pleased to have been able to find a solution to this issue, without the parties begin a procedure in court," said a Deutsche Bank in New York.
The Bank has not recognized in comparison no fault.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which is committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
The president of now-closed Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (now-closed) responsible for cooperative banks in the US and it is in bankruptcy, in order to protect the deposits of customers.
The now-closed tries to repair the damage incurred by several billion dollars.
Comparisons made now are the first of their kind.
The regulator has also taken other major banks to party and been sued before the Court JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
With regard to the issue of mortgage documents "Mortgage-backed Securities."
Houses of credit are at the base.
When the US housing bubble burst in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the peak of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even if the events are already a few years ago, at the moment it blows on US banks a wind storm.
Investors and regulators have filed numerous appeals for compensation or to punish breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of complaints.
It accuses 18 major international banks, two of the estate of American state Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to benefit in kind in cases of mortgages of about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank must also file an appeal with the FHFA, there are several transactions totalling $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities, the Frankfurter responds "substantial losses" but without naming a specific amount.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unjustified and says it wants to defend themselves.
Warren Buffett increases of 10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the guru of finance, is investing huge amounts of money in the enterprise IT IBM.
Since March, he bought shares with a value of more than $10 billion.
So far the largest U.S. investor Warren Buffett said repeatedly not to invest in IT technology companies, given that the long-term trend of companies show that poor prognosis.
However, he read the reports of IBM and has changed his opinion on investment in this sector.
He had already understand much earlier than IBM sets of services and computer systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is seen as an attack of Knight in the world of finance.
Therefore the IBM IT gives itself the right to call itself now, "Mr IBM."
Because Buffett revealed today at the "economic programme CNBC, he bought since March of IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has become a major shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that IBM has never knew nothing of this commitment so far.
He commended the leadership, even during the economic crisis had provided reasonable profits.
"You have done a great job," said Buffett strategically.
IBM set for some time on the lucrative IT services as "accounting centres.
The pioneer of the computer, more than 100 years, offers both Software and consultation that computers to company performance.
Buffett had so far avoided rather technology companies.
He said that it invests only in companies that he understands business.
But Buffett tackles rather rail cargo, to manufacturers of lubricants or machines.
His holding company Berkshire Hathaway owns about 80 subsidiaries and shares with a series of large groups such as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, ex Munich Re.
The 80-year-old 81 years had resumed in the 1960s "small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and was promoted to the rank of one of the most prestigious global companies, thanks to smart investments.
However his lifestyle is modest.
That is why it is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
Sense almost infallible to earn money earned him the nickname of "Oracle of Omaha".
Following the announcement of Buffett IBM shares rose 1 percent to the stock market.
"Big Blue", as is also known as IBM, has a market capitalization of a total of more than 220 billion and account with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, said Buffett, he does not want to participate.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "cell of Zwickauer" the Turkish media about the state of German law.
A newspaper even speak of a "bloody ideology," which would thereby be re-established now.
The killing of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
Following this new, Turkey as well as the population germano-turque reacted with fear and anxiety.
As for many of the spectrum germano-turcs thought long dead returned: Since the incendiary attacks of Mölln in November 1992 and at Solingen in May 1993, there has been no violence comparable with the context of right-wing extremist against the Turks.
There is in Germany a xenophobia, it has never been issue.
The network of right-wing extremist who has been detected, however, reveals proportions which dimension is far from predictable.
"Is it a return to the bloody ideology", "This was the title of the publication on the Internet of the Turkish daily" Haberturk. "
The newspaper Sabah "highlights the fact that one of the authors would have been a v-homme of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities might be involved in the quagmire of the far right.
It is a reasoned that responded to the Turkish community in Germany: She called this weekend in a silent commemoration for victims of racial violence in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Only two weeks ago that the Turkish community in Berlin and the policies of Turkish and German had thought in a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment.
It is with fresh colours that cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
The reports of some Turkish media are a slap: "The gift of Germany for the 50th anniversary" is the title of an article in the platform turque- "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
The release of German 'Hürriyet' has no compunction to draw clear conditions.
"It starts to puer," This is the title of the chronicle of Ahmet Külahci.
It stressed that people would have been murdered, would have paid taxes and have provided by their work an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
The police action has been seen very critically on forums germano-turcs and they were subsequently discussed the success of their research.
 Why it is not already come much earlier in the spirit of the German authorities to do research in some circles suspect right-wing, are the authors.
More of a willingness to at least rhetorical means or drastic: "If the case continues to be cobbled together, it will be to migrants anything other than self-defence and weaponry."
"It will be the best self-defense."
"Inner peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network," wrote "Selen."
What this means if domestic peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have explained.
The photo of the ruins after the fire of Solingen is deeply rooted in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event has shown more clearly the Turks living here that there is a credible threat, and the Germans, whereupon the mistrust and distance by acts of violence could erupt.
The attacks have heightened the sense of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
This is especially the failure of German politics after the attacks against the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire of Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Chief of the Turkish state, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. Kinkel at the time, in his speech, how many taxes produced the local Turkish population.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of its tax burden.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how much germano-turcs mistrust is deep in the "state of local law since that date.
In addition to the efforts of a further clarification and revaluation of terrorism of the extreme right in Germany, a clear message is this time.
The bank scandal of Lake Zurich
The Bank the most adventurous of Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has been almost bankruptcy in the financial crisis and patina meanwhile from one crisis to another.
It is a German who must lead now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber "was imagined.
After his departure, the head of the Bundesbank; it was informed in July, he would be in 2013 a position almost as dramatic, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the great Swiss bank UBS - a major step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber has publicly welcomed, commended; Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its strength recently obtained and sent to kind comments on the future colleagues.
"UBS has managed the turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, in September, it was clear that everything was going to change.
A trader in UBS Securities in London had diverted all security systems of the Bank and had soared about 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the board of directors of UBS Oswald Grübel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, was forced to leave.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of the UBS is seen as suffering - and all asking: When Axel Weber, then finally?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised of the bank from February 2012.
And it will resume the presidency of administration already in May - not in 2013, as has been reported by the bank on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber it becomes difficult.
It is not a banker, a professor of economics and President of the bank, and it certainly would have needed a period of adjustment.
All of a sudden he assumed responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has once again demonstrated that it has long since earned the title of "the largest bank scandal in Europe."
Indeed, the UBS is one huge - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and the other, she skated for years of a scandal.
Nothing, it seems, is the proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and strong, but also cunning, she had combined with ambitious goals: It also wanted to become, in the area of investment banking, a very large bank.
Therefore the UBS managed to one side in 2007 with 1.6 billion more money from a wealthy clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, she had advanced as investment bank in the league of the biggest banks in the world.
This has impression.
The former banker Hans Geiger and later a professor of bank for many years in Zurich said: "I have always taken the UBS as a model of good bank before my students."
"In the current context, one wonders: How is it that I could simply say at this point?"
He is deeply wrong.
In 2007, it is clear that for the first time something was amiss at UBS.
In the middle of the year President Peter Wuffli withdrew surprisingly, which was considered to be a high intellectual as well as a brilliant banker.
A few months later it was approached why he was gone.
The division of the bank had singed with sub-prime documents and write off billions.
To support this, UBS announced a capital increase of $13 billion francs and made a cross on top.
For this she did find investors, but that, shortly before, have furrowed eyebrows: An Asian state non-transparent from Singapore and an Arab state, which was ignored, to the point that it never learned his name.
It was, however, that the first blow.
In April 2008, it has worsened.
The bank was expected to announce new losses amounting to billions, chairman Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006, the second board paid to Switzerland, withdrew.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: UBS was given its mistakes of investment in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank has bought from UBS tens of billion of securities issues, the Swiss Confederation issued six billion francs for convertible bonds, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
Throughout Switzerland has been shaken - because she noted how this can be dramatic for a small country, to host such large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet total of the UBS 2007 "raised more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"We have not been able to save the UBS again," said the researcher banks, Geiger.
After the first disaster it was followed by the second.
A few months before, UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and was prepared to publish data for the wealthy clientele, who had defrauded the taxman perhaps with the help of the Bank.
In addition, she accepted a payment of $780 million - in repayment of unjustified profits from those operations with a fine.
The UBS has more or less published that she had helped to tax fraud.
At the same time it has lost something that has always been its capital in competition with the rich clients: The prestige of the discretion.
After the scandal Swiss bank secrecy was no longer the same.
It was followed by the withdrawal of the head of the board of directors and president of the board of directors.
And the exodus of money from customers.
The bank had lost in a few months its credibility in the two main business lines: Investment banking because of bad speculation and asset management because of aid for tax fraud.
And, as there was somewhat of a return to calm, and as it did, that UBS would be, he was followed by this unfortunate history of merchants of title: One merchant of title is surging 1.7 billion euros, before the bank was aware that something was amiss.
And it publishes: With risk management in the investment bank that still does not seem to work.
"With the case Adoboli, it was found that the risk of too little changed," said Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the Institute of the University of Zurich.
As the chief financial officer of a large German bank is safe: "The problem of the UBS is that it does not control the risks."
However, it was exactly the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long since taken their function as guardian of the vast wealth of the world: Not too great a risk, but security for the money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of a rock-solid reliability as Lindt & Sprüngli chocolate in a particularly noble.
The UBS in Zurich goes hand in hand with the solid cliché of the private Swiss bank - it is only a little larger.
Already the situation is classic.
The Bank has its seat at the railway station in Zurich, which led directly to the Central Station at Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by snow-covered peaks of Swiss mountains.
The buildings are prestigious, rents stores are among the highest in Europe.
The jewelers like Tiffany's, are found here between stores of Swiss traditions like those of the confectionery Sprüngli.
For centuries, Swiss bankers have lived here: The national bank through the palace of the Credit Suisse until private banks elitist as Julius Bär.
It happens in the lobby of the UBS by a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are lined with marble, before are thick leather chairs, and beside the logo of the bank, a major label to "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer research here: Security.
The idea of the Swiss bank has a day off the market - or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the leader of a small Swiss private bank.
He would prefer not to read his name in the newspaper, finally as all Swiss bankers it does business with the two major banks.
The UBS would become too large, trouve-t' it - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons are also common.
The Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And even if they have long been adapted to the morals of the Anglo-Saxons."
This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that has changed the UBS, she has made high profits and then the debacle: No European financial institution has lost so much money in the jungle of sub-prime as the great Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
"This Wednesday, the coalition government of the small country of seven million inhabitants has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," wrote the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The crash of UBS."
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the bankruptcy of a major bank.
How could that happen?
If we talk with Swiss bankers, they see the issue mainly in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks have reached a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too big for the small Switzerland - and has been steadily increasing.
What has helped is that the two banks prédécesseuses different from UBS completed: A bank rich, but lethargy with strength in asset management in Zurich and a poor, but certainly more highly internationalized.
Suddenly, the international investment banks have been favourably access to lots of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of UBS, Marcel Ospel, formerly chairman of the board of directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel constituted a dream team," said the researcher of banks, Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great intellectual modest, which are very much in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who has found its way to the summit with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have relied until the end to Wuffli.
Wuffli and would probably have committed at the end a decisive error: "He thought that his models were the reality," said Geiger.
"It is a tragic fall."
Tragic, perhaps.
One thing is clear: The exuberance arrived before the fall.
The staff of the UBS remembers clearly meetings of leaders, during which the group's leader Wuffli was always the same watchword: Dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The US bank investment bank was the most powerful in the world.
It ordered the "League Tables" the rankings, which have documented at the time the success of banks.
After all the UBS wanted to climb to the top.
Some steps have already succeeded.
In the case of foreign exchange and securities transactions it has played a very important role.
The business advisers, who had the responsibility, stressed however a weakness: In the international operations of interest in banking jargon "Fixed Income", there was a huge difference compared to the largest banks.
UBS would have gaps in the US mortgage products.
To fill this gap, UBS has launched into an adventure, which almost cost him his life.
Thirsty for growth, it is both the bank itself as a management created before it in the US sub-prime investments that have invested.
It has turned into a massive machine who packaged and sent the documents of value based on the US mortgages - but which has also retained risks.
Even when other banks were looking for a long time to go.
"Even in the summer of 2007, as the housing market was in flames, UBS bought here," said Geiger, a banking expert.

Smart crows spread in cities
In many places, the rooks are considered "problem of birds °" But experts say that these highly intelligent animals are more hunt cities for a long time.
Some love, some want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Crows belong to the city for centuries, but in many communities residents' complaints are increasing because of the dirt and noise of animals.
An antidote to the "No problem of birds" is not yet in sight.
During the first Ostfriesische symposium on crows, experts have said that it is no longer possible to hunt the rooks cities.
The experts from throughout Germany has deliberated on possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in the
The protectors of nature based the problems of cities on the exodus of rooks particularly protected: The use of chemicals in agriculture to destroy more vital areas.
Hunting, development and the felling of typical brooding made life difficult for birds.
The crows are under the protection of nature.
There are large settlements with more than 600 pairs nesting in the westfälischen Soest in the northwest, including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had won negative ads because of the massacre of crows in this region.
Critics have found the capture of birds in traps and killing them with batons particularly brutal.
"The expulsion, the ousting, serves no purpose," the planner of the city and the landscape of Leer, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nests using water under pressure or cut down trees, often produces undesirable consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals away, large colonies divide and they disperse in other places."
"The drive is conceivable only in exceptional cases, such as hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We are forced to live with them, we can no longer kill them."
The problem is not solved in the cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of the mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of the ousting of animals to a conditioning aversif and eye-catching offers to allow them to relocate.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens tried "signs of info in place of chainsaws" to establish relations with completely different: "We can better withstand a button in the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-cheminement-éducatif baskets in Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing on the lives of these rooks very intelligent.
This project has since been adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion about the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "This is a large number of communication, these oiseaux-là have much to say."
The intelligence and the ability of animals are legendary: The rooks use not only of work instruments to arrive at a beauty but they make their own tools as instruments of work.
Éthologistes of Cambridge University tested four rooks recently, at what point is the intelligence of the birds.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to make a scaffold collapse with stones to achieve a larva.
Without a lot of training, they recognized déterminément that a stone had to have some size and shape to collapse the platform.
In a second test, crafty crows were then asked to solve a problem more.
In a cylinder placed vertically, researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
The birds could not meet their booty with their bills.
However, the researchers had set pieces of wire at their disposal.
All four animals formed a hook with which they fished the small bucket of small pipe.
Three of the four rooks are even from the beginning.

The mass slaughter staff
A new book by Peter Englund provides depth and generosity. Entitled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War), it begins with a long list of characters who give you the heart.
A council to begin: Tear up carefully and make your bookmark this page.
You'll learn about these people in detail. In this fictional story of Peter Englund, the list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during those few moments where, as one of his men or women, you will be disturbed and desperate in the fog of war.
Peter Englund is a historian and journalist Swedish.
It is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which issues the Nobel Prize for literature.
He has written a book in which he describes, accurately, as "a book of anti-histoire."
It contains a few known names, the major treaties or famous battles; there is almost no ambassador or discussion on strategies and equipment.
This is not so much a book about what happened, "he says," a book describing what it was like. "There is the" feelings and impressions, experiences and moods. "
"The beauty and sorrow" summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 men and women more or less ordinary, on both sides of the war, young schoolgirls and botanists to there, doctors, paramedics and sellers.
Some will become heroes.
Other prisoners of war. Some will lose members, will become crazy or will lose their lives.
Their lives are vacillating here as pillars of a church: While some are exhausted, it has new.
The book by Peter Englund departs from the history books.
It gives the lie to the idea that the First World War is that by the terrible trench warfare on the Western Front.
"The beauty and sorrow" describes other theatres of war: The Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are under hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
The war invades the lives of these people such as a natural disaster like a hurricane Katrina, which reeks of cordite.
When cannon shots echoed in the distance, and you are a mother at home, are you staying or fuyez-vous?
That will come anyway?
Almost nobody can understand what happened, or even the reasons for the war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been expanded by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nanny within the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly from memoirs, letters and other documents already released.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying and exciting, but are preserved through the accumulation of small moments and details isolated.
Most the deprivation and the ability to cope.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, ersatz everywhere."
"Coffee, forged aluminum, rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He goes on the food in Germany.
He described the "meat made of rice cooked in grease (and finished with a false bone); the manufactured tobacco with roots dry skin and dried potatoes; the soles of shoes."
He says that "837 permitted substitute meats are registered in the production of sausages. There is also 511 cafes."
Some stories with the honour and courage.
An American acknowledges its own impulse to the savagery and says about the war: "You feel that, after all, is what the men were intended, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and instead of pretending that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there was no formal and barbaric behind your shirt cloutée.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die, and that no one will notice or pay attention.
"When one is resigned to sacrifice, we hope to have an audience," he writes.
Unfortunately, this is not comparable to "a condemned man strangled in secret."
Other comments about the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict is increasingly becoming a history of economic competition," wrote Peter Englund, "a war between the plants."
It took the arrival of what he called "a new species within the aviary at the beginning of the century: The mass murderer, articulate and confident ideologically, clothing well pruned, who runs the butcher shop while sitting behind a desk."
People act in unexpected ways; there are so many acts of heroism.
Peter Englund speaks of soldiers who have tried to catch a venereal disease among prostitutes in order to avoid the service at the front.
"It is the most grotesque in the trade of pus due to gonorrhea, that soldiers and buy žpþ splashed on the genitals in the hope of ending at the hospital," he writes.
"The more desperate to apply on the eyes, which translates into a blindness to life."
In the Swedish translation by Peter Graves, the prose of Peter Englund is flexible, but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to the task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, it captures how the war has triggered exclusively uncontrollable forces: Extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to the religion. "
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are a war.
The best books on the First World War are often indirect, as "Great War and Modern Memory" (The Great War and Modern Memory) Paul Fussel, or "A western nothing new," Erich Maria Remarque, rather than comprehensive.
The book by Peter Englund is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most damning that I read in a work non-fictionnelle.
I do not reveal.
But it is as if he had emerged from his book, seized from your hands this page with a list of people and burned with a match.
After a first misstep, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.

The Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, its presence underlining the risks and challenges to the Police Department.

The operation to clean Zuccotti Park of the demonstrators was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police "were prepared by observing the conduct of occupations in other cities.

The final training session took place on Monday evening, the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders for travel in the park are reached "at the last minute," said a accustomed, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise."
"The few police officers that I know and who have been called did not know that they would at Zuccotti Park," said the person anonymously.
"The only ones to know that they would be attending are at the top of the hierarchy of the Police Department."
The city has taken a lesson, where the secrecy of the operation.
On 14 October, the police wanted to clean the park but were postponed by hundreds of demonstrators informed of the plans.
The operation Tuesday involved officers from various police units, whose task forces throughout the neighbourhood - dozens of officers accustomed to neighborhoods particularly criminals.
Mr. Kelly said that many people were coming and going in the park during the day, in the manner of migrants. An hour of the morning was a favourable time.
"It should be done when the park was the least of people," he said.
Emergency services vehicles equipped with loudspeakers spots and gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The lights and loudspeakers resounding recorded messages appeared to intimidate the protesters.
While officers in community affairs entered the park with clear blue windbreakers, many protesters have simply brought their business and left.
No attempt has been hit before 1h 45 said the Police, which left the occupants to bring their cases.
Other teams of police officers were seen on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Reporters inside the park have been forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said that the measure was taken solely by security.
But according to many journalists, the police would have prevented from observing the intervention inside the park, severely selected by officers.
Mr. Browne said that trucks of television cameras present on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the police moved westward through the thick jumble of demonstrators, including baggage, the plastic lawn and leaf bags filled with clothes, teams of the Department of Sanitation, cleaning everything that the occupants left behind.
The few demonstrators who refused to leave were dragged. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of demonstrators took place near the kitchen of the camp, not far from the centre of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police moved to stop methodically.
A dozen people at the epicenter of the camp have clung together.
Finally, two people were chained to trees, "said Mr. Kelly.
The emergency services were called to cut the lock.
There have been no arrests in the park before three-thirty Kelly said.
According to the police, the clean-up operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most for "disturbing public order and rebellion."
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Department of Police, is the highest ranking official to be found on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the department detectives, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although now, "did not," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police patientaient along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of need.
Barricades were put on Cortlandt Street, one block north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, in the south.
We saw the Police widen the perimeter well beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most equipped with shields, have even been seen pushing people to the move.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most serious of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 am, south of Pine Street, one protester jumped on the rollover of a police car. Others were starting to puncture the tires of a truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood has arisen in the crowd.
Finally, a policeman and a demonstrator were hospitalized.
The union of school aid continues the city for redundancies
The union, which represents hundreds of school aid who lost their jobs last month plans to file a lawsuit against the city Wednesday for layoffs unnecessary and discriminatory. The disproportionate impact on schools serving disadvantaged pupils.
The prosecution is probably the ultimate weapon of the union, Council of the 37th District, to try to reverse the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school aides, parent coordinators and other employees, part of the less well paid the city, have lost their jobs on 7 October. The union leaders have compared these redundancies to a political vendetta for not having left the city access to a fund for health care led by groups of workers, and that would have enabled us to close the budget gap last spring.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied the accusation.
At a hearing before the City Council last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said that the dismissals were part of the budget ended in June.
A member of the Council responded, stating that the dismissals of school aid subsidies were not specified in the budget.
The officers of the Council of the 37th District said they would fill a notice of claim, warning the Education Department that he would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held Wednesday to formally announce the prosecution in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Dennis M. Walcott and the Department of Education of the City will be the defendant. The complainants will be represented by eight laid-off women workers, all black or Latino origin, like most school aid subsidies that have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman of the legal department of the city, said that the municipality has not yet seen the lawsuit and could not comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of the complaint obtained by the New York Times, the union would capitalize on the number of redundancies in schools in the poorest areas of the city to support his complaint against unfair treatment, saying that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to underfunding.
While there are no dismissal on Staten Island, and some barely in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school aid subsidies have lost their jobs in the 23rd District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of southern districts in the Bronx.
Noting the loss of five school aid on eight employed at Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68% of children live in poverty, the prosecution claim that "This is not a district of wealthy parents who can bring in money to close the budget gap."
The budget of the "public school 36 has been reduced to 3.26% this year. Funds have also been lost when the city has changed its calculation of the additional funding for each registration of" disadvantaged.
The union also says that the directors of secondary schools have been misled by some words in a memo authorizing the dismissal of coordinators of the parents.
The memo employed the term "surge" to describe the action, even if "excess" described more generally the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the complaints, "sixty-six coordinators of parents have been made redundant," and "not only because of excess."
Mission: Congress is an agreement on the issue of Libya
It appears that the Republicans and Democrats have reached an agreement on Capitol Hill on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
It took an uprising succeeded, the capture and death of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi as well as American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will make a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat, Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut, applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and American troops for their "courage".
"This resolution is to honor the courage of Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
"This is a bipartisan support to their democratic aspirations."
The language may be harmless but the debate on Libya has never been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties came into conflict, as well as with the White House over the wording of several resolutions to approve or not the U.S. military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain have submitted a resolution to authorize the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a wide margin bipartisan and has never been subject to a vote in the Senate.
But the same day of the failure of the bill, the House also rejected a measure to cut funding for US operations in Libya.
The American mission has been under a form of legislative purgatory - Congress sufficiently upset to criticize the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to pull the rug from under the feet.
The indecision of Congress has been overtaken by events.
Tripoli has fallen under the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Foreign Relations Committee "congratulate the Libyan people for their courage and determination with a view of freedom" and "congratulates the men and women of the U.S. armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people for their courage and professionalism."
The resolution also says "the national interest of the United States to reach an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
The new measure record all the support of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee or divisera-t-elle legislators as last June?
Senator and President of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) objected to the final version.
His spokesman said on Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of new project.
In the Capitol, the House will vote this week a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans in Congress, and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other issue, to get a floor vote in the House or the Senate.
Other lawmakers have so far failed to approve their amendments, but it is not without trying.
Goodlatte's amendment is part of the 68 constitutional amendments have been introduced in Congress, on a wide range of topics.
Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate - and others are slight variations of a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House only to the amendment to a balanced budget, and another handful who "control federal spending."
Some of these bills are identical, but give their support - including the new Republicans who want to gild their CV - the chance to boast of being the "author" of such a measure.
The law on the control of the budget (Budget Control Act) approved last August asked the vote of the House and Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms that members of Congress may serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) want to lift the limit of two terms for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr., Democrat - Illinois has proposed a number of amendments guaranteeing the right to a quality education and health care, among other topics.
An amendment prohibiting marriage between people of the same sex is perpetually proposed, as well as the amendment banning desecration of the flag.
Some lawmakers also want to authorize the cancellation of federal laws if two-thirds of the States are opposed.
Also eager that have been members to offer amendments, they are not as fast as in the past.
During the 111th Congress, lawmakers have proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The pace slows in the early 1990s, when members tended to offer more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the library of the Senate.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to have been added - the 27th - has been ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massacred but not beaten," says Gabrielle Giffords during his first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him at point-blank range in Tucson, the Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona emerged Monday evening in a televised, sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" of Broadway and said he wanted to restore rather than return to Congress.
During his appearance on the nightly news "20 / 20" on ABC, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords fought for forming sentences and needed assistance to walk.
The show has touched his return difficult following the ball that has fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, through the head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprise return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling.
In his first television interview since the shooting in January, which killed six people and wounded 13 others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described its restoration of "difficult".
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, replied "rather well."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special edition of "20 / 20", released on the eve of the release of the couple' s new book titled "Gabby: A story of courage and hope."
The special program has traced the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords since the shooting incident on 8 January.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first few weeks, have been seen on his hospital bed, a shaved head and a large scar on his forehead.
It is to use one or two fingers only, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair while doctors told him to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
Movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word: "What".
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word (" Toast ") to seek to change the menu of his breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords: Is she singing with physicians air Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free nervuus? '.
In an interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spent two hours each day with doctors, said he did not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was read an article about the shooting of March 12, when she was stopped and asked for the first time information on the six people killed in the incident.
The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a prison in Missouri and vigorously Treaty pending trial.
"There has been a lot of dead," said Gabrielle Giffords to Diane Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
During his recovery, said Mark Kelly to Diane Sawyer, she said, "I was beaten."
"So I would say, 'Gabby, you have not been beaten," said Mark Kelly.
You just have been massacred.
And you're going to get out, restore and come back even stronger than ever.
More pity that respect for the troops
The event: A gala to Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for homeless veterans of the City of New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad on impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines around him.
The crowd dressed in a suit and tie was standing on its feet cheering for.
"The military men and women, are seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of fundraising for the spring.
A military haut-gradé present at the gala, which was also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the United States, has given the role of troops in a different way.
"They have been presented as a kind of orphan," wrote the military haut-gradé in an e-mail.
I am sure that the organizers had good intentions.
I know.
But this was not respect. Just pity.
The impressions absolutely contradictory illustrate the difficult relations who settled between the military and an American public passion but often distant.
Are lavished praise the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, say some military.
The public is increasingly as if he was sorry for the men and women in uniform.
"We are not at all of the victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan will soon.
"But it seems that the only way to support us is to lock ourselves in the role of unlucky souls."
It is a very sensitive issue for the military leaders, who do not wish to seem not grateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of troops returners of the Vietnam War was much worse.
Thus, most conversations on the mercy are held in confidence among veterans.
After the return of his two sons of combat with the Marines, the retired colonel Mark Cancian has warned that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some people would watch with respect because they have been faced with insurgents and traveled to remote locations.
Others will ask if "a veteran angry and violent lurks beneath the surface," says Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work at the Government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that some people who were sending the interviews were subtle if he would be able to cope with the stress of a job requiring Washington immediately after his return from combat.
"When you start talking about the service, you are faced with negative impressions," said Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his son.
The difficulties of the military, in part, from the American indifference to the wars.
The victories are rarely praise from a country as unfamiliar with the army, which sees little direct benefits of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we value more heroism in the same way as the Second World War," said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people focus largely on the depth of the suffering of a soldier.
The troops are recognized for the number of services, the number of lost friends or the extent of the injuries.
The army in the growing pressure to crack down on rapists
This week, a hearing will decide whether capital 28 men and women will go to trial against the Army for alleged inaction on allegations of rape.
If necessary, hundreds of plaintiffs will prepare the next.
The soldier from 1st Class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant with 11 weeks the night where she says she was raped by a soldier.
It was in October 2008. It returned to its barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met with a colleague carrying a pack of beer.
He asked if he could join her in his room for a drink.
"It was an alarm signal," said Elizabeth Lyman.
But the Texane has set aside its concern.
I thought: No, he has 19 years.
"It is Texas," she said.
"I have to follow my intuition."
A few minutes after entering the chamber of Elizabeth Lyman, the man grabbed her from behind and thrown to the ground and raped, she claimed.
This week, on 18 November, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other members, some still in service and others not, anxiously awaiting the decision of the court in a trial that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and who will decide whether a lawsuit brought against the former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
They are accused of failing to halt the spread of rape within the army, in contravention of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, the trial was initially 17 plaintiffs. That number rose to 28 months - 25 women and three men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also argue that the army has not investigated, prosecuted or provided adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke said the military galonnées, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she said.
"People who are in a position to" eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leaders. "
The lawyer also said that since February, she has been contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of which could be part of future prosecutions.
His strategy: Instead of bringing all the plaintiffs in this case - putting all its eggs in one basket - it will initiate several trial, if necessary, to keep the pressure on.
The defence team, for the Department of Defense, led by the US attorney Neil MacBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detailing the defence strategy, and the fact that the army cannot be pursued by soldiers on duty or not for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 decision of the Supreme Court, known as the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries sustained by personnel on active service.
"The alleged evil is inherent in the military service of complainants" indicate the documents.
The Defense Department has refused to make any comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women have not, officially, the right to go into combat, this distinction is not only on paper: The front lines of the recent wars are rarely all-male.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, the teams of soldiers women play an increasingly important role, especially to come into contact with local women.
Result: On these two wars, 150 women soldiers have lost their lives - two thirds in combat situations.
It is time for the army to modernize said Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight: Three other trials are underway in most of its own.
The Yale Law School, the centre of legal services for veterans is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly encouraging an atmosphere misogynistic.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a lawsuit against the army, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorders" awarded to victims of rape in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women's Action Network (women), a group for human rights.
His group filed a lawsuit in December at the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in how to deal with applications for benefits for those who have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine bills independent of each other have been submitted to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded, according to the centre of intervention and prevention of sexual assault (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office of the Department of Defense.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assault is underestimated. Indeed, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this represents approximately 13.5% of 19,000 incidents this year.
The report released in March also explores the percentage of lawsuits: In 2010, 20% of cases recorded in the army have been the subject of a trial - half the percentage of the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in the case of Susan Burke describe their aggression as the first in a series of injuries.
In the case of Lyman, it informs the Military Police of rape less than an hour after the incident.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell 11 times in detail his rape at different police, doctors and commanders.
She suffered a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the blood of his attacker - due to a cut to his arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman is seated in front of a judge, in a trial in which it raised questions about his sexual relationship with her boyfriend earlier the day of its aggression.
Six people have testified as character witnesses for the crime, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day when the verdict was delivered," said Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions. I started yelling at the court."
"I have been placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember saying to my commander," This was not his trial but mine. "
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to see a military psychiatrist, who was eventually diagnosed with a personality disorder, making it unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was back on terms less than honourable, preventing him from receiving any advantage.
Does the case Lyman and other plaintiffs proceed or not, it is a long story, "says John Turley, a law professor at the Faculty of Law of the University of Washington.
However, he noted, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I have always criticised the Feres doctrine.
The army is decades behind because they do not have the same benefits and disincentives posed by the responsibility.
"The odds are heavily against them... but it is important that they try," he says.
These things happen only when the right have the will to fight.
If the trial is not in their favour, Susan Burke, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, will bring together hundreds of other plaintiffs in other trials.
"We will continue to fight against the army on this issue so that there will be no reform," she said.
Where up to what we would, one or the other of the two options.
The walls have eyes: Researchers are studying on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just a guy doing his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who has admitted having been taken to a murderous folly in Norway in July, leaving 77 victims, was facing its first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, it was far from being on cyberspace: He had spent much of the time prior to the attack on his computer, to discuss with some of the millions of nationalists who support the extreme right-wing groups on social networking sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how to find?
Easy... Connectez-vous to Facebook.
"We realized that he was not all that hard to find them," says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report by the think-tank of DEMOS on populism in Europe.
Facebook is so full of personal information, "says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to find the people they seek with scientific precision - how marketers have been doing it for years.
The team of Jamie Bartlett discovered that half a million members are fans of right-wing groups in Europe. It has targeted with announcements, but instead of creating a new group or product announcements invited users to respond to an inquiry. The questions related to their level of education, their attitudes toward violence and their optimism about their own future.
By coming into contact with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interrogate 10,000 followers of 14 right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"This is a new way of doing research," says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not at all surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups are men, young and against immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who combine online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screen."
The study of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook has become the new essential tool in the hands of scientists.
The focus groups, medical researchers and scientists use the site to examine all the issues that affect health issues like social trends, thanks to "I love," publications on the walls and updated statutes.
With more than 800 million active users add content on average three per day, "the supernova data" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research that the site's name appears in the title of almost 800% over the last five years.
For some, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people that you could not close in the street.
"Before, when you try to conduct investigations on the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You have to make the party, but you would never have allowed to enter," says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could provide a means to identify and address the health and social issues.
According to a recent study of D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, young students who spoke on Facebook feats intoxicated were much more likely to be alcoholics that students discreet about it.
Megan Moreno suggests that the fellow students, such as advisors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student whose status would talk too much alcohol.
"You can't treat a problem if you do not diagnose," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Health, behaviour and development of children at the Research Institute for children based in Seattle, says the Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and that would not be in another case not recognized."
Facebook also constantly access to information of its users.
The team of the site, which handles data has studied the statistics on the situation in love and the day of the Saint Valentine, the participation rate in the mid-term elections of 2010 and a national happiness index (thanks to information available only - the champions of the digital freedom have long argued that the site could make available its treasure trove of data to other people for research purposes).
But users of Facebook know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for power play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometres, the site is authorized to access your information.
But what happens when users of Facebook are part of a survey that they have not even heard of?
While researchers have clear instructions on how to collect the information other than via the Internet, it is anything else online.
"I do not believe that a large number of users have already thought about the fact that a researcher can study their profile," said Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the Laboratory of Knowledge of London, according to a 2006 study led by observing the Facebook walls of his students.
"As far as they know, the exchanges were seen by their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study to be completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on the wall of a user.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two completely different things," says Neil Selwyn.
That is why, despite his experience as a researcher, Neil Selwyn think a pad and pen are the best tools we can use.
"Nothing can replace the real world and the contact with people," he said.
"The social studies are expected to address the social aspect - and the social, it is not in front of a computer."
"Cold and inhuman ": First appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to having organized the two attacks that have made 77 deaths in Norway this summer, was described as a combatant "resistance" in his first appearance at the trial which takes place in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Temple of Norway," he said before a courtroom packed with 500 people.
"With regard to the competence of the court, I repudiate it, because you want your mandate of organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the facts, but I am not guilty."
The judge Torkjel Nesheim has stopped Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give him an opportunity to use the trial to express his opinions."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought with him a speech on paper, talk to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
The judge Nesheim has also asked the police to keep Breivik in custody 12 weeks, prohibited him from speaking to the media for four weeks and warned that the authorities would monitor very closely all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Some 30 relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came in the hope of watching Breivik in the eyes, others to be sure that it would be placed behind bars.
All attended the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found cold and inhuman," said one survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian television channel NRK.
"I" was not comfortable, but I personally a little progress after having seen and heard the suspect. "
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He watched the journalists and the survivors in the eye in entering and leaving the court.
Despite the odd idea that Breivik belongs to a broad movement of "resistance," the judge determined that he was not crazy. He also said that there was no evidence that he was acting with accomplices.
The attacks of July 22, appeared to be the work of an extremist rather than a whole group of radicals, which right now isn't perhaps some.
But this does not reduce the grief and confusion felt by the entire nation.
"I would have preferred that it looks like a monster, but this is not the case," said a relative of a victim.
"It would have been much easier."
7 lessons of the interview lost Steve Jobs, film this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October, some have compared to Henry Ford - distinguished by the engineering and inventor of the modern computer.
But what fans of Apple may find more revealing, in an interview with Steve Jobs regained recently and which will be released this week in the first part of a film on the main markets, is how this creative spirit had understood the process and workflow products.
It was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. He was identified with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as a breeder of charts - a man who believed that many business leaders had a "disease their suggesting that a great idea is 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work between a great idea of a product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely elaborated on the television series "Triumph of the Nerds." This series traces the birth of the computer, and he sits down for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and unusual conversation.
At that time, it was about 10 years that Steve Jobs was forced to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aimed at a popular adoption of the Internet.
While only a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he said that the main copies disappeared in transport.
It was only after the death of Steve Jobs that a full video is found in the garage of the director.
This video, slightly rebound, is the basis of the film in 68 minutes, Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be released in cinemas next Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to dislike the in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic to expose philosophies technological and business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs is clearly his thoughts, in order to give a precise answer.
We also find moments when the perfectionism of Steve Jobs resurfaced, where he seems eager to hear the questions of Cringely, kicking elbow to speed up and take questions or topics of greatest importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or iPhone, there is something eerily prescient on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs assesses what he considers good or bad for other companies and expressed his own vision of the future of computing.
It is one thing to read the posthumous assessments of the career of Steve Jobs, but there is something gross and inspiring on human rights that we see here, the dreamer anxious on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can be and should be.
He explains them and then put forth.
Here's a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
On the way he has learned to run a business:
"During all these years, I have always asked: 'Why do you do it?' And the answer is always the same: 'Oh, simply because we need to."
No one knows why, nobody is thinking in depth to things in a company.
This is what I discovered.
Steve Jobs continues in giving details on its efforts to simplify accounting for Apple.
Puzzled as to how the costs were registered - it often begins with a "standard cost" assessed for nose and then fitted with a "change" - it has developed an automated plant that guaranteed the precise calculation of trade costs.
The opportunity to play a round at the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the story of the "Blue Box" that he has created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack into the phone networks and free long-distance call.
The device has been the subject of numerous written in advance, but the euphoria of Steve Jobs here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He described how he and Wozniak have tested the box using a public telephone, and an appeal by connecting to a network AT & T to another while bypassing all satellites as possible.
"We enveloppions the ball of different things half a dozen times and you hurliez in the public telephone and you arrived a minute later the public telephone next door," says Jobs laughs.
"We were young and through the Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves capable of controlling billions of dollars of infrastructure in the world."
We do not know much, but we have created a small thing capable of great things. It was an incredible lesson, and I do not believe that Apple would one day have existed without it.
Steve Jobs is telling a wonderful round that he and Wozniak have developed: He phoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night by impersonating Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two accomplices in laughter just before the Pope himself is awakened.
On his love with technology (and canvassing of Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12 years, to the hunt for spare parts to manufacture a fréquencemètre, it is the number of Bill Hewlett in the directory and to pass a call.
Shortly after their conversation 20 minutes, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"This has had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company that I have seen in this age, and this formed my definition of a company and how employees are treated."
Steve Jobs has subsequently become one of HP employees to visit the research laboratories of the company, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first desktop computer ever designed."
It was as big as a suitcase, had a small cathode-ray tube. I fell in love.
The teenager I was returned with HP and began to write programs for the machine.
The improvisation of innovation:
Several times in the interview, Steve Jobs speaks to invent new products on a whim.
At the beginning of his career, when he moved to sell some printed circuit boards, a customer asked him to assemble a computer.
Working with only 30 days of credit, he had to address the assembly and the delivery of the aircraft.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember large disputes... I yelled back, arguing that it would take five years to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that was incredibly reliable.
On the large companies that is faltering:
Well before it does revive Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industry leaders would be wrong and losing control of their market share.
"If you work at IBM and Xerox, you better copier or a better printer, and after?"
You have the monopoly of the market, therefore, the company does not meet more success.
Sales and marketing can evolve, so [it is these types of people] that eventually lead firms and staff are put to the "gap of decision-making.
The genius in product that has led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who cannot imagine designing a good product compared to a bad product - the manual work required.
This is what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could hold all the computer industry.
It could be 10 times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They tore the defeat to the victory.
On innovation as art form:
"A huge part of manual work between a great idea of an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it is changing and growing."
You learn a lot on its intricacies.
There are trade-offs... Some things you can't do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories as well.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) in assembling to each other.
Finally, decisions are taken by personal taste. He is trying to expose you to the best products that men have created, and to try to make these things to the product that you create.
Picasso once said that the good artists copy and that the great artists steal.
We have always ashamed to steal excellent ideas.
This is part of what makes Macintosh exceptional. People who worked on were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who have just been the best computer scientists in the world.
If not for the computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another area.
Scalia and Thomas dining with opponents of the health law while the court meets
The day when the Supreme Court meets behind closed doors to discuss the issue of political discord, whether the opposition to the law of President Obama's health will be heard, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, have been noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm of lawyers who defend the case before the high court.
The event was last Thursday, when the nine justices gathered for a conference to discuss petitions for review.
One of the cases involved a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for conservative activists nationwide.
The justices agreed to hear the complaint, in effect, a monumental argument: Is expected in March next year, and the result will probably be conducive to the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing when the court's decision will be made.
The lawyer who will be held before the court and argumentera on the rejection of the law, will likely be Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
The law firm of Clement, Bancroft PLLC, was among the two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society) (Fédéraliste Society, a group of dedicated to defend the long-standing conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, is one of the trade associations who have challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business (National Federation of Independent Business).
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a hotel in Washington a few hours after the court conference on the case.
Was there, among others, Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate and sworn opponent of the law.
Guests at the dinner? "Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: The two judges were present at the events of the Société Fédéraliste for years.
And there is nothing that goes against the rules of conduct.
In fact, the judges are exempt from code of conduct governing the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they argumenteraient probably by the Code of Canon 4C, which states: "A judge may attend fundraising organizations linked to the right and although the judge could not be a speaker, a guest of honour, or on the programme of such an event."
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas near two law firms in the case, as well as a company with a financial interest, has been enough to alarm the activists of government ethics.
"This violation of ethics and blithe indifference to the code contradicted the statements of several judges that the Court follows the same rules for all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges drank and were having dinner and a fund-raising gala with lawyers who have cases pending before the court."
Their presence and their participation in the fundraising event debunks any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for the critics that they mix too easily the affairs of the court with the agenda of groups such as the Society Fédéraliste.
And the wife of Thomas, Ginni, is a conservative activist haut-profil.
Moreover, the Conservatives argue that it is the judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, and not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was solicitor general of the Obama administration when the initial objections to the law were filed at the court of first instance.
His critics have pushed for Kagan recused herself to hear the case, saying that she was too invested in defense of the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that it would do so.
Boeing has a record of 18 billion for airliners
The airline Emirates order 50 Boeing 777 airliners bi-couloirs, with the option to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners in Oman Air, a market estimated at more than $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary in what a company receives an order contemplating 50 of its products.
This is a case where the company in question is the manufacturer of Boeing aircraft and that the amount of these 50 had reached a record $18 billion.
Equally amazing is that Boeing has received this order: The Middle East, a gold mine of future orders for aircraft.
In forecasts published Monday, the Chicago company believes that airlines in the Middle East will need in the next 20 years 2 520 planes worth a total of $450 billion.
Over the weekend, Boeing has informed of the order of commercial aircraft, the most expensive in history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-couloirs.
This is the Dubai-based Emirates airline who has spent this command of the pharaoh.
Boeing announced at the Dubai Air Show 2011 that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more, which would raise the total amount of the order to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing said Monday that the company Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787-8, nicknamed Dreamliners, a model that boasts significant fuel savings and amenities for passengers.
The amount of these six aircraft "more than a billion dollars.
"This is clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, analyst at Morningstar.
"These customers in particular have immense value."
In the Middle East, the oil-producing countries have much of their airlines.
They have not only the means to pay these planes, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually detrimental for airlines because it represents the most significant costs - would not be as damaging as the country would earn money with the rise of oil prices.
This is important because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or delay orders for aircraft when the oil price increases, reported Dihora.
"They have a natural hedge," he said.
The order from Emirates strengthens the dominance of Boeing in the market for wide-bodied aircraft and help curb the attempt to encroachment of competitor Airbus with its A350 aircraft.
The victory of Boeing aircraft at the show comes four months after the announcement of Airbus to postpone the start of the larger version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus pushes its beginnings to increase the surge in response to customer demand to increase its capacity and autonomy.
The shares of the company Boeing rose 1.5 percent to reach $67,94.
The sister of Mexican President clearly beaten in elections of Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon said that drug traffickers have helped his opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for governor.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon appears to have lost its attempt to access to the office of governor of Michoacán during violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers have promoted one of his opponents.
Early results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was leading the race for governor of the state of the west.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and particularly yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for the Michoacán but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon to radio in an interview on Monday after the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our election agents... They took the ballot boxes, have set up roadblocks... and have forced people to vote for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until losing the presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in the Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have emerged that little Calderon, who was leading in opinion polls before election day.
Calderon, the candidate of the Conservative Party of his brother, the National Action Party, or PAN, has refused to recognise Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, candidate of the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, which currently holds the position of governor, came third, a painful defeat before the presidential election of 2012 for this left divided and unhappy.
Aureoles has also refused to recognize the results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the state, has denied any connection with drug traffickers and has urged other candidates to accept the results.
The Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specialized in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
It is the home state of President Calderon, and he chose the Michoacán to launch a military offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Yet, the violence has persisted.
A week before the election of a mayor of the NAP was assassinated as he campaigned for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates have renounced locally to the campaign by fear.
However, for the PRI, so corrupt that the elections of Michoacán have air, a victory will help the party in its tracks.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo since Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for the next year."
The BASD urges Asia to help the euro zone
The Asian Development Bank called on India and China to prepare to help the eurozone out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Director General of the BASD based in Manila, said that the two economic powers to the fastest growing regions in the world should "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the eurozone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral arrangements.
He warned the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at the difficulties of Europe of a "indifferent eye" and noted that Asian financial support for the leaders and the resources of the EU would "avoid a collapse in the long term of the global economy.
"We are all together in this crisis."
"Therefore anyone can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected up to a certain point, but it is not immune."
"So if China and India can help, that there are no limits."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of borrowing Italian is dangerously soared and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The flourishing of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe has spurred the fear that the global economy is in recession, and the appeal of the major emerging economies to join together to help the euro zone to find a solution.
Mr. Nag raised hopes that the IMF would bring any assistance, but he also said that bilateral assistance - such as buying bonds of US financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered a greater negotiating power of the Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Minister of Commerce and Industry of India, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro zone since its own economy now suffers from a drop in exports and a dwindling inflows of foreign capital.
"Nobody wants the euro zone remains unstable and agitated," he said.
"We have tremendous challenges ahead and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"This is not a choice, it is an imperative, because where would we find jobs for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the rich when they face their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically very difficult to accept aid to Europe to 1.2 billion Indians, including at least 800,000 live on $2 a day or less.
"One day, they will discover that the Greeks retire at 50 years and they go on vacation in the sun and they will have difficulty swallowing," he said.
Lee Howell, the chairman of the World Economic Forum, also questioned why the reserves of India should be used to keep many Greek officials well-paid jobs poorly managed that generate losses, as in the rail sector.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis could cause "significant impact" across Asia.
Forecasts of the BASD of economic growth of 7.5 per cent in Asia in 2011 / 2012 face now "risk of loss" because of the threat.
He noted that emerging markets vulnerable needed to develop "contingency plans" to protect themselves from an economic downturn and large capital flight.
The Pentagon's stern warnings about the potential reductions of defence
The Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, has upped the pressure on Congress Monday, warning that the automatic cuts imminent would undermine national security. It has triggered a chain reaction of corridors of the Pentagon to the battlefields of Afghanistan through the civilian gatherings.
The Pentagon already digest 450 billion of cuts in the next decade, but is now feared that an additional $600 or more cuts is imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting in what is called the kidnapping, 23% cuts, as well as the freezing of many new projects.
"Such a significant reduction, and applied indiscriminately, would make most of our vessels and construction projects unfeasible - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and serious damage to other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to separate us from a number of our civilian personnel, and because the reduction would be imposed if quickly, we would almost certainly send civilians on leave without pay in order to achieve the objective."
"These changes would undermine the faith of those who support our troops and seriously damage our preparation."
The cuts would ultimately affect the fighting troops, Panetta.
"Although the funding in time of war accounts of contingency operations abroad is not directly affected by the kidnapping, the war effort would be adversely affected by the disruptions in the core budgets," warned Panetta.
"The Contracting personnel would be reduced, causing delays in the contracts and the supervision of contract that support the war."
"The personnel manager salaries would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to suppliers of war, and the legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequence of a kidnapping on the Department of Defense would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as the undisputed global leader of military power."
"We are vehemently opposed to this drastic action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon at the publication of the letter to Panetta.
"This is not a result with which we can live, and this is certainly not the one that we should impose".
"The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen."
The letter to Panetta and recent warnings of senators are increasing the pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon cuts, remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly vocal about possible cuts, even if it is reached itself at the highest position in the Pentagon with years of expertise in the budget to Congress and the White House and knowing that it was facing difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, Defense Secretary has painted a bleak picture of what could happen - a soldier with a shell, but no core.
"This is a ship without sailors."
"It is a brigade without bullets."
"It is a fighter aircraft, without enough trained pilots."
"This is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission," Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a force depressed, unprepared and unable to cope with potential adversaries."
"De facto, it invites aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta has set out specifically how further reductions could "generate significant operational risks: Time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limitations on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and risk assumed unacceptable in combat operations in the future."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest projects could the axe, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
That list included the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new bomber planned, the new generation missile submarine, the new littoral combat ship and the new vehicle, which would replace the Humvee army and navy.
Ending the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but his supporters say it is an essential step to improve and response to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to spot a lie
A look at recent headlines indicates how the deception and lies are ubiquitous in everyday life.
The Republican nominee Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women, with each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators have been accused of perjury for allegedly covered reports that a football coach to retire sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone saying to US President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie is destroyed careers and convulsé countries.
The member of Congress from New York and celebrity of the Internet Anthony Weiner, rose for a fool by issuing swift denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of violations of campaign financing related to the coverage of an extramarital affair.
And then, none of those who lived the history will never forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton has triggered by lying in his second term on even even his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating on tests of school and university are legion.
There have been cases where teachers have given the test answers to students to ingratiate itself on their performance.
Mentors who should teach the contrary to send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How many deception let's meet?
On any given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are lies piles.
Another study showed that foreigners are deceiving three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Identify or locate lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game similar to, say, charades, where the aim is to scream: "I had," the detection of fraud is a serious industry knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities have conducted a thorough search of such projects, including psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths about the lies were démystifiés.
The liars you look in the eye.
They bégayent, turn red or are not always.
Not to conclude that the liars are difficult to detect and difficult to detect.
A lie detector could discover the truth by examining the structure of the declaration, the facial micro-expressions, the formation of the issue and the response time.
I spent several years to review the scientific findings in the vast body and always emerge from the knowledge of deception, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern jurisdiction that is easy to learn and useful to navigate our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, negotiation or management.
The good liars are entitled to read the other, making them feel comfortable in managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more lies "focused on them," while women are more lies "focused on other" - usually to protect the feelings of someone - that married people lie less often to their partners that unmarried people, but that the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are seen as a mécréant, others will feel less guilty of lying.
How can you tell if someone is lying?
First, look at the normal behaviour of your subject.
This is called "establish benchmarks."
This helps to provide a benchmark for measuring future changes.
Watch the posture of your subject, the laughter, the voice quality.
You need to know if someone is moving his feet in order not to launch unfair accusations when you see drag their feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for clues of misleading verbal and non-verbal cues.
Consider these indices as red flags, not evidence of deception.
People are misleading the upper body when they try to remember their history, they can point their feet at the door, look toward an exit, change of posture significantly or submit a relief "post-interview" - a sigh of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult questions are placed.
The interrogators often indicate that maintenance is completed just to seek to trigger the reaction post-interview.
Also, beware the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson skidded using the past while claiming that his wife murdered was alive, triggering a national search for him.
Individuals can also use a misleading language outpaced: "I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky..." or repeat entirely a difficult issue.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "waffle" in its response to a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... if I remember goods... to my knowledge."
This makes the perceptual response rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize the deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid victimization by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline will be diverted after the threat of late approval of the United States
A few days after that, the Obama administration has threatened to delay the approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, angering the unions while appeasing environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline said that it is ready to redirect the project to put it back on track.
TransCanada said Monday evening that it will move the pipeline from the environmentally sensitive area of sand dunes of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will still win approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference on Capitol Hill in Nebraska.
The official of TransCanada, Alex Pourbax, says the company remains confident that it will eventually get the approval of a pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the State Department last week that it would delay its decision to award a federal permit for the project until it receives new studies of potential routes to avoid areas of the Nebraska Sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a vast underground water sources.
"It is a real way forward," said Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska to Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department would probably have postponed any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials deny the involvement of politics in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as "the decision by the State Department, and he expressed his support.
The pipeline of 2,735 km stretch from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would carry 700,000 barrels per day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, it would have to pass through six states.
He is hated by environmentalists but loved by working groups, which have relied on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are pressing for a law to force the remoteness of the region of Sand Hills and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The environmental impact statement in the State Department has found that the project would have only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry said that the department's inspector general has ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focused on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest in the program.
The other is whether a company that has been hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice in its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly caused a young child to vomit fear
A family of New York says the Disco diva Patti LaBelle launched in a shooting rampage in the lobby of their apartment building in Manhattan, terrified their daughter to the point where she vomited fear.
The singer's tirade "Lady Marmalade" spooked the small Geneviève Monk aged 18 months, to the point that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders," and "the heightened fear of foreigners," said her family during the trial of the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on 10 November last year while the theatrical technician Kevin Monk, his wife kindergarten teacher, Roseanna, and Genevieve preparing to travel as a family.
While Kevin Monk would pick up the car, Roseanna Monk down into the lobby of the building of the Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, Geneviève in his arms.
Roseanna Monk stated that she had stopped near the door and had asked his daughter for a time.
"Someone came up behind me and said: 'Do you know what your daughter?' I said 'yes' and I went out," she says.
Labelle chastised with anger the pregnant woman.
"She told me of an aggressive tone:" You should not let your daughter near the door, "said Roseanna Monk.
"I replied:" What you say or think I am not interested. "
She became enraged and started using expletives - the word "and the word" "a strong voice...
She had a bottle of water and started to sprinkle water from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Geneviève became hysterical.
"I said to her: 'Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
Labelle jumped on the mother - who was always Geneviève in his arms - and had to be restrained by his entourage who has carried over to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so hard that she began to vomit, "she said.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but received no response.
The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle did not return calls for comment.
The complaint seeks unspecified damage, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money to a charity for children with cancer.
"The goal is to take Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," said Mr Davis.
"This kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially against a kindergarten teacher with a child aged 18 months."
Climate adversity has slowed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario Lopez Valdez, Sinaloa unemployment and informality increased foreign investment has fallen and the economy shrank
2011 is a year in which he will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, this is the first year of Government of Mario Lopez Valdez, auto-appelé of change, which has generated great expectations regarding the advances of the economy, but given the climate adversity at the beginning of the year, the increase was not observed, there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
The temperatures in February, besides causing loss of trillions to the agricultural sector, have limited the ability of the economy to growth, have caused a contraction in economic activity in general by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, supported mainly by the historic decline of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which has affected the dynamics of other economic sectors.
According to the report of assignments by the frozen out by the Mexican Council of Rural Development Soutenable, there has been damage to 582 million 835 hectares, including a 78,03 percent suffered damage and the rest of 21.07, percent suffered partial damage, the main crops affected were vegetables, corn and chick peas.
The economic downturn has generated, until November, a steady rise in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the unemployment rate in the state during the first three quarters of the year there has been a rapid increase, because during the January to March 55 000 053 sinaloens were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent Population Economics Active, in the second quarter the rate became 5.28 percent and from July to September, the average has continued to raise up to 6.19 percent, a rate that represents more than 74 thousand sinaloens unemployed, an increase compared to the first half of 18,000 969 people.
Less liquidity of
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to the economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Sciences Economiques et Sociales of the UAS, rising unemployment can be explained by the actions carried out by public policy.
"What we are seeing is an increase in unemployment, which is due to various factors, among which the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by the approved legislation in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who earn dollars in an illicit manner, it is not easy work for the win, they invest them and use them in something," he says.
Migration detained
Lopez Cervantes said that rising unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the state to go to work abroad, the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because entering they have already struggling to find work, these people to stay here and there are sources of work, which means that unemployment rise," déclaré-t-il.

Reactions to
The representatives of the business sector, the first year of Government of Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there has not been a harmonization of the wishes of the various sectors, including the State Government.
"The performance of the economy of Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we must work hard to regain the ground we lost this year in 2012 we must double our effort, it was necessary to align the efforts of everyone, especially the already synchronized this new team of Government, hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slow pace
Loredo López said that events such as the frozen at the beginning of the year have retained the economy of the state and have restricted his performance and growth.
"The low economic fluxe is a product of several events, among which jellies, one of the main effect has been a slow economy that is fast enough to generate economic dynamism that makes it possible to have an acceptable level he flow in the trial, products and services, and therefore, at the end of the year we are far below the expectations that we had," he says.
Redefine the importantnot
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation for Mexican Sinaloa has said that it wants to harness the State towards productive activities more dynamism.
"In general terms, we found that it worked, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme which redefined the role and the economic direction of the state, because it is important that detonates the full potential of material and human resources of Sinaloa," he says.
Much to do
The president of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future that channels better government efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to give good results in various fields, in terms of economic development there is some progress, but it is important to develop a euro in the long term," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown advances in the way of public policy management.
"There are elements which enable us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that it was a lot of work and the Government is aware of the fact that there is still much to be done," he says.
Sentenced to 8 kilograms of marihuana
A person resident Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and a fine of 100 days in possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Prosecutor General's Office of the Republic has informed that the small trafficker sentenced is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for crimes against health, in its variant of possession of marijuana for sale.

Debts to the contributions to books
The works of social enshrined in programs like Hábitat, Rescate of Spaces Públicos and 3 x 1 para migrants may not be finished where to register serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, "said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of Municipal Social Development said that even if the construction programs have progressed, they find themselves in a situation of risk, because the Government of the State has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions that exceed the 11 million pesos in the three programs.
He noted that in total, the investment of these three programs is approximately 50 million pesos, which the state must provide the 25 percent and so far only the Federation and the Municipe provided resources for books, therefore there is the possibility of a delay in their final stages.
"They should make a contribution of 12 million, and despite the fact that the year will soon conclude they have achieved nothing, although since July they should give us a part," he says, "and we, to register no delays, we started the books and we have made a lot of progress, but we need the money."
He noted that last year, during the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the state had not paid contributions, therefore, at the beginning of the administration the Municipe has had to request a credit to cover the $7 million that the administration had not provided at that session.
"We had already suffered in the previous six-year period because the state had not had the economic capacity to participate and programs will continue to operate and this year we, to have access to these programs, we duu resources to cover what the state had not paid," détailla-t-il.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment on the part of State authorities to provide these resources, he said they had asked the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the management for the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
"They must provide almost 12 million, and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they have given nothing."
The Court validates "the analog cutoff" in Mexico in 2015
The substitution of analog data reported by the exchange is one of the most important that the world has suffered the last few years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversy that the Senate and the House of Deputies made against the presidential decree that advance the so-called 'analog cutoff "from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes needed to overturn have not been met.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón has not exceeded his authority when he issued the decree detailing the actions to take to make the transition to digital television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for not having reached a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or non-constitutionalité of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft, prepared by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutionnel, due to the fact that the regulation on radio and television is an award reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (COFETEL), in violation of the principles of subordination and reserve law.
In favour of the project have voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversy to challenge the decree and assuming the complaints, the Minister Sánchez Cordero has suspended the implementation of the decree and all actions planned for the digital transition.
The plenary meeting of ministers resolved also dismissed the complaint by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project with the Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the president said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Government cannot structure through general standards for measures that the government is preparing to.
"I do believe that if it did it would affect the independence of the regulatory body," and he recalled that the public policy planning in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Government, which has a constitutional mandate the leadership of the state.
The substitution of analog reported by digital) is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in the last few years, and this translates into a better use of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more channels.
Postponing the change, has soutenu-t-il, would postpone the benefits of digitalisation implies a decision of public interest that not only has a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security."
These issues, has souligné-t-il, "require the operation of a whole system establishes, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, includes a group of powers that the Constitution gives the power of the executive branch of the State."
He recalled that a large number of countries throughout the world have already finished the digital transition, and they have done through the Executive, despite the fact that they had the highly specialized technical bodies.
We cannot conclude that the Commission, in issuing the decree challenged, has invaded a form the jurisdiction of Congress, because it provides in the administrative sphere respect laws issued by the Legislative, assura-t-il.
Analysis of the possibility of a "vote by vote" in Michoacán
According to the data highlighted by PERs, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes for 879 6 thousand 74 minutes total.
The possibility of the count "vote by vote" is a reality in regard to the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where according to data highlighted by the preliminary election results (PER) the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes for 879 6 thousand 74 minutes total.
In this sense, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (EMI), Maria de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, the past 9 November, the electoral body approved a set of guidelines to harmonize local standards to the federal electoral reform.
It will be recalled that Michoacán has not approved or its Political Constitution and the Electoral Code of State or the Electoral Act, Justice, at the same time that the state Congress approved reforms that will shortly before the legal deadline for the electoral process can enter into force and the governor Leonel Godoy Rangel failed its publication in the deadlines specified by the Act of the Official Journal of the state, with the argument that he had some objections.
The same 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the (SCJN) has solved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Authority and described as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the representative of the state for constitutional reform, because he did not have the right to "sanction or challenge."
Interviewed on the possibility of "vote by vote," Maria de los Ángeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the guidelines by the General Council of which it will be possible to achieve the total and partial counts the votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the counting of votes, one or more electoral packages, it may be that: The results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of voting and counting in the case of the ballot box is not among the president; or there are errors or obvious alterations of minutes.
In addition, the total count of votes received in all the ballot boxes from the election can be achieved when there is an indication of the fact that the difference between the candidate presumed winner of the election and had the second place in the poll is equal to or less than a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session is a petition from the representative of the party or coalition that made the second of the candidates reported.
The total amount of voting can also be achieved if at the end of the joint statement, it follows that the difference between the candidate and the presumed winner of the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is a petition from the representative of the political party whose candidate came second, in which case we will exclude the electoral packets that have been subject of partial count.
It should be noted that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PPRD, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of 923 total minutes.

The new Italian government will be formed Wednesday
The prime minister designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy to present the new government will face a crisis that brought the country to the brink of economic disaster
The prime minister designate, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with President of Italy to present the new government which will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has jeopardized the entire Eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed Sunday, would meet Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that it can form the government.
It is expected that a cabinet composed in its majority by technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will assume his post.
Monti said he would submit to the president the result of his conversations with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner for journalists.
Monti has not said explicitly that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
"The framework is now well route," he added.
Monti has completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than normal, while Italy fight a political and financial crisis that pushed the cost of its debt to unsustainable levels.
The new administration headed by former European Commissioner Monti should approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to recover confidence in Italy who had been affected.
Highlighting the pressure on Monti to dispatch, volatility in the bond yields on 10-year Italian BTP above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland have duu be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian Confindustria employers, told the media after his meeting with Monti: "We have said that we would support the government."
We believe that this Government is the last chance for Italy to sort of this emergency.
The chances of success of Monti have been boosted significantly by the support of the party VDPHDVLQWKHSUHFHGLQJZHHN of Silvio Berlusconi, in which the crisis was forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti will have a good result," said to the press Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of VDPHDVLQWKHSUHFHGLQJZHHN, the Italian party the largest, is significant because until now many of its members were opposed to the Government of majority technocrat that Monti form.
Parliamentary support
The new government of Monti must have a strong parliamentary support to implement what probably will be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could cause a new and devastating attack of financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks has added to the pressure by observing that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began Monday its consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups and organizations juveniles and women.
He will end his tour of meetings Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, who has authorized an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between the uncertainty on the success of the new prime minister.
Save Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, it would be too much for the current financial defences of Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should persist in future elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions on the fact that politicians will only time to implement the reforms before the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it must be formed only by specialists, an index of their objections to a process required by the financial pressure.
Political sources reported that the mutual suspicions and disagreements between the parties make the trial to include political figures.
The experience of Spanish is higher than that of the Costa
Of the 22 players called Spain, 10 participated in more than 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 summoned participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, comparing the 22 summoned by the two countries for the friendly today, at 3: 05 p.m. at the National Stadium in San José.
While the national champions and of Europe, the number one in the FIFA monthly ranking, record an extensive record of games inter-sélectionnes Class A, the Habs only has the defender Michael Umana as the only one to have 50 international matches.
This figure was reached the last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernandez.
The Spanish footballers who play in the League of stars and powerful clubs in the Premier League of England, maintain the intense activities in the national championships in league and cup and disputes in European Cup as the Champions League.
There is also the experience with Furia Espanola during the playoffs complicated of the World Cup and the European football.
The Costa Rican footballers, in contrast, have international experience limited to an area, as the Concacaf, which is considered a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the record of the selection is the Spanish goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who earlier Saturday against England (0-1 in London) tied the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today against the Habs and they will impose a new record for Spain, 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, cerebral wheel of Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA to the other side of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above, with 126 and the centre front of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The figure centenary is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
The share of Costa Rica, and nearly Michael Umana are the left lateral Junior Díaz, with 48 attendance and the striker Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five have exceeded the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, with 32, Randall Azofeifa, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The less.
Those who have less. With more than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 attendance, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest can't even 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, Costa Rica Victor Bolivar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson begins again.
The history of Spain striker David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
In Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who has the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"" Go to Costa Rica is a dream that became reality '
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament, Pearl Jam, said that the group is prepared to offer one of his best concerts on Sunday at the National Stadium.
They waited more than 20 years, but the group assured that for them it will be a dream come true to occur in this country.
It is the founding member and bassist Jeff Ament said, speaking exclusively with Viva, Brazil, last week.
The group is in the South American wing of his tour of celebration of two decades of work and Sunday 20 will be its only stop in Central America.
That day will be on the National Stadium, from 19: 30 hours, next to the group of Los Angeles The X and nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt of the conversation, including the full transcript is located in La Nacion on the Internet.
Costa Rican to his followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen to Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans live?
Go to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is the second time in South America and Central and so far this has been great.
I spent in Costa Rica only once the holidays; it is a beautiful country and I think that we will be able to spend a few days.
We therefore émotionne to our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the group, the fans live with the previous days.
What is your message to your most ardent followers?
Thank you to stay beside us for all these years.
There have been 21 years before we get to Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so long and we regret the fact that so much time has had to spend up to the concert.
Some people are already saying that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does that adds a bit of pressure on your visit.
Some of the biggest shows that we have offered during the last 21 years have taken place in the past two weeks.
We offered a huge two shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that this has put us in good shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are very eager to produce.
We love this country, we love to surfing and the jungle; for the two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have a lot of friends surfers and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and waves are unbelievable there.
My friends would always be surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to make surfing; this is what we have learned, through the age who enjoy surfing.
Seeing the tour, you have offered shows enormous, with many songs.
What do you planned for your presentation to Costa Rica?
As we have never produced there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to do the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and give our fans a good and various.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What is this?
I believe that this is partly because we have nine discs and we can interpret more than 120 songs and everyone likes of different songs, so it is very difficult to choose which songs interpret each evening.
When we have two or three songs in the repertory that we have not seen for a very long time, it helps us to stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked the songs and that we can have forgotten.
The fact that the show is more interesting for us, and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you are celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
In retrospect, it is difficult to believe everything you have succeeded?
Yes, absolutely.
First, I believe that none of us could have imagined that we would form a large rock group, and the fact that we have done for more than 20 years is that it seems like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the ability to continue to make music together we émotionne much.
We love and we love to create music.
We are fortunate to go to places in the world that we have always wanted to go.
Things could only get better for us.
That means to you having been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
This has always been an honour for us to form part of this group of major groups.
We are very friends with people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is unusual.
From time to time, a group out of a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups out at the same time in the same city.
We are proud and it is an honour for us to form part of the group of Seattle.
We play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we have been in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden in their tour, so we are lucky to still be friends with all of them, and it is an honour for us to form part of the sound of Seattle, which has emerged.
It is also very strange that a group like the your remain united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only this is much more time than many groups are normally.
First, I believe that we are all lucky to be alive and, secondly, we are all concerned for others.
We are all friends and through this musical boulevards that give the freedom to experiment.
We have confidence in each other with the music, and it can only get better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you can do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We ensure that we do not spend too much time on tour because it is easy to fall into the hands of big numbers and people who love your music.
If we do not forget that people are there for the music, it helps us to remember that he must respect the music and which has made, without getting in mind the fact that it is famous and a rock star, which is not really to any of us.
How do you remember your project, Mother Love Bone?
I believe that we are writing good songs and early this was big.
We were a group for almost three years and we have not issued a disk before the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
There has been a lot of frustration for the fact that it took so little, and the most important is the fact that we are still friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), which began in the group with us and when I listen to a song or I see a photo I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how it made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about the music, football and many other things with him.
It was a human being surprising and we lack.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
It is true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you have chosen for the opening?
Yes, the production we sent videos with various proposals and that has been the group that we liked the most, therefore we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer online, and it must be very distracting.
What you always change the words of Yello Ledbetter online?
It is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
It was he who sings and I think he did it with the first words he imagines.
As bassist, what are its influences?
There are so...
Among the first I remember there was Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, that I could talk all afternoon on the bassistes that I love.
How has managed Pearl Jam has maintained under the grunge despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a bit disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the groups that I just mentioned, Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who have emerged at the same time, and if it is in now, I think it is wonderful, because it is a music that is worth listening to and groups like Mudhoney are now the best music than ever.
At first, his music had a more obscure and now it has become more positive.
What is this change?
It is interesting, because I think there are songs from the new album, which seem to be more lenient, but there are also songs such as The End or Just Breathe qualified as songs very unclear, although they may sound a little positive.
With the two, when Ed has played for me, I cried when I listened to them and they are deeply obscure songs.
I think that if you grow and there is a trauma in your life and you lose a relative or friend, these things are beginning to influence your art and your music and songs, without doubt, is that for me.
I also believe that we can also be pleased and even as it can be to make music.

Fujimori, 72, who is serving a sentence of 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his 1990-2000 government suffers from a variety of ailments, including cancer for which he has been operated on four times and which is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, said on Canal N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days in the National Institute of neoplastic diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength in his legs.
Aguinaga said that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of remission of the sentences for humanitarian reasons, without doubt, he said that he wants because he feels he is innocent.
It has been operated on four times of cancer of the tongue, it has a weight loss of 18 pounds, and other diseases, such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst, pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulation problems in the feet, said the doctor.
Fujimori is serving imprisonment since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the police.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of a squadron of annihilation of the army, which has operated clandestinely during the early years of his government.
Mujica trip to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official procession, who heads the Uruguayan President Jose Mujica, and various ministers and bosses, introduced on Tuesday a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two nations and deal with political themes of the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with the political authorities, commercial and a meeting with the Uruguayan community residents in Mexico, according to the agenda released by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara, will be "conducive to the exchange of information in the political affairs between the two nations," according to information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its web page.
According to local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France, which took place when the agent of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, has included the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy has threatened to exclude from the international community, the countries that continue to be of tax havens, a statement that led to the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations its ambassador to the European country.
Mexico President since November the G20, a group of emerging and developed stronger in the world, and has in place with the South American country, since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to send the agreements to exchange tax to break the "gri list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not enforce all the standards of international cooperation in tax matters.
On the trade front, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (TLC), which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The mustachioed plumber passes to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has struggled, tireless, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but it had never been done in three dimensions: In "Super Mario 3D Land" will contend for the love of the young in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month to stores across the world, has been designed from the outset to fully exploit the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, who can play in 3D without glasses.
"Mario is the man who must say as must operate stereo without glasses," said the head of press for Nintendo in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game from Nintendo originally designed for the media," because so far of success as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" was adaptations of existing titles.
The spokesman for Nintendo argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a video game "accessible", which allows some fast and fluid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: The first part is "simple" to hang users less skilled.
Once overcome, most experts will make a "second round" to the levels of the game, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users can choose to real time between an "aggressive" or that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome the various challenges and "does not succumb to optical illusions."
The incursion of Super Mario in all three dimensions also requires the return of the character to a portable console, which was more since 2005.
In the video games, Nintendo is a nod to the followers of the saga and repeat the success of previous games, which lies in the fact that the mustachioed plumber must be mined platforms of peril for free to Princess Peach.
Even if I find anything new in the movement, settings, costumes and enemies and also in the case of Luigi "feasible".
Colom gives its consent to the extradition of Portillo in the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had ordered for the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to meet in the United States for conspiracy to launder US $70 million.
This is the end of trial for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern countries calling for Portillo to judge.
In a press conference, Colom said that her decision follows the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account the fact that a lower court had already ordered his extradition.
He said that during his tenure he had not helped "in any judicial resolution and he had given way to all extraditions that he had known.
From Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and grievous bodily harm, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom made calls after exhausting all legal and constitutional bodies to try the former agent of the interval 2004-04.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court, and the Court of Constitutionalité (CC), Portillo should be extradited after resolving his legal situation in Guatemala and having secured his human rights.
Portillo was complete for embezzlement was million of the Ministry of Defence when he was president, who was the trial that preceded the extradition, but the prosecutor appealed and has revived the case.
Trinijove helped to 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the marginalization of young people without training
The results of the first 25 years of life of the entity of social support Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received assistance to overcome a difficult situation during the past quarter century.
Added to this is the centenary of jobs obtained by this social group.
The anniversary has served yesterday to take stock in an act celebrated in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats in which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the neighbourhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping people trained, without work, with drug problems or marginalized.
Yesterday's commemoration in Sant Andreu has concentrated a large number of bodies and institutions in the 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The diverse political representation, electoral season, showed the unitary character of the work done by Trinijove.
In addition to the president of the Catalan regional government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the act, the former Minister of Education socialist, Ernest Maragall and the former mayor, deputy mayor and current councillor éco-socialiste Ricard Goma.
Have also seen in the Great Hall of Fabra i Coats, the current Minister of Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the Director General of charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
DSS said Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that currently is also, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis."
The president gave Trinijove as an example to fight the bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new to the entity and for the work that it does," he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-fêtes, evacuated
The invaders had 11 of the 13 apartments in the building, Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants abandoned the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that residents of the number 51 Rue Balmes lived ended.
Twelve people have abandoned at noon yesterday voluntarily the building they occupied illegally and where they staged micro-fêtes which désespéraient neighbours, by court order and without the need of an intervention by the police.
At the end of the operation has changed the lock on the door to prevent recurrence.
"From this day there will be access control," affirmât administrator.
The squatters who had invaded 11 of 13 apartments of the building - the rest were habités-, have won the electrical installation and part of the water, in part to paint the walls and leave residues of any kind, especially boxes of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of the masses, which lasted until two days and désespéraient tenants.
Beside the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that since the occupation of the building his case has declined an 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of the property was the competence unfair, because they were selling the drinks to three euros, while in the club they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of a local recreation had to respond to complaints from neighbours for noise, while, according to it, the problems were not caused by clients of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the occupied homes and especially the celebrations there, which were more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to neighbors resentful of the area.
The head of the disco explained that the problems were so large that it has reached an agreement with the owner of the building and it is nine months that he "forgave him" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that the last few weeks they had received more complaints from neighbours for this situation.
The group's president, the PP mayor, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to deal with the problems of life in common and civility that it caused to residents and the degradation of the area."
The popular leader explained that before the summer only a floor of the building was occupied, but last month the squatters had occupied all floors of the building, and almost all of the apartments and that in some apartments there have been robberies.
It is in this sense, he added that "we must put an end to impunity and be relentless against anti-social behaviour generated in the property."
Also yesterday, the main Catalan) (the local police evacuated a building at Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m. the police moved to the number 35 Rue Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbour who had observed that four people moved into the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects coincide on the desirability of convening beyond the controversy over fees
The competition on the 16 gates again opened the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid 1980s, at the height of the Metropolitan déjà-éteinte Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration has printed posters promoting Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the large park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with the Central Park in New York.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park has become again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital is the only one that focuses not on the north-south axis, if not top (mountain) - (sea).
As the Collserola Natural Park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was not Central Park or Yellowstone, with wild boar in the role of the Yogi Bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the mayor convened a méga-compétition composed by 16 competition for all access doors to Collserola.
A door to the idea of park, no doubt.
It is that, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question appears alone: Collserola: Park or mountain?
The competition, both in terms of its organisation such as the reflection on the city is a topic of conversation all the architects of Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme, including two members of this ancient caste of elected officials are talking about when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this is one of the few opinions on which coincide three architects of Barcelona, university professors, who are presented.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel modol and Marta Bayona: The competition is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the littoral front, "it is necessary to" discuss "the mountain front" because the speech by Ildefons Cerda, blocks green has not been led to end.
"We have to start from the basis that the park more extended Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its accessibility.
Collserola is more complex, "gave the verdict the architect for which the title of" doors of Collserola "contains a" trap lexicon ": We must think about them "as the access to a park, but the delimitation of areas in which we must act."
Modol, as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, described the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "a few perils."
The perils that are derived from "the uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience in the 1980s and who was in the area of the Forum "his swan song."
The first fear is the demarcation of borders on which we can build.
"Limit something means establishing already the next step", i.e., its excess.
"We must think about new instruments planning, planning, because the current [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can cause real disasters."
In addition to the question, modol argues that, by simplifying the side of the region of El Valles Collserola "can be heard as a park, Barcelona, not".
Modol reminds us that there is already a work done by the Office of Collserola who "must not be lost," thanks for the opportunity that the mayor's corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment."
In addition, it meant that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the pass that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" if this looming technique must lead multi-disciplinary teams (" a success, "he says) that it has set up:" We, the architects, should be only one instrument. "
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because of the foundations of the competition we lack a comprehensive vision of Collserola: "We convened 16 cross-cutting competition - he says - in the sense montagne-mer, but it is not a reading that way and understands the area as a whole."
This is, at least in this case, he has opted to participate in the competition.
In another way, a project for a doors can shock in the program and definition with that of the architect of the door.
In his opinion, yes, the mayor should ensure that the band immediately above Ronda de Dalt should provide, in all its extension, an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgive Jonás Larrazábal and it will be released
After 72 days of detention, the legal authority of Casino Red has granted a pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the proceedings initiated against him for alleged blackmail
After 72 years arrested, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal authority of the Casino Red grant forgiveness before the Second District Criminal Tribunal, which follows a trial for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, has published a series of photos and videos in which presumably Manuel Jonás required him to the payment of an economic quotte for the mayor of Monterrey operation underground gambling house.
After public denunciation, the prosecutor has opened a criminal case against the brother of Mayor PANiste and on September 2, he was arrested and held in detention for 30 days.
After four hours before the agent of the Public Ministry 3 Patrimoniaux incident, he was transferred to the Detention Center, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He stayed there for the 49 days when he delivered a second detention order after an officer of the Public Ministry has dismissed the crimes of corruption and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to the prison of Cadereyta alleged to have made to sing with one and a half million pesos owners of Casino Red; but he spent only a few hours in the medium security detention centre because there were death threats against him.
The authorities have allowed him to continue the trial held in the cells of San Nicolas de los Garza.
On October 25, a capture order was issued by the Clerk of the Second District Criminal Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, who said that after nearly two months of investigation there was evidence confirmed sufficient to determine the guilt of Jonás, such as those relating to the payment of 1.5 million pesos representatives of the gambling house in exchange for its operation.
On Monday, the legal authority of the Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore it could recover his freedom within hours.
During the legal formalities, the agent of the prosecutor attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, interviewed García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and that of the gambling house had been granted a pardon, but the lawyer tried not to disclose the name.
Under the record 197 / 2011 it provides the legal pardon to Jonás Larrazábal and later it will make no claim to the trial against him; there are no damage and no punishment.
After the hearing of the legal authority of the gambling house, at 3: 50 p.m. ordered the immediate release of Larrazabal Bretón.
The Clerk of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved up to the prison municipium of San Nicolas de los Garza to communicate to Jonás that he had been forgiven legally and his case would be classified.
It will be the order of immediate release that the judge has issued.
The Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives the details of the plane crash in which has lost his life the Government's secretary, Francisco Blake and another seven people
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) informed that the results highlighted on the accident in which lost his life Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people, indicate that the helicopter was shocked directly against the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot to attempt an emergency landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, said that before the takeoff of the aircraft, the pilot found that the climate conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit has had several contacts with the soil, the blades have had contact with the trees to 25 metres where the unit has lost the fuselage."
He also informed of the fact that the unit was designed to 19 people, therefore it met the requirements needed to transport personnel.
In addition, he said that the investigations within the zone of impact do not report the emergence of rooms on the ground.
"In a research reported that there was no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact was presented.
"The helicopter was designed to 19 passengers and met the requirements for transport.
The ground had a pante seven to 30 degrees.
For the moment, the secretary said that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation may last a few months, it may take a year.
In turn, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, Executive Director of Airports and Auxiliary Services has ensured that the moment of impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Maggiore state were operated in speed and happened on soft ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of a normal functioning were at the time of the impact," he says.
During the press conference, the owner of the TBS, Pérez Jácome, has listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aviation standards, the flight was conducted according to the visual flight rules, which means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM mentioned adequate conditions at takeoff and as the aircraft was moving towards the border area between DF and the State of Mexico there were layers of low cloud cover.
Roads selected:
It is likely that "because of the conditions of cloud cover the crew has sought a height lower and more visibility to the valley of Cuernavaca.
Of the impact.
The details of the impact and the last recording of the aircraft on radar coincide, probably before the impact there has been no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersal of the remains of the aircraft in a small area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact was held on a straight and lateral.
The dispersion model of the remains of the aircraft suggests that the helicopter hit the ground in terms of structural integrity.
It was not detected traces of fire or explosion:
In the area of the disaster, there was still no trace in the remains of the aircraft type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple contacts with the soil.
During the fieldwork was found parts of the aircraft at a height of 9 000 200 feet above sea level, the ground had a slope from seven dégrées to 30 degrees.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was possibly désarticulé along its route.
The information provided evidence that suggests that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the soil.
After careful research in an area larger than the place circled around the accident, it has not found scattered pieces of the aircraft, which supports the presumption that the impact was held in conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announcement protocol to find the gene for obesity
Social insurance is leading an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people; this is borne by the IPN
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) announced that he is leading an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, known as' Genetics of obesity among children and adolescents who will have the markers associated with being overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Investigation Unit in Biochemistry Medical Hospital Specialization of National Medical Center of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that it had formed a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social support.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students at the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Investigation and Advanced Study (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The investigation should be invited to participate in the population with or not right, to run for the participating sports units of the IMSS Valle de México, where is the evidence to minors every Saturday from 8: 00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in Unity Sports Cuauhtémoc (Estado de México Poniente) and from 8 October, activity occurs in the Sports Unit of Nezahualcóyolt (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the objective of 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in Unity Sports Independencia (south of Federal District) and eventually in the Sports Unit Morelos (north of Federal District).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and e know the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity and identify among children and young Mexicans risk factors to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
As we celebrate the 14 November's World Diabetes Day, he said that the aim is to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific questionnaires relating to food.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and their family history of hereditary diseases, to avoid the risk factors that trigger conditions like diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that Saturdays it will apply to all participants of anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference, blood pressure, glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetic (trying to identify people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals to the alarming weight in the case of minors.
'Health surveys of 1999 and 2006 reported that in just six years there has been an increase in the case of boys, 77 percent in obesity and in the case of girls of 47 percent; as regards the overweight has seen a dramatic increase, "said the specialist of the IMSS.
He said that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the country's population is different from other genetic history.
He informed that, on average, Mexicans have a 65 percent of heredity Indian-American, a 30 percent and a five percent African, and this is reflected in people with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that, in general, the genetics of obesity is reflected in the inability of burning the excess energy that we consume (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to participants is the full assessment of children, which can detect if they are overweight or obese.
He even said that the presence of dark folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the likelihood of developing metabolic alterations and even pré-diabètes.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, doctors submit in writing to parents, which explains each of the measures and changes in lifestyle that they must do to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that are overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: The sedentary lifestyles, which is the lack of daily physical activity, remain most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transportation instead to walk short distances.
Another reason is the high caloric intake, i.e. the greater consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - block of meat to corn flour wrapped in sheets of corn, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and genetics analyzed in this protocol.
The asphalt of UNAM would avoid the blackcurrants
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of the UNAM, develops polymer modified asphalt to produce a mixture with a better performance, regardless of environmental conditions and temperature
If the reported that the streets were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand blackcurrants each rainy season in the metropolitan area of Valle de México, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, who assured him that if the process of construction and maintenance of bituminous deck is adequate, blackcurrants may be reduced or even eliminated entirely.
During its conference A technological opinion on blackcurrants, organized in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory that it is responsible for developing polymer modified asphalt to produce a mix with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with a greater strength, both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera has estimated that this type of modified asphalts could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities in the north of the country, to improve performance, and therefore, the training of cassis.
He explained that the asphalt, the heavier share of oil, is a set of molecules of hydrocarbons, molecules with a molecular weight heavier, called asphaltenes, and with a low molecular weight molecules, called malthènes, which together provide the paved his characteristic viscoelastic behaviour.
The viscoelastic behaviour of asphalt is the fact that at temperatures high, nearly 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and 50 degrees C presents an almost solid, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day in terms of environmental conditions and temperature, warns the specialist in chemical engineering.
The researcher of the FQ observed that the streets of Ciudad de México in their majority were covered by a flexible, composed of six layers of materials, including the last three involve the asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the layer of asphalt, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and compacted later.
Each small stones that form the layer, signalât-il, is bathed year asphalt.
When vehicles are generating efforts, it is that the forces are spread very well in the streets.
If we had the modified asphalt, they propagate best opinât chemical engineers.
On the asphalt layer, he says, there is a final layer called layer of turnover, made of stone, i.e., sand, which is also steeped in asphalt.
As it is in contact with the wheels of vehicles, she must have more strength than the layer of asphalt and provide traction in the street.
As part of the pavement that receives and distributes the efforts, the layer of turnover also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material it is made must be treated.
The climate, especially the humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, because they affect the performance of the layer of asphalt.
When the soil is getting wet, water is spreading to the interior of the film is that it is difficult, which softened all layers of pavement and therefore cause of cassis.
In the trial of a black currant, he says, the first striker is the film and only later is affected the layer of asphalt, but the damage was not immediately, but it is a process that must be treated to the first signs with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that the burden of vehicles is another important factor for the training of cassis and therefore the thickness of each layer of pavement must always be linked to the burden of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, to avoid the frequent formation of cassis.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on the asphalt, for example, the bituminous emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and help repair the blackcurrants easily and without having to use high temperatures.
That failed in the Valle candidate to be the new miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that made that Melina Ramírez Serna may not get the crown of miss Colombia.
Valle receives its title number 14 of princess.
New Valle del Cauca stayed with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna has had to be content with the fact of being on the winners' podium, wear the crown of money and the band, which accredits as new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained yesterday evening in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico is mounted with the crown and the scepter, the department money already 14 titles of Princess and Melina is one of a legion of women of Valle del Cauca were found near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, among which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Now the big question that many world arises:
What he has missed? Because the result is the defeat of a favorite in each presentation showed that it had to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Complexion Jolie of Vogue, securities obtained by queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The key factor in the decision by the jury of the designate First Princess is the fact that she was not satisfied with her answer to the question "? What was the book that has marked and why? By Martín Murillo Gómez, Leamos Carreta Literaria.
This is the response of the candidate of Valle to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I believe that it is a form of culturaliser, definitely I think the book that has marked my childhood is" The Little Prince, "a book deep enough.
Now I read "Crime et châtiment" is a book of universal literature that we should read all; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The passion of the blood."
The response has not pleasing firstly because of the term "culturaliser" and secondly not to explain specifically how each book was marked.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said that she felt relaxed and happy with the result, "the universe and wise, it is what must happen.
And for the world, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book "
Among the assumptions launched that Valle was destroyed by patronage.
A journalist from Bogota has insinuated that being the preferred, the highly acclaimed and the candidate who received all preliminary price (challenge of gastronomy Oster, the public vote for the best homemade costume, and Queen Mother), "it has awakened the envy of other candidates, has stressed the Queen and that is why it has not shone on the scene."
And it was noted that in his first presentation in bathing suits on the beach of Hilton and her two parades on the eve of the coronation.
Even if the two parades, it seemed safe, it noted that it was not the strength and energy of representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the program "Como en casa" (As at home), Canal NCR said that the fact that Melina was designated princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who obtains most prices during the competition does not receive the crown of Queen."
In addition, Valle has avoided the press at the end, and it was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle has failed to convince the jury on his interest in social initiatives, which is the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
It is for this reason that two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty said that they were looking for a woman committed in relation to the social needs of his country.
"Only the beauty is not enough for a Miss Colombia, we need to look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, that before starting the competition are already involved in projects," Justice. "
There is speculation that the Valle has sinned by its shortcomings of his behind and fibrosis, who was in his abdomen, but this is contradictory precisely because the board elected him as the candidate 'natural beauty with the body more healthy, good nutrition and physical work.
The preparer queens Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina was not the best body, that it was better, "but his problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in reality for me was not too well known, he left marks the last day."
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, the magazine Cromos considers that the error of the candidate of Valle were the surgery that she had suffered.
"The surgery are good, but Valle has failed to make them.
His body has never been his strength and she lost because of this. "
For this price, that the National Beauty Contest calls for the first time, after the parade in swimsuits has a cruel prediction that was done yesterday evening, saying that this was a small gift that Raymundo was to Melina not to give him a taste of the crown.
True or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year reign, not as a sovereign, if not as Princess, a position that gives him the opportunity to represent Colombia in an international competition by appointment of the National Competition.
However, it will go down in history as one of the queens that despite his dazzling passage in Cartagena, has not won the crown.
This was the work of the Cali who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A dactyloscopiste of Cali is history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officials is crucial.
The past 4 November an ITC dactyloscopiste Cali spent in history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader Madrid: "Alfonso Cano", comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven dactyloscopistes working in the local offices of the ITC, this week it was the turn of "availability of Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tejada, who works for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez has worked in the Choco municipes, where many times he had spent five days in the forest to arrive at the venue in which the corpses that had to be identified.
The year 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after taking courses, he specialized in fingerprinting, which is the study of the skin friction, i.e. the palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano had been warned to Eliazar taking with him some clothes at least for three days.
Something very large.
On Friday night he went to Cauca in a helicopter of Palmira.
He knew he had to identify two corpses and that the suspected that one of them was that of the man who led the world's longest guérrilla, therefore asked to carry the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigative team to the location of the body, it has not recognized by his physical appearance, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed as a farmer in the area, without glasses and much leaner.
But the fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a magnifying glass galtonienne, ink, a procuring and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the cadaver with those of the card.
His eye was wrong: It was "Alfonso Cano."
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, it was the supreme head of Madrid.
Search of the footprint
For a dactyloscopiste Sijín of Cali recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos has done to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano," is very significant.
A lot of people not our work.
Fingerprinting is an exact science, no margin for error, which can be crucial in solving crimes.
In part to identify the bodies, the dactyloscopistes support investigations for crimes such as robbery and murder and confirm the identity of those captured.
When caught, many offenders are false identity cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and seek in the database.
The researcher told that in a case of flight he had to remove part of the wall of a house, because in this area the thief had supported his hand to get a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable areas for a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to obtain the footprint of the hand and identify the offender who had participated in various flights," he recalls.
The fingerprints can also remove or confirm the suspects in cases of homicide.
Recently found a dead man, with beverage bottles around him.
By interlude of the investigation has determined that a parent can be accused of the crime and a footprint on the bottle coincided.
Even if this No. not guarantee that he is the murderer, this places on the scene of the crime.
An ITC dactyloscopiste explained that one excerpt "fingerprints of objects with physical or chemical reagents."
When they occur, using a sampling or a band for the draw.
Subsequently, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the database of déclinquents, or the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there is still a lot of undocumented Colombian," said the expert of the ITC.
He explained that it is not how it is shown in the television programme CSI.
As all that glitters is not gold, all that is not necessarily a fingerprint.
However, it can be used, if it achieves the confrontation necessary.
The "indignant" defy the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters jumping to the camping in Zuccotti.
A lot of people have acceded to the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The movement's ingrained Held Wall Street have defied this Tuesday, the authorities in New York while trying to re-enter, thanks to a court order, in place of Manhattan, where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters overwhelmed at the Zuccotti, where they wanted to go through a judicial order that allows' outraged 'camp again in this place, while the other part of the movement had responded to the evacuation in a park north of the city, where there have been new judgments.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to stay in place, we will move to another place and we will continue the legal fight to return to Zuccotti, and through be-ins and peaceful demonstrations," dit-un spokespersons "Held Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray described the response of 'outraged' at the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to court, where the judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the area and allowed the demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, the 'indignant' held a new park located at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, between New York and New Jersey, ownership of the parish Trinity Church.
At least for an hour, they have managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved in and arrested some demonstrators, even if Bray was unable to confirm the concrete figure, Efe that he has seen a few journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization ensures that there are old people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved as a sign of support for members of the movement and tried to intervene in favour of them before the Police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti - which is a forum for private property - remains closed pending the celebration of a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday during which we must analyse the legality of the evacuation of this morning.
Some demonstrators moved up to that time were handing out copies of the judiciary and they were even officers guarding the place, which has caused some small clashes, "said Bray, who has denounced the fact that some officials have hit the demonstrators.
The judiciary authorities to evacuate Held Wall Street or implement laws published after the beginning of the occupation or prohibit the demonstrators to regain access to the park with tents or other properties that they used previously.
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, because of the judiciary, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and the demonstrators, however, that he was alerted to the fact that local laws do not permit to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The councillor has personally defended the evacuation carried out at dawn to Zuccotti, an operation in which it was arrested 200 people and which has been decided because the protesters' violated the law.
Bloomberg said that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it was "a place where people came to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to hurt other people," because "some stores had received threats" and residents were afraid "to their quality of life."
"The evacuation of this morning at dawn was repugnant and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in protecting the financial interests than those of American workers," added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression."
Officials of "Held Wall Street" have also indicated that they do not hold a "major actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions to commemorate the two months of Protestes, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a television programme of Noel
Beside Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadian, it will emerge in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" the next December 1
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was the assistant Tim Allen in "Home Improvement," rescuer in "Baywatch," rabbit in Playboy, wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special programme of Noel of Canadian television.
The private channel CTV television announced today that Anderson, next to the "crooner" (balladeer who tells) Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadian, will emerge in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" the next December 1, playing a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV has distributed today images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide dissemination on the Internet a pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband at the time, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe," Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary in arguing in a crèche a doll representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian actor of Indian origin who recently presented a part of "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" Charlie Sheen, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the special programme of Noel CTV also includes Canadian singer Bublé, at the end of March was married to Buenos Aires, the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, which itself is not far from the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called 'slut' American Kim Kardashian during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan Returns after the earthquake
The GDP increase a 1.5% due to domestic consumption and puts an end to the downward spiral of the early March
Since March, the Japanese economy was paralyzed, still recovering after the devastating earthquake that has become nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in the country Nippon since World War II.
First estimates of the Government of Tokyo have calculated the material losses to $300 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have eased.
After three consecutive quarters of falling, the Gross Domestic Product between July and September were used to definitively turn the page: GDP has raised a 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter and a 6% annual rate.
That recorded the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year beginning in March 2012 - is, in addition, the highest rate of increase since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is due, in part, by the resumption of equipment additions to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies have increased their investments by 1.1%, compared with a decline of 0.9% of capital spending seen from January to March, the first decline after six months of rising non-interrompue.
However, the true stimulate the Japanese economy is based exclusively on the Keynesian stimulus that invites us to take advantage of the crisis to build or rebuild - infrastructure, use the shortcomings to grow from scratch.
Japan woke up thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently represents the 60 percent of Japanese GDP.
This variable has raised a 1%, driven by the increase in spending on cars, travel and entertainment.
The stigma of yen
Tokyo has returned to the internal market when the yen, the Japanese currency - has become a "safe-haven" elected by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the eurozone and forecasts of the United States, a privilege that weighs as a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a divided stronger, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose line of economic uncertainty is determined by the health of major technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, have been responsible for their poor results between July and September, the contribution of the yen.
While the markets continue their seats in the peripheral countries of the EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda did not lower its guard.
"We must take risks that exist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand, and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that the majority of member countries have submitted in September clearer signals of economic slowdown.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points of the global economy has highlighted that the major powers are curtailed.
Because it has dropped four decimals until 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone has even been above the average, which is in the level, dropping eight decimal places to 99.13 points.
Athens fuels new doubts
Papadimos said that adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will sign a written commitment
With the risk premium peripheral triggered and uncertainty resettled in the parks, Greece continues to become entangled in the maze that led to the exit of the European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Transitional Government is Helennic; rather, imposed by the requirements of Brussels by real conviction of political forces began to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos reported yesterday that there is no alternative to the structural reforms and that the period of 100 days in his appointment may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, maintained that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated its demand for new elections on the scheduled date of February 19.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the summit of 26 October," said Papadimos when it opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new Executive.
A package of 24 programs to boost employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras No. emerging doubts about his position: "We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we are committed to nothing more."
The conservative leader has gone a step further in his pulse that EU and IMF, agencies must release the 8,000 million that Athens needs with urgency, and has made clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment adjustments.
But the European Commission, irritated by the impact caused by the lengths of the referendum of Papandreu, reiterated yesterday that its requirement is firm: It will help if the new Government and leaders of the main parties corruption cases do not sign a written commitment without ambiguities as soon as possible. "
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Altafaj marketing, explained that the troika inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "the elements needed to pay for the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, even if there is a final date.
The Greek still have much to do.
The Queen Sofía: "They are instruments for the progress and hope"
The Queen said the "predominant" Spain in relation to this type of Finance
Spain has reached a prominent place at the global level in the role of microfinance. "
The Queen Sofía recalled that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor in the world as regards this instrument of cooperation that "the essence" lies in the fact that it is an instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in humans. "
The Queen opened yesterday the V-E World Summit of the Microcredit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt that such operations are" absolutely essential "to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations to 2015, and" very specifically, which aims to reduce the volume of people with incomes below a dollar a day, which is the "poverty line".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the globe, and undertake this task with" responsibility, "said the Queen Sofía, who had hoped that the initiatives and contributions origins during the summit, which will last until Thursday," guarantee the creation of new capacity and better opportunities for the poor, and especially for women, "the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have "reached a lot of goals," and "we are facing a lot of challenges."
The Microcredit Summit is seen not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which we must give "two basic goals."
Thus, Her Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have acceded to these financial services and that 100 million of these families out of poverty in which they now live.
The impetus for the development of micro-credits in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the trail started a few years ago there was a pioneer" by Muhammad Yunus, stressed the Queen Sofía as an "act of justice and due recognition."
And she described the father of this instrument as a "idealist admirable in the universal cause of the fight against poverty," the work which she has since he was 15 years ago, when the Queen has traveled to Bangladesh to get on the ground its lending policy.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "in every meeting I saw a continuing evolution," said Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project yesterday gave him the title of "head of household" convened at Valladolid on the part of the "deep pocket of the poor."
Finally, the Queen Sofía ended his speech by encouraging people to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to progress in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this sense, it stated that it would be a mistake to vinculer cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, because it is "a permanent obligation."
Jiménez said that microcredit involves "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty," and now "more than ever" governments of developed countries must work under the criteria of solidarity and do not allow to be the victim of the cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of cooperation for development."
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded the "success" of giving "confidence" to people "excluded by closing the door "; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva, welcomed the people in a city that" opens its doors contaminated the spirit of solidarity. "
The CDU proposes to elect the president by universal suffrage European
The first day of the convention of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday November 14, Leipzig, took place without any real difficulty for Chancellor Angela Merkel, but also the president of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the program but has imposed in the fall, including activists who feel the government policy too lax Greeks today and possibly Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted almost unanimously.
On 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and 10 abstained.
The standing ovation lasting several minutes that were right, at the end of their interventions, Angela Merkel and, hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very European-minded finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The focus of the Chancellor - and the motion - is a slogan: The response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe."
Not only because Europe is peace but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe."
This could result in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the control of the European Union on fiscal policies of the eurozone countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission to universal suffrage "to give a face to Europe."
That is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the congress whose inspirer is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the EU27 agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is opposed to it and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also.
But the milestone is asked.
Similarly, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to balance the weight of each country to the Executive Board of the European Central Bank based on the weight of each economy, which of course was to strengthen the weight of Germany.
To defuse the climate inside his party, the Chancellor has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl but it has not sought to win its conference on the backs of "small" European countries or countries in difficulty, quick to criticise the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of the Franco-German friendship, "Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in.
Recalling that there are two centuries, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic.
That represents the fraud sick?
After the allowances, the UMP and the government launched the offensive on the disease.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a box of family allowances, and deliver a speech on the theme - recurrent since 2007 - the fight against fraud and social welfare.
And to accompany this offensive, which share a willingness to make savings in a context of rigour, but is no less a harbinger of an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on the disease.
First in a goal of budgetary savings: The government plans to impose to workers a fourth day of failure before the takeover of a work stoppage.
Clearly, without the agreement of specific company, an employee who falls ill would lose four days of salary, so at least 15 percent of their monthly income.
A measure which could spark anger, but that would bring 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another measure, more symbolic: Impose staff with a day of uncompensated deficiency in the event of a work stoppage (they have so far not waiting period, against three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority revival also the theme of fraud, this time targeting abuses linked to the work stoppages.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are caught, you will pay," warned Xavier Bertrand at the microphone of RTL, Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the announcement effect seemed somewhat disproportionate with the reality of fraud to the work stoppages.
It is indeed the subject since 2002 to constant monitoring and offensive policies, which have often borne fruit.
The French not sicker than elsewhere in Europe.
We focus first on the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), more than 237 million euros of daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in health economics, daily allowances accounted for in 2008 5% of health spending, with 11.3 billion euros.
Of this amount, 46% were maternity leave and work-related accidents, and 54% were the sickness, or 6.2 billion euros.
And therefore 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, the French have averaged 14.5 days, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the group Alma Consulting.
An average that conceals variations: Another survey, published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said they had not taken any day of sickness.
Another study, this time in the Insurance, said that in 2010, 37% of sickness were for less than 8 days, 22% 8 to 14 days, 15% of 15 days a month, 15% of one to three months and 11% above.
When compared with their European neighbours, the French are not more likely than elsewhere to work stoppages.
A study conducted in 2010 by two researchers at the CNRS showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence (for health reasons or not) varied, France, between 10% and 11%, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud sick is very little in the face of the black economy.
The fraud, it reached only a small scale.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 is that controls are systematic on the sickness of more than 45 days.
In 2008, about 1.5 million checks, the CNAM has found that 13% of 285 000 made for short were "unjustified or too long", or 37 050 cases.
In the case of judgments of more than 45 days, systematically checked, there were 11% of cases "inappropriate and unjustified" about 1.2 million, 132 000.
In total, therefore 169,000 cases "unjustified", on several million employees who had a sickness.
A figure that represents little face, for example, to work in the black economy.
According to the Member UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, it would be 9 to 15 billion euros in lost tax revenue per year, more than the total cost per diems, and therefore infinitely more that fraud in the past.
Papadémos: Greece will have to implement a new plan of adjustment
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to rebuild its economy.
So said Monday, November 14, Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos, before Parliament, adding that the 100 days to his unity government would not be able to accomplish this task.
"To continue the economic recovery efforts, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," said the head of government, who gave his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on October 27, will be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro zone "is at stake," he added.
As a result, Mr. Papadémos predicted that the country's public deficit will be reduced "around 9% of GDP by the end of the year, after having been 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right refuses the new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, made Monday his support for the measures already agreed to try to find a way out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not engage in additional austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with members of his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objective of reducing the deficit and debt, and the fight against waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent the economic recovery.
"Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU does not débloqueraient the loan of EUR 8 billion needed without written assurances from all parties that they would support the measures, Antonio Samaras responded that his speech was and that he would sign anything under external pressure.
To legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, said a committee of experts
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and doctors are working together to ensure better palliative care, and that, beyond the cancer cases.
The Canadian company is living in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk with their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and take steps to this effect.
It is one of the conclusions of a report by the Royal Society of Canada, attended by six experts in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The committee recommends the government to amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when this choice is needed, with a patient is found competent to make such a decision.
From the outset, the experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
If Canada is ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death."
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, we are the experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
Overall, the country is in Quebec that this is the highest rate, with 86% of deaths at the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report's authors reach conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that it will change nothing in the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also reviewed all the countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalised, there is no evidence that this change in abuses in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on unqualified persons willing or not.
On the contrary, said yesterday in a teleconference Jocelyn Downie, author of the report, we would have more cases of these excesses in the country where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," said Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support euthanasia
Recall that 85% of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia because they believe it would allow people at the end of life to ease their suffering, according to an Angus Reid poll conducted in 2010.
And 66 percent believe that legalizing euthanasia will not send the message that the lives of the elderly or disabled has less value.
For those who assisted suicide, the surveyed feel to 41% that they should not be prosecuted.
In terms of maintaining or cessation care to a patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is stated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not a criminal.
The committee also asked that health professionals are trained to enforce a refusal of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and doctors are working together to ensure better palliative care, and that, beyond the cancer cases.
Finally, in the area of palliative sedation or terminal, already widely used in the Canadian health institutions, the committee asked that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce the physical pain, such as euthanasia, and that it is subject to the same procedures.
Of other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the report of experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
Am Pierre Deschamps, an expert on health law, described as "extreme" the position of the experts signatories of the report, among other things, because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia for the terminally ill.
"This opens the door to a situation where everyone is tired of life and have more than 18 years could ask to be assisted suicide," said Mr. Deschamps, who had consulted yesterday a summary of the report.
I Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report appears to place the autonomy of the individual above all other values that are involved in the social fabric of society.
However, "in society," he says, there are safeguards and constraints. "
The health law expert Margaret Somerville has also expressed "strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which she called "clear pro-euthanasie."
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly challenged the data in the report about the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide were legalised, either in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan called on President Assad to leave power
Damascus denounced a "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad marched yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Syria's Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, and denounced a "conspiracy" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria from the Arab League, the European Union has tightened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria, have taken a position in favour of a departure of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to leave power "in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the forces of the regime have been killed.
"If Bashar had committed to the interests of his country, he should resign, but it should also create the conditions for a new phase of Syrian politics," said the king of Jordan, a neighbour of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For its part, the Turkish foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu lamented that Turkish mediation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime collapse.
"Those who are not in peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot meet them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, neighbouring countries to which Turkey is taking an increasingly hard line.
The United States is on their side welcomed a "building consensus against Assad and the actions of the regime" of Syria, after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey adopted a tone increasingly hard" in response to the crackdown in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime forces were killed in the region of Deraa, in southern Syria, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians were killed "during an exchange of fire and shelling with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem has estimated that the country is "heading toward the end of the crisis."
He has also reacted strongly to the Arab League decision to suspend Damascus of its work, which he described as "a dangerous step."
Syria "will not waver," he added, asserting that "the plots hatched against Syria will fail."
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "mechanism for the protection of civilians" and wants the shipment of 500 members of Arab organizations of human rights, media and military observers in the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also expressed support for the sending of observers from the United Nations to help protect civilians from the regime's repression which he locks himself in the "paranoia".
A new special meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the peace plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of forces from cities in the dispute and the release of protesters arrested.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, said yesterday "incorrect" the decision of the Arab League, while China urged Syria to implement the plan out of the crisis, while avoiding support possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy,
Monti takes time to markets and sacrifices Italians
The future leader of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has called for a little time to markets to form his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices" to recover the lost credibility in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting today the unions and employers.
It should put in place a relatively small firm composed of technocrats from outside Parliament.
"Monti spoke of a major program with a lot of sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small groups involved in the talks, after meeting with the President of the Council.
The president of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has for its part said expect Mario Monti sought by Friday a vote of confidence in parliament to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr Monti of a shortlist, perhaps a dozen ministers, the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock and bond markets yesterday, asking them time.
In "democracy, there are specific deadlines" to prepare a government and its programme, he stressed, saying they were "confident that the markets will be patient and understand."
His appointment by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but the concern has regained the upper hand after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro zone in September.
The designated prime minister should form a team consisting mainly of technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "political".
The new government will last until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he said.
According to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti is committed, once in office, to work with a sense of urgency and purpose that Italy become protagonist "in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis on the Italian economy does not change."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not reach its goal of balancing the budget by 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, including asking new austerity measures.
The "boss of bosses" Italian Emma Marcegaglia, who discussed Tuesday, also stressed the need to revive the economy, "as a country that has no growth cannot meet the deficit parameters."
Mr Monti, known for its competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconisme", "Professor" symbolizes "the challenge of serious" and "another Italy," according to the editorial writers.
The great unknown is the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, because Italy must place by April 2012 to 200 billion euros of government bonds.
A Russian scientist has helped the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, "Vycheslav, helped Iran develop a detonator with a nuclear weapon, said Monday, an American NGO specializing in the nuclear risk.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report by the International Agency for Atomic Safety (IAEA) and other documents from the UN agency to identify the researcher.
The IAEA reported last week of its "serious concerns" about "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS, largely from the IAEA documents, Mr. ", born in 1934, had worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear facility in Chelyabinsk, in the Urals, and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 and 1991, leaving the house to establish a company producing "nano-diamants" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated in the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA referred to "strong evidence that the development by Iran of a nuclear detonation system" has been helped by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique, but that, as a Member State has informed the Agency, has spent most of his career on this technology within the military nuclear programme of his country of origin.

The anti-Muslim hate crimes have increased by 50%
Crimes against Muslims have increased by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious violence has declined slightly or little progress, according to statistics from the FBI made public Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence perpetrated against Muslims from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, or 49% increase, compared with an increase of 13% of violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4% of crimes against Jews and an overall increase of 14% of crimes and offences manipulate widespread anti-clerical resentment.
The total number of "hate crimes" has increased marginally to 6 628 cases, 47.3 percent motivated by differences of race and 20% by differences of religion, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offences increase again," said the human rights organization Human Rights First, "the rise of anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," says one of the leaders of the organization, Paul Legendre.
"The US government can and should do more to tackle these abuses," he says, arguing that it could pass through an improvement of police reports on the "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in the U.S. federal law is a legacy of the time of the struggle for civil rights.
The legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, colour, religion, origin and now sex.
Twitter changes its platform and is more like Facebook
The micro-blogging site Twitter has introduced Monday, changes in the presentation of its platform, in particular to enable users to observe the activity of those they follow, which is like a little more than Facebook.
A new tab "activity" and another "name" track more legibly, the activity of other "twittos", Internet users who follows the messages (" tweets ") and those who follow you.
This allows whether they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have a favourite messages, etc.
This new form of Twitter has been tested on a small percentage of users in August "before being distributed to the entire network Monday, told AFP Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its functioning little instinctive, with terms somewhat esoteric (RT to broadcast a message from someone else, # followfriday to recommend to follow another user) happiness insiders, opens to a wider audience with more comparable to that of major public networks Facebook and Google +.
On the network, users struggling with "tweets" decided on the interest of this innovation.
"It is unnecessary, intrusive, and it is too similar to Facebook," wrote @ jemb123.
"The functionality Activity will help me to better monitor elements of my Twitter stream," wrote @ dannykronstrom.
) Austria
Inclusion of a "golden rule" in the constitution
The grand coalition Government Social Democrat / Christian Democrats to power in Austria decided Tuesday to write into the Constitution a "golden rule" budget in order to reduce public deficits and avert a possible deterioration in the credit rating agencies of the sovereign rating of Austria (triple A).
It is the Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann, who had announced the decision after a council of ministers, while the Austrian public debt is $74.6 percent, well above the 60 percent limit set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece and Spain.
"If the solvency of Austria was lowered by one notch, from AAA to AA +, we should pay three billion euros of interest in more each year," argued the Christian Democrat Vice-Chancellor and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria gives following a request from the summit in Brussels of the member countries of the euro area of 26 October: The heads of state and government had claimed the registration by the end of 2012, the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or a law of equal value.
The system introduced by the Austrian government is close to the "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural deficit should decrease each year to 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and, starting in 2017, the structural deficit of the federal state should not exceed each year 0.35% of GDP, while the regional states and municipalities will present balanced budgets.
The goal is to increase by 2020 / 21 public debt under the criterion of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Strong Japanese yen
Noda threat of a new intervention on the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again in the currency market if the yen should continue to rise.
"We will act as we did the last time when we see excessive volatility in the exchange rate of the yen," said Mr. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was not far from historical levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
That day, Tokyo has sold massive amounts of yen against the dollar in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just set a new record of force since 1945 against the greenback.
But the yen is regularly since rebounded, boosted by purchases of investors who see it as a "safe haven" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar rose Tuesday under the 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic barrier of 105 yen, close to levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was quoted at around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
The outbreak of the Japanese currency hurts exports of the archipelago because it increases the cost of products made in Japan and reduces the value of earnings from abroad by Japanese firms when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan struggle to rebuild itself" since the earthquake and tsunami of March 11 that devastated the region of Tohoku (northeast), said Mr Noda, who feared that the rise of the yen kills in the bud the fragile recovery.
The world's third largest economy has returned to growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the quarter - well documented for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and household consumption sealed by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister has found that the high yen did not reflect "the economic fundamentals in Japan".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, for its part, has called on the Bank of Japan (BOJ), which opened Tuesday a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the deputy governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BOJ had already taken "appropriate measures", suggesting that no additional monetary easing was expected Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the institute of emissions increased by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) its purchases of Treasury bonds, bringing to 55 billion yen (519 billion euros), the amount of money it spends on purchases of securities to flood the market with liquidity.
Euro zone:
Rates go up, the flanchent
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis of mine always European indexes.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rate of vulnerable countries continue their ascent.
Always worried about the stability of the euro zone, the European stock markets sink in a little more negative territory, on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, the CAC 40 lost 1.4 per cent to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt and London ceded 0.4% 0.1%.
"With the new tensions on the bond yields of euro zone states in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to give back some of their recent gains."
"Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion," said Terry Pratt, institutional dealer at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7%, who in turn renewed fears of market participants about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, as the rest of the world was riveted on Europe and the exchanges will continue in a narrow corridor of variations as investors will not have evidence that the situation is stabilized," said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concerns over the future of the euro penalises the single currency, which continues its decline Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level in a month and a half.
At 10 a.m., the European currency is 1,3570 dollar, falling 0.4 per cent.
According to brokers, it fell after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, met in Congress on Monday passed a motion, including the possibility for a country struggling to emerge from the euro zone without leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates well beyond 6%
The borrowing rate of Italy and Spain are very worrying.
On Tuesday morning, the yield on 10-year Italian bonds reached 6.85%, the Spanish debt maturity of 6.2%.
These tensions on interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of stakeholders.
The leader of the future government Italian Mario Monti called for time to markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, he said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on October 27, would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is in the firing line of markets, while held Sunday legislative elections in the country.
The gap in the rate (" spread between 10-year bonds, Germany and Spain has reached a new high.
In anticipation of the growth figures for the euro
Statistics aside, France has registered economic growth of 0.4 percent in the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3 percent expected, driven by household consumption.
INSEE, however, has revised downwards the figure for the second quarter, with a decline of 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And, it is the fourth that worries the economists.
Germany, for its part, has recorded a growth of 0.5 per cent over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected to 11, while the European Commission has warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts should prevail over dogmas
If there is one issue that we cannot treat from short-term considerations or under the "emotion, it is the energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of enterprises.
It is healthy that an election date is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and the place that is nuclear power.
The debate will only be successful if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the options.
The French are based on objective facts, data rational.
While we are 7 billion of "human beings on the planet, the demographic changes will result in a doubling of demand for electricity by 2050, at least to deprive a huge proportion of the global population of a vital element.
At the same time, we must address the depletion of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity at all times, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a subject of debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear weapons.
This is not the case of Belgium, who makes it to the need to find a replacement capable of substitute, or Switzerland, which is just not build plants of the latest generation.
Conversely, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, for example, are continuing their projects with determination.
The United States have decided after Fukushima added a unit to the park in the construction of a suspended after the accident at Three Mile Island.
If the German model, focusing on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality frustrates the speech.
The choice of Berlin will result in a rise in the price of electricity, energy dependency worsened by the reliance on imported gas, in particular Russia, a leap of CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas-fired power plants and coal.
In a few months, all of these unfortunate effects are already being felt.
The case of Denmark is to meditate.
European champions of the wind, which accounts for 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the biggest users of coal and gas because of the intermittency of wind; as a result, its CO2 emissions, and the price of its electricity 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Conversely, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a bill "electricity 40 percent of French households.
While in a globalized economy, the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies are "the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Thus, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would lead to a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would make false declarations on the redevelopment of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of the French are unwilling to pay, especially as they are not opposed in principle to this energy, polls show.
Recall that the energy policy of our country has helped build a cluster of 125 000 direct jobs and 410 000 jobs.
Exports are strong, it leads to a galaxy of SMEs in international markets and makes them very creative non-relocatable jobs.
If France were to decide to get out of nuclear power, this would be sacrificing many of these SMEs in reducing be shrinking the 6 billion euros of French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician would dictate a PRT designed to operate 60 years while the decline of its manufacturer would be scheduled?
To solve the energy equation, we must admit that there is no source of production of electricity miracle, any more than there is of evil.
The development by Areva solutions little emitters of CO2, nuclear and renewables, reflects the complementarity of sources of energy.
For nuclear power, maintain the highest level of security is an absolute imperative.
In France, we are Safety Authority, which controls intransigent and transparent on existing plants as on the Flamanville site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited the same obsession with security.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has suffered three serious accidents.
A single, Three Mile Island, intervened in conditions of normal operation; he remained without human or environmental consequences.
"Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human error caused the tragedy.
Was Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw lessons from this accident, as it had for the previous two.
Fruit of this approach and cooperation between the security authorities, operators, and manufacturers, French and German, the PRT idea, making it capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians willing to build a power plant, halting its construction at Flamanville is a magnificent gift to competitors of Areva and EDF, leaving the way open to seize the leadership in the development of nuclear power.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partisan tactics dominate a debate as crucial to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration is a burden or a chance for the economy?
Immigration policy under President Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized in various angles -engorgement police, judicial and administrative subject to the policy of the figure, compatibility with the self-proclaimed status of "human rights" of France.
More recently, it is administrative harassment against foreign students who made the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Liberation of 23 May) declaring that France "does not need foreign talent, masons and restaurant servers."
But it is rarely discussed in economic terms.
It is that there is this a fairly broad consensus between left and right.
On the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac ruled in 1976 that "900 000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million migrant workers," and left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot accommodate all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the level of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on the left and right.
For both sides, the immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and society.
The only difference is the level of generosity that is prepared to grant towards immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande confined to the trivial, indicating that co-development will solve our "migration problem."
This idea of immigration as a problem, is perhaps electorally pay; but it is economically very costly.
As economists Ian Goldin, Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book summarising the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries that receive immigrants.
Restrict immigration anemic growth and employment.
The fears of the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they can substitute for domestic workers, especially the unskilled, exerting downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for domestic workers, mostly in areas of employment shortage.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the more skilled in dynamic sectors in which the training is not the supply of jobs.
A positive effect on the
In the same way as a surgeon will struggle to work in a country that has a shortage of anesthesiologists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants are that the influx of immigrants have a positive effect on wages and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri has calculated that an increase of 1% of migration flows leads to an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% in real wages in the long term.
And this without taking into account the fact that diversity provided by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of immigrants naturalized American among the Nobel, Google, Intel, PayPal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors of social systems, an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labor Organization estimates that, for example, in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 years will make a net contribution (revenue minus expenses) of 150,000 euros to public budgets on average for the whole of his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of the mandate, pick up the points of missing growth "with teeth".
The teeth, used to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, is to think European democracy
Democracy is a precious commodity; it is also a very fragile.
The European continent should remember him for having invented in Athens over two thousand years, has experienced in the 20th century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the gulag, but Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that it would be sufficient for democracy triomphât definitively of its enemies, to exercise the vote, and the exercise of the most direct way.
We know, since Napoleon "Little", that it was an ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, to be a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and may even be "instrument of oppression" as saying in the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires much more: A public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation of powers and control, education, enlightenment, solidarity, economic and social justice.
The crisis in Europe that we live is an economic crisis, but it is equally and a crisis of politics and democracy.
The choice of the Greek referendum palinodie will have been worth double revealing: The need for a return of politics, but also the disquieting sense of its inability to its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be exceeded.
The truth is that the front lines of the Democratic battle are now displaced, and that, for many of them, the soldiers Republicans do more in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain by requiring a succession of national referendums, organised the ad hoc and piecemeal.
A blank cheque to the absolute monarch or a leap into the void of nationalist reaction: What options for the citizen!
No, we do not want sunset but an exercise, common, right, serene and continuous, choice and democracy, this time at the European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - there will be more to stop the "list - because there is a crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe who pander to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe who is humiliated on the international stage.
There are concerns about transfers of sovereignty to Europe, but it is the whole of Europe who slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to restore popular sovereignty the piloting of the European project.
As it is, that the Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead us to disaster.
After long fought the proposal of the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone now wants the European economic government.
Be. "
But the thinking without a democratic political integration and stronger, and seen as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must assume a new stage of European construction.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "do" of Republicans.
The Revolution in the interests could not be sufficient.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more integrated Europe economically.
This can only be done by building a more democratic Europe on the political front, a genuine popular sovereignty.
For Europe, do Europeans.
The smart cards "without contact" spreading
The show of the smart card opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in a climate of optimism.
The year 2011 is expected to be completed on an 11% increase in global sales of smart cards (bank card, telephone SIM card...), to more than 6 billion units, according to the firm Eurosmart.
The fastest growing segment of the contactless technology that allows for the payment of transit or resolve its purchases with the card from a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards should be sold around the world, from 320 million a year earlier.
Their share is expected to grow in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent nearly 10% of the global market for smart cards (6.925 million cards).
Long the laggard of the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for the contactless payment.
Some 26 million Visa debit cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been deployed.
But the supermarkets are the semi-finals.
Carrefour has issued this year and 2.5 million cards Pass MasterCard without contact.
To move up a gear, it must now that banks on their customers.
"Two major French institutions are committed to broadcast in the future to their clients of the bank cards without contact," said Gerard Nébouy, Director General Visa Europe France.
The banks are testing the mobile payment
But this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: The mobile phone.
Few are now equipped with the technology NFC (Near Field Communication) needed to complete transactions.
"They have lagged behind."
"But they should finally have a real growth next year."
"We rely on the sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 in the world," says Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks to take the lead.
Crédit Agricole yesterday announced the launch of a test from December to June at Caen.
The iPhone of some 200 customers and staff will be equipped with a holster authorizing the payment without contact.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseilles.
And the Société Générale, too, said yesterday the placing on the market of an offer to customers pay without contact with their mobile.
The Sahara in Nigeria, the terrorist front extends
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram.
Long suspected of links between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram is confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, has even said that Algiers has now "satisfied".
"The way in which the two organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is cooperation," he said without elaboration.
Paris seems to be a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger in January would have uncovered bridges.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory should be killed the next day at the same time that several of their captors during an operation by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, the French investigators and Nigerian had to return several phone chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist axis of
The analysis of calls to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues of particular interest to investigators: One leads to a Niger citizen who has traveled extensively in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram and the other to a man who said he was close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but it is probably expect more formal evidence before talk of operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it is possible."
"It has been known for years that the sect has been receiving financial support and intellectuals, and that it is increasingly active" moderates Amuwo Lagos, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months the "support" had been increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in its modus operandi, which involve the use of suicide bombers or explosives increasingly complex and the same as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, including Washington, has therefore put pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long viewed the group as a community of illuminated little interest.
A rapid success
Founded in 2002 to Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist 117 Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means Hausa "Western education is a sin" - calls for the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is a rapid success.
It is politicized and requires strict adherence to Sharia law while its militants involved in the fight against the central government infidels.
These are first churches, bars, authorities.
In 2009, the militants of Boko Haram were particularly active, multiplying attacks against police stations.
The reaction of Abuja is, as usual, without nuances.
The army invests the city, there are 800 deaths.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is killed in prison.
Therefore the sect will radicalize and leave its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, she claimed an attack which is 80 dead in Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, it is still in Abuja that Boko Haram took control of the police headquarters in a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will be his first international target.
The creation of an axis of terrorism in Africa which is operating from Mauritania to Somalia from Nigeria worried now all security specialists.
While Aqmi invested Mali and Niger, that Somalis al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat to the heart of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting with Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready "to share all the information."
The world according to the Republican candidates for the presidency
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival of simplicity and ignorance.
An America weakened by the crisis can manage a complex world with simple ideas, even simplistic?
To listen to the Republican presidential candidates, voters might think.
Over the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and other growing thundering declarations and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a Republican stronghold.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, slogans - often not supported - abound.
Mitt Romney, the better placed in the race for the nomination of the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to drag the Chinese before the WTO and the challenge "for manipulating their currency," a theme in a carrier America exasperated by the migration of large parts of its industry to Asia.
Too bad if it must involve the outbreak of a trade war, "he said.
Jon Huntsman, the former Obama in China and only candidate to have an aggressive foreign policy vision, threatened to strangle faced with an attitude that "suits" emotions.
He called for a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who sits in the depths of the polls, remains muted.
The image of Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran, he fanfaronné."
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb."
He has also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in its obligations to the partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second candidate best placed, displays an embarrassing lack of records.
Recently, he called to counter the military threat in China because Beijing "is trying to develop a nuclear capacity" - apparently unaware of the fact that China holds the military atom since 1964.
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to strikes against Iran, said he is willing to engage the American army in Mexico against the drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
It is far from the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president countered that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he had won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and he has had to make his wine in counter-terrorism.
They rightly stress the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, leaving too hasty "boys" of Iraq, on its procrastination in Libya, and a sticky label of low.
But the attack is not so easy.
The judge rather positive assessment of national security of Obama, who has eliminated Bin Laden.
In Iraq, it is wary of military interventions that lead to the stalemate.
And, on the grounds that it must rebuild economically America to resurrect his leadership, Obama is more fair.
The Nord Stream, new door to ntrée of Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, directly linking Western Europe to Russia to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, came into service.
It must provide gas to the equivalent of 30 million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with a bang.
More than 500 guests including four heads of state and government participated last Tuesday, on the shores of the Baltic Sea, between orchestra and buffet end, at the opening of the Nord Stream, this new pipeline that connects directly from Russia to Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte turned the wheel of the valve commander the entry of Russian gas in the West European network.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas additional will arrive each year in Western Europe by a first tube 1 224 km from the St. Petersburg region in the Land of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
A second tube must be completed by the end of 2012, to issue a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, equivalent to the entire French consumption.
And there is already talk the possibility of building a third on the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion in time for this huge project has the air of victory.
The project had been strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
Nord Stream will allow us to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding any land crossings by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries are losing some of their power: It becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to shut down access to European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream to a "new Nazi-Soviet Pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for Poland in 1939.
Is to say if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, in supporting the Russian draft, has gained greater security of supply.
But it is the price of a weakening of European energy, since the project has created a gap between people of East and West.
Russia has five years ago, vindicating his vision of an alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, strongly gas consumers, and whose deposits are in decline.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically," confirmed François Fillon inaugurating this pipeline, demonstrating how the major gas contracts are also political and economic.
All of this explains the broad smiles posted by the leaders of Gazprom, present in number to Lubmin, to the point of arrival of gas.
The construction of the pipeline is also a technical feat.
The submarine is steel tube wrapped with concrete to protect against the anchors of ships.
It is based on the bottom of the sea, 200 m on average.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from the Second World War.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed, as a precaution," said Jens Müller, spokesman for the Nord Stream company.
It was also increased measures to protect the flora and fauna.
The tube is a long snake of metal, heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, that nothing stops along its entire length: Or valves, nor station maintenance.
A platform of control was scheduled off Sweden, but the project was abandoned when the Swedes were unwilling to see a company of Russian state settle permanently off their coasts.
"In the event of damage, we stop the passage of gas in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the pipeline is in the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by manufacturers who have planned the welds for a leak every 100,000 years.
Monitoring of the condition of the pipeline is provided by a robot submarine, dragged by a ship, for outside observation, as well as a device that circulates inside the pipeline.
The shape of a cigar, he was introduced to the tube, wide of a metre in diameter, and it is caused by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 m second book accurate information on the possible distortions of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate 50 years without any compensation.
The gas flow is simply provided by the pressure.
It is 200 bars at the outset, and 100 on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to achieve this project.
The leader is Gazprom, which retains a 51% of the shares.
Joined the German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each) and the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, named Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where the tax is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to the company for 20 years, all the gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas transported really," says Jens Müller.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline has been provided to 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to reach 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are safe to return to their fees, because only Gazprom assumes the risk.
The pipeline is emerging from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted pine.
Valves, 4.5 metres high, form the exit door of gas.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and the characteristics of the gas that comes before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas to every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a notebook.
Founded 15 years ago by an Italian company, the Moleskine wants to restore the taste of writing.
It smacks of adventures, hours to write in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with his black rectangular coverage, his elastic, its leaves an off-white color, as outdated by the time.
Yet, the Moleskine notebook as we know today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company podrían podrían, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a notebook design but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, is responsible for the launch of the new product.
The book is based on an ancient production technique, the mole skin (skin of mole), which means a cotton varnish used to cover seats, for example.
This type of book was very popular writers and travelers.
"Moleskine revived the something old and forgotten, who was an icon of avant-garde artists, until the 20th century," said Maria Sebregondi, now the head of the mark in podrían podrían.
The success is.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 percent to 12.7 million pieces passed.
It is far from the confidential production early years, where only 3 000 books were designed.
Moleskine exceeds the Italian borders and exported in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
Difficult to establish an image of the buyer, because the notebook seduces both the businessman that students and professionals.
The image of Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and grown.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its infancy, with nearly 100 today since 2008 and has two offices, one in Milan and one in New York.
It distributes its books in bookstores, Fnac to small shops of downtown and was able to impose its identity.
"We have followed the air time and this need new writing, despite the rise of e-mail," says Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signing with the development of Moleskine: Recently, the brand launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects and artists present their own book.
In August, she has also initiated coverage in leopard, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has managed to diversify its products: Bags, agenda, pens, bags of computer... The mark runs on a wide range of media.
A success that has been envious: In the fall of 2006, podrían podrían was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe today SYNTEGRA Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why the unemployment rate of disabled workers remains so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are in search of work.
The 15th week for the employment of disabled opens today.
Despite a proactive policy implemented in 2005, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is two times higher than the average: 19%, compared with 9 percent of the total population.
Discouraging? "
"No," said Eric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt, the association that organises the week for the employment of disabled. "
"The progress made over the past 15 years are considerable."
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
"There is still a lot to do."
It must be said that for persons with disabilities, many barriers still exist before access to employment.
They are older: 37% more than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% were not the pan and on the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
In short, these criteria that makes the return to employment, and that is the crux of the problem, "according to Christian Grapin, general manager of Springboard, an association created in 1992 to help businesses recruit disabled workers.
So much for the brakes objectives.
Left unsaid, attitudes are changing, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre Precinct indicated that managers interviewed "a low level of awareness of disability," with a "representation of people in wheelchairs, mental or intellectual disabilities."
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the goal of 6% of disabled workers, set in a law... 1987.
The latest figures available, dating back to 2008, reported a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," said Pierre White, Director General of the Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with the law.
The evidence: The number of institutions "taxed", as well as the amounts paid, declined between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 to 46,000 structures (and 606 to 480 million euros).
"The Act of 2005, which increased contributions, has created a lot of pressure on businesses," said Pierre White. "
"But this improvement also reflected a real awareness, especially in large groups."
According to the Department of Employment, only 59 percent of establishments of 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of businesses from 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "That happiness"
Prior to face the Blues on Tuesday night (20h45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure of this friendly match.
It will not go so far as to say that there was complicity between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the podium in the auditorium at the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have indeed made peace.
Five months after the gesture of mood of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian breeder has nothing but praise for him.
"I am very glad to Eden, its progress and the fact that it is Belgian."
"I want to move forward," is to help support these worthwhile organisations.
The contrastre between its benefits in club and selection, "it is a very, is justified."
"Lille, I am throughout the year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I have to take my marks."
Spared against Romania on Friday night for the game against France, Hazard comes in Saint-Denis to finally "shine".
Without fail, however, the concept of "pleasure".
The Blues, he encouraged them since the age of 7 years and the victorious campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I have always been bear," he says.
Inevitably, this is to further strengthen the character "special" meeting.
Even that, "Mathieu Debuchy (), Yohan Cabaye () and Adil Rami ()," rapelle-t-il.
"It sat just now."
"To play against them, it is only of happiness!"
With bonhomie, Leekens, for its part, spoke of the "pride".
"Pride" to fight "a gala match."
"Pride" also see - quality of "neighbors" - that France is "once again a very high-level team" a little more than a year after the trauma of suggestions.
"Laurent Blanc has a work of thunder," he enthused.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would even share a plane with the Blues direction... Brazil in 2014.
"Our small Belgians are great," he said.
"We are building something, the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"You will see in the next few matches." That against France included.
Portugal very confident
Portugal's Paulo Bento began with much optimistic his dam return to Bosnia (10 p.m.), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
The move, the two teams had been realistic.
"At the end of the 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a country happy."
Paulo Bento are already, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not a shadow of a doubt, the Selecçao, of which he is in touch since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually to 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a game to play, and an adversary, Bosnia, to rip down.
In view of the match to go (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the games are not facts.
Portugal has dominated the party for more than an hour, but it has been unable to mark this goal so valuable, that would have relieved.
"This is a good result, which has, however, a certain risk because we have not made purpose outside"
But at home, in the light of the Luz Stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced, before an audience that should be boiling again, even if the party is obviously very tight, "according to a Bento optimistic but lucid.
"We expect a very tight game, but we are quite confident we can win," said the Portuguese coach for 42 years.
"We continue to have a 50% chance of being in the Euro 2012," has put the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The one reported Friday in Bosnia obliges the Portuguese to score and win.
No one may suffice for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"This is a good result, which has, however, a certain risk because we have not scored from outside," said Bento.
"We are going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and players with a lot of individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese have the intention to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians in order not to "not give them time to reflect."
A good idea, provided to be realistic, this time.
