The lack of snow discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and boarding houses .
Therefore , in the giant yet still they get free rooms to all winter dates including the Christmas and New Year's Eve .
On our site , we have a large number of visitors .
People are going through , the prices , but so far she has made to order .
And if the US call , so I ask if we will be this year's Christmas in the snow or mud , " said an information portal operator Spindl.Info Martin .
Who wants to stay in a New Year's Eve in Spindleruv Mlyn exactly according to imagine , I wouldn't hesitate .
Who is in favour of saving money and the quality of accommodation is for him to take second place , he may yet try to wait a couple of days .
So far the offer on New Year's Eve mostly weekly stays .
I think they will be a little more to give , but then they , too , and they go for a shorter period .
and then will be free rooms quickly disappear , " he estimated .
free beds in all winter dates still offers vrchlabská Ingtours travel agency .
Now we are more interested in Christmas week , which is not yet .
So half of jobs in our menu , remains free .
That's why we've prepared for any cheaper Christmas stays at the last minute , " said director Peter .
New Year's Eve in the giant may travel office yet , but also to offer free seats is less .
Good for sales and the first two days in February , the winter dates are sold on average .
This year , interest in the winter stays negatively affects the that in the giant is still not snow .
People lying in wait , if you can think of .
No one wants to spend the end of the year without the snow on the mountains .
If during the week of the snowy slopes , and Christmas , " he says .
On the contrary , slightly better than last year's horizon hotel rooms in Pec pod .
We're about five percent better .
On New Year's Eve to Christmas we have the last few jobs .
A big concern is about the Polish holidays in January and is sold in February , " said the director of the best hotel Karel Rada .
Eighty percent of New Year's Eve and hotel stays at Central Park in the spa .
On the contrary , for Christmas remains in the latest hotel even half the beds free .
US pleasantly surprised by January this year , which we already have in this moment of about 60 percent .
February is a bit weaker , but as soon as they think of snow , interest in stays in the giant must still go up , said the hotel manager Eric Sporysch .
on the snow , but so far they have to go .
Thursday's cool , if any , should be snow on the mountains .
But then has once again come to the warming , informed the Jiří Jakubský from the workplace of the Czech constitution .
The US is the mother of wisdom : recurrence
It's funny , with Barack Obama , the president with a reputation , repeated in the Afghan issue , the strategy of his predecessor , whom he considered to be the most idiotic .
When he finally vypotil its expected Afghan doctrine , it turned out that her over from Bush's Iraqi scenario three years ago .
not only in the very text uses the word several times the turnover " , as it did in Iraq , " but he did not even use the name Bush's declaration of January 2007 as the name of its own declaration : " new way forward " .
He himself three years ago , criticized Bush's idea to send fresh military reinforcements to Iraq beset by civil war as " irresponsible and in the aftermath of catastrophic decision " .
The subsequent months have shown , however , that the Bush strategy based on a recommendation from the field commanders , was the only possible and , so much so that today in the intelligence on Iraq at all .
Bush's reputation , but he left to his successor , objectively much default situation than can be expected .
In Afghanistan he hopes Barack Obama that he could repeat the miracle .
The increase in military contingent him again asked the field commanders , in particular the top commander of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal , even despite the harsh reality of the shooter in the White House .
He asked 40 thousand men , in order to break the situation for the better .
The president three months hesitated , but nothing better , and so at least the general 10 thousand soldiers .
From Europe , he managed to squeeze out the promise of a further 5 thousands , even though originally counted at least 10 .
On the face of the new Obama strategy seems to be to his intention to begin the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan for 18 months and to end this process within three years . All of the Obama doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers .
Many doubt that the increase in fruit can be the same as in Iraq .
Despite the internecine war in recent years , the Iraqi society is relatively good , its leaders to honor the agreement .
The Afghan situation is characterised by in the opposite - no one cannot rely on and no agreement is not respected .
Wrong , under these conditions , the Afghan security forces are being used to change every day , according to how it suits them .
The political institutions , even if they are formally based , will remain just outside the village , which will continue to be the patriarchal tribal relations .
The balance of interests of the various ethnic groups is an extremely complex whereas ratios , which further complicate the Pakistani and Iranian influences .
Even the creation of " the state " , which is the target of the operation , it doesn't look like all too real .
Obama's strategy at the time horizon .
Over the past eight years , the situation in Afghanistan deteriorated and is now on the verge of explosion .
To believe that soldiers into combat in order to " return home " will cause here made a miracle , can only really romantic soul , the facts .
From a political point of view is to determine the date of withdrawal of troops by the Taliban , because it will be seen as an indirect recognition of America's defeat .
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is nearing .
Europe's politicians can't and don't want to explain to voters , the manner in which the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the foothills of the Hindu Kush .
Another factor capable of radically to intervene into the situation is developments around Iran .
If the situation continues to deteriorate and reinforced sanctions on the Iranians would not work , before the United States , the question of whether we just try to solve the problem of the military force .
to reply to it , it will be just at a time when Obama's America to withdrawal from Afghanistan .
Any such solution , however , will mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation .
The only for Barack Obama , is the fact that , in the presidential election three years and , therefore , there's still plenty of time to come up with another strategy , if this proves to be a flop .

The secret of glow over Norway : the Russians were testing the rocket
over Norway , it has been possible to observe a special light effect of unknown origin .
The Russian Ministry of Defense yesterday acknowledged that near the Norwegian border , an intercontinental ballistic missile .
It was a start but failed again and shot referred to as the " type " Bulava " , which was originally intended to be the pride of the Russian Army , becoming a nightmare of black Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin .
his presence at the tests missiles on the success of the test flights .
majority at all or have been damaged in the air .
In the paper , " " , as the " rocket " .
The rocket , which doesn't fly but shines
This already filed 13 attempt took place at first .
When in flight , there was damage to technical apparatus .
The engine apparently exploded in the third stage of the rocket .
This time , " Bulava " taking off from a nuclear submarine , which went below the surface of the White Sea .
This type of missiles , allows you to be fired from the vessel , which is in the movement and at the same time .
Therefore , it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by the unidentified flying object was actually " Bulava " .
Indeed , from the first time they had no doubt that it is a Russian rocket .
The generals this time , and that we cannot speak clearly about failure .
The first two missiles , and an accident to hit the third .
In previous cases , the engines in the first instance .
Even if completely by the facts had not been not one Test start , for the failed leadership of the ministry of defence only six out of thirteen .
Almost 50 - 50 chance of success because the generals are filled with optimism and still claims that " Bulava " will one day fly without problems , and that even up to ten nuclear blocks on the maximum total weight of 1.15 tons .

The Czech discovery : the substance , which is working on the ' ' viruses of HIV
A team of Czech and German scientists test new compounds , which can slow down the spread of HIV virus in the body .
The main advantage of improved substance is that it works on the viruses , which have already acquired immunity against drugs .
This fact is , in some cases , that the compound to a normal variant of the virus is not as strongly as some already available medicines .
The disease has so far been unable to cure AIDS .
However , patients can greatly extend the life of a mixture of drugs which prevent the propagation of HIV virus in the body .
However , their use is accompanied by a number of side effects .
Moreover , the suppression of propagation of the virus has resulted in the development of the so-called resistentních viruses against which there are already drugs ineffective .
The work of experts of the three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic , Prague and from the University of Heidelberg , opens the way to deal with the virus .
They have demonstrated that the substances called on the protein responsible for the reproduction of the HIV virus .
Metalokarborany are compounds boron , hydrogen , carbon and cobalt .
These compounds are blocking the spread of virus otherwise than all today used drugs and , therefore , can overcome the problem of drug resistance .
In his work , scientists are coming with the new compounds based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their ties to the viral protein .
They have a unique three-dimensional structure : two cages of boron atoms of hydrogen and carbon , are connected by a metal , in this case .
The treacherous and resistant virus
HIV is the virus HIV protein , which is necessary for the life cycle of the virus .
without HIV proteázou fission caused by the HIV virus would not ripe infectious viral particles .
When we stop HIV , to stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body , scientists explain in a press release issued by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic .
In a study published in the scientific journal , the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry scientists describe a series of compounds in which there are two pairs of cages ( see table ) connected with a short chain , which is systematically .
slightly weaker , but more reliable
The effect of this series of HIV vaccines have been tested in a test tube , and also against its odolným ( rezistentním ) obtained from patients infected with the HIV virus .
The effect on the normal variant of the enzyme is not so strong as clinically used drugs , but its effect for resistant variant which used drugs are often ineffective .
A unique mechanism of action and also their other properties , such as biological and chemical stability , low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical adjustments from the interesting compounds for further research to design effective drugs against HIV , says Pavlína , head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and molecular genetics Institute of the Academy of Sciences .
The argument for the budget . the ODS has embarked on Fischer , the opposing
The head of the ODS Mirek Topolanek called the approved budget for the next year as " terrifying " , and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer , according to him , should consider the existence of the other .

access the ODS and social democracy on the issue of public deficits is a fundamentally different , " he said .

The House had raised money for the salaries of state employees , the operation of the social services and direct payments to farmers .
The government's proposals to address social democracy was that by increasing the budget deficit .
The Czech Republic should run a deficit 163 billion crowns .
Before the vote , left the hall , to comply with the wishes of the government , so that the revised budget is less bad than the budget .
disappointment and frustration
Finance Minister Eduard Janota , he spoke of his disappointment and frustration , the Prime Minister , Jan Fischer , said that the government will assess the current situation even more .
He is convinced that , if he really has threatened to leave the function in the case of the adoption of the amendments , the situation could be different .
According to the Czech television after the government ordered on Monday to the Prime Minister .
He suggested that , after all , is to remain in office .
The reason is his disappointment of the negotiations on the budget .
If Fischer has decided for the next fight a deficit budget , according to government what to do , which changes in the budget .
The Prime Minister should also be made clear that , if approved by the House of Commons next laws increasing the deficit , such as those that relate to the sick , pensions , or amendments to the Staff Regulations of the law .
The PM : ministers
It is a matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the government .
Ministers haven't done anything wrong , stressed the premier in a text message from the US .
He reminded that in several ministries are in positions of people reporting to the top , which voted against the budget .
He stressed that if the Fischer decides to abandon the principle of the fight with the amount of deficit of public finances , " it is perfectly logical and fair that rest on the left-wing majority , which is currently in the House of Commons " .
Then , he says , but it cannot count on the support and the tolerance of the Civic Democrats .
I hadn't thought about it , and when it's the current , so I'll be given to journalists , he said in the House of Commons , Defense Minister Martin , which the government nominated just's Civic Democrats .
Prime Minister Fischer this afternoon flew on the agenda of the European Council in Brussels .
At the request of Prime Minister Topolánek stepped back
While stressing that the ODS would on Wednesday in the House to vote against the amended budget , if the prime minister , a member of the Civil Democrats specifically asked that the adoption of the budget .
I feel like we're not orphans , small children , then responded to the question whether the ODS in the political negotiations on the budget of the absence of the President of the parties in the parliament and the Czech Republic .
I hadn't noticed that my voice .
When I gave up the mandate , so I knew that in the coming months will be to the house and destruction of all positive , alone .

Vaccination against will be free of charge and optional
Vaccination against since January .
to be the first family for free , and at the same time .
But there are voices , that it would be compulsory vaccination more effective .
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against the peak .
The institute now provides the maximum price of vaccines , which will pay for health insurance .
Experts also have a clear procedure for the vaccination .
The new vaccination
The vaccine free of charge for children in August
From January to May be vaccinated free of charge against the children , who were born last year , 2 August and later .
The condition is that we still do not have even one dose of the vaccine .
who began last year or sooner , it must pay for himself and others .
The first batch of vaccination must be brought between 3 and 5 . a month ago , the age of the child .
Last year , voluntarily left their children vaccinated against a quarter of families .
Parents , meanwhile , paid 1,600 crowns for one dose of even more .
While the need for vaccination , the youngest children are four benefits .
Overall , experts estimate that health insurance be issued on the vaccine doses of 300 to 450 thousand crowns a year .
But on the treatment that would be children without vaccination .
Yet for all the vaccination of children was roughly 500 thousand a year .
vaccination was introduced by the so-called Janotovým package .
It causes inflammation of the middle ear , but also a serious infection , including the brain and blood poisoning .
pneumococcal infections in the US for the year will die , according to surveys in hospitals to 28 children within 10 years .
In addition to the Czech Republic by the vaccination of children against in about 40 countries .
The vaccination will be compulsory ?
At the same time , but there are views that would in the future could be this vaccination compulsory .
From January to be paid by insurance companies and optional .
mandatory vaccination that it would be better , he suggested , for example , the boss of civil associations Rudolf Kalovský aloud .
His association pneumococcal vaccine in the long run .
Experts at the international conference , which our associations participated in , they were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccination .
It's not ideal .
On the other hand , we are glad that we have managed to push through at least this .
I think that's the way it is , now we have to get in , he said .
The ministry of health but the vaccination against change .
At the moment about it , said his spokesman .
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages , says doctors
The President support the company's practical children's doctors Hana Cabrnochová recognises that the voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages .
If they were vaccinated all the children , could be given to a reduction in the number of " for the situation , when the vaccine is , like , a relatively high amount , we understand the political decision that vaccination was voluntary , " he says of course .
Experts expect that their infants to vaccinate against from next year , more than 80 percent of the parents .
Vaccination against is a breakthrough , in spite of that , first , the vaccination of children to be borne by the health insurance companies , not the state .
Insurance companies should issue will save money for prevention , for further treatment , explains .
Doctors will have to buy the substances themselves .
But there was something to worry about practical children's doctors , which relate to the shopping vaccines .
According to the original plan , should a vaccine to purchase insurance companies and doctors would like , as the state adds substance to the other vaccination .
Some Members , however , feared that they could give insurance companies " money from the health insurance " .
Doctors will therefore have to buy the substance and wait until they are insurance companies .
According to estimates , will be made by individual doctors to invest in vaccines 40 thousand a month , which is a significant sum .
It won't be easy , he says .
Still , they and we
It may be a Muslim ?
pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state .
At a time when voters called for a ban on the construction of minarets , and in general , spreading alarm reports on the alleged islamizaci Europe , John Bowen , an American academic , wrote and informed and wondered whether it can integrate Muslims - and whether - to one of the continent's secular society .
Some of the readers , after reading this book became the last artist's work , " why do the French don't like scarves on his head " ( 2006 ) , this elegant and study on the disputed issues that divide and employ the country already for a period of 15 years and whose effects are still felt today .
The last book Mr Bowena has a wider and much more ambitious .
Like a good antropolog wants to know not only what politicians and the media said about Islam in France , but what actually happened in the base .
He spent months in mosques , schools and institutes , which is now taking care of 5 to 6 million of French Muslims , which Mr Bowen as " Islamic " .
It is a good listener , reproduces the debate between teachers and students on issues , which is most worried about .
Should a Muslim to join the volume in the mosque or at the City Hall ( or in both places ) ?
He should be on the development of the young Muslim and gay rights ?
It may be a Muslim to marry a man who is not a Muslim ?
A Muslim has the right to use the banking system if it wants to get a mortgage ?
It's these seemingly mundane issues , which have been mentioned , and which are part of everyday life , rather than the political drama , which employ media .
author identifies a new generation of teachers and intellectuals , among other persons , including the widely known , Arab , Muslim and academic , who was born in Switzerland .
This new generation is trying to open a debate on how this can be a good at the same time be a Muslim and a good citizen in the modern secular society .
They don't have the arguments for all of their customs .
The Conservatives are suspicious of the actual French or European Islam .
philosophers and activists , with which Mr Bowen did an interview , on the left , that this is a Sunni Islam , combined in Saudi Arabia - this group is a small , but affects the European Muslims .
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and the French secularism are compatible .
But the adaptation requires compromises on both sides .
It is the question of how far they are French politicians ( and intellectual elite , which doggedly defends the general public ) actually committed to the idea of pluralism .
It is of the opinion that the Muslims are in matters of faith may have less experience than Catholics , Protestants and Jews , who also had to make historical compromises to the secular .
Rather than the development of pragmatism , he found " tightening the screws values " .
It may be a Muslim ? after reading this book may have a tendency to say " yes , but not now . "

The ice is melting , an alarming speed , which has an effect on the animals and their survival as anywhere else .

In Cuba , there is a young community , led by the popular komentátorkou Sánchezovou , who often writes about how she and her husband and had been harassed by government agents .
Mrs Sánchezová repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country , in order to take over the prices , but the permit was denied .
The detention of the American vendor may be the result of the growing tension between the communist Castrovým brother , Cuba , and the Obama administration , which was monitored as " delaying tactics " in improving relations with the island .
As the first to report on the imprisonment of the New York Times on Friday night .
The new US policy , stressing that if the Cuban government will take concrete steps , such as the release of political prisoners and creates more space for the opposition , the United States will take reciprocal steps .
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba , although they are new and most sought after commodity in a country where the average wage of the employees is $ 15 a month .
The Cuban government has granted to ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones in this year ; these are used mostly prpo zasílání textovýchg reports , because the phone call would cost more than one daily wage .
The use of the Internet on the island is limited .
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and some government , such as universities .
The Cubans , who often want to log on , their names must notify the government .
Access to many of the Web page is prohibited .
An American detention in Cuba is a rarity .
Most of the US citizens in the prison in Cuba is behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling , said Gloria Berbenová , an official of the section for American interests in Havana .
Mrs Berbenová said that cannot provide more information about the prison .
His arrest and detention were clearly immoral .
Such activities , which would open in each other companies were legal - say , a free mobile phones - are in Cuba to a criminal offense , said Miguel Vivanco , director of the US program for the respect for human rights , which recently published a report on the basic freedoms in Cuba , named the " New Castro , Cuba , the same " as a reference to the installation of Raul Castro as the leader of the country and to pay for his older brother Fidel .

Personnel Administration rozkrývají conspiracy , concerning the broadcasting of men into Afghanistan .
The Pakistani authorities on Saturday revealed the alleged leader of the plot , concerning the posting of five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill members of the American units , and said that they hoped that this would be the case could help uncover the extensive network of terrorists , which he's on the Internet and is searching for young men .
Investigators said the search for a grey , known as Saifulláh , who invited the men to Pakistan after it first appeared , when one of these men to make public comment , the authorising officer terristické attacks Ma website YouTube .
He took over the management of these men as soon as they came to Pakistan , he tried to help them to get into a remote area of Pakistan in the indigenous tribes to Pakistan , which is home to Al Qaeda and its training camps for terrorists .
But Pakistani intelligence official , who submitted a report on the case , said on Saturday that it was unsuccessful in Al Qaeda commanders , and that the men were not part of the attempt to CIA infiltration into the terrorist network .
As a result , a few days after they were transferred to the eastern neighborhood , far from the mountains in the northwest , which has become a haven for terrorists .
They were seen as a unit .
That's why they were transferred , said the official , who spoke on anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case .
The official said that the men were not deterred by the and is still trying to obtain consent for obtaining access to the camps , when they were arrested , the exercise of rights .
The case of the five - which remained in Pakistan and was being questioned by the FBI - underlines the critical role in identifying potential terrorists , and maybe , which is much more important , to determine who is trusted .
Since the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the American intelligence service is the highest priority of attempts on the location of the human resources to al Qaeda .
The organisation of work as a guard , those who are not sufficiently serious in its commitment to the holy war , and those who might be spies .
American Al Qaeda recruits were subject to special scrutiny , analysts said .
But they were also considered to be extremely interesting in the group , because of their potential access to America's objectives and their promotional value .
But Evan Kohlmann , a senior analyst at the foundation , based in the US , said that terrorist groups also have become significantly more cautious in recent years , in order to allow the came up to them , because the American intelligence agency experts on their recruitment methods .
If we're trying to get to these groups , there's no better way than to follow their recruitment model , which was already so much ? " said Mr Kohlmann .
This model is one of those that is far more based on the site .
Tens of thousands in Copenhagen , called the Climate Action '
Tens of thousands of protesters in the streets , this Saturday and pressed for stronger action on climate change from the negotiators in the Bella Convention Center .
The protesters have reported the number of many hundreds of thousands of participants in this event , but the police said that the number was closer to 25,000 .
The event was relatively calm and a handful of activists placed a couple of small bombs near a group of government buildings in the centre of the city .
On the day when the incident occurred at the talks on climate change , which has sponsored the UN , thousands of activists as they walked through the city and carried banners with inscriptions , " this is not a planet " B " ( minor ) and one in , of all things , " he says . "
Several celebrities took part in the protest , including the Danish model and fotografky Heleny Christensenové , which stated that in his mother's birthplace in Peru , and has given me the information on the state of the country , which is involved in the impact of climate change , which is still taking place .
That's part of the reason why we decided to connect to this great March - to the world and to appeal to the leaders of the world , to present a fair , ambitious and binding agreement , " she said .
This is not an easy task , but it is necessary to carry it out , it can still be avoided .
Police prevented the protesters from approaching to the centre of Bella , and said that they had arrested 19 persons , in the first place because they should either mask or should pocket knives .
These activities are under Danish law , during the demonstrations .
According to one of the spectators , who does not wish to be identified , because it is involved in climate change activists as athletes and in black suits the several bombs near the main channel of Copenhagen , which is located near several ministries .
The buildings , he said , but this was followed by " several large explosions . "
Inside the conference center , people gathered around television screens to watch the parade during the afternoon .
But the protest is likely to have penetrated the consciousness of key officials , such as Su , the chief Chinese negotiator on climate change .
When he was asked whether the demonstrations still had a constructive impact on the international agenda , said the English " , that is something that I was not aware of " ( actually it's something ) .
Then he went in and said , " because the scene is extensive , I can't hear what's going on out there . "
watch to see whether the march of pain or , depending on the outlook for everyone .
It is easy to see the concentration of the general public and various sectors and the subject of climate change , he said .
In other words : " You can say , however , that this is a distortion of the negotiations or the freedom of other persons .
The date of the test revealed the lingering racial differences
A federal certificate from last week on the knowledge of mathematics was a welcome element of good news about the public education , District of Columbia .
Even when the District far lagging behind the highly productive systems country , certificates showed greater progress for pupils and classes in the last two years than in the cities , including Atlanta , Chicago and New York .
But what remains hidden behind the numbers , the national centre for progress in the classroom are persistent differences in the knowledge between African-Americans and white students and page after page after page of local and national .
The result of the average white pupils in classes of District of Columbia in the last two years has increased from 267 to 270 points ( out of a possible 500 ) , but their peers to only three points , from 209 to 212 .
The difference in the knowledge-based economy is actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points .
The progress of African-Americans in the eighth grade remains essentially in balance , with a statistically insignificant one point from 245 to 245 .
The result of the average for white students was not included in the results of the test , because the sample size was not big enough .
The image in a term of six years is not encouraging .
The difference between white and black students classes in 2003 , when he was first carried out in the area , was 60 points to 262 scale ( 202 ) .
Even if the result in children from groups during this period , the difference is 58 .
Some advocates for education in the District in the last week expressed that the results , oslavované tajemnicí Michelle A. M. and the mayor of Adrianem Fentym ( D ) were of white students rozsáhleji stimulovány , where there were already high results .
That would imply that we increase the sum of the aid of those at the higher end of the scale , which is problematic and disturbing , said Jeff Smith , the executive director of the D.C. voice , non-profit group that advocates equality in the district .
I'm not jumping up and down for two or three points , said a member of the committee , Kwame R. Brown ( D-At Large ) , who has a daughter in the fourth grade of elementary school in Eatonu .
often kritizujíce management style lady , Mrs Brown said that a report on the results of the test means high school education in the town is in a desperate state and requires attention .
It is clear that always want to see the virtues of and I respect that .
But what is that we didn't pay almost no time and energy , which had to be paid to the middle of our education .
Mrs Rheeová said that the district's continuation in the search for better ways to focus on the needs of students with low results .
Thus , for example , some teachers are trained in the use of the new curriculum , reading system , aimed at students in higher grades of primary schools and middle schools , students who couldn't handle the basics of reading earlier in his kolní significantly lag behind their peers .
Everyday Mathematics curriculum and teaching math to sixth grade , games and experience of real life , which put them in the district for the former director Clifford Janeyiho , can be traced to the progress which has been made , the report last week .
And I think that we should continue the work and implement the best possible interventions for those students who remain below the level of the class , she said .
Other analysts said that the results made clear to the question of whether Mrs Rheeová can continue in the overall system performance and to provide more money and resources for schools with low efficiency , which is necessary for the nullification of the difference .
It's a dilemma Mrs Michell , said Bruce Fuller , a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley , where she is studying the results of the tests in urban areas .
conventional procedure to remedy is to focus resources and administrative reform at the school , located in the worst parts of the District of Columbia .
So the focus to political repercussions , which are against important agenda .
But there I was , however , one of the other directors , who is trying to keep the middle between white and black .
We have to focus on the creation of a system of large schools .
We have our schools , so that all the family , regardless of where they live , they could rely on , that their children will be provided an excellent public education .
Mr Janey , now the director of schools in Newark , he said in an interview this week that an essential element of the reduction of the difference between the results achieved , is an extension of the traditional public school year , currently 180 days in the area , to establish the validity of the schools .
You have to get up to 200 days , to be able to push through the changes , said Mr Janey , who concluded a contract with their teachers Association last year for the school year in the length of the 185 days , which considers it to be a " flag " for the search for a larger increase in the next year .
to make higher education part of the better future

Parents have received high school in El Salvador .
Still , that was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale , have never entered the house .

Yes ! that's it ! " she said , which would like to study medicine when the wizard offered to enter into the building .
Wow , really ? " she said , when the low ratio of professors to students .
The college was one of the seven , which visited on his trip , and now they were completely in the future : the question is not whether to enter the house .
The question is where .
But this is a problem relating to the high number of children born in the US , Spanish immigrants , who are excluded from the high schools or pregnant as minors , but there are hundreds of thousands of those who will get a college education and into the middle class .
In fact , the " fifth generation " of Spanish pupils from the track - achieved remarkable results indicate that many of their parents , mostly Mexicans and Central America , they came to the United States , without have completed high school .
Their success story is important , the researchers , because it underlines the point the way forward for their generation , who played a marginal role in the field of the workforce in the country .
Those who have reached the higher education , they say , should be a natural to the school and the energy and the will to succeed .
Many also have parents who set the children high goals and looking for ways to replace the ignorance of the American education system .
But the school programs also play a special role in helping Graciele and millions of children , which would like to track - especially if these efforts in the time persists .
If considering that the children of the groups with low incomes , whose parents do not have the experience and ability to help them in the system , free from any interference in each individual that will not solve the point , says Patricia Gándara , researcher at the University of California at Davis , where she studied students from the Latin American region .
We have to think about it , to provide these children in pre-school age in all ways , to a high school .
The federal program , which financed the trip after the track , it's a useful example .
known as gear up ( SE ) , provides more than 300 million dollars a year for the local education systems for the start of preparatory programs , which they used for students of the groups with little income to the middle schools and continue until these students of a high school .
Since 1999 , this program has served more than 10 million students , of which more than % entered on the tracks , according to the US Department of Education .

Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war and American companies here in the first place on the way Asians and Europeans , said Ruba Husari , editor of Iraq Oil Forum , online news service .
It will be a long time before something else will be in Iraq for sale .
Concerns about safety , highlighted by coordinated bomb attacks Tuesday and political instability , as well as download the American army is likely to discourage American companies from a much more intensive business in Iraq , which has proved to be the third largest raw material reserves , analysts say .
US companies have been in some cases at a disadvantage , in particular , the Chinese and the other governments controlled energy firms have noticeably lower operating costs and are more vulnerable to the risk , because they are not accountable to shareholders .
The company , Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc . , were the only American companies which have concluded an agreement with the ministry .
A leading American companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips , which maintain close contacts with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil industry and offer technical assistance in the past years , they left empty-handed .

A top al Qaeda was killed in Pakistan .
When the impact of American missiles near the border between Pakistan and China in this week was probably killed a top Al Qaeda operations , announced on Friday , officials of the American Department .
How are confirmed , it would be the second fatal attack on one of the top leaders of the terrorists .

He was involved in the world , said a senior official , who did not wish to be named , who claimed the sensitive nature of the American air strikes in the territory of Pakistan .
If he held such a central position , it may have been involved in the attacks against the United States and Europe .
He received instructions from Al Qaeda's top leadership and on the basis of them planned to possible terrorist attacks .

The top delegate of the United Nations in Kabul .
The top delegate of the United Nations in Afghanistan , Kai Eide , said on Friday that he wanted to withdraw from his of his duties in March and end a stormy term of office which was allegations of massive corruption in the election of a president in Afghanistan , supported by the UN .
To the left , because the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 additional American troops to Afghanistan .
A delegate to the UN , said that he supported the increase , but expressed concern that the timetable for the US for a reduction in the state , which starts in 18 months should be a challenge for the governments of the other NATO nations to withdraw their forces .
We need to speed up the building of the security forces and to send the right signal that they have confidence in the international community , he said in a telephone interview from Kabul .
The commitment must be long-term .
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed for the United States and other military forces , to increase the number of international civilian personnel to assist in the political transformation of Afghanistan .
On the side of the armed forces must be on the civilians , he said .
Eide said that , but that's just to fulfil a promise he had made to his family in March 2008 , in Kabul to spend only two years .
Still , he said , wanted to submit a report to the UN .
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now , he said , would need the time for finding a refund .
As I said , it is time to look for the Dauphin , Eide said .
When I came here , it was here two months a vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival .
According to officials of the UN ban started the search for a refund .
The officials said that they will be decided between Staffanem Di , who is the origin and previously led the UN mission in Baghdad , and Jeanem-Maria Guéhennem , the Frenchman , who before he led the UN peacekeeping operation .
The situation in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy , Peter W. , who was accused in September President , who won the presidential election in the cloak of the presence of massive electoral fraud .
Eide denied these claims , but said the charges - which was released - " certainly damage the mission , because there was a high degree of scepticism with regard to the international interference " in the election .
Eide said that the proposed meeting with the representative of citizens because of the coordination of relief efforts for the leadership of the US forces in Afghanistan .
Also at the leadership of the UN , to enable his successor to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries , which would be for the mission , because , as he says , he wanted to strengthen their confidence that their money is properly .
Eide has expressed disappointment over the limitations of its efforts in Afghanistan and the UN , said that the cumbersome regulation on hiring undermine its ability to use the powers .
The UN rules are such that I had the opportunity to obtain since May , only one person , he said .
This is a disaster , and I cannot continue .
Gates : Iran faces sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon impose on Iran " significant additional sanctions " because of the lack of involvement in talks about its nuclear ambitions .
Gates , who was speaking to a group of about 300 American troops in northern Iraq during the weekly trip to areas where the war is fought in Afghanistan and Iraq , the prospect of armed actions against the Islamic Republic .
It is not a good choice for Iran , he said in response to a query on the likely development of the soldier .
One of the things that depends on me , it's the one that I've learned something from Iraq over the past six years , [ it ] is the unpredictability in the war .
The Obama administration will be decided in a package of sanctions , which could hit the military and political elite , but Gates indicated that some of these sanctions could also affect the ordinary .
He said that " a package of incentives and " would require " to persuade the government to actually feel less safe with nuclear weapons , " because " her people will suffer " sanctions .
According to Friday's opinion , issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs , the administration has engaged the European leader in warning that Iran will bear the serious consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program into full compliance with the UN Committee for nuclear safety and its supervisory authority , the International Agency for Atomic Energy .
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise is only for peaceful purposes .
At the talks in Geneva on 1 October , has hinted that he wants to return to the talks on the reduction of their nuclear programme and agreed that they will provide a substantial part of its stocks of low enriched uranium in exchange for badly needed fuel for the reactor to the implementation of medical research .
The administration for such an agreement as a way for the establishment of mutual trust between the two parties and to allow time for negotiations .
But since then , it seems , is stepping down from the provisional agreements - partly because , according to the expert , because leadership is divided in opinion , whether it is to engage in the United States .
Frankly , with regard to the international community , in the case of certain proposals which really agreed at the beginning of October , I think it has brought the international community , including the Russians and Chinese on the road together , which is not in the terminology of additional sanctions against the gates , he said .
President Obama has set for December 31 . the final deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals before he returns to the search for other elections , including monitoring , which Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton , once called the " sanctions " .
In its opinion , issued in New York , iránská mission at the UN on Thursday condemned what she called " groundless allegations " against some members of the security committee on the nuclear activities and said that he wants to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers " to achieve a reasonable long-term solutions .
Gates , who returned to Washington last Friday , he met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before he flew to the region of Kurdistan , rich in oil , to meet with troops and Kurdish leaders in .
There is still a high tension between the Kurds and Iraq's Arab majority , in particular because of the border , and the distribution of income .
He urged both parties to reduce the potential for conflicts in order to delay the US plans to reduce the number of American soldiers from 881 to 50,000 by the end of August .
Gates also tried to dampen the Kurdish concern from persistent depression . The US official quoted the gates when he told Massoudu Barzáanímu , president of the regional government : " We want to protect your security , prosperity and in a united Iraq .
We don't want you to leave . "
In China , the change in the exchange rate
Wang and her husband grew up surrounded by posters , which read that " mother earth is too tired to fund more children " , and " one child , it means one grave " .
Then they got a lesson that , when a government official in Shanghai , the low birth rate and ageing population in their city , suddenly changed course in this summer , and began to encourage young couples , their response was immediate and determined : never .
We have always devoted all their time and energy to just one child .
Nothing we have left for the second , says Wang , 31 years , manager of human resources , who has a son .
More than 30 years of China's policy to have only one child was put in place and has created a generation of only two notorious boubelatých and children , " little emperors " , the country threatens the population crisis .
The average fertility rate decreased to 1.8 children per couple in comparison with six than vpolitika vsoupila into force , according to the UN .
The distribution of the population , where the number of people aged 60 years and above , forecast that the population will grow from 16.7 percent in the year 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050 . This is far above the overall average of around 20 percent .
The imbalance is more rich coastal towns with a population with higher education , for example , in Shanghai .
Last year , people aged 60 years and above accounted for almost 22 percent in Shanghai registered population , while the birth rate was less than one child on the couple .
Xie Lingli , director of the Shanghai Municipal Commission for population and family planning said , many couples to have children , to " help reduce the proportion of an ageing population and the reduction of the establishment of the workforce in the future " .
He says it's about it " to be old , that doesn't mean to be rich - as in developed countries , such as Japan or Sweden " .
The gradual
How it was put into the Constitution the country in 1978 , China's policy of one child is probably still the most controversial mandate , established under the rule of the Communist Party .
The pair , which violated the policy , they would face a tremendous fines - up to three times their annual salary in some areas - and discrimination at work .
China's official policy , which helped the country to prevent the use of natural resources , while the defenders of human rights , they were permitted in the enforcement of the policy .
In rural areas , some officials , forcing pregnant women in the second child to undergo abortions .
In addition , many of the pair had to undergo selective abortion , leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women .
In recent years , the population officials were gradually milder in its opinion to the policy of one child .
In 2004 , as a rule , povolovali výce exceptions - including the population of cities , members of national minorities , and in cases where a man and a woman have been - and in 2007 to mitigate their passwords , the hard line .
Qiao Xiaochun , a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Beijing University , said that officials of the central government has previously debated the with more radical changes , such as allowing couples to have two children , if one of the partners was an only child .
In June , has become the first Chinese city , which launched an aggressive campaign for incitement to more .
Almost overnight , the posters were parents , to have only one child , replaced by the regulation , in detail , how it would be justified to have a second child , and how to apply for a permit .
The city administration has sent officials planning for families and volunteers , so that they can meet with couples in their houses and leaflets under the door .
It also promised to provide emotional and financial counseling for those that have decided to have more than one child .
The response was cool , said officials planning for families .
Zarmucující response
Even if officials in one rural town in Shanghai , there has been an increase in interest in pairs , which wanted to have a second child after the start of the campaign , most of the urban districts .
Urban district with 881 , for example - - still four to five cases a month .
Officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign is the number of babies born in the city in 2010 was still expected only around 165 000 - slightly higher than in the year 2009 , but lower than in 2008 .
Feng , head of the Committee for family planning in Shanghai , said that financial considerations were likely to have been the main reason why people don't want to have more children .
They want to provide the best of the first child , he said .
Yang , 27 years old , and his wife , Liu , 26 years , she said she would like to have two children and it was legally allowed to tell them .
But as many of the Chinese , who have only a lack of health and life insurance provided by the government .
Without dociální záchytné network could be the choice of being irresponsible .
People in the West to consider the policy of one child is wrong as a matter of law , says Yang , a structural engineer , whose wife is in her seventh month of pregnancy in volume with the first child .
Yes , we were taken from you a chance to have more than one child .
But the problem is not only in politics .
It's about the money .
Other couples to be given psychological reasons .
Wang , manager of human resources , says that they have only one child , because she also was an only child : " We were at the heart of our families , and all of us .
We weren't being used for the provision of care and , in fact , we didn't want to take care of the other .
Chen , 42 , who own the translation company , has put it much more address .
For the parents of the middle class , who reduced the fertility rate , he said , to be a successful means to be selfish .
Today's 20 and waxing on parents as the first days experiment with capitalism , and they don't want this for himself , he says .
Just one child is enormous requirements on time parents , he says .
The mother must sacrifice for at least two years of their social life .
Then there are still disputed questions - " you'll have to rebuild your apartment " - and the strategy - " you must have a resume prepared at a time when a child is 9 months for a good pre-school education .
Most of his friends he wants to be content with one child , says Che , but not two .
We are the first generation with higher standards , he says .
We don't want to make too many victims .
The UN group laid out a plan for the reduction of emissions .
sponsored by the UN conference on climate change - and each other - again on Friday focused on the release of the document , which proposes ambitious reduction of the quantity of greenhouse gases over the next 40 years with industrialized nations , most of the burden in the immediate term .
The text , which may provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases , stresses the remaining obstacles , as well as the way forward .
But it was important to see progress in the negotiations , which took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders who will come to Copenhagen next week .
The working group created the UN ad hoc , this text , how much money rich countries should provide the poor for coping with the global warming in the short term and in the long run .
and provides the full range of options for the key questions , including how to develop and manage the economy so that they can reduce their carbon output and what should be the upper limit the increase in global temperatures , which political leaders will be able to tolerate .
It's the process a great deal of flexibility , says John Coequyt , chief representative of the Sierra Club .
Michael Zammit Cutajar , who suggested the document of the 180 pages of text from the negotiations for the focus on what a top official on issues of climate change at the UN , Yvo de Boer , described as a " big picture " .
The outlines of the outlines for a possible deal , in which they would be together industrial nations to reduce their emissions in the year to 25 to 45 percent compared with 1990 levels , while the main developing countries could reduce their emissions during this period to reduce to 15 to 30 percent .
Together , the country could reduce emissions by the year 2050 , between 50 and 95 percent .
The European Union discussed on Friday the promise of that will provide 3.6 trillion dollars over the next three years to help the poorer countries to adapt to the climate change - from coping with the floods and drought to the prevention of deforestation .
Still , but on Friday said the same type of fireworks that prevailed at the talks in the last week .
The US special envoy for climate change Todd Stern dismissed the speech , requiring binding restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries compared with the main emerging economies , should have been financed by the developed world .
The move signaled that the Obama administration nastolila harder line against China go to the officials of the Bush administration's just two years ago .
The United States will not accept the treaty without the transfer of the main developing countries and the implementation of actions , " said Stern , who also complained that the text is not sufficient to cover the limitations and should be examined by outside observers .
Stern made this comment about an hour after the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said the Central American negotiators on the issues of climate change that either the lack of " common sense " or " exceptional " irresponsibility led earlier in the week on the communication that the United States would not help financially China , in order to deal with global warming .
With the future of the world's major economic powers at stake , both within the developing world , as well as between the world and emerging economies .
The current fighting is mostly on the conservation of individual economies , rather than on the conservation of the planet , between China and the United States about the performance of their relevant commitments , while poorer nations to the fact that two of the most influential countries in the world to ignore scientific imperative for the implementation of actions .
Ricardo , a delegate of Costa Rica , said that it is not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the cost of the greenhouse gases , while the vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in the search for a way to prevent the big issuers responsibly in their actions .
It's a game that new economic hegemony is being developed , he said , which also serves as a regional advisor in the area of regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international protection of nature .
Some of the countries which are the most zranitelnelné effects of climate change have indicated that they wish to continue the promotion of a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen , but most of the main participants , she said , that the best result of the talks will be the political agreement .
The alliance of small island states , which has 43 members , has created a draft agreement last Friday morning .
Artur Runge-Metzger , who had led the international negotiations on climate change for the benefit of the European Commission , said that the enforcement of the small island nations , " has caused a political momentum to the process , " in part because they are now united and demand action from the fast-growing economies , such as China and India .
The negotiations sparked a new sense of urgency , as soon as the delegates focused on the fact that most of the remaining contentious issues must be resolved before the heads of government on the deal .
high-ranking officials , such as , for example , the Indian minister of environmental protection and the Chinese deputy minister got out of the aircraft and the Bella Center to a closed door meetings and conferences so they could set a new claims , which will be assessed next week .
The vast majority of the Assembly - where the 13,000 people every day to and from the Congress Center , the guitar playing activists inscenovali night ironizující spectacle of countries , which believed that put them forward , and there has been a transfer of proposals from hand to hand on the paper rather than by electronic mail - dominated by the challenge .
The intensity is only an extension of : in Copenhagen were present at almost all of the key ministers and in the center of the 60 heads of state .
We have come to the high category , said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez , said the deputy minister for the global policy at the international protection of nature .

The first British train with a speed of 140 miles per hour this Monday feelings
At 5 : 13 Monday morning hvizd cut through the darkness in a sign of the departure of the train , which meant a transport revolution in Britain .
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will reach the speed of 140 miles per hour and will fly from Ashfordu in Kent to London St Pancras and the distance of 58 miles for 38 minutes .
Lord Adonis , the transport minister , then joined the Mrs Kelly Holmesové and got into the first high-speed passenger trains outside .
He hopes that the new service will link Britain with the international networks of rapid , reliable trains and large urban agglomerations of Midland , the North and Scotland , with London .
Stagnant water should shorten the transport times in passenger transport and trade , and the transition from aircraft and cars on the rail , could reduce carbon emissions , and to eliminate the traffic jams on the roads .
In theory , the three main political parties in order to get to this vision .
But tens of thousands of pounds , necessary for the building of a new national railway network , the inevitable fight for projects and concerns about the distortion of the environment now British building high-speed rail lines .
High Speed Two ( HS2 ) , a company created in January to provide a government study , submitted its report to Lord Adonisovi 30 December , as stated by the Times .
It provided him with a detailed map of the planned routes to the next stage of the high-speed network .
The new trace links London with the West was designed to five meters in urban areas and neighborhoods , where they would be on the environment could be problematic .
In an open landscape was scheduled to run until 25 m the final route .
Also , is planned to determine the three options for a high-speed network leading to the north .
Lord Adonis will reply in the spring .
The preferred choice is the shape of the letter Y , when one of the high-speed line should lead to the West Midland .
The track should share with one near Birmingham , passing through the branches of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland , and the other , head to the northeast into Sheffield , Leeds and Newcastle over the Tyne .
One track should lead to Scotland .
" It looks like it is the most effective choice , " he said , and an expert on railways .
As soon as it is ready , the journey times between London and shall be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes .
The first stage , which opened a year ago by 2025 , could enable passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared with the more than one hour in the presence of .
The proposals should allow trains to run at a speed of 2250 miles an hour , which would have made of the British network here the fastest in Europe .
The initial line already proposes to hold the trains in the length of 400 m , which would have been able to carry the 1100 .
Up to 18 trains would operate every hour on the track , London and Birmingham .
That means that , in the case of the London terminal would be able to handle the needs of up to 20,000 passengers per hour .
due to the restrictions , it is assumed that the existing station would be expanded to include the high-speed network .
Experts argue that only San Pancras International , or offer such potential .
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not to implement this scheme , but extensive public consultation and planning procedures , means that the final decision will not be made before the general election .
Even if the wheels in motion , the network should be after parts of the building .
Trains should first be put into service on the high-speed lines , but already existing lines north of Birmingham and the journey times between London and Scotland over three hours .
This is regarded as a crucial point of contact for the transition from the aircraft on the trains , a reference point for the revolution on the railroad .

The Association of UDF increases the tone and calls on the side of the new centre , to keep their title .
The Association of the UDF , a party to the controlled MoDemFrançoise Bayrou , on Friday reacted to an attempt by the president's party , the new centre on the appropriation of the former Giscardovy parties that must not be used in any media under the threat of criminal prosecution .
Hervé Morin publicly announced its intention to appropriate the UDF with François Bayrou doesn't deserve to carry on her legacy , after he handed the left hand .
The minister of defense , whose party is a partner of the UMP , had planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before a national movement by the Nouveau Centre ( NC ) .
This step has the support of the members of the de Charetta ( former za-UMP now for the NC ) , which claims its ownership of the UDF , because it was the first he left in 2004 to register in the National Institute of Industrial Property ( National de la Propriété Industrielle ) .
But on Friday evening , the committee of the Association of Friends of François Bayrou , who do not intend to leave , he stepped out of his silence and handed a formal request to the minister and members of parliament to stop the use of a shortcut and handed back ownership of trademarks , under the threat of criminal prosecution .
In the last few days , you're a declaration that his political movement + + again to take over the abbreviation of the UDF , writes in his letter , signed by 19 of 24 members of the committee , of which , for example , François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from the modem or Senator Jean Arthuis from the alliance .
You were also considered appropriate to place on their promotional materials and welcome the website of the movement of your name + the new centre , with the slogan " + + , today also signatories to the letter .
As you are aware , you have no right to use this shortcut , explains the UDF , which asks the NC movement " immediately to remove all references to the names of all the promotional materials including ( their ) websites " .
It also asks the Hervého de Charettea " to give ownership of trademarks of legitimate owners . "
If you do not do so , let's go to the courts to have respected the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF , the attention of the signatories .
In his letter that the UDF " is a fully-fledged political hnutíod 1978 " and point out that Mr Morin and his friends " have chosen " retirement in 2007 , " to create a competitive , as well as others in 2002 , to form a UMP .
The new centre does not , then , according to them , have no right to use the UDF ( Union pour la démocratie Française ) .
They also point out that the last Congress voted in 2007 to connect to the modem for three years and for the creation of a committee to defend the " moral and material interests " associations based Valery Giscard d'Estaing .
As regards the Hervého de Charettea continues with the committee , " when he picked out the trade mark " , was " already three years a member of the UDF , " but the UMP .
and fraudulently used the lack of registration to do so on its own account .
This is beginning to be turned into a criminal offence , they contend , and then with the irony to the strategy for the NC : " It seems to us that , in politics , in the ordinary course of life is more valuable to make a name for themselves , than to get out of the anonymity of fraudulent names , the adoption of which do not have the right to " .
The case : François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of state weakness .
A court in Nanterre on Friday decided to judge the artist Françoise-Marie Baniera and bring judgment , whether he used state of weakness in order to prepare it for a part of its assets , of which it blames her daughter .
A photographer ( 62 ) , known for his photographs of the famous will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for the misuse of the state of weakness , which is a criminal offence for which the imposing a sentence in a maximum duration of 3 years and a fine of EUR 375 000 .
This decision confirms that actually takes place in the process , which can be categorised as a family saga of one of the richest families in France , in which each other can think of a mother and daughter and fighting on the management of the empire .
But 15 criminal court also ordered the medical examination of 87 leté Liliany Bettencourtové , which should be carried out by the College of three doctors .
The heiress and the main company L'Oreal has always refused to undergo such testing , certainly not on the terms offered by the state prosecutor in Nanterre during the investigation .
Doctors , who will be elected on Friday , should draw up a report on 10 March 2010 and at the same time to submit its observations , whether she could be in a state of weakness , and in which the period .
I think that it will be .
I talk to her , he said , after the end of the hearing Mrs Bettencourtové lawyer , Georges Kiejman .
As far as the lawyer Francois Bettencourtové-Meyersové , Olivier Metznera , welcomed the court's decision .
It's excellent report ( ... ) . that with this old lady , who needs protection , manipulated ( M. ) , he said .
Two years ago , the only daughter Liliany Bettencourtové initiated criminal proceedings against Banierovi , photographer and , whom they blame for years that he was using the state of weakness of her mother , in order to gain a gift of EUR 1 billion in the form of cheques , contracts for life insurance or images .
But always , believing that it would be a photographer , who is regarded as a long-term friend , handled .
While the court had to assess the validity of the claims made by Mrs Bettencourtovou-Meyersovou , Friday's the speech of lawyers and melted into the family hour of truth .
The lawyer submitted three letters , which his client ( in 1999 , 2003 and 2005 ) sent its notaries , and in which they expressed their distrust of her husband .
In a letter to the 2003 , according to the attorney , adding : " Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote for a period of 15 years , once to twice a day .
Ever since she got married , I was never going to talk " .
The state prosecutor's office in Nanterre again found that the negotiations cannot be justified , it's more than that , in these days of the judge rejected her request for the initiation of a proceeding to the issue of legal protection for her mother .
" It is fully able to participate in the court , is not under the protection of or in custody .
No one else for it to act will not be confirmed , " a representative of the prosecutor general , Marie-Christine Daubigneyová .
In the end , the court decided that the validity of Mrs Bettencourtové-Meyersové expressed at the time of the start of the process .
The revolution or the end of the economic intelligence ?
If nothing is going to change in the management of large French companies , our fight for the development of the economic intelligence was unnecessary . . .
For more than ten years is reminiscent of the behavior of the management of large companies for the staff of the companies access to the consumers before the revolution : the aim is to ensure that identified them as collaborators with the " values " designated by the mountain , as was the case before , when there was a need to impose on consumer products , which originated in the ideas of heads of technicians .
The fact that a customer has become a centre of entrepreneurial companies marketing strategy mining market revolution in the right direction . . . even if efforts to impose authoritarian products different from customer preferences , regularly coming back !
passive approach employees may lead to death .
suicides at France Telecom , a dog or a Renault are only visible parts of a much more general phenomenon , which affects mostly managerial cadres .
this adversely affects the development of all the functions of the company , including research and development , and , what is more important , the economic intelligence .
And , indeed , EI " requires from all interested parties ( ... ) the active access and the ability to anticipate " and requires from the staff of the commitments which are entirely contrary to the revenue management .
Therefore , we call on the managerial revolution , which should aim to workers at the center of the interest of the company as well as a client .
The usefulness of the relative internal surveys of public opinion .
Internal surveys of public opinion - as a questionnaire submitted by the employees of the company Orange - will contribute to a revolution in the managerial procedures ?
Unfortunately , I'm afraid I'm not .
mainly because I convinced myself that in the face of the new situation , the structure of the various returns as a priority , to do so . . . what I always do !
In addition , because of authoritarianism , as one of the power , increases in proportion to the severity of their own failures .
And finally , because most of the workers has simplified view of human behavior .
Because they are graduates of universities for engineers , mechanical interpretation of psychology .
because of the convenience of thought take the old theory , is currently " again " from the US and without scientific knowledge of the constitution and the media .
with the fact that it is possible to move " levers " ( sic ) the involvement of managers , showed a recent Ipsos survey agency on the pages , which only underscores the management staff in their position of mechanical , unsuitable for today's world .
to identify and measure the factors of mobilization .
On the contrary , the revolution is necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises , for the adoption of a final vision of human behavior .
lies in the integration of the basic insight into all the intentions and practice management : for the staff of the commitments to the company will be possible only if it will seem like a clear means to achieve their dreams , ambition and projects .
Currently , this concept of the motivation of staff involved in the only study of functional analysis .
These studies have shown that assesses their undertakings on the basis of the intended to allow them to be , through the image , which the company says , to assess what the offers to the realisation of their life goals .
Thanks to identify and measure the mobilisation of these factors may have the staff to check , and on its " social " and its management of human resources " on the right path " .
This creates a breeding ground for the development of a solid and effective economic intelligence .
The result of the Oslo : " just war " Obama earned him praise from the right .
The American right on Friday welcomed a speech by Barack Obama made the day before in Oslo , happy with the way that the holder of the Nobel peace prize for the year 2009 , he defended the concept of " just war " against the enemies of the United States .
The Conservatives , who at first laughed at the price of Obama , 9 October , this time a presidential speech , including Sarah Palin , the former vice-presidential nominee in the election in 2008 .
I liked what he said about it , she said , Palin , the muse of right-wing Republican wings for USA Today , and added that she herself on the subject , " sometimes " war must be expressed in his memoirs , which are based on .
The war is , of course , the last thing the Americans would like to have some work to do , but it's necessary .
All the terrorists is to be held , it believes .
President Obama , who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after George W. Bush , who on Thursday in Oslo , justified the deployment of forces and used the speech to clarify its decision to send a further 30,000 troops to Afghanistan , nine days before .
Obama's next opponent , Newt Gingrich , said that the president had done a " very good job " .
I think that the speech was really very good , congratulated the former Speaker of the House of Representatives , which in particular appreciate the president's reference to " the existence of evil in the world . "
In a way , I felt this was the speech as a matter of historical , Gingrich said during an interview on the radio " The Takeaway " .
The former member , whom some considered a possible Republican candidate in the presidential elections of the year 2012 , he was so impressed that he sees " a left-wing president , " recalled the members of the committee for the Nobel Prize , " that they would not be free and they could transmit the price for peace , if the use of force . "
According to Michael Gerson , a former speechwriter for George W. Bush , now editor of the Washington Post , Obama made the case " very American speech " .
not only introduced himself as " the " , but , as always , " he said as the American President " and reminded the Europeans " that they live in a safe bubble , which themselves have created , and that they don't do too much for it to her , " Gerson said .
between a few from the right belongs to hawk the Bush era , a former ambassador to the UN John Bolton , who called the speech " , pompous and inspiration , " said on the website of the National Review Online .
To the left of the president , for example , Democratic reprezentant Dennis Kucinich is appalled at the sight of Barack Obama , justifies the use of forces .
" When the war into a container of justice , we can easily justify massacre of innocent people , " he warned .
However , the print to the opinion of the president .
Although Los Angeles Times continue to be regarded as the award of the Nobel Peace Prize for Obama early , his output as " nadvýkon " and even speaker known for his talent .
A speech by the Oslo accords should serve as a guide to international decision on the solution to the conflicts in the fight against poverty and oppression " , according to the California diary .
Obama , " he said of what needed to be done , " said the New York Times , and called the speech " for the simple and instructive " .
Road carriers : three marathons to the agreement , which will save the supply of stocks at Christmas .
After three jednacích maratónech ran out of road transport carriers and the trade unions , the only organization of employers , who remained until the end , on Friday evening to the agreement that ended the challenge of going on strike and the threat that hung over the supply of stocks at Christmas .
The secretary of state for transport , Dominique Bussereau at Friday's signing of the agreement expressed " joy " and that after several negotiations , which started on Wednesday morning .
After the second night of discussions with trade negotiators on Friday broke up early in the morning with the hope that the text of the agreement will be signed by the end of the morning as quickly as possible .
In spite of the fact that the three organizations of employers ( , ) from the negotiations .
But it was the need for further , more than six hours meeting , which began at 11 hours , to ensure that everyone is agreed and in 18 hours of the agreement .
This conflict " would be very hurt " and " there would be a danger that they will be distorted by the holidays at the end of the year , " he said .
The text contains wage increase by 4 % for the lowest salaries ( for local and regional road transport ) and 2.9 % for those with the highest salaries ( international ) .
The hourly wage for the lowest salaries increased from EUR 9.06 8.72 .
It's not much , but it's a lot of effort , " said Patrice Clos ( FO ) .
Tonight we'll give our members of the command , in order to avoid blockades , the blockade of supply centres .
But it can occur a few opponents , who are not satisfied , " he added .
Philippe Grillot , president , welcomed the " good agreement " , even though it was hard to admit the increase of high salaries given to the international competition " .
According to him , there will be an increase of EUR 170 per month for the lowest wages and about 100 to 120 euros for those with the highest .
It is a deal of common sense and respect to the employees , said Dumont ( CFDT ) , while Thierry Douine ( CFTC ) welcomed the " historic agreement " .
According to Richard Jauberta ( CGT ) it is an " acceptable compromise " .
The agreement also provides travel expenditure of 3 % , and a report on the situation of the state road transport in the first half of the year 2010 , which will also focus on the question of 13 . salary and the modernisation of collective agreements .
Bussereau said the " reduction of EUR 100 million in taxes from wages " , which was the subject of a proposed amendment to the government on the draft law on the budget for the year 2009 , which voted in the night from Thursday to Friday , the National Assembly .
The government will ask the Senate to " match " the vote .
signature allows that this agreement will be applied as soon as possible to the enterprises , which are members of the organization , and later to the whole scope , in the case of enlargement , the Ministry of Labor .
will take place " as soon as possible , " he said .
The whole process may put the brakes on only opposition organizations of employers .
The organisation is on the " wrong " for EUR 100 million , " it was within the sector offered compensation , part of the carbon tax " .
The Secretary of State for Transport , forcing us to emergency negotiations rather than as a result of mutual analysis , but in order to make the turkeys at the time of the approaching Christmas holidays , she complained .
for the organization , the danger is that the agreement in the next 12 months " would be a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the field " .
suburban RER trains : the disruption of services over the weekend , trade unions , with the proposals of the transport firm RATP .
The interruption of traffic on the line of suburban RER trains , which is the largest urban public transport in France , will continue even during the weekend , because Friday's negotiations between the unions and management on the second day of the strike did not lead to any specific results in the premium .
On Saturday and Sunday , an important shopping on the weekend before Christmas , will ride the trains between 10 and 20 an hour ago , the main section of the ( between LA and nation ) will be able to ride the train every second , outside of this section of the train only one of the four .
A link to the SNCF will be aborted in Nanterre and passengers will be forced to transfer to another train .
commercial houses Galeries Lafayette , which expect every day over 200 000 customers welcomed the fact that " the RATP tried to talk about with large commercial houses " .
The RER line and leads from the west to the east of Paris .
The section of the managed RATP leads from and to the Nanterre Boissy-Saint-Léger and .
On Friday , he was in the top of the train in operation , one of the two , and virtually no souprava nejezdila during off-peak hours , as mentioned in the plan .
as well as on Thursday of the Ile de France and at the landings .
So early in the morning in the station ( ) far fewer people than usual , inter alia , also because the pupils and students .
Jack , the engineer , 29 , from Boissy-Saint-Léger ( Val-de-Marne ) explained that he got on " an hour and a half before , to be sure that arrive in time " .
The station was crowded , announced the state railway SNCF , predicted that a large number of prisoners and guards .
suburban RER trains , and operated in the direction of SNCF to or from the airport or departed from the station with waste to the subway .
Next , the General Assembly will be held on Saturday and Sunday , which will evaluate the results of Friday's afternoon meeting with the leadership of that trade unions as " weak " .
The proposed negotiations on a special protocol for the suburban RER trains and after all the pages of working time , the career etc .
However , it is not the drivers , who require a premium , according to Thierry ( OdboryJih ) .
Even for the proposals of the premium , which shocked the CGT , saying that " it has not been able to solve the problem , while travel carriers and SNCF it " .
The new meeting , which is scheduled for Monday , " closer to review the conditions of the profession , " clarified the RATP transport businesses .
which was the cause of trade unionists , why do you think that the firm " makes fun of passengers " .
In the late morning hours about 150 drivers obsadilo Enterprise Committee in his Paris headquarters .
leadership , which has so far been any discussion during the strike , is therefore in the interest of " comfort " for the meeting .
There is a danger that the conflict will spread Tuesday on the RER B line , after the independent and notify the emergency .
The unions demand a premium in value from the 120 ( Unsa ) to EUR 150 , of which EUR 30 variables ( CGT , FO , CFDT , a barrel of ( South ) , ( independent ) ) and make it difficult to get used to the deteriorating working conditions on this line , which will carry a million passengers a day .
Drivers of suburban RER trains in the more advanced the time career until 2200 2700 EUR 600 to EUR 650 gross wages and bonuses for working time and for the work on Sundays and public holidays .
Turkey's justice for the Kurdish side , and this decision is fraught with heavy consequences .
The Turkish constitutional court on Friday decided to cancel the main parties in the country . This decision immediately provoked a protest demonstration in the Kurdish community in the country and in Istanbul .
This decision could greatly complicate the task of government , which is trying to to the Kurdish community a friendly hand to attempt to end 25 years of conflict .
The party for Democratic Society ( DTP ) was disbanded because it has become " activities against the independence of the state and its indivisible unity , " said the president of the Supreme Court Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of negotiations .
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges , for the dissolution of the parties of the need to vote , he said , adding that 37 of party cadres , including its president and the ban to participate in political life for a period of five years .
The judge also announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity , which was used by Mr and Mrs Tugluková and confiscation of assets held by the Ministry of Finance .
The party has 21 seats in parliament ( from $ 500 ) .
The party leadership has indicated before that members would prefer to leave the European Parliament than in it served as members of parliament without political nationality .
The decision is a continuation of a process initiated in 2007 , the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation , which accused the DTP of obedience to the " orders " of the Kurdistan Workers' Party ( PKK ) , which Ankara , and many countries are considered to be a terrorist organization .
Many observers believe that the DTP is legal political vitrínou rebels from the PKK .
The party that the PKK with no connection to the " basic " , but refuses to declare her a terrorist organization and calls on the government to move in with her .
The court's verdict comes at a time when the government is the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights and is attempting to limit the support of Kurds against the PKK and end the conflict .
The DTP has confirmed that the dissolution of the parties could lead to a renewal of tensions in the southeast Anatolia , where in the past few weeks , many demonstrations against the conditions under which the PKK leader Abdullah öcalan into clashes with the police .
notification of the decision of justice , thousands of demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP in Diyarbakiru , a major town in the southeast , which populated largely by the Kurds .
The police used grenades and guns , the demonstrators threw stones from Molotovovy cocktails or shot at .
Also in Istanbul , about a hundred people .
After the verdict , Mr Justice , said that the decision " will deepen the despair " .
Turkey cannot answer this question ( the Kurds dytrych . ) to resolve a ban on the party , said in the press .
The government , formed by the party from the Islamist movement , also condemned the decision .
We are , in principle , against the interference of the parties .
It does not , said Minister for Energy Taner Yildiz .
This decision is completely Democratic proposals , which were initiated by the government , said political scientist Ahmet Insel .
Of course , we cannot wait for a response from the PKK , he added .
On Thursday , the PKK is signed up for one of the attacks in the north , Turkey , which killed three days earlier , seven soldiers .
The new
For years , was for a secret city , inaccessible for visitors from the West .
Zelenograd , one of the 10 districts of the capital city of Moscow , in the Soviet Union , it was strictly guarded location , where he has a secret weapons research .
Today , it is considered to be this district with 216 000 inhabitants , the remote 37 miles from the centre of Moscow , Russia's " Silicon Valley " .
There are significant micro - and research and production center .
from September 2008 to establish contacts with the representatives of the scientific center - with institutions and firms frankfurtského Innovation Centre ( ) .
There have been a number of mutual visits and signed Wednesday in Frankfurt and the protocol on the " close cooperation " .
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow Mayor Yuri Rosljak and prefect of Zelenogradu Anatoly Smirnov , Frankfurt , head of the planning officer Edwin Schwarz .
In 2010 , they'll go and representatives of small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) engaged in research on to the seminar .
The scientific exchange
This is an interim scientific exchange .
It is also about economic relations .
Companies will be allowed to take hold on the Russian market .
On the contrary , the Russian scientific firms they want to get the contract in Germany .
It is where the major Russian research institutes and companies .
Among them are to be Moscow's Institute of Technology , the hills and electronics .
The county was founded in 1958 as a so-called " socialist " planned city " for the weapons research .
( the literal translation of " green city " ) gained its name from the wooded hilly landscape in which they are , a research facility .
Stuttgartská brake
Stuttgart 21 dimension there can't be sufficiently prepared .
For fans of the project , it is quite simply a " new heart of Europe " .
All right . it is more than the launch of the station , more than the monstrous building , the main city on one decade in the building of chaos .
Stuttgart , 21 , from the spirit of the 80's .
The top station with the rails , which ended in the centre of the city , at that time were considered to be in the 19th century , which acts as a brake modern rail transport , because it was the need for much of his time in the locomotives from behind .
For a moment , to stop them , go on - that's how it should work .
And that's why the station : in Frankfurt and Munich .
And in Stuttgart : a transit station , which lies roughly in the middle of the route the trans-European rail track between Paris and Bratislava / - hence the slogan of " the heart of Europe " .
Indeed , starting with a , although the vision of the 1980's are no longer compatible with the facts .
themselves very ambitious designers know that , and the city is almost the start of construction .
Since that time , there are modern shuttle trains , motor vehicles and the management at both ends , they don't have problems with the station and .
Yet : starts with 21 , including a new line into the ice .
It and local politicians .
Railways , therefore , that the risks of an individual of the largest infrastructure project in the Republic is borne by the taxpayer , not the state .
The project is still in some way .
A new urban area , which - if we are to believe the computer images - will contain many green .
for rail transport system is harmful .
The station , and the construction of the line are intended for passenger transport , which typically in the 1980's - attributed the huge increase .
Indeed , there was no competition from cheap flights .
A modern transport policy must go but in the first place on the strengthening of freight transport , because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than freight car on the road .
But the new line is not because of the sharp stoupáním suitable for freight trains .
Even more serious is that indirectly affects a lot of other railway projects .
In should be a good six billion euro .
That's the official number .
experts consider to be the real ten to 15 billion .
It is clear that in the next decade will miss the finances for the next uzlové points and narrow space on the network .
On the list of the ministry of transport is a larger projects .
One of the most important is the roughly 180 miles long routes the Rhine Valley .
Since 1987 , on the route is in slow pace .
There would need to be a good one .
But it will be as a brake .
The track will become the Rhine Valley , long-necked bottle international freight transport : right in the heart of Europe .

The provincial government in the face of the open , if he goes against the judgment of the Court of Justice ( administrative ) regarding the prohibition of night flights and allow him to reconsider .

The factions called on the SPD , the CDU and the FDP to again returned to the promises concerning the prohibition of night flights , which gave prior to the election . otherwise , it is possible to evaluate as " a violation of the words " .
It is hard , if you can keep your word , said Chief of the green to the electoral slogan " We the word " we " .
The minister rejected the charge , the provincial government is trying to force through the " rights and tricks " to get to their night flights .
The precise legal control needs time .
The coalition doesn't want to work on the basis of " a quick first impression . "
We need a realistic decision , said Stefan Müller ( FDP ) .
Comments by his faction to ban night flights have never been such , as the opposition .

It was only a faster than expected .
The station's successor , just two weeks after the board of directors of the ZDF from office .
last night to agree on that .
For the favourite was Peter Mandelson , Frey , head of the studio in the main city in Berlin .
The station , but it has not been proven - officially to the process .
The role it could play but also that they did not want to damage the ZDF Markuse Schächtera , if this proposal for the management board has not passed .
Frey , a candidate needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the bodies .
The result of the vote was not known before the close of this issue .

Most of the EU's administrative board for several weeks before the election , that he doesn't want in office to confirm .
Opposition to Prime Minister Roland Koch .
He refused to remain in office highly weighted the editor of the argument that Brendera fell quota monitoring of the news .
until shortly before the election were therefore the protests , in which was sharply criticized by political influence on the ZDF .

The board of the Council , the Prime Minister , Kurt Beck , said last week that the country would change the state treaty , so that the staff of the proposals could not be blocked by politically motivated majority .
Beck but also refused to the exclusion of the party from politicians supervisory councils .
The expected successor Peter Frey , the board of the council ordered the move - immediately after the removal of Brendera for it strongly criticized .
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence he could take place without losing face , so how could he be elected by the management board , without access to a suspected that he was sworn into office .

A partial success for students : after finally headed Thursday to the Federal States of ministers of culture : at the conference of ministers of culture and higher education , the two parties have agreed on the fact that there is a will to improve the conditions for a bachelor's degree and study .
Students should in future be able to handle its study .
In particular , have agreed that the load tests : in principle should study each module to end once the only test .
In addition , it should be to check the work load of learners , and should ensure " real and obhajitelná rate " .
Politicians and high school they want to simplify the recognition tests between universities in Germany and abroad .
The federal countries undertake to create a more flexible common structural award for undergraduate and graduate study .
The derogations should cease to exist .
Less tests
From the start of the student protests in the worm had ministers of culture and the university in his mouth the words of a studio .
Now , they are the first time filled with specific content .
The so-called Accreditation Council concluded that the number of tests , in part , to reduce drastically : " each module will be terminated , as a rule , only one test , " writes in a 30 - page report , which is , in part , to regulate the approval of the new study .
" a significantly lower burden , " said the chairman of the Accreditation Council Reinhold Grimm , it will be " stopped bad development that significantly limited the performance of the studio . "
It has to be " studies " in the future , " the decisive criterion " in their implementation .
The modules and contents of the " hard " to " unnecessarily , a student in the choice of
seminars " .
" Students should be entitled to the space , which allows and encourages its own initiative " .
The rules have to pay for the approval of the new study , after a review , but also for the study .
You need to be , " " every five years - which , however , means that it will take until the year 2015 , before they all fields of study .
It is responsible for around Germany ten accreditation agencies , which are subject to the advice of established countries .
Ministers of Culture in October called " strongly " the land to the agency so that the material was not too big , and the scheme was strict .
in individual countries is no longer the university and high school have agreed with terrestrial ministries on the corresponding measures .
As has been the only country Porýní-Falcko additional resources for the further development of the Bologna process .

That's what they want , and the high school to spend ten million euros .
At the beginning of the year 2010 wants to submit to the Parliament amendments to the higher education law .

More than a footnote to the Müllerové
to get into and out of Germany's nice , almost no control . . . " is the opening line of one of the poems poet Werner Söllnera , which in this language a bit of experience with one dissident , who gained his freedom came at the same time , but their language environment .
Werner was born in 1951 in a Romanian Banátu , he worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and , later , as one of the children's book publishers , 1982 and then , from Frankfurt am Main .
He was honored the different prices , 1993 a poetry reading at the legendary frankfurtské Goethe University , and since 2002 , is head of the literature in Frankfurt .
A commotion took care of last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich , which was a " German literature in Romania in the mirror and a cracked mirror its security act " .
Obviously , and he left a declaration , in which the writer Romanian colleagues before the Germans , including Richard Wagner , William Totokem , Franzem Hodjakem and Helmuthem Frauendorferem , admits to working as a secret informant Romanian Securitate secret service .
Together with some of the present won in 1989 , the German language .
Attempts to naverbování said he began quietly , as soon as possible in 1971 .
I said , " Well , someone who did not sufficiently attempts at intimidation by the Securitate . "
The poet Werner Söllner is a secret agent Walter .
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize and its literary addressing the underlying mechanisms of dictatorial government's literary scene , and particularly the German authors originating in Romania , the case , which indicates the deep and political system , which is based on the control and .
Werner Söllner is not , at least if it can be referred to in the present state of knowledge , just the perpetrator , but is also a victim .
In the Securitate secret agent Walter played a role , said after the granting of Michael , and had a positive impact on the secret agent Walter .
" me " in all the essential points for him , he says .
He has a moral obligation to do this .
The statement was in this form , and before this unexpected , but not totally surprising confession of former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service .

He remained even after the fourth match after the return of 11 October 2008 .
After nearly four years of break , then beat Samuel Peter in Berlin and took back " their " WBC belt , which must have before to surrender without a fight .
Earlier this year , when he defeated defending champion Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba in September and Chris Arreola from the US .

It is alleged that his company plans to fight against Klitschko in London's Wembley Stadium .
The case
The attack from the opposition factions : the green Jürgen Trittin called because of wrong information about the affairs , minister of defense as a liar .
The SPD and the Linke ( the left ) are invited to submit an explanation .
Hamburg / Berlin - according to the most recent knowledge to the raid on the opposition believes that the defense minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg ( CSU ) had made a deliberate choice of deception .
Minister to the bombing of two tanks in September said " knowingly " , said the head of the Green fraction Jürgen Trittin Saturday zpravodajském agenda " Tagesschau " .
Let's call it the usual expression : he lied .
The order was issued to the killing in infringement of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan ( ISAF ) .
This is the essence of the message , which was read by the NATO , Mr Guttenberg , said Trittin .
On Friday , it became clear that the attack was not only about the destruction of freight cars , but about the targeted killing of two leaders of the Taliban .
When the American raid , which claimed the German commander , Colonel Klein , according to NATO to kill or wound up to 142 people .
The Green Party , the SPD and the left have called for Saturday by Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) to immediately expressed before the Federal Assembly , and also to clarify what he really knew about this event .
Mrs Merkel must explain whether the strategy is part of the targeted killing of the Afghan policy - and , if the Chancellor , and the intelligence of this new strategy , called Jürgen Trittin and colleague from the Green Party .
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism .
The Chancellor has no effect on the concrete deployment in Afghanistan , he said .
On Saturday there were also doubts about the makeup of the ministry on the background to the release of the inspector general and the Secretary of State Wolfgang Peter Wicherta .
According to the information to inform both fairly and completely on the background to the attack on the tanker .
There was that they had to deny reports of the existence of NATO and the minister of sensitive details .
From both a number of top officials , however , said that the Ministry of Defense , even for a few reports , among them the two-page document velícího Colonel Klein and one of the military police .
" Frankfurter Sonntagszeitung " shall report , meanwhile , had requested in the letter on the clarification of the situation .
It is noted that has not yet received any response .
The ministry has not commented on Saturday to výtkám and pointed out that this will be dealt with in a committee of the federal assembly , which is set to be appointed as the next Wednesday .
The worlds of Dreams
Some see in his paintings , and hearing voices , that other people don't see and hear .
Not only was mentally ill , or in the drug ecstasy between imagination and reality .
As long as this is the case in my sleep , everything is all right .
If we closed our eyes in a dark room , we surround and delusions .
But who is experiencing in vigilance dream states , hear and see things that others don't see and hear , in today's West most of the world for a fool or a drug , or at least as a result .
But such images and voices are not only mentally ill or in the drug .
Blame our imagination : the same processes that allow us to design houses , to paint pictures or write novels , here and there , they will take care of it , that the border between the dream and reality .
Dreams altered state of consciousness may be present in a variety of forms , in case we call them a better vision , in worse shape .
Even when the initiator and the effect may vary , however , the vision of Hildegard von Bingen , drug experiences the Prophet new-age Carlos Castanedy , states , and hallucinations derived from similar processes .
hallucinations or visions to arise in the event of a derailment balance neuronálních brain - especially the dopamine , serotonin and acetylcholinu - and interaction between different parts of the brain is blocked .
A comprehensive hallucinations and wandering thoughts occur very often in the schizophrenic psychosis .
gravity above him too much .
The link between the dream and philosophers and staffed by doctors from the ancients .
Aristotle understood the hallucinations as a form of the dream in the state , one of the founders of modern psychology in 1861 , he said " the great similarity snovými stocks " , for the Sigmund Freud was a dream even " psychosis , with all the nonsense , images , the senses . "
It's the fall of 2001 , Henning T. amended in komiksovou figure .
His body is a two-dimensional and bright color .
gravity above him , does not have any power , raises the ceiling of the room .
He feels the kick .
Behind him the winged figures with blood red , showing his teeth .
chasing him , gave him a heavy , shoes , throwing him against a wall , he feels the pain throughout the body .
There is a loud , the voices of the walls and on the radio .
He cannot tolerate the voices , which his swearing and an insult .
Henning T. pulls out two cables on the stereo , the loop and put her on a hook on the ceiling .
As he scrambles to one speaker and loop it around his neck .
jumps .
loop .
A chorus of voices his eardrums , " go to the clinic and let yourself ! "
It is now 40 years old , has had six akutních psychóz , the last two years ago , the first in nearly 20 years ago .
They have started .
His diagnosis is schizoafektivní paranoická psychosis , it is also , he takes medication for depression , mania and schizophrenia .
He learned to live with the disease , three years is married .
I've had the worst fear and doubt , he says .
The ghosts are a terrible reality
About one percent of people will get sick at least once in a lifetime of schizophrenia in psychiatric hospitals , clinics , it's the second most commonly treated diseases .
In the acute schizophrenic psychóze disability usually cannot distinguish between internal and external world , central to the condition , which can lead to halucinacím , velikostním , or the illusion of persecution .
Especially the enlarged is hearing the voices of the vote - which give orders , or lead to dialogue .
Even optical hallucinations are not unusual .
The affected is not able to distinguish between important from an unimportant , the brain cannot filter out signals , consciousness is flooded with impressions .
As well as a dream opening the floodgates to a barrage of ideas and fantasies , which come from the deepest layers of consciousness .
The perception of reality in psychosis is focusing on the body , says Professor Thomas Fuchs , chief veterinarian clinic general psychiatry University Clinic in Heidelberg .
A schizophrenic is located in the center of the stage , everything has meaning for him .
At the same time , in a passive role , it becomes , as well as in a dream , overwhelmed by events and can actively shape .
It is therefore often feel threatened , and manipulated .
Compared with the reality is not possible , the majority of them are the ghosts of a terrible reality , the Awakening is out of the question .
once in a lifetime experience
otherwise than in a dream , he says , " but the fact remains the sensual and spatial structure , in which a man is , in principle , a well-preserved . "
The derelict thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality , to alienation experience takes place in real time .
Scientists are still puzzled as to why our brain is doing exactly this sort of stuff .
The exceptional conditions for each person may lead to the fact that in the short term will lose to the reality , says Fuchs .
Not everyone , however , to develop psychosis .
It seems that there is a genetic disposition to schizophrenia , but studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factor .
Scientists are based on the fact that disabled people have a minimum damage to the brain .
We believe that , in an early stage of development , the damage to the brain , such as viral diseases of the mother during pregnancy , explains .
But it remains a puzzle , as the failure of the system , which for years did not materialise .
The role played by the effects of the area - stress or traumatic experiences may be , if it is to her disposition .
also a hallucinogenic drugs can start , because the transmission system .
When our brain
The crazy thing is , psychotronici suffers hallucinations , and to get rid of them , expensive , others give money for drugs , to get it , he says , a professor of psychology .
If the images as a pleasant or unpleasant , is often just a position .
Ten years on and , in the last year to present its results in a book , " Die Welt " ( in the world in our head ) .
While hallucinating belongs to a typical doprovodným phenomena , but also to the surprisingly many other illnesses .
In addition to the psychological disorders such as depression or borderline personality also often like a migraine disease , epilepsy , multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or brain trauma .
Surprisingly , under certain conditions , and even the brain of a healthy person .
hallucinations , according to Kasten , shall consist of the contents of ideas , which are normally .
When a part of the brain , which processes sensory perception , are too active or little repressed ; if our brains , or when there is a lack of stimulation .
Drugs may run this state as well as brain damage or psychosis .
But also the withdrawal of stimulus , the stress , worry about love or other more exceptional .
In the most recent studies indicated that up to a third of people surveyed , that at least once in your life , have seen a hallucination .
In the summer of 2005 , Sarah K. 16 years old , lives in a small town in and they go to secondary school .
Actually , the normal girl .
If there were no shape and voices .
Between classes , it may be that her appeals to the Hulk with long , dark hair .
When he says , looking at her classmates with surprise - no one except for her to see and hear of this boy .
This timid girl as a dreamer , but Sarah K. nesní , knows it .
He's awake , and sees the boy , as much as he can hear and see the girl sitting next to him in the dock .
Even he can feel his presence , at least for a few moments .
It's a nice feeling , the boy .
I'm crazy ? , asks .
But he knows that the boy and the other delusions are not real and disappears .
In the night are rather depressing .
They are often brought to light .
When sitting in class , he can't keep track of how many times the teaching , because the teacher in her eyes and ears just represents a new class , he explains , but all the other audibly , and visibly on the mathematical equation .
In the night are rather depressing .
When waiting in a dark room to sleep , which is rarely and too late , often cannot , if it's up or if , if , that he sees , or girl with wounds to her hands and feet are open or closed .
Leave me alone , shouting at those figures .
parents and friends , don't say anything about it , people would talk about her , that's crazy .
The fall of 2009 . Sarah K. is now 20 years old .
Last year she graduated high school and lives with her boyfriend .
A year ago , the hallucinations .
Since then , what she contacted on the Internet , a psychologist , she knows exactly that .
The images are also the art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or incentives are removed , it will have a high probability the hallucinations , he says .
I believe that the brain then doesn't have enough employment and old himself for his own amusement .
Sarah K. , an only child , she's like a little girl , fear of the other children , often played alone .
Her hallucinations started , when he was 13 , she learned that the man , who he says dad from the days when she thinks is her own father .
Because the acoustic and visual hallucinations are active in the same area of the brain that process also real images and sounds , it's for the disabled as Sarah K. hard to distinguish from each other and reality . " every experience , " says , " takes place in the brain , also shows the reality there .
There are also paintings , which have given rise to the brain , that's why they are so real . "
The night also dreams as a form of delusion .
Healthy people does not differ substantially from the hallucinations in acute psychosis .
compared to the mental health of people able to identify their delusions as unrealistic .
therefore advise my patients to hallucinations as an extraordinary ability .
The border situation between dreams and hallucinations .
In our world , the concentrated too much on the mind is an imaginary experience , unfortunately , mostly , says Michael , a professor in Heidelberg and the psychiatric hospital and clinic in Düsseldorf .
It's a disease , but it also provides the benefits of creativity , a mirage - is also the art of despair .
The so-called " form of experiences , a special form of the Amended Notes to the dream .
Stocks are highly comprehensive , detailed fictional dreams , which is considered to be the real and can't even back to distinguish from the state .
The state of mind in extreme situations caused by trauma or illness , such as patients who are conscious motor paralysis .
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and ourselves , should be continued , the inability to complete , is replaced by life to the real situation of your own , an imaginary world , which is disconnected from reality , he says .
The type of state borders between dreams and hallucinations .
because in reality it is not possible to cope with any situation , there is a change in the worlds , the real situation but to ideas .
intensive form of aid and the transfer of the senses in an intolerable situation , which allows people to their own ability to shaping , during the time of to a loss of consciousness .
All of this is real , even later in the memories of
Also , the art historian Peter Cornelius describes his experiences in his book " The Exchange " ( heart ) as a rescue mission .
He was 49 years , when , after the cardiac valve replacement surgery with a heart transplant has set his mind for a few days , while his body was still in intensive care .
He sank into the world , of which he created , visited foreign time and place : it is becoming an old man on the bed in a nursing home , the robot's on his health .
He lives in the early Middle Ages between , which produces the narcotic substances from the blood .
on a motorcycle , it can say to his country , in a hospital bed in the Alps , and meets the Korean .
completely immersed in an imaginary going on , all of this is real , even later in memory .
These internal path for the fundamentally different from any dream .
The dream is a different status , describes his experience .
In contrast to dreams are the memories of those trips across the years and clearly in the details .
even clearer and more intense than the real experience .
The intensity of the experience of the horizon of our other opravdivých experience , says psychiatrist .
After all , the show , hallucinations and psychosis , drug intoxication , how fragile are in a state of our internal images of external reality .
Any change in the status of consciousness , summarises the psychologist , " may lead to a distortion of what we call reality . "
The fact , which may also be enriching .
The snow may come
Burda
In the 27 to take over the children .
The new head of the publishing house is a transitional solution : the long term he wants to Hubert Burda to his business into the hands of their two children , said Der Spiegel .
Holding up even in the future include 100 family .
Hamburg - publisher Hubert Burda sees his own business in the long run in the hands of their children .
Both children will inherit in 27 years and have a strong will to join the company , says the man .
The details , we carefully .
The question of whether they are also active in the company , will be taken until then .
The question is , if they have the skills .
It is not possible to take the 7500 employees their children if they are not sufficiently capable of .
That would have killed the children .
Burda Thursday announced that from January from the presidency of the board of directors , and was named as his successor .
52 years old is a member of the board of directors since 1999 .
First , he was in charge of technology .
Later , with added responsibility for the assets of the company and following the resignation of Jürgena Todenhöfera also direct marketing , Cizina , printing and finance .
The first time at the head of any of the members of the family .
Burdovým children is 19 and 17 years , his son , Felix , which would today was 42 years old , died a few years ago .
The appointment also serves to make a " 10 , 15 years , " he said .
holding should in the future include 100 family , he says .
With regard to the cases and Schaeffler Burda put it , that even the family enterprises do not have the security before the agency : " It's always the firms , which are left to infect the desire of capital , which have speculated , and thought that they may become big players .
It has never been my strategy .
He never had a " dreams of a world power , " he says .
As the political system of the country , such as Springer , and I don't want to play the World League with " time " , these shops are too big .
promise
Peek is extremely limited , only serves to view the mail , without the ability to view a particular type of annexes or surfing in the network .
He had many of their five minutes of fame in the US , when Time magazine as one of the products of the year .
It is more difficult to see him out there , but the idea may be interesting , especially for young people .
Unlike the Peek is characterised by very low price and the monthly payments , less than half the amount , which is true , for example , the data plan for the iPhone .
After the success of the company has begun to offer two new device : one is addressed to exclusively for Twitter , second on the basis of permanently provided free data service , for which , however , is the need to pay for the amount .
yesterday , which was introduced to the Web site , is the European version of the invention and at the same time , his third .
is limited as well as his American counterpart , but brings a surprise .
The price of a monthly maintenance is around EUR 12 per month and includes roaming all over Europe .
passengers , people already know what it means to lose data services after crossing the border or impatiently search café with ( or WiFi connection Fon ) , so that they can see through the mail .
The idea of a fixed price is an incredibly attractive and should be put in place a long time ago .
Yes , some operators have a special treaty and travel plans , but in my experience , you need a degree in physics in order to understand them , and also very good glasses , to read a miniature letters .
The European Commission is required to reduce roaming tariffs so that they are available for the whole of Europe , which still does not have much effect .
There is a reasonable concern on the use of data services outside the home .
It is that the instrument as FonPeek ( it is interesting , however , that he still has the name FON WiFi ) , if it does not reach this type of fare , means that operators are beginning to think otherwise and are considering the various offers , kterýmiby kompenzovali your data network .
Kindle is another fine example , offers downloads of books and other search on the Internet .
No contract , no complications .
This device is attached and , when the purchase , rather than for months .
And that's exactly what I expect that one comes in , it is a chance to purchase with the approach as it has already put in place in the US .
Not because that's what I'd wanted to buy .
I'm going through the mail , on the phone , thank you .
I expect it , because I think that it's from the consumer's point of view the best type .
It would be interesting if the same system used in the computer .
Color , Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly a favorite color of the first ladies .
for Barack Obama to be President of the US , she chose a dress and coat in this colour , the same color also has chosen , if it was accompanied by the second most important moment of his life : the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo .
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases : in addition to the fact that this is a similar color - lime with effects - in both cases , it was the ensemble - clothes , and coat made out of the same substance - decorated with a large embroidery or a collar .
At first sight , it seemed that the US first lady has decided to follow in the footsteps of the Princess , and wear similar clothes .
The substance , which is made up of clothes , both models significantly different .
On the occasion of taking up their duties Michelle used a large , in Oslo , velvet with prints .
Even the accessories : green shoes with a medium high podpadkem nynípodobný model , but in a golden colour .
They wear different hairstyles : tentokrátdrdol , before their hair .
75 % of workers working mothers has problems associated with maternity .
discrimination in employment in recent years has increased , especially for women , younger years , which they intend to buy a child .
That is the result of the study and the career of Spanish , which is carried out in cooperation with the Institute of Women .
The study took part in women aged from 15 to 75 years , and the results are clear : 75 % of working mothers have limited options on the labour market due to motherhood .
The study points out that at the beginning of the coexistence of many differences of opinion regarding the number of children , according to whether they are working or not , and also according to the type of employment .
Women who do not work outside the home , working part-time or do not have stable work , start with a partner to live before , previously gave birth to their first child and have more children .
From the other side , the women with stable employment , especially in the public sector , the partner of coexistence and motherhood , and have fewer offspring .
" Women from 35 to 49 years , stable employment , have their first child at an average of 3.7 years from the beginning of living with a partner . This number is 4.1 in the case of women , their stable employment devoted the greater part of his life and , therefore , had to postpone the partner coexistence and the arrival of children .
The type of the profession is also a strong influence on maternity , even if less influence at the time of the opening of the living with a partner , " explains Delgado , which is devoted to research .
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of the marriage of a child is the level of education .
Research shows that the higher the education level , the higher the is also the age when women should marry and have their first child .
There are also differences between the women of the same generation .
For example , in the age group of women 35 to 49 years with the basic and higher education given birth of his first child at the age of 25 , or 32.1 .
" There is another difference between women depending on their level of education .
Women with the basic education and gave birth to the first baby before they find stable jobs , while women with the middle or high education in reverse , they prefer to obtain a stable employment , before the marriage and the birth of the first child , " Delgado .
Diane Kruger also is worth it .
L'Oreal Paris just added a new name on its prestigious list : Diane Kruger .
From next year , the German actress will face different products and brand under the universal password it .
A representative of 'Joyeux Noël' , one of the most elegant actresses international levels , thus adds to other famous osobnostemL'Oréal Paris such as Linda Evangelista , Jane Fonda , Andie MacDowell , Eva Longoria and Penélope Cruz .
Even before it joined the club of the selected this actress Evangeline Lilly ( ' lost ' ) and Freida Pinto ( from ) .
Men's part of this brand of cosmetics is also represented by important people : Patrick Dempsey ( 'Greyova anatomie' ) and Matthew Fox ( Evangelinin partner in ' lost ' ) .

A : " what else was Martínu Santosovi than Joyce focus on ?
What else was Benetovi than to execute Faulknerovou weapons ?
What else was Celovi than to do the famous at the expense of the glory of that man ? "

We don't understand , where good manners , respect for animals and people .

The result of this is that , despite the rise in the last month , the total number of registered vehicles in the last 11 months are 40 % less than in the previous financial year .
Since January was prodáno95,853 vehicles , which includes all the vehicles may be falling into the category of light commercial vehicles : derivatives passenger cars , pick , supply , less freight cars and light trucks / bogies .
And even the gloom which cause the most harm to the demand , even when it is bought by private persons , most of the purchases were made smaller and medium-sized firms and almost 100 % of the cases , the financing through third parties .
The limitations imposed by the conclusion of the resources of bank loans should be added as well as other factors such as the suspension of the operations or the continuation of the bad economic situation .

In fact , the already form part of the compulsory installation of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles , while the other is the deadline for the removal of a lack of oxygen , which is February 2011 .
The measures introduced in the EU's aim is to increase the protection of pedestrians , while the works so that it can help to avoid the many collisions .
The hand brake system increases the pressure on the brakes in an emergency case , which finds the system after the driver .
But this cannot always keep the pressure until the end .
According to a study carried out by an automotive parts manufacturer Bosch , a third of the drivers , who have an accident , brake before the collision , and half of them did not take full power brakes .
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary , this requires help from the system , the maximum the stopping distance of a vehicle .
According to a study carried out in the EU itself , if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment , it could prevent up to 1 100 fatalities a year related to the pedestrians .
There will still be a reduction of the number of calculations would prevent any one of the four accidents with the impact of the introduction of the so-called intelligent systems hand brakes .
In this case , the vehicle will be equipped with the system , that ( the radar ) or the camera captures the obstacles and reports the driver , except light braking .
If the driver's response will help him to increase the pressure on the pedal , if it is needed .
If the driver does not react , even in a case in which a collision cannot prevent , the device will be what the brakes , and to reduce the risk of damage to a minimum .

After the days of wine and roses since last spring , when inflation of assets was the prevailing mood in the markets , the uncertainty in the markets , which should come as no surprise , because it is no longer the natural state of the environment , where decisions are taken on the future of the plant , which is by itself .
The drug used by central banks to stabilize the market , it was the realisation of the debt the direct purchase of assets and indirect release liquidity at a rate close to zero , the financing of the Constitution could buy assets to reading .
The central bank has already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets already virtually ended , and without doubt on its policy of liquidity , are starting to throw some sand into the wheels , how has the Spanish central bank , with its auctions in the last year .
Investors thus cast doubt on the ability of the world economy to keep economic recovery without heterodoxních measures , and to the return of the reduction of risk .
The volatility in the stock market and the differences have acquired points again , although they are still very remote abnormal level , reached at the beginning of the year .
The Member States were forced to socializovat private risk , which , once again , the public debt .
Once again , on the quality and the US , Japan and Germany have become a haven for investors , thereby expanding the differentiation of the euro area countries against Germany .
Spain this instability almost was affected , but in that time came standard
On the other hand , some uncertainty is not useless for supporters of the moral hazard , who again tried to pose to the conscience of the persons responsible for the world's economic policy because of the devastating consequences of reducing the loan on employment , when in fact , it would have to be to declare a new day of Thanksgiving .
However , the situation in Dubai is a tribal fight between emíry to restore power in the UAE , and as for Greece , that we've seen before .

It doesn't make sense to the Ecofin Council to save Hungary before foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to enable the country to membership of the euro failed to comply with its commitments .
But what is the logic , it's that the ECOFIN Council made by the Greek government to transparency and its own citizens to a common responsibility to the need for emergency measures to maintain the stability of its public finances .
If , as we expect , we find ourselves before the normalization of the premium from the transitional risks , after some of the positions would be in line with expectations .
In the Spanish case , while our differences in the public debt will increase , as well as the bonds of European companies , we don't have to worry about .
If the European Union to reduce differences and our will to expand further , it would be a typically Spanish risk .
