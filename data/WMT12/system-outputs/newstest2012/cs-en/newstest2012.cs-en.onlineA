Parliament did not support the amendment exempting Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected a proposal to cancel the amendments to the Criminal Code section, which has been condemned the opposition leader Yuliya Tymoshenko.
Adjustment, which would have opened the way to the liberation of imprisoned expremiérky, MPs rejected at second reading of the proposal on penalties for economic offenses.
Tymoshenko was in October sentenced to seven years in prison for allegedly concluding disadvantageous Treaty with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final, the Court of Appeal sentenced discussed in December.
Tymoshenko indicates a judgment for political revenge scheme, suspicion of bias, the Court raised the process even in the West.
The proposal that fell from the Criminal Code section 365, on which expremiérka condemned, was supported in the vote of 147 members.
Its approval was needed 226 votes.
Libyan victory
The story of Libya's Liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar al-Qaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert, and without him the war is over.
Left to define the winners.
As is customary in the Shire, wins the elections the Islamists, but about whether moderate or radical.
The Transitional National Council signed up to the common law, the Sharia, and have some idea we have.
Libya becomes a country without crime, because theft is at hand.
Women can forget emancipation, the apostates of faith waiting for execution, and so on.
The place of the person of the dictator will be company consisting of rival tribes uniting the Koran.
In Libya it will order, how we can't imagine, and we certainly didn't want to.
But our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best, and perhaps would have just for a change should be referred to Libyjcům.
Actually, it is surprising that the Islamic warriors took on help from infidel dogs.
Sorry, it is only that, from their perspective, NATO air raids followed a General from America, but Allah, the size of each povedeném celebrated intervention.
So, when looking for winners in Libya, the West is among them.
We took part in the shootings, they served Islam and our politicians in the person of the dictator to get rid of a political ally, without guarantee a profit.
After fresh bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, Libya of military neokupujeme.
Thus the local no problem with vyháněním "Crusaders".
They will have but without occupation of oil companies for a kiss Libyan black gold?
Perhaps not, and West finally will be able to boast of the selfless defence of human rights.
If we therefore don't disrupt those followers of Sharia law.
Begins a new era of crisis.

Diet obézního child: not eating her breakfast and dinner sausages
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 years of age has a problem with being overweight, excessive weight is 9 percent of school children and obese is 5 percent of the children.
Obese children, mostly come from the families had the life style, as demonstrated by the current survey.
Once again shows how important it is for healthy human development environment in which grows, and designs, which is surrounded by.
On the tables for obese children, for example, there are sausages and half more frequently than in families of children with normal weight.
Fries had for dinner the day before the research associated with an awareness-raising actions with the name of Obesity is not an accident more than 19 percent of the obese.
In the family tlouštíků also customary to play sports, but most families today's students-only 15 per cent of children said that their parents at least once a week to find the time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
A survey was carried out at the end of last school year and participated with him nearly 900 children from elementary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It was the second year of action, Obesity is not a coincidence that supports Universal health insurance and the company Unilever.
So far in the project involved more than 12 thousand students from 4. up to 8. classes.
Good food and plenty of movement in the family is one of the determining factors that causes rising dramatically, the number of overweight or even obese.
"Only half of the respondents, for example, stated that her five times daily in breakfast-lunch-dinner-lunch-dinner, which is one of the fundamental assumptions of good nutrition," is one of the results of the survey.
Without breakfast and in the evening the sausage
Experts note that are essential for the healthy development and relative details, which include the time should be a regular family breakfast.
In the Czech Republic, while at the same time eating breakfast only 23 percent of the families of the children.
In most families, eating breakfast alone.
And the worst part was the finding that, in the tenth of households is not eating her breakfast.
Breakfast is the basis for the correct daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in families, obese children are much more likely to consume unhealthy French fries.
Almost everyone-regardless of the weight-he drinks each day of sweet soft drinks (70 percent).
While the regular sports more than 40 percent of those children, their parents, the result was less than half-15 percent.
Reports to your diet
The next part of the survey to enable the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to build a custom menu options offered by your own taste and personal opinion.
"Food preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 years are of healthy nutrition to ideal."
Between their popular dishes is very moučných, meat and sweet dishes.
"The alarming, in particular, the great popularity of sweet soda," says in the final report of the survey.
For dinner as the main food won pasta just above the poultry.
Children, but practically not wanted pulses and low is the popularity of the fish and vegetable lunch dishes.
Momentum health
Survey also showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits, if they get the correct information.
"In the control group of the participants of the survey, who fill out the questionnaire after the awareness-raising lectures Obesity is not a coincidence, it is in many cases a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition," says in the results of the project.
Actually it was, for example, for sweet soda, where it started more babies prefer plain water.
Children are also more frequently zaškrtly in the questionnaire, poultry and fish as the main meal of the day and the limit would be sweet food and dumplings.
He must be a good psychologist, says the pros
In the opening article about how to teach stylists, I'm a bit postěžovala that the initial hours were a lot.
I had no idea, what will follow.
Lectures of three professionals in the field, dress, troubled characters and a seminar about how it goes on set.
And it will be worse.
The closer to the final test, the more information and practical tasks ahead of us.
And even if the course is being held every Saturday and Sunday, it is really "tight".
This time we're discussing with the Director from Alice (in the exchange rate is not the only boy), how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly shapely figure.
And such is the vast majority.
Someone has a short neck, somebody's boy's figure without a sturdy set of curves, and someone's overweight.
He must know how to visually soften broad shoulders, to extend the neck or deliver the required curves.
We got so tips for women-Jennifer Lopez, larger breasts and hips and narrow waist, figure pretty stressed and wife neobléknout too.
For example, if the difference between the waist and hips, skirts or pants really doesn't fit, then it pays to have made at least one such piece.
Certainly you won't regret it, because the perfectly good Plaid dress is priceless.
In the skirt to the peace you feel much better than the one that you are constantly shifting, vyhrnuje, it's loose in the waist and the like.
Boys ' character, he can afford to wear clothes with řasením, applications, embroidery, or in making.
Such information, and the types of characters is of course much, so I'm glad I've got a whole week to get all the information in my head look.
And anyway, I'm afraid that due to the specified domestic task is.
Each of the kurzistek, she is assigned a celebrity that has come up with two outfity: daily and evening.
We have to take into account the current appearance, fashion style of the personality and the type of the character.
I'll be the "dress" Miranda Kerrovou, maybe you know her from Victoria's Secret campaign.
In the spirit of it, for me personally, definitely better than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently gained maybe a hundred pounds (Bert, please recognize the retelling), or young Selena Gomez.
Outfits we have to abstain from magazines or search on the Internet and print and graphically processed.
Moodboard, as the entire result says, then express our personal style and the relationship to the graphics rendering.
Think about the graphic page styling down is important.
He had to wear only physically, but also, for example, of the so-called product page in magazines (to a specific type, such as trends in handbags, coats, etc.).
He told us about it, and the designer Mario Stonemason.
But until Sunday.
He must have a general overview of the
Saturday Lecture a loaded information about the types of figures of the movement three guests from the scope.
He Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and he should be able to take advantage of.
And handsome he can work with one piece of clothing.
Variability in this case is crucial.
So a trenčkot (or if you want to initially trenchcoat) could wear classic across the jeans and t-shirt as a cloak, but you can get dressed and naked body, dressing up in high heels and photographed as a dress.
Or just roll up your sleeves or collars and now the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he emphasized.
But mostly, I appreciate the following advice: "to work you need to perfectly know the rules."
"Then you can start to break," said James.
Finally, it is clear to me, why are all these propositions, sliced with the combine, what, why, when, in fashion magazines, sometimes we see something else.
Not to mention about the shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben again, I know that he must have prepared much more variants of clothes than they are taking pictures.
So fashion story, which will have ten parties (ten outfitů), I have to be ready to "nastajlovat" at least fifteen.
And that in the picture the clothes looks and works in combination with other pieces of sometimes quite differently than in reality.
With it we have to create the outfitu count.
That image and style is sometimes up to half of success, we confirmed the Honza Pokorný.
Just look at Madonna, which is not just a singer, but image and marketing from her world star.
In the Czech Republic's approach to the use of the services of stylists, rather cold.
Even familiar faces it can be construed as useless (it's something I can do, that's how I look at it, it is secondary).
And if someone from us leaves create the styling, then we expect that the US is likely to nadiktuje a completely different (smaller) size than it really is.
Then do googlovat and see if the tabloids writing about the celebrity ztoustla/lost weight and so on.
John and Mario on Sunday, put us on the heart, that is not enough stylistovi in fashion and know how to piece together outfits.
Their work primarily communicates with human beings, which dresses, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to assess people, nepodbízet, state your opinion.
"If you a Manager to protřídili her wardrobe and complete it on Nice pieces, so you can't wear the whole case and say, my God, this is terrible."
"Find there at least a few things pochválíte and recommend what they wear," says Mario.
He also specifically pointed to what it must contain a so-called "placovka", or "bag on the set.
It's the one that turns around the waist and have all the necessary paraphernalia.
In addition to the obvious things, such as scissors, roller on the hair or pins, there are also silonová yarn (with her he helps out in the photo products such as handbags or hats), special just clips, which we clip the clothes in the back, if it is more (a PIN or other staple are not admissible, damaging the garment), or sewing kit.
We just didn't listen, but also virtually anything, but we have learned how to properly podlepit shoes.
Even in a photo shoot at the Studio, where the flat surface, the foot may harm, let alone outside.
And so we're stuck and stuck.
Scissors bot we can't even touch that happens to be damaging.
It is therefore really need skill.
Mario me when my baby without reservations.
Mentioned skill are not my friend.
This is just a tiny fraction of what we talk about the second weekend the continuation rate hearing.
I'm getting more and more clear that attending styling down on professional level really isn't a cakewalk, says who wants what it wants.
In Need for Speed: The Run, the race across America.
Reviews
Originally, the rider is a series of completely unnecessary on sloppy mistakes in a routine early morning trip to shift.
Ambitions are to a large extent to fill, but it's not valid, if no one apparently didn't want to do anything extra.
New episode: The Run attracted before the release of high expectations.
He promised that the venerable racing series Need for Speed, once again, moves a new direction and the playable demos appeared as a game, which, in the genre of racing might not be just the number.
Also, we were wondering how they inserted passages in which the main character gets out of the car and will take place on foot.
As for the NFS series is custom, many of them in the result a little differently than we expected.
It's potentially decent arcaded races, but a whole runs down some unnecessary errors that appear in the series are more or less already for several years.
So it's actually not errors, but rather a sign of some sort of incomprehensible laziness of developers.
Adventure begins very well.
You are introduced to the story, the main hero Jack has certain problems of a personal nature, and as a solution offers participation in an illegal race across America.
Behind the wheel recline on the West Coast in San Francisco and your task is to reach the first in New York City.
The idea has some interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then to more than fifty plants.
It follows that every race on the other line and the stages are integrated into different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
Man does not have a feeling that the game was always the same.
Some of the environment are also very pretty to look at, although the technical level of the graphics corresponding to the previous parts of the series.
So it's nothing to write home about.
But the ride across the desert, autumn landscape, or high in the snowy mountains is visually very pleasant.
The races are, in addition, from time to time some zpestřeny the unusual element.
In the desert, for example, přimotáte in the sand storm, which significantly reduces the visibility.
By contrast, in the mountains again, you must be careful not to nezasypala you.
In addition, they are quite good for a planted rather individual races.
While it is only a few types, but it's enough.
A moment so you're trying to pass the required number of opponents (basically the classic race), then our gaining on them time (a classic duel with peduncles), and then you must duel with a single opponent.
It still gets from time to time and the police, which all your efforts even further znepříjemňuje.
Novelty are the passages out of the car.
Rather, it is just such an interactive animation, when Jack majority before someone running and you must help him, in the correct order you are printing the correct buttons.
Nothing complicated.
Surprised, however, that these passages is in the game much less than you'd expect (more specifically, maybe even only three).
As a result, but it is to the benefit of things, because this element has no chance to become a nuisance and in the context of the above said is one of the elements that the game by.
Driving model is following in the footsteps of the previous parts.
This means that it's certainly not a big deal, but you can't say that would be a big drawback.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you'll have to look elsewhere.
But akčněji pojatému racing its bicycles model meets the still quite well, although we could find better competitors.
So far, everything in perfect order.
But the problems are beginning to appear after some time.
Unlike the model schedule was too fine is not a model of the collision.
From games of this type don't expect that counts the complex deformation and collision, but practically before no impact to any object, you do not have the faintest idea how to maintain your car, then it probably is not quite all right.
Typically, when a succession of overtaking or passing other cars in normal operation is sometimes only slightly cooked each other, but sometimes in a nearly identical situation then your car in feral piruetách.
Or even straight to smithereens.
Thanks to the restartů system, while it's not particularly mind, but you get it reliably.
Restarts are designed so that if the smashing or go far out of line, you play back to latest landmark on the route.
But the restartů is available in each race only five.
When is a space, you must race to start again from the beginning.
It is, rather, a widget for the case that something does not than you could rely on them exclusively.
But sometimes restarts do not help you, will need to learn is the section of the ex-works from memory.
The big game there is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some of the curves, for example, the need to ride in a specific way, or simply not enough room in them.
Sometimes you meet on the "civilian" trucks always in the same configuration, whether you arrive there first, pátí, about five seconds or a minute later.
It sucks, in particular in situations where you can see how the opponent between two protijedoucími cars in front of you easily passes, while when you get there, you are already the wagons in a position that you have to detour around or slow down.
It is one thing when you get to them, because it is a "calculated" to a given situation there is always just before your nose.
Opponents also have another advantage.
For the entire period of play you'll find several places where you, again without regard to time, always pass the same opponent on the same site.
Most hits in the conclusion of the game on a long bridge, where you're going the wrong way.
Opponent must get there before you, apparently, perhaps at any price.
Coming from you, so you are getting worse overview of protijedoucích wagons, so initially I guess a couple of pretty rozmašírujete.
I can understand the intention to make the game exciting and adrenalinovější, but the implementation is so clear that you can reliably get frustrated quickly.
And it's a shame, because, despite the simple combination of model is acting funny and action so that sometimes literally can't follow track, where everything goes.
And is essentially one, whether it is the concept with 49 unique lines, sort of plants, so that boredom would have no chance, or anything else.
Non-traditional idea is the exchange of cars during races.
You must watch out for the gas station for journeys, because that is where you can change the car, although in most cases perfectly with what you have now.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Convertibles are suitable to the urban areas, a strong America we love you on the highway straight and exotic supersporty technical riding, for example, after the winding mountain roads.
With the main příběhovým regime goes hand in hand and the mode of the challenges, which are races in each of the locations that you know from the story.
Here you not only medals but also experience points to your profile, which is common for the call and the story.
In order to obtain a higher level driver to unlock the various subjects: starting with the cars and ending with the backgrounds for profile.
It is also once again linked with on-line features Autolog, which, inter alia, compares your results with other players, and provides other community features.
One of the more difficult the situation is understandable kicks from the last race in the story.
With your car to get to the Metro tunnel (so be it), where it's going in the dark on the tracks (so be it).
On the tacho you are flashing numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (so be it) and someone in the rear set of Metro and uncompromising was instalation you.
In the Newsroom about us even for a few days will hold discussions on whether to create the games really nobody even thought about it, or whether the authors are really so great.
The technical elements of the game is nothing special, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in some cases even great.
Start praying for mercy so that in certain moments in the vypjatějších falls, and in some cases quite tragic.
This concerns especially car crashes with a larger number of participants, which would give you continuous imagery there was just nothing valid.
Audio page is in order, and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to appeal to the widest range of rather younger audience was the soundtrack from category "Motley", but it can be assumed that because of listening to music a game just about anyone to buy it.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so greatly embarrassed.
If the game committing herself completely unnecessary errors, then we are not afraid to say that The Run the best NFS share for the last several years.
But as the game is nedodělaně.
Fun is certainly fine, but be prepared that you will třískat into the eyes of errors by airport lights.

Ambassador to the EU Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation for negativistů and euroskeptics
"The Lisbon Treaty significantly enough to disrupt the balance between the individual institutions."
"I didn't expect that it would be such a tough war."
"It will take five, six years before the situation settles a bit, relax and than all the players get used to my new role," she said sharply lecture at the Faculty of the Czech Ambassador to the European Union Milena Vicenová.
As far as their motto, "Clearly and openly on Europe" takes seriously, it showed in the first part of the lecture, which she managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their relations so clear and comprehensible manner, that it would have a number of speakers from the Law Faculty of the envy.
It also praised the work of the new Vicenová permanent President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuye:
"The first appearance of critique that is dull, it's grey official that he cannot play any role, and I must say that all of the gear that the role had been very good."
"It's a man who knows how to listen to twenty-seven Member States, good communicate with them and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
A new post of high představitelky for Foreign Affairs and security policy, then explained as the answer to the question: "who is the European Union? Which telephone number do I call? ", i.e., as an important step towards unification and greater legibility of EU policy towards the States, such as China or India.
No one wants to disable the syrečky
Vicenová devoted and agenda, which the European Council had lived, lives and will live in the near future.
Předloňské the Czech presidency a success.
The Czechs responded to the emerging financial crisis, solved the crisis by gas or held a summit on the Eastern partnership.
The fall of the Government in this time then a large negative, which the Czech Republic very heavily damaged.
Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, "a fact so crazy" was not the Presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis, which shall be settled today.
In addition, still must be approved by a new 7-year budget of the Union, which is due to the present economic situation considerably.
Whether the budget will be lean and cost-effective, which sectors they prefer that the country will be supported by more and more, all of this is on the agenda of the next meeting.
The Ambassador reminded their main slogans, which came to Brussels: "Europe clearly".
"I really don't like ugly abbreviations, foreign words, jargon that nobody understands.
How should the citizen to understand that I really be writing next in Brussels curved or circular cucumbers, bananas and of different sizes, or that we really need someone to disable syrečky. ".
Also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more of the Czechs into the European institutions.
We have a multi-speed Europe
According to the Ambassador of the Czechs have the reputation of euroskeptics, and people who pay attention to the rather negative than positive things pages.
In addition, her sorry low representation of Czechs in the European institutions.
The fault is according to many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also the low support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech Presidency then highlighted the strength and cooperation Visegradské Quartet.
"Believe me, when it comes to me Polish and Hungarian and Slovak, the Frenchman next to me say:" Hey, what's really misses you, what's your Visegradská? "and it did."
In the future the Union according to Vicenové waiting for mainly new tough rules for budgetary policies of member countries.
As a very real then sees the concept of a two speed, if not a multi-speed Europe, rather than the new "European Federation".
"We have the euro-area countries and countries outside the euro zone."
"We have the Schengen area, we have also enhanced cooperation Institute."
"For the first time were told to cooperate, only countries that they want and those that do not want to, whatever is nearby."
"The institutes will be more and it will be a hard two-speed Europe," expects Vicenová.
In this respect also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye in enforcing the principle, according to which all the topics that have an impact on the whole of the Union, between all the Member States, not only between the countries of the euro area.
Brand story:
IBM begins second century innovator of its existence
If someone was looking for the word that most closely expressed the strategy of IBM, the closest would probably be "long-term".
For the general public is the IBM symbol of the technological revolution, it is a company perceived as very contemporary, yet since its formation had already passed a hundred years.
The basis of this dlouhodobosti laid the first boss of the firm, a visionary Thomas j. Watson SR.
He coined the password that a number of the world's problems can be easily solved, if people are willing to think.
His motto, "Think!", so the imprint, which will depend on the life of the future giant (and also the name of an internal magazine that IBM had begun in 1935).
It was also the basis for Watson carefully built corporate culture.
"For us from IBM means long-term thinking, continuous movement toward the future.
IBM has survived and prospered, a hundred years because they remained loyal to its basic values and yet afraid everything else around them change.
It allowed us during our first centuries transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second round, we can achieve more, "he said to the anniversary of the current Director of the Samuel j. Palmisano.
Sophisticated system
Watson in the 1930s had to take care of their employees as a businessman Baťa in the Czech Republic-people from IBM had as one of the first American workers paid vacation, insurance from an employer, plus an elegant employee uniform, and a sophisticated system of remuneration of the best inventors, and traders.
As detailed in the IBM i has a relationship with the customer.
The company was from the beginning a genius in the extraction of talent-as one of the first international firms to abolish any discrimination, so that you could choose from.
In accordance with the strategy of anti-discrimination is the current plan that Palmisana at the head of IBM in the next year would be followed by a woman-Virginia Rometty.
The IBM Act already thirty years, still holds the position of boss of sales, marketing and strategy.
IBM in recent years is the so-called jams, on-line brainstormingy, from which there is a lot of future strategies and innovation.
Not surprisingly, ideas is enough-in the company works almost half a million people.
Institutions with a good name
A fixed position in business provides the company a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, the institution should IBM concept rather than just technology firms," she said Economistu Professor of Harvard Business School and author of books about Rosabeth Moss Kanter of IBM.
"IBM is not a technology company, but the company, which helps to solve business problems for the use of technology," said George Colony from the consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the name itself says, is the difference between the market and the market right to create.
IBM-or "big blue" her because of her logo in the United States, familiarly nicknamed-one hundred years grew into one of the largest companies in the world.
Is probably the most versatile technological company-develops hardware and software, infrasturukturu, hosting, and consulting services in the range of products from servers for nanotechnology.
Holds the most patents from all u.s. technology businesses and five of its employees received the Nobel Prize.
Her inventions include ATM, credit card, financial swap, bar code or a floppy disk.
IBM is roughly 220 billion dollars this year to become the second largest technology company by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time since 1996, surpassed Microsoft.
Looking forward
Not all products and innovation they taste customers and periods of-IBM, for example, did not work the bet on their own operating system, OS/2, the on-line service Prodigy or the IBM PCjr.
"If your business built on the movement forward, you cannot emotionally can tie up the past," poznamává to Samuel j. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM does not have problem to build its foundations on many platforms-and if not, then leave.
The difference should be from the competitive Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Perspective technologies
On the sales of IBM, the largest share of services, after roughly a fifth of it consists of software and hardware.
Yet in 1990 with more than half the share of the most powerful representative of the hardware.
Since 2000, IBM sold a few profitable assets worth $ 15 billion, during the same period it has invested $ 58 billion to purchase prospective technologies.
In the investment continues from 2008, when the first modern swept the world financial crisis.
IBM is acting according to a reference of its first head of the Thomas j. Watson, who, during the great depression, also increased the volume of investment.
Yet it appears that IBM is going through the current crisis intact.
IBM'S share price since the beginning of 2008 increased by 120 percent, rocket net profit the company is continually growing.
Corporate password IBM is changing everything, only their values.
It can therefore be expected that even if the came another crisis, this flexible giant can handle it.
IBM: from the toilet of cheese after years in space
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York City, a hundred years ago, originally had a complicated name of the Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM took over until in 1924-originally it was a tag used for the branch companies in Canada and South America.
The basis for the later IBM gave the merger the four firms, whose history dates back to the eighties of the nineteenth century.
Owning the technology, such as the famous "píchačky," then hours afterwards, the employee can record the arrival and departure.
Architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who in 1930, also chaired the Supervisory Board of the company.
Flint has hired the chief rival of Thomas j. Watson, to help him with the management of the company.
Leader of then were overshadowed by the founder of the IBM-at Watsonových thought is not yet built the advantage corporate culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production and sale of machines for business-from kráječů of meat and cheese after the Treasury.
During the first four years, what Watson headed the company, doubled turnover to nine million dollars and began a large expansion of the company in all continents.
Watson has been indispensable for the company so that after almost 40 years in the šéfovském Chair, it was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Jr.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA to manage flights into space-on mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight of man on the moon.
In the meantime, in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers-a series of IBM System/360.
Classic "pécéčko," which raised the computer standard, since named IBM 5150 it came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers, Lenovo, the Chinese company bought the konzultantskou part of the firms PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to devote advice and services with high added value.
The strategy, which in the last three years, IBM paid-is the concept of a Smarter Planet, "smarter planet".
Its aim is the clever use of technology not yet even unplanned areas and improve the situation, for example, in transport, or administration of the cities.
For the area of trade, introduced recently, the IBM platform "Smarter" Commerce ", which helps traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the territory of the country.
Its branch founded in what was then Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM CZECH REPUBLIC also operates the Centre of strategic outsourcing in Brno.
Center for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also a world-class research team dealing with voice recognition.

The worst women's bad habits: affect you?
When you ask the men if they could recite some typical women's bad habits, usually all in one is very promptly poured from the sleeve.
Nice women, in the following lines, where few women's vices that can pump up the blood of the men perfectly in my veins?
Shopping
He blames you your second half, you're dependent on shopping?
You have to buy at least one cloth downloads?
You are purchasing, and in bulk in discounts?
Then, in your case, we can talk about shopping as a habit.
Some of the women recognize that should his nakupovatelskou passion at least a little to tame.
But tell me, that would withstand it, just browse the shops with clothing, find yourself a good fitting together and then take them all (ideally in different color versions) test in the stall?
Even if it is for the majority of women shopping, hobby, men can become literally a hell.
Just think, how many times you've told her you better wait outside the entrance.
Constant discontent
"I'm too fat?"
"I need to lose weight at least five pounds-should I start out?"
"Do you like me?"
Resembling these sentences?
Isn't it?
Then you are one of those women who are obsessed with how they look.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men is allergic to it, how their partner is constantly complaining about his appearance.
The stronger sex also ties in to what the frequency of complaints increases, the women are more hostile.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an endless carousel.
Washing of Windows, sucking, vytírání, facade, dusting, scrubbing the bathtub-at least twice a week.
Takin' it to the partner that trod the dirty feet to the net, pavement, the children that they scrubbed the sink and opatlaly a glassed-in living wall, with the polishing you put so much work?
In the event that you suffer from this "aberration", try to remember that nothing is no exaggeration and order and cleanliness should not stand in the framework of the family in the first place.
This harmless desire for purity may jeopardize your relationship and family well-being.
Nag
"You used boxers throw in the trash."
"You old socks you take you tomorrow?"
"Wet wash cloth on the ground."
If your partner as follows rýpete several times a day, know that it can reliably dial.
Of course, that you're not sick, you want to have to make sure that everything was fine.
Maybe if men knew the women would not them again so much offense.
So vivid, gossip about
For some women, they also slander, gossip, but also insulting and affiliation are against someone.
Women are focused on relationships, and together they are running things-who, where, who, how and why.
Perhaps each of us a little harmless gossip or klevetu there be deleted.
Hand on heart, it's almost all women.
The opposite of gossips are but the basest, who often drbají, perhaps each others scorn and are for their environment-especially in the context of the female working-especially dangerous.

How have the prices of tours since 1989
Until 1989 it was in what was then Czechoslovakia allowed only five State-owned travel agencies: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM.XML, Recreational and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at that time were sold in the overwhelming majority of only trips to countries of Socialist bloc, as travelling to the West was very limited.
Czech tourists as they traveled on a vacation to the sea to the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea on the Black Sea), in Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A clear exception was the period from 1962 until 1972, when it was able to to travel to Yugoslavia, but the Yugoslavian regime brought to the West and the Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of socialism was that it was not the citizens of the Socialist block (i.e., also Czechoslovakians) allowed to travel freely, either individually or in the socialist countries.
In the event that a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, so he needed a letter of invitation from this country, not otherwise individual path, maybe.
The travel agency at the time, offering package tours to the West, however, was the need to queue overnight with sleeping or in the travel agency "known good".
Not so, however, not the end.
The so-called foreign exchange the promise, which was a condition for the journey to the West, was not granted "politically unreliable" people "who could not travel at all.
Czechoslovak currency is not freely convertible currency, without foreign exchange promise so it was not possible to obtain financial resources (Western currency) on journey to the West.
By far the most common, however, the Czechs spent a vacation in the country, of which the result was a large number of huts and cottages, which the Czechs to take and this custom survives to this day.
Travelling Czechs so experienced since 1989, a real revolution.
While in the year 1989 was a vacation in EAST GERMANY or Bulgaria to our maximum, the Czechs spent abroad last year 4.5 miles. holidays in countries around the world.
A great paradox that you already realize today is that the US is currently most popular in Croatia was not possible until 1989 travel freely, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the outset, 90. years of the last century following the abolition of the visa requirement to neighbouring West European countries, which was triggered by a huge surge in short-term visits Vienna Austria or Germany in particular.
They couldn't get enough of czechoslovakians long trips to the West, each with at least wanted to see for a while.
For example, in Paris, sleeping in parks tours of Czechs in tents, as our former income were, so we can pay the hotel or guesthouse.
A typical feature of the travel of Czechs was by this time vození their own food, cans, salami, etc, to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of freely convertible of the Czech Crown, giving our visitors could finally after many years of destítkách freely to buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and average wages rose, however, which resulted in around 1997, another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, the travel agencies began regularly since 1997 to prepare tours Charter air services, air tours, thanks to options nasmlouvat quantity discounts in comparison with the past, incredibly had become cheaper.
In the late 1990s. years of the last century had already the Czechs enjoyed virtually all developed countries in the world, except the US, which continue to facilitate our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel occurred in 2000, when he was due to the large demand, dispatched from the Czech Republic, historically the first direct charter flight to the touch, it was in Thailand.
From this year so every year vylétávají with Czech tourists spot charters to warm lands, this year's winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic into 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries currently visiting already around 100 thousand Czechs per year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-Orange, came in 2008.
17. November 2008, abolished the U.S. visas for Czech tourists and thereby our country finally became the most advanced country in the world.
In 2008, for the first time in the history of the Czechs also spent more than half their vacations abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in the history of it spent on one foreign holiday, including the cost of the place of residence of more than 15 000. USD per person.
The general meeting has to find the President, again, but threatens to stalemate
Almost five months is a Czech football without the President and there is a risk that the successor Ivan Haška led the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) will not be known even after the next extraordinary general meeting, which will take place Thursday in Nymburk.
Still, there is no agreement, according to which the electoral regulations shall be followed.
Without it, neither does not vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
Interest to lead Czech football to Henry Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hasek resigned from Office in June and, in his retirement called colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
But in an era when Haškovi football slid back toward tit-svazovými between the two chambers, which are unable to agree on a common candidate.
Full it showed 16. September, when a new President was to be chosen.
Delegates of the general meeting to the National House in Prague-Smíchov left unnecessarily, because the negotiations remain blocked, and it wasn't just on the way to elections.
There is not a consensus, who has the right to vote, actually-if only the statutory representatives or officials of the credentials, full powers.
At this one point since there was a partial match, which was helped by the recommendation of the Institute of State and law, according to which the representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Disputes but still exist in the electoral regulations.
Too clear to the situation of the nevnesl, or the Executive Committee, at its meetings, whether regular or extraordinary, does not, in essence, nothing else.
Look at the option of several times changed, but neuralgický the point is still the same.
The question is: how to handle 3. bike, to eliminate the possibility of stalemate?
"The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes, or find another model," said one of the three Vice-Presidents of the FAČR Dušan Svoboda in the leadership of the Association represents professional football.
According to the statutes of the proposed model in the third round to win one of the candidates, which will have a greater percentage of support in the Chamber, for which he's running.
Moravia is reportedly willing to go to the concession, to win the candidate who receives the higher the sum of the percent of the vote from both chambers.
And the Czech party promotes the condition that the winner must, when this percentage addition to obtain at least two-thirds.
"But it would then make sense and she lost the two previous rounds, that would be completely refuted by the bicameral concept" understands the objections of the Moravian parties Freedom according to which would be the best regulations don't stem and vote under the applicable statutes.
With the somewhat surprisingly agrees and Tomáš Paclík, although it is estimated that the statutes specified the electoral regulations of the suits of all candidates most of the Pelt.
"I wish that voted for the maximum according to the articles of Association."
"To nevymýšlely some wildcard nonsense as at the last general meeting," said the owner of the Victoria Plzeň, who's running for the first time, and in its observations, explaining, in particular, against the Pelt.
Pelta remains an optimist.
According to him, in Nymburk, the new Chairman, I know and believe that the candidates together constructively in the future.
"All passion calms down, where today's procedure for the national team at the European Championships."
"Football will be again happy wave, it will be a greater willingness to cooperate," says jablonecký and former, who is from across the three largest experience in the management of football at both the professional and the regional level.
Rajchl is nearing.
"I hope in an agreement, but unfortunately, the situation is a lot of ambivalent."
"It's not between people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to adapt to the rules.-assigned"
"This may cause it to stop the general meeting again."
"I hope that sanity will prevail," said Rajchl.
To the agreement of all parties have much time left.
Some of the negotiations was allegedly happen directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the struggle will football ever complete the generals.
The air special, in which they move to Podgorica, inter alia, Vice-Chairman of Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, namely from Prague because of technical failure in the morning takes off and looking for the replacement option, as part of the Executive Committee to the scene barážové retaliation.
Finally, maybe it will be a crucial meeting at the ministerial level, which might be alleged on Wednesday.
Minister of education, youth and sports of Josef Telecommunication would like to persuade riven by the parties within the strongest sporting association in the country, to the agreement.
In the game's a lot: State subsidies, the credibility of the football and the upcoming general meeting of the ČSTV, which will address the new direction of the Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazky.
Paclík goes into battle for the President, because they see a suitable candidate
If the Chief players in the grounds of Tomáš Paclík before an extraordinary general meeting saw a strong candidate who would meet all his ideas about the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), nor should the fight Summit function.
"If the quality of the adept existed, I'm fighting for it, and I'm not going into the elections."
"But in the current situation, unable to find anyone like that," said Paclík.
In a duel with Miroslav Peltou and Henry Rajchlem drives Paclíka motivation to just Pelt, alleged by him, he tried to avoid in the way to the head of FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that, in the case of his victory, in the role of the President lasted only until 2013, which is on the agenda of the annual general meeting.
In the long run would like to see an experienced and award winning Manager, who is not too linked with a football game.
"With some of the people who would come into consideration, I'm talking about."
"For me it was crazy, some say that at this point, with the Czech football or do not want to be identified."
"That I'd like to change, '' he said.
Paclíkovi was now most of all do Peltovo conjunction with the Chairman of the Pilsen District Football Association by Romano Berbrem, a man with a controversial reputation, which is in the wings known as powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of the delegates to the general meeting.
For the Paclíka is so unacceptable that stood in the Chair position Pelta.
"If he won, so zakonzervuje the current state of and nothing would move forward in football."
"In combination with the support of Berbra, who is a skilled trader, would help the football even more," said Paclík.
Referring to that Peltovo name years ago there was a corruption in the eavesdropping when investigating the affair, but from which Pelta went unpunished.
"I don't know what kind of prestige would football Peltovo the victory."
"And how would we also looked in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, but it also takes the perspective of his former statement that it would "sell plzeňský Club if Pelta became Chairman".
In the event that Paclík in the Thursday election triumphs, but could with Peltou imagine future cooperation.
The same is another candidate Rajchl, which Paclík is supported before the general meeting, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would have been the first who I'd go."
"He has great ability."
"I could see him as head of the team."
"But this would drive the Association."
"I also don't stick your nose where it can't do it," said Paclík, who in September raised much attention by standing behind the Commission citing the arbitration with the Luďkem Macelou, which was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclík says that it would take over the management of the Association dared.
Refers to the ability of management to private companies since last summer's also Plzeň, which with its support in May was celebrated by the premiérový League triumph.
"I have the strength to make it in the football environment, something has changed, so has contributed to its particular culture."
"To reduce the effects of certain interest groups, which should tend to influence disciplinary and appeals to the Commission, which goes up to the unsavoury situations," said Paclík, who expresses his dislike for example for sparťanskému boss Daniel Křetínskému.
One of the priorities should also considered tightening the relations of the FAČR with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose use would be for political leaders lobbying for the sport received more money from the lottery tax.
"It is one of the key things that should be the new Chairman."
"If the taxation of gambling, how to declare political party, so I understand their reasoning, but must say where the money will go," he said.
A Paclík now its not even associated with the Plzeň Club, even though he himself claims that the President of the FAČR should be "non-partisan".
Pelta is associated with Jabloncem, with the Prague Duklou. Rajchl
"It's not ideal."
"I can't see but no sense to someone clinging convert their shares in the Club and a year and a half there," says Paclík.
Pelta promised the new statutes FAČR, which would eliminate the electoral stalemate
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Chairman Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, intends to have FAČR the new statutes, which would, in future, definitely avoid disputes over the election regulations.
Jablonecký is official before Thursday's meetings in Nymburk optimist and believes that the election fight significantly dampen any of today's success of the football team.
Pelta is now been made the choice promised that the representation and acquisition Finance intends to concentrate in the case of the election.
The choice before the last general meeting decided to go at the last minute, and he two-month postponement of the throw to their ideas about the management of football, he defended and presented in a broader context.
"The people at all levels make football a long time and they expect that the President will be known on Thursday."
"Feels that it is high time that the Association leadership," says the man, who is associated in particular with the jabloneckým Club, but a number of years he worked in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
I, therefore, believes that he has enough experience to Czech football.
Is convinced that the current problems with the choice is euphoria, which was at the time the Government of Ivan Haška.
"Unfortunately, at the June general meeting approved the statutes, which were not as perfect as everybody thought."
"If Númenor did not permit different interpretations, the President we've had since September," said Pelta.
Just processing the most important document of the Civic Association began as a vějičku delegate.
"If I become President, I'll take it as a personal challenge, and I'm willing to take personal responsibility, if it fail."
"It is a matter of principle, without which we cannot be," says Pelta.
Next they try to nevymezovat against their opponents.
Earlier avizoval that he could imagine cooperation with Henry Rajchlem, which recognizes for its forensic education, and knows that his opponent was its first Vice-President.
Long neútočil and Thomas Paclíka, who, on the contrary, to let the thread of dried Pelt.
"In football, something over a year, has had some success."
"However, his attacks were unworthy of him and a lot of people in the election campaign."
"And so many of them now has doubts about its actual nature," he said to the man who supposedly Pelta address remains faithful to the proklamacím, which had already announced in September.
His strongest weapon is knowledge of football from the lowest competition after representation.
This should be a showcase of football.
"And I also tried to close all the Affairs, starting with the case of Bohemians or echoes of last year's corruption scandal."
"Then I went to the negotiations with the private and public sectors, to make enough money for the whole of football," said the candidate, 46, two months ago.
If also promised that his arrival was to head the football would be no staff purges.
"I'd have to first get acquainted with the contents of the individual employees," said David at Strahov, where the long anarchy, there is understandable nervousness.
Despite the current worst-case scenarios, covering Europe General meeting, believes that on Thursday they delegates to Nymburka.
"If it is the only contentious point, how will be elected in the third round, so that we can migrate."
"Soccer needs credibility, there will only be finally have again their leader," remains Pelta two days before the possibly decisive on his funkcionářské career optimist.
Rajchl promises that would FAČR began to work hard
If the new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic on Thursday former Vice-President the General Meeting elected Henry Rajchl, many people in the Association should be pleased.
Rajchl, promises that in the event of his election will work hard.
He wants to promote system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football field.
It also promised to solve the case against Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring to football more money and continue the work that was started by the previous President Ivan Hašek.
"As President, I'd like to dedicate football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA over representation, professional football, a performance football after the youth."
"But I'm not saying I'd do everything myself," he said in an interview with Rajchl ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want in the Executive Committee to distribute competences so that each of the members devoted to a particular area."
"And I will give away the hard tasks to each of this segment to move football on the great step forward."
"Many people would probably was pleased, because it started to work really hard and not just to criticize the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement said he thought that would not stand again.
"I know that I'm doing 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know, that it will have meaning and that I will have people who will be constantly crimping and questioning my every step," he explained why he hesitated.
"Many people told me that I must not give up, because then it would give others."
"It's confidence, that I can't just throw away, '' he said.
Motivates him and the continuation of the work started with Haškem.
"For those two years did a great job and I don't want it now."
"They are of started processes that will have the reverb should be up in a few years, and I'd hate to be stopped," he said with concern that in the case of the election of another candidate, Pelty should the situation on the Union to return to the time before the Haškem.
"I believe in fully, and that is the thing to me Mirek Pelta can't."
"Behind him are mostly navázáni people who did not football that was only for those lucky ones."
"I can be blamed for many things, but certainly not that someone for negligence."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do football for all, because then it will be all right everybody, and not just the privileged few," said Rajchl.
Is refuted by the claim that he was the Czech President.
"Even though some people trying to argue otherwise, so I plan to do for the Moravia maximum."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second League split to Czech and Moravian part of the whose winners would go to the League."
"Valid should the current situation, where they are in the League only three Moravian units, which is a problem to the young players," said Rajchl.
As the fight of the Chairman joined, and the Chairman of the Pilsen Club, Tomáš Paclík, dares you to estimate their chances of Rajchl election.
"But I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which I chose as its Vice-Chairman, and that for me is the clear successes," said Rajchl, for his achievements as the saving of tens of millions of Crowns on negotiated contracts, negotiating television contracts and negotiations on the loterijním law.
On the contrary, he gives for complicity that Union ties together.
While the Pelt declares that "disqualified from being returned to the Czech football confidence", the second contender Paclíka considered a strong candidate who has the football to offer.
"No one can contest that in Pilsen for the year did a great job."
"If he were elected, he would have said in those matters, which started the Ivan Hašek and would not substantively changed staffing committees."
"It would be twisted in its favour," assesses the rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jump into the blue
Julia Stanek
Paddling pools from the perspective of Ufona, luxurious swimming pool in Budapest: who is touring Europe, can experience your blue miracle-and after visiting the cities or travel to have his tired feet relax in the thermal baths.
The book show is the most beautiful wellness on the water.
When the issue of Iris Meder in the past one and a half year on the objevné path, was in her bag to miss her bathing suit.
New back on the water, I looked up to a height of to the artistically shaped by the dome, swam across the marble putti (the Ant small naked boy child (with wings)), which it waited on the edge of the pool and admire the carefully restored art nouveau swimming areas.
If some of the Lido, in an instant, it has entered into his notebook-with notable details about how to build, and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pool area examined in this way, the architecture historian Meder and represents is now in his just released book "Badefreuden (the joy of bathing)": the popular swimming areas in Munich, the historic Palace of the swimming pool area in the Black Forest, "the hard core of concrete structures" in Taunusu.
13 countries led her to her "path for nejneobyčejnějšími Spa in Central Europe": in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland attended the site in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland-and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
the 46-year-old German is a real entuziastkou plovárenské culture.
The sport's power overstated, says Meder-only in the water, it's something else.
The anger is just that the fans of swimming must be content with the blue crowd and smell of chlorine, while meat for health may breathe in the smell of spruce forests or a narcotic to listen cheery chirps of birds in the Park.
"One day, I asked, why was he swimming areas must always be so ugly," says Vienna Lady Meder.
"So I started to collect good swimming areas."
The water level of the zdvojuje architecture
Splashing in the pool and ethereal oils will for sauna-a factor of well-being is so large that it covers all of the senses, so Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders were swimming pools can be a real feast for the eyes: "instead of the floor has a man in the bath water."
"Is both transparent, on the other hand, reflects the beauty of the entire building."
All optical zdvojuje: high roof, colourful tiles, hopper boards.
Over the picture the volume "Badefreuden (Joy of swimming)" provides the 190 pages of everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history, a historical OASIS wellness-raises but, above all, taste, jump into the blue.
A remarkable collector of specimens discovered swimming Mrs. Meder in its search in Hungary.
In addition to the wonderful medicinal baths, as 100 years old bath Széchenyi in Budapest, she found the water containing nitrate in the original karst cave (cave baths in Miskolc-Tapolca) and the thermal baths, the swimming pools are filled with an alkaline water and are located in the building the shape of a cylinder (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
A beautiful spectacle, in contrast, offer many heated open-air swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria. While one of the most nástřešního swimming pool on the eyes of the whole city, outdoor pool, Spa in St. Anton on Arlberg snow-covered-and: in the steam bath is a window from which you can monitor tourism on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most notable design pool expected the spa guests in Längenfeldu: Park, Ötztal looks like a ufo, which had just arrived in the Alps.
Of the three top open pans in the winter steam while in the background the Ötztal mountains stands the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every sběratelce the Lido pools Mrs. Meder rose smell of chlorine into the nostrils.
Many thermal baths are smell like sulphur, Árpád at the Spa in Hungarian Békescsabě smells after fuel oil to the extent that one can hardly believe that he got into therapeutic baths.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters containing alkaline bicarbonates, almost black, and whose deposits up to the skin, once just a man slips into the pool-a rather special experience wellness.
But also one place was Iris Meder in his quest for nice baths disappointed: when she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climate lázně Luhačovice, hit the closed terrain.
In 1902 by architect Dušanem Jurkovičem designed Spa has meanwhile been concluded.
When Mrs. Meder looked collapsing Windows red-and-white-yellow, Art Nouveau buildings, she saw how the massively growing weeds between the tiles.
By contrast, the built in the Lido in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These baths have already had three phases of construction; You can discover not only novorománské elements that originate from the time of its inception in 1844, but also the Moorish Alhambra-style Hall, which was added around 1900.
From careful modernisation of 1995 is the Palais Thermal Spa popular place has swimming pools, Mrs Iris Meder, and not only because of the black forest.
"It's a performance, contact a variety of construction styles in a beautiful complex," says Ms. Meder.
For such the Palace is immersed in a hot pool seems to be a relatively minor issue.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank is to examine trade in commodities
Christian Teevs
Leaves Deutsche Bank of their trade in agricultural commodities?
According to the information SPIEGEL-ONLINE's Josef Ackermann working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the then Chief of the group, to draw the consequences.
Hamburg-
For the Federal citizens is clear: 84% of Germans are regarded as unacceptable, according to one study, with banks speculating in agricultural raw materials like wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of those polled even requested that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions from this trade came because the problems of the poorest of the world.
This is the result of a survey of Forsa on behalf of consumer organisations Foodwatch.
The study is based on the report, which presented the Foodwatch in mid-October.
It shows the author Harald Schumann that betting on global commodity exchanges of driving prices up and the Bank therefore are complicit in the global problem of hunger.
Campaign for consumers is targeted specifically against the boss of Deutsche Bank Josef was largely responsible Ackermannovi, although velkobanky like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting like.
Originally, the commodities bets refer to traders to insure against price fluctuations.
In the meantime, but most experts agree that the participants of the capital market is high risk transactions shall be released from the supply and demand-and on behalf of the poorest high profits.
Otherwise than competitors in the United States responded to criticism of the Ackermann: promised to examine the complaints and said that no trade "is not worth the reputation given to Deutsche Bank in a bet".
According to the information SPIEGEL ONLINE checks for international working group of criticisms of Foodwatch-Report.
By the end of the year is to be closed to check, then the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank-together with a recommendation, to be loaded.
At the end of January, they then tell the leaders of the Bank shall draw the consequences.
At the end of could be a reduction of the trade in commodities or even complete refusal.
Ackermann is a self-help on its image.
Foodwatch organization Chief Thilo Bode, welcomed the report but also for his criticism of the financial sector: "betting on rising food prices in particular shows how drastically our Bank today, is inimical to the common good."
Whether Ackermann as the highest banking lobbyist should follow the obligations.
"Deutsche Bank shall strike from its portfolio of all of the items for which they are used the money for betting on food prices," said Bode.
"No matter whether Mr Ackermannovi's hunger, the suffering, the people or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
Ackermannův preview seems at first glance like a surprising, but what is clear is that koncernový the boss a few months prior to his departure from Office would like to leave the perfect image.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the Board of directors otherwise than planned, to the Supervisory Board does not move.
Averting from controversial agrarian speculation could improve its image.
And potential losses need not worry-you should consult his successor.
Every second, investment in raw materials, testified
Foodwatch is trying to maintain a high pressure on the Manager.
Not yet participated already more than 30,000 Internet users on the campaign organization.
On Tuesday, a survey published in Bode, in which the Institute Forsa, 7. and 8. November interviewed 1001 people.
Just eleven percent according to be considered legitimate, that Deutsche Bank offers investment, with which they are linked bets on food prices.
Many customers of banks would also reached personal consequences, if they learned that their bank is involved in such transactions: every second in the polls, testified all investments, for which the money is to speculation in raw materials.
43 percent, warned about the known before such a Bank, 49 percent said they think about it on the termination of your account and go to the other institution.
The House of 21. century in Vienna
Long Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture with peaks, falls and a happy ending: the Austrian Pavilion of the world exhibition in Brussels in 1958 won the price became the Vienna arts, remained empty and zpustnul.
Now it is otvírán again as the exhibition house.
When knitting for modern post-war architecture, for clear forms, glass Hall, bold strokes and new building materials, which are typical for faith in technical progress, then the Austrian Pavilion of architect Charles Schwanzera for the Brussels World Exposition 1958 concise and its celebrated example.
Schwanzerův Pavilion received when the Grand Prix d ' Architecture for its light and they towered, active construction of steel and glass.
The building is seen as a milestone in contemporary architecture.
Best known as an architect, so that also for the next World Expo Pavilion built in Austria.
With its legendary čtyřválcovým BMW-Palace plus as a key carried out minor building in Munich, eventually 1973 internationally famous.
Its as a temporary exhibition structure designed Pavilion for the World Exposition placed in the Schweizer Garten at the Vienna Südbahnhof (Southern train station), and have recreated in 1962 opened the Museum of 20. century-was named as "the House of 20. of the century ".
Appropriate for the museum building was not used, or spatially nor technically-lacking the walls for hanging up art exhibits, no satisfactory climate.
Yet it was used until the current art yet in Vienna of the new stand.
Since 2001 the building was empty and deteriorate more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz Pavilion in an instant, is now the name of "the House of 21. of the century "and will in future be used as the Museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday night there opens the Museum Belvedere Palace, to which it belongs, the first exhibition-happy intention in every respect.
Entrepreneurship new start Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became the new Director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, art historian with a significant name králová career, m. j. figure skater in his youth, and later in Sotheby 's, the Guggenheim Museum and as a founding Director of the Museo modernism Salzburg, pushed strongly for the reconstruction of the politicians and preservationists, sought public funding and private sponsorship money and identified uses.
In addition to the contemporary art should be posted on the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruby restaurant of the foundations, should there be a café and bookshop, and had to be built to the Office building.
Close supervision, low budget.
For the implementation was then Krischanitz ideal cast.
Not only that, sensitively reconstructed them and spread of Art Nouveau buildings of Joseph Olbricha in Vienna, and won the competition, but because, at the Schwanzera, he studied at the Technical University of Vienna and the Pavilion was extremely important for him to "place" in which "almost every weekend" at the exhibition.
He knew the original project, and also knew problems building, which is already in its relocation to Vienna and the change of use of lost to its generosity and lightness.
In the current reconstruction were far bigger problems: the building was "Catapult problems for energy," says Krischanitz.
Window profiles, glass facades have been exchanged, used glass fibre-reinforced insulating glass and glass roof replaced by special security glass.
Chladové bridges-steel beams were reinforced or replaced, and the asbestos filled ceilings rescued.
Two underground floors provide space for new uses, flush mounted lighting channel between the building and the street lighting, handles to the entrance leads to the bridge-almost new construction, but still vznosný Schwanzerův Pavilion.
The original entrance door, the building is preserved in the old natřena anti-corrosive červenohnědém color tone.
And is exactly the same as he was before.
And it's all under strict supervision of the heritage and the low budget.
"Often had to be found of the material which is good and cheap, and also liked the památkovému Office," says Krischanitz and points to a broken floor basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction of the building remained flexible and airy.
It's difficult to be with Pavilion, "who came here from Brussels," he said recently, the typical "Krischanitz Drop-in-the-City-History".
Such architecture he is "always in the wrong place" and wants to still "give proper self-esteem."
In this case, but it is not the House of 21. the century nepatřičném the spot since most urban happy coincidence: in radius around Schweizer Garten is a completely newly designed "Urban neighborhood at the main station" with Office and residential houses.
And perhaps even to another happy coincidence: the House of 21. century could receive aid from other Krischanitzovy buildings, as the lover of Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and how to hear, this is with the city of the neighbourhood at in Schweizer Garten.
Runway plans to package for the winter crisis in million EUR
Distance vypiplala the crisis plan to prevent a shortage of trains in winter.
The number of staff shall be doubled.
It will cost millions.
In the fight against the cold caused by shortage of trains and delays shall be issued by the Deutsche Bahn in this year according to a report in the newspaper more than 70 million euro.
The newspaper "Bild" reported a preliminary report with reference to the internal koncernový plan that supposedly counts by 2015, total investment of around 300 million euros.

So many new regional trains waiting for years for approval by the federal railway Office.
They also treated the delays in dispatching trains ICE
The runway has also over the years by not dealing with it must redress the trains apparently more often leave the ICE dílensky check, when one train ICE on the main station Köln to the destruction of the axle.
Deutsche Bank paid a million fine in the US
After the fuss around the Chief Josef Ackermanna occurs to new trials in the US: Deutsche Bank there must pay miliónové damages.
As if he didn't have problems at home, Deutsche Bank, enough to catch up with the giant in the field of his past in the USA: the Frankfurt institution applies in one countervailing proceedings 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settled disputes due to the bankruptcy of the five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is a sale of mortgage worksheets.
Regulator of financial market, she punishes a whole series of NCUA big banks that fought cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; I think that the risks had decreased.
Such papers were lost during the crisis considerably in value and drop their banks with him into the abyss.
"We are satisfied that we were able to resolve the issue, it was necessary to bring the parties to the Court," said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York.
Bank payment to blame unacknowledged.
This is also true for Citigroup, which is committed to the payment of 20,5 million dollars.
The President welcomed the NCUA Debbie Matz helpfulness of both financial institutions.
National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the US and helps out in the bankruptcy laws to protect customer assets.
NCUA is attempting to obtain compensation for the incurred billions in damage.
Now closed by settlements are the first of its kind.
Viscosity is also pinned on the other velkobanky and in summer has sued JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland, and Goldman Sachs.
For questionable mortgage leaves it is a so called Mortgage-backed Palm Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When us real estate bubble around in 2007 popping, it happened to a number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis has changed the Above US-Lehman Brothers, their thinking.
Even when the events took place a few years ago, is now the banks towards the sharp wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have submitted numerous complaints to the axles or affected misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has started the biggest wave of actions.
Complains of 18 international velkobankám that two State American financiers dealing with real estate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the shops with the mortgages in a volume of about $ 200 billion znevýhodnily.
Also Deutsche Bank must face action, the FHFA, there are more shops in the total value of approximately $ 14.2 billion, from the years 2005 to 2007.
Dohlédací Office requires that the Frankfurt Institute responsible for "substantial losses", without, however, said some of the exact amount.
Deutsche Bank declined to requests as unfounded and said that he wanted to defend himself.
Warren Buffett shall enter with the 10 billion to IBM
Financial guru Buffett invests massively in IT-company IBM.
From March bought shares in an amount of more than $ 10 billion.
Not yet an American investor Warren Buffett always claimed that it is not in the IT area, and computers to invest because of the long-term development of the company allowed only with difficulty to predict.
Now, however, read commercial messages IBM and their opinion on investment in the business changed.
Already much earlier had to understand that IBM offers mainly services and acquisition of computer systems for the IT-Department of other undertakings.
Warren Buffett's investment in the financial world is seen as a passage to the Knight.
As a result, IT may be called the mother rock IBM now "Sir IBM".
As Buffett told American economic radio station CNBC that from March bought shares of IBM at $ 10.7 billion.
His Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway has become one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett sagte, that even IBM has nothing about his involvement.
Rewarding management who tried for depression, even of a proper income.
"You've done a great job," said Buffett to the strategy.
IBM bets already for a long time on the lucrative IT-services such as the operation of the computing center.
More than 100-year-old pioneer of computer also offers software and advice and powerful computers for businesses.
The Buffett technological companies to this day rather avoided.
Claims that invests only to undertakings whose activity also means.
Instead, he reached Buffett after the freight rail, manufacturers of lubricants or for the products of machinery.
His Holding Company Berkshire Hathaway owns next to about 80 own subsidiaries also shares in the whole range of velkokoncernů such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, Münchener Rück earlier.
81-year-old man in 60-1960s last century a small textile company, Berkshire Hathaway, and built up from the wise investments, one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet it is his way of life, modest.
It is therefore for many investors around the world cult figure.
Its almost infallible sense of making money brought him the nickname "Orakel from Omaha (the miracle of Omaha".
When Mr. Buffett's investments become known, increased shares of IBM stock market prior to the start of one percent.
"Big Blue", as IBM, also referred to as, is the total price on the stock exchange of more than 220 billion dollars and is seen together with the companies Apple and Microsoft as most valuable technology companies in the world.
In the company Microsoft, so Buffett, but he didn't want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates is said to be his close friend.
A threat is a tangible
After the discovery of the "cells in the Zwickau" doubt the Turkish media on German legal State.
The paper talks about "the bloody ideology", which is now once again.
The murder of eight small entrepreneurs of Turkish origin, and one Greek in the years 2000 to 2006 have the right extremist background.
This message in Turkey and in Germany-the Turkish population in Germany reacted with fear and worry.
Because for many German Turks it returns back to the ghost, which was long regarded as the dead: from the arson in Mölln in November 1992 and at Solingen in May 1993, there is no comparable violence with right extremist background.
In Germany there are xenophobia about yet never in doubt.
Discovered right extremist network reveals, however, the extent to which the dimension cannot see anymore.
"Come again the bloody ideology?" were the headlines of the Internet Edition of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk "".
Newspaper "Sabah", by contrast, point out that one of the perpetrators was supposed to be a secret police agent of the Department for the protection of the Constitution and they fear that the German authorities might also be involved in the radical right.
Deliberately reacted Turkish municipality of Germany: remembering the weekend demonstrations silence before the Brandeburskou gate, the victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago she remembered of the Turkish community in Berlin together with German and Turkish policy in the solemn act of the padesátého anniversary of the German-Turkish agreement on recruitment.
Collared was stage followed the common life-like history of success.
As the boxes here is news of several Turkish media: "a gift of Germany, yeah" is the heading of article in Turkish Internet platform "Haber" X ", to make reports on the background to the murder series.
Also the issue of "Hürriyet" for Germany can't take to fail this mental link.
"It's starting to smell" is the caption of the column by Ahmet Külahci.
Underlines, in that they were murdered the people who paid their taxes and his work brought an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
Nejkritičtěji is discussed in německotureckých Internet forums to the police and her late success in search.
Why did the German authorities already much earlier, when the suspicious looking in right extremist circles, authors.
So many shows at least rhetorically a ready to use drastic means: "If there continue to be carried out activity so superficially, immigrants to anything other than their own defense and armed".
"This is perhaps the best self-defense".
"The quality of clarification and the proportionality of the punishment of the whole network very strongly depends on the internal peace in Germany", "Selenium".
What does it mean if the internal peace in Germany is vulnerable, clarify the assassination in Mölln, Solingen in the 1990s.
Photographs of the burn in Solingen is deeply vryta in memory of Germans and Turks.
Since no other event has shown here living the Turks more clearly that there is a tangible threat to the Germans and that mistrust and distance can result in right-wing violence
But the bombings have made on the side of the Turks more pronounced sense of reciprocity.
Don't repeat the errors of the past
In the Turkish press, it was mainly criticized the failure of the German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to you in Mölln, survivors, visit.
Arrested after the attack in a telegram of condolence to Solingen sent the Turkish National President, but left at the Memorial Festival in Köln represented by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel when the Kinkelem-in his speech has calculated what charges the Turks will pay.
Quite so, as if the value of man according to the height of its taxes.
Current news of the Turkish media once again shows how deep the distrust many German Turks in local polities.
In addition to the efforts of the extensive clarification and new evaluation of those extreme terrorism in Germany this time requires open words.
Scandalous Bank in Zürichsee
Most Bank, Europe does not have a registered office in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has suffered a financial crisis almost bankrupt, and since then, sliding from one crisis to the next.
Now it has some German.
So the Axel Weber certainly didn't think so.
After his retirement from the leadership of the noisy Federal Bank happened in July known that arrives 2013 to almost the same spektakulárního a new job: President of the Management Board of the Swiss velkobanky UBS-unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber had publicly praised Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its newly acquired respectability and said the friendly remarks towards future colleagues.
"Die UBS its turnover".
"I look forward to working with Kasparem Villigerem and Oswald Grübelem".
But in September it was clear that everything goes differently.
One dealer from UBS in London, walked around all the security systems of the Bank and approximately 1.7 billion euro zmarnil.
Head of the Board of Directors of UBS Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland, a respected banker, had to leave.
The President of the Board of UBS is since then also stunned-and they all ask: When finally coming Axel Weber?
I already have known that Weber Bank from February 2012 may advise.
And the Presidency of the Administrative Council takes over in may-not only in the year 2013, the Bank informed on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber will be hard.
Is not a banker, Professor of Economics and major banker and he would certainly have time to incorporate needed.
At the same time will take over then the responsibility for the strategy of the Bank, who once again has proved that he deserves the title "Bank of the largest scandals in Europe"
Because UBS is both great-until recently was the largest asset manager in the world-and sliding in both years from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, will not remain proud of the Swiss Bank was spared.
It started as a financial crisis.
In 2007, UBS enjoyed an excellent reputation.
The Image of the quiet, and a solid, but also vychytralého Asset Manager combines with the ambitious objectives: also wanted to mean something in the investment banking business.
So managed the UBS 2007 on one side with the 1.6 trillion dollars more money of wealthy clients than any other Bank in the world.
And on the other hand, has advanced as an investment bank, to the League's biggest banks
It made an impression.
A former banker and later a long-time Professor of banking in Zurich, Hans Geiger says: "their students I UBS claimed always as a model of good Bank."
"From today's point of view, a man asks: how I could so wrong?"
He was wrong considerably.
In 2007, was the first clear that something went wrong in the UBS properly.
In mid boss surprisingly resigned Board of Directors Peter Wuffli, who has not been seen as highly intelligent and also a brilliant banker.
A few months later, knew why he left.
The Investment Bank Division squandered the Subprime-papers and had to write off billions.
To withstand a Prowler, same UBS capital increase in the amount of really 13 billion francs.
But actually found investors, however, over which was recently still sneered: Opaque Asian State Fund from Singapore and the Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that one even knew his name.
But that was just the first impact.
In April 2008 it developed the worse.
The Bank had to admit the new billions in losses, the President of the Board Marcel Ospel, 2006 still the second best paid Executive Board Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, followed by a disaster: UBS was due to its bad investments for financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the State.
Nationalbank bought from UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation has six billion francs to mandatorily convertible bonds, which could be a partner in a bank.
Whole Switzerland was shaken-as you noted, as dramatic for a small country, has on its territory the big banks.
After all he was the balance sum of UBS 2007 more than five times greater than the performance of the economy of Switzerland (see picture).
"Once again we could not save UBS", says Bank expert Geiger.
The first disaster follows another.
For several months in the tax dispute capitulated UBS with America and has shown willingness to issue data, affluent customers who, if possible, with the assistance of banks've ended the tax.
In addition, she agreed with the payment of 780 million dollars-as the recovery of irregular profits from these transactions, including, and.
This confession, more or less openly, that helped the reduction of taxes.
At the same time she lost something that has always been its capital in the competition for rich clients: Halo discretion.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secrecy was no longer what it was previously.
Followed the resignation of the head of the Board of Directors and the President of the Administrative Council.
And the exodus of money customers.
So the Bank lost in the course of a few months, his credibility in both the central business areas: investment banking for the poor speculation and in the management of assets for aiding the reduction of taxes.
And just when things calmed down a little bit again, just as it was thought that UBS has once again recovered, here comes this unfortunate business quest: the only dealer zmarnil euro 1.7 billion before the Bank noticed that something was wrong.
And it's clear: with the management of the risks in the investment banking it probably still isn't working.
"Case of Adoboli probably found that control risks has too few", says Martin Janssen, an economist and a Professor of finance at Banking Finanz Institute of the University of Zürich, Switzerland.
The Financial Director of a large German bank is certain: "the problem of UBS lies in the fact that it doesn't control the risks."
It was exactly her idea of the precautionary principle, which got off on the Swiss Bankers have long ago to become guard big properties of the world: none too great a risk, but security for the money-also from the parties of the Alpine Republic collapsed the world again.
Vaults of Swiss banks have become a symbol for steadfast reliability as the Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly high-quality chocolate.
Headquarters for UBS in Zurich, to cliché good Swiss private banks-it is just a little bigger.
It's a classic.
The Bank has its main office in Zurich, Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the Curyšskému Lake, which is backed by snow-capped Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, rental shops, among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry, such as Tiffany 's, here they find between the Swiss traditional trades such as ice Sprüngli.
For centuries houses the Swiss banks: from the Nationalbank via Palast der Credit Suisse to an elite private banks as Julius Bär.
In the reception hall you enter the UBS heavy otáčivými the door.
Inside the walls are panelled in marble, in front of them is a huge leather chairs, in addition to the Bank's logo, a large signpost to "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for: safety.
This idea of Swiss banks both by the Swiss velkobanky, UBS and Credit Suisse but sometimes-curb or betrayed, how determined the boss of a small Swiss private bank.
His name would prefer to read in the papers, he concluded, like all Swiss Bankers, also with the two velkobankami shops.
UBS is probably too grown, primarily detect in investment banking, where, moreover, extend the Anglo-saxons.
The Swiss, it do not have more to tell.
"And if you had to adapt to the Anglo-Saxon ways."
Actually, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, UBS has doomed her high profits and then disaster: no European financial Institute lost in the jungle around the Subprime as much money as the Schweizer Großbank.
October 15, 2008 was a disaster.
"In the center of the small coalition Government agreed to sedmimilionové the country to the greatest life-saving action in the history of his nation," writes author Lukas Hässig, in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros, approved the politicians to save the bankruptcy standing velkobanku.
How did this happen?
If the talks with the Swiss Bankers, the problem arises mainly in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss velkobank to massive concern.
The Bank, which has already resulted in a merger was too large to small Switzerland-and still further grew.
While allowing that the two different banking predecessor UBS complement each other: one rich, but sleepy Bank in Zurich with a focus in management of assets and the poorer, but internationally more involved.
Suddenly they came internacionalizovaní investment bankers looking to many money, with which they could spin a roulette wheel.
With this rise of UBS are associated with two names: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, the head of the group, UBS and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel are a team of the future," says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, humble, who knows a lot about models and statistics and Ospel, the person managing the feelings around the stomach, which is from Bank of science has developed a completely up."
But Ospel was to end on Wuffliho.
Wuffli and at the end of may has committed crucial errors: "I thought that its models are a reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."

Hungry for growth, invested as the Bank itself and based her Fund to ensure the risks to American Subprime investments.
Developed into a massive machine that securities přebaloval on American mortgage loans and forward further-but he also kept the risks.
Also, when other banks had long sought a way out.
"In the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, UBS bought them, '' says a banking expert Geiger.
How big is the euphoria and deep fall.
One manager behind the other had to leave, when attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
Positions in UBS became a katapultovacím seat and to this day the pick fleas out.
Who leads the velkobanku now has an uncontrollable work.
Must find a strategy for the Bank, all of which are close to the business models were gone.
Banking expert Geiger has had an idea: the end to investment banking, concentration on the administration of the assets, the return of Swiss roots.
Completely so far while (still) doesn't want to go.
But investment banking has strong ubýt, it is now clear.
Next Thursday the Bank wants new boss Sergio Ermotti introduce the world of their future strategy.
the 51-year-old Swiss Italian was seen only as a temporary solution, when surprisingly broke up with predecessor Grübelem.
In the meantime, pushed through: long-term lead business, UBS, said Bank Zürich on Tuesday.

Smart crows are expanding in cities
In many places they are reputed to be the Ravens field for "the problem birds": But of the cities could not long ago these highly intelligent animals out, say experts.
Some like, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: Crows belongs for centuries to the image of the city, yet in some municipalities collect complaints of the dust and noise caused by animals.
While it is not against "troublesome birds" not yet in sight for a resource.
Ravens field probably cannot be expelled from the towns of it, said experts at the first sympóziu of the vránách in the východofríském Leeru.

Critics have called the capture of animals in traps for birds and ubíjení sticks for particularly brutal.
"Normal expulsion, to be habitable, nothing brings", as found in landscapes and artist Werner Klöver from Leeru.
Removal of nests by spraying the water or the felling of trees is often undesirable consequences, he said, also an expert on the environment Manfred Kaiser from Lahru in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are retreating, the large colony is split and distributed to other places."
To be habitable, it is conceivable only as an exception for hospitals, homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, she's gone."
Without the rest of the territory cannot be the problem of cities to deal with, it was the view of the Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leeru.
Exit is the combination of the expulsions of the animals from the sensitive residential areas and their crowd in order to settle down in other places.
"The information board instead of the chainsaws" promoted by contrast, psychologist and etnoložka Uta Maria Jürgens because of the completely different treatment of animals: "One pimple on her face we can finally best withstand the self-assurance."
Mrs. Jürgens co-founded Ascherbergskou in Schleswig-Holstein, a nature trail, to the Crow that provide information board lessons on the life of a highly intelligent Raven field.
The project is said to have already adopted in the meantime.
Also on the criticism of the noise caused by the birds Mrs. Jürgens own opinion: "this is about each volume of communication, they have a lot to say."
Intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: the Ravens field do not only AIDS to achieve the marshmallow immediately, but even as an aid to your tool has compiled.
Researchers from the University of Cambridge has recently tested the behavior of four Ravens field, how far is the intelligence of birds.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that must bring about the collapse of the structure, the stones to get larva Pier.
Without much training, what size and shape of the stone must have, to have caused the collapse of the platform.
In the second attempt to have clever crows then resolve the weaker problem.
In the vertically placed cylinder built a tube with researchers larva Pier.
Beak birds could not achieve on their prey.
However, the researchers placed them pieces of wire.
Of them vytvarovala all four animals, whose use as fish and reel in the tube from the tube for the handle.
Three of the four field Ravens did it even zásekem.

The massacre at the personal level
Emotionally powerful new book Peter Englunda with the name of beauty and sorrow: Confidential history of the first World War (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War) begins with a long list of acting of characters until you make your head spin.
One of the Council, as at the moment keep: Carefully pull this page and make it a bookmark.
All persons in his narrative of Mr. Englunda you very well, and this list will serve as navigation-as a lighthouse-at a time when, like the men and women in the story you feel confused and lost in different situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
It is also the new Assistant at the Swedish Academy, which grants the Nobel Prize for literature.
The book, we talking about here, is very unusual-the author himself describes, quite presciently, as "antihistorickou work".
Includes several well-known names, important contracts or famous battles, on the contrary, in her nearly missing Ambassador, energetic journalists and debates on tactics and equipment.
It's not so much a book about what happened, explains the author as "a book about what it was like." Discusses mainly about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"The beauty and the sorrow" combines the war experiences of 20 more or less common men and women on both sides of the divide, from students and botanists and mountaineers, the doctors, the driver záchranek and officials.
Some of these people become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go mad or die.
Their lives twinkle as the flames of candles candles in the Church-new to be added to the entanglement of the fates, while the other uhasínají.
The book of Mr. Englunda from the classical historical novels are different.
Modifies the idea that the first world war was just God awful zákopových fighting on the Western front.
"The beauty and the sorrow" deftly explores and other places, where there was a war dramas: the Alps, Balkans, Eastern front, Mesopotamia, Eastern Africa.
The soldiers in this book addresses the issues with the fact that they fall bee nest, it must spend Christmas in the shadow of the pyramids or the face with the presence of tse-tse flies.
Almost from the beginning, it's a very touching read.
War will engulf the lives of people like some kind of natural disaster, such as Hurricane Katrina, foul-smelling gunpowder.
When the shooting starts sounding in the distance from the works and you are a woman who is at home with their children, to escape or will you stay?
Who's coming?
Almost no one understands what's going on, or even why the war was rozpoutána.
"The vacuum arising from the lack of facts," noted Mr. Englund, "was filled with guesses, assumptions, expectations, fears, prejudices, konspiračními theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors are."
"The beauty and the sorrow" follows the stories of individuals, such as Florence Farmboroughová, English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are generally are taken from CVS, letters, and other already published materials.
Descriptions of their lives may seem frightening and fascinating, but thanks to the inclusion of small moments and details are perfectly alive and believable.
Many of them discusses the hardships and dealing with him.
In the story of the German students author says: "Substitutes, everywhere the same substitutes."
"A coffee substitute, aluminium imitation, imitation of rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
Goes even further and describes the substitutes meals in Germany.
Mentions "mass manufactured from pressed rice cooked in the morsels of fat (and supplemented by a spoofed bone from wood), tobacco from the dried roots and dried peelings, shoes with wooden soles".
Mentions that there were "837 registered meat substitutes in the production of sausages and 511 registered substitutes coffee."
Some of the stories are about honour and bravery.
One American in me is the internal incentives to the savagery and brutality of war, and declares: "in the end you'll understand that this is human nature. Rather than sit in comfortable chairs with a cigarette and whiskey, the evening newspaper or a good book and pretend that this mask represents civilization and for the Prim I inside is no barbarian. "
On the contrary, a British soldier realizes that with the greatest likelihood of death and nobody would notice, let alone to mourn his passing.
"When you finally accept that the sacrifices, he would at least that this happens before the eyes of grateful audience," he writes.
Instead, however, sounds like "condemned, which secretly to hang".
Other remarks concerning the retirement of old Europe and the advent of new horrors.
"Conflict is increasingly becoming an economic competition and competitive struggle," writes Mr. Englund, "the war between the factories."
He caught it, what he says "a new kind of beast: the emerging century vocal and ideologically professed a serial killer in a dress cut on the peace that their blood is carried out without stood up from the table."
People behave unexpectedly, meanness, alternate with heroism.
Mr. Englund describes soldiers who deliberately sought from prostitutes to catch a venereal disease, in order to avoid service on the queue.
"Nejgrotesknějším an example of this behavior was trading with the gonokokovým the pus that soldiers were buying and they punished his genitals in the hope that ends up in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate it's even in the eye, which is often blinded until the end of life."
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves is prose of Mr. Englunda speedy, but not conspicuous, which, to his great human theme.
In dozens of small outputs captures the way in which war "unleashed a completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, the religious hatred".
People are starting to ask why their leaders to fight.
The best books on the first world war, the majority, rather than a comprehensive narrative work with signs such as "the first world war and modern memory" from Paul Fussella or novels as "quiet on the Western Front" from Erich Maria Remarquea.
Mr. Englund prefers a nekonvenčnímu concept.
His book has the most overwhelming in the end handpainted literature deadlocks.
However, you can't tell.
However, you will feel as if the author suddenly jumped out of the book, you tore a page from the list of heroes from my hand and lit it.
After the previous error, this time to the minute, exactly the scheduled RAID
Involving hundreds of police officers, some in the iron used in street riots.
The night of Monday to Tuesday was chosen because at the time, Zuccotti park should be almost empty.
The action was one of several high-ranking officers. The other was the first to say that this is a exercise.
At the forefront of the action was the Police Commissioner Raymond w. Kelly, whose presence had emphasized how many problems it had to face during the operation Police Department.
They repeated cases of the last few weeks, when, for example, to the use of pepřových spray against demonstrators, thereby infringed the rules of the Department, and a wave of public sympathy poured on the side.
Therefore, the police operation, intended to clean up the park Zuccotti of demonstrators, only launched after two weeks of careful planning and exercises.
Inspired by the leaders of the proběhnuvšími operations in other cities.
A massive exercise in case of conduct in emergency situations was carried out in part of the Randalls Iceland, which was preparing for action in Zuccotti Park.
Leaders of the so-called regulators training for riot-counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of a large number of police officers-focusing on the urban part of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place in Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the river the East River.
Orders to move into the park were literally at the last minute, "said someone who was originally explained only as" exercise ".
"I know a few of the police officers, who were in this action also called upon, and certainly no one said, that goes to the Park Zuccotti," said the person, who spoke only on condition that he remain anonymous.
"That is going to the Park, only a maximum of Zuccotti status of members of the Department."
One of the reason for secrecy was the lesson that the city once was.
October 14 had the leaders of the city in the park to be cleaned, but then stepped back from the plan, because as soon as they heard the demonstrators, many before the start of the operation to the park hundreds of.
Tuesday's action took part in the police officers from different units, including the intervention groups from all over the area-dozens of police officers, who are normally used to strengthen neighborhoods with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day in the Park comes back and leaves a large number of people, so one hour in the night was the ideal time to initiate the action.
"It was appropriate to do so at a time when it will be in the Park, the least of the people," he said.
Than drive out, in order, on the border of Pike Slip, and the Franklin d. Roosevelt Drive, near the bridge, Manhattan Bridge, freight wagons of the contingency units with arc lamps and.
Light and a recorded message from the roaring speakers sotto voce as many protesters are.
When the Park entered the members of law enforcement units in the blue větrovkách, many of the protesters, sbalilo your things and leave.
Police say up to 1: 45 in the morning, without a single tent, which wanted to give protesters time to pack.
Other teams of police officers were seen, as are collected at the edge of the Park, in order to allow enter, if you need to make any arrests.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
The main Police Department spokesman Paul j. Browne, claimed that this was for their safety.
Many journalists, however, is of the opinion that the police wanted to stop to see its troops in action, and in addition to them, some police officers were brutally.
Mr. Browne said that television wagons on Church Street along the western boundary of the Park may have no problem shooting.
Police moved west and her thick tangled personal affairs of protesters, including baggage and plastic bags full of clothes. Behind them was the teams from the Health Department, which immediately gathered all of what's left in the Park.
Some of the demonstrators, who refused to move, they were dragged out of the Park. Documenting the visual materials appeared soon after on the Internet.
Speaking of a group of demonstrators resorted to the vicinity of the kitchen in their camp, which lay near the center of the Park.
Some have set up a roadblock and police launched their methodological arrests.
About ten people in the Centre of the camp are to each other in.
And two people are tied to a tree, said Mr. Kelly.
Have been called members of the emergency services, to přeřízli locks.
Until 3: 30 in the morning in the Park have undergone no arrests, said Mr. Kelly.
The whole operation was completed about 75 minutes later, was the expression of the police.
Mr. Browne said that in the Park approximately 142 persons were arrested.
Most of the arrests took place because of the "Organization of riots and resisting arrest," he clarified.
The most senior police officer on the spot was Joseph j. Esposito, Commander of the Police Department, the highest ranking uniformed officer in the Department.
The operation personally also Phil t. Pulaski, Chief of detectives in the Department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "not concerned with the management of the operation," said Mr. Brown.
The second group of police officers waited along the East side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in the event that would have been necessary to call it needed to be.
On the street to Cortlandt Street, a block north of the Park, and on the street to Pine Street, a block south of the Park, have been erected roadblocks.
From these points, then the police has developed a protective belt even further from the Park Zuccotti.
At one point, police were seen, many of which were equipped with shields, expel a person even further for this limit.
On the northern border was about 28 persons.
The wildest action night took place South of the Park.
Around five o'clock in the morning was seen one demonstrant South from Pine Street, as he jumped on the hood of a police car, and several others, who poured the air from tires of a police van.
At one point, the crowd jumped a piece of plywood.
At the end of the operation was taken to hospital, one police officer and one protester.
Trade Union of auxiliary workers will sue the city because of the release of the
Unions representing hundreds of school ancillary workers who have lost their jobs last month, in the middle of planning to sue the city. Argues that the dismissal was not necessary and it was discrimination, because of the disproportionate impact on schools, visiting the poor students.
Lawsuit is probably the last option, which the unions in the area of District Council 37, in their efforts to reverse the decision on layoffs.
7th October lost work of the six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parent coordinators and other staff, who were among the worst-paid employees of the city. Their release of the leading members of trade unions described as retaliation of the city for him last spring, did not allow access to fund health care managed working teams, by which the city wanted to seal a hole in the budget.
Leaders of the town, this accusation categorically rejected.
At a meeting of the Municipal Council, held last month, said Education Minister Dennis m. Walcott, that the release was part of the budget approved in June.
One of the members of the Council immediately countered that the budget is nowhere specifically was the release of ancillary staff.
Representatives of District Council 37 announced that has already filled in the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of education, that it will be sued. On Wednesday called a press conference, where he formally brought before the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The two defendants were in the process will be Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of education, while the claimant will be eight displaced workers, of which all are African-Americans or Hispanics, as well as most of the other assistants, who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the Legal Department of the city, said that the city had seen action, and therefore the individual accusations will express.
According to the proposal the complaint, which managed to get the New York Times, unions focused on quantities released in the poor parts of town, thus wanted to support his claim of unfair negotiations. Holding the view that the poor schools have more assistants, because they are already long denied adequate financial resources.
They point out that while in the schools in Staten Iceland, nepropouštělo, and in parts of the Upper East Side, Brooklyn, in the part of District 23 in the Brownsville came on the work of 17 school assistants and in parts of the District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx was placed even 46 assistants.
Recalls that in school Public School 36 in Harlem lost work of five of the eight assistants, although this is a school, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty. In the application, says: "it's not about the neighbourhood full of wealthy parents who can procure funds to offset the deficit in the budget."
The budget of the schools Public School 36 this year was reduced by 3,26% and the school also lost money when the city changed the method of calculating the bonus funds for each logged-on a poor student.
In addition, the unions argue that the directors of secondary schools could be confused by the way in which it was written in the document authorizing the release of the parent coordinators.
In the document, it was used to describe the action, the word "excess", i.e., cancel the position, although this word is more often used to describe the movement of teachers from the payroll of the school into a database of available workers, whose salary is paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators have been released," says the draft complaint, "and not only moved into the database on the position of workers."
The mission is over, Congress is ready to adopt an agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, it appears that Republicans and Democrats in Congress agree on something that concerns the rebellion in Libya.
This, however, there had been a revolution succeed, long ruling dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the participation of units of the United States ended.
On Tuesday, the Commission for international relations of the Senate to decide on the terms, which supports the President, John Kerry (mass.), together with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph i. Lieberman (Conn.), in which it should congratulate Libyjcům for their successful rebellion and to thank us troops for "bravery".
"This Declaration we appreciate the courage people of Libya, who began with the conversion of their country," said Kerry.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express support for their democratic aspirations."
The said sentence might appear innocently, but no debate concerning Libya, when the have not been easy.
During the summer, lawmakers from both parties constantly quarrelled among themselves and with the White House on the text of a statement series for approval or rejection of the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduce resolution authorizing limited the use of u.s. armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the House because of the differing views of both political parties, so it is in the Senate, never nehlasovalo.
However, the same day he was in the House, this proposal is rejected, the Chamber rejected the measure, which would stop financing us operations in Libya.
The American Mission in Libya was literally in the legislative purgatory-Congress criticized the way in which President Obama mission control, but its members apparently nedráždilo enough to stop him in his actions.
The hesitancy of the Congress finally ran ahead of the next event.
The rebels conquered Tripoli in August and 20. October was killed by Gadhafi.
Nato's mission officially ended 31. October.
It is now the Senate might be ready to act.
The Commission for international relations in its Declaration "congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and admirable tenacity, which have invested in an attempt to free his people" and "commends the men and women of the armed forces of the United States and their allies, who are involved in the operation of the protection of the Libyan population, for exceptional bravery and professionalism."
In a statement, also "confirms the national interest of the United States on the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Obtains a new proposal from the full support of the Commission for international relations, or legislators once again divided into two halves, as was the case for the approval of the June draft?
Against the last version, built by Senator Richard g. Lugar (IND.), the main representative of the Republican party in the Commission.
Lugarův spokesman on Monday said that the final version of the new proposal has yet seen.
In the House this week to vote on the amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest priority of almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, advocated by Bob Goodlattem (Va), will be the first amendment to the Constitution relating to the budget or any other topic, which will be put to the vote the entire House or Senate.
Other lawmakers, meanwhile, despite substantial efforts to push its proposals to the voting.
Goodlattův proposal is the only one of the 68 amendments to the Constitution, which were presented in the Congress and touched a wide range of different themes.
Some of them were the same-the same proposal submitted by the House of Commons and the Senate-and others are just a minor variation of the other.
Just in the House you can find at least 15 version of the Appendix of the balanced budget and the other a handful who liked to "regulate federal spending."
Some of the proposals are identical, but their supporters-especially beginning with the Republicans, who want to enhance the reputation-can boast of their "autorstvím".
The yield on the regulation of the budget, which was approved in August, would require of the appendix relating to the balanced budget vote, the House of the Senate.
In March 58 senators voted in favour of non-declaration to support the creation of such amendment.
In addition to the budget wants to discuss a few members and limit the number of periods in which could serve the members of Congress, while José e. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods, which may be in the function of the President.
Representative Jesse l. Jackson, Jr. (ill.) offered a number of appendices, which would, inter alia, guarantee the right to quality education and health care.
Permanent banning marriage proposal remains Appendix couples of the same sex as the appendix to prohibit the burning of national flags.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the nullification of federal laws in the event that they will stand up to two thirds of the States.
Although it seems that they are members of the Congress in the design of the various additions to the very active, in comparison with previous years, however, are not significantly from the average.
In the 111. The Congress offered 77 amendments, while in the 100. The Congress there were 66.
Their activity even pales in comparison with the beginning of 90. 20. century, when the members of the Senate, according to the statistics of the library offered every two years, more than 150 additions.
However, they were much more successful than the current politicians.
The last amendment was added-27. Appendix-was ratified in 1992, but in fact Congress was proposed in 1789.
"Beat up, but not slaughtered," says Giffordová in his first TV interview since shooting
Ten months after her from the immediate vicinity of the wounded gunner on a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffordsová (Fla.) on Monday evening, appeared on national television, he sang along with tunes from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that more than a return to the Congress wants to heal.
Giffordsová appeared in the show "20/20" on ABC News with Diane Sawyerovou. It was evident that the formation of sentences in her trouble and needed help.
The whole show has documented its difficult convalescence, which was necessary because of an injury caused by a bullet that penetrated the front of her skull, penetrated the left half of the brain and in the back of her head out.
Three months ago, surprisingly returned to the House in order to triumphantly took part in the vote on from the ceiling.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, during which six people were killed and another 13 were injured, Giffordsová smiling, laughing and singing while his recovery has described as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked him how she feels, she replied jednačtyřicetiletá Giffordsová: "pretty good."
Interview with Giffordsovou and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the one-hour special episode of the show "20/20", which was aired on the eve of the new edition of this book, with the name "Gabby: a story of courage and hope."
Watched the entire Special convalescing Giffordové from the shooting of the 8. January.
On the video, which made Kelly during the first week, you can see the Giffordsová in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across his forehead.
While her husband, could not at that time more than just pick up one or two fingers.
A few months later is captured Giffordsová, sitting in a wheelchair and therapists teach her how to perform simple activities.
Pokývání head.
Vyšpulení lips.
And then, her first word: "what."
In a few days Giffordsová in favour of another word-"toast", when demanded changes in their breakfast.
Video odvysílaná station ABC shows that a central role for the recovery Giffordsové music: Congresswoman on them singing together with the therapist on the melody to the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauperové and "Free Fallin" "by Tom Petty.
During the interview, Giffordová, which is two hours a day therapy, Sawyer revealed some of the day to fire, nothing.
Her husband said that Giffordové read newspaper articles about the shooting to 12. March, when it is the first time she asked who she was six, who was killed in the incident.
From shooting suspect is Jared Lee Loughner, who is detained in a prison in Missoury, where under the influence of forcibly administered drugs is awaiting trial.
"A lot of people have died," she said Giffordsová Calls.
"Horrible, horrible, horrible."
Kelly Sawyer revealed that at one point his wife during convalescence, she said: "I lost."
"So I just said: Gabby, neprohrálas," to describe Kelly.
"You just got beat up.
But you can do it, you put it together and come back even stronger than before. "
Military units are faced with compassion rather than with the respect
The event was galavečerem on Wall Street, that brought millions of dollars for veterans in New York City, who do not have a roof over his head.
Kid Rock sang the Ballad of helplessness, frustration and loss.
Converge around him, hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines.
Formally dressed crowd enthusiastically applauded.
"The men and women serving in the army were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who has hosted the spring benefit.
A festive evening attended, and then Chairman of the Committee of the chiefs of staff. In addition to him on the spot and Admiral Mike Mullen, who saw the role of the military units of a little differently.
"They were all introduced as some of the orphans," the officer wrote in the e-mail.
I'm sure that the organizers thought it was good.
I know that, Yes.
But what I saw did not respect. It was a pity.
Completely the opposite impressions just illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and often aloof, sometimes celebrating the American public.
Army bezbřeze zahrnováno praise for his victims.
But this praise, saying the soldiers.
The public is increasingly acts as if the individuals in uniform.
"We are not at all the victims," said Brigadier General Sean b. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and Afghanistan will soon leave.
"But it seems that the only way some of us can support, is to put us in the role of the unfortunate souls."
This topic is very sensitive for the Army Commander, who don't want to appear ungrateful or spoil the relations with the public which they serve.
Also realize that anger, which had to face troops returning from Vietnam, once was much worse.
The result is that most of the words of the repentance is pronášena quietly and in private among war veterans.
When the two sons of Colonel penzionovaného Mark Canciana were returning from combat actions, where they served as members of the Marine Corps, said their father that their service will be those outside the military watch from two angles.
From the perspective of some will feel the respect and awe, as they defeated the enemy insurgents, and they visited exotic locations.
Other but wondered if "below the surface in hiding bad, violent, a veteran," said Cancian, which participated in the fighting in Iraq, and after his return took place in Washington in the Government.
He claimed that when he was looking for work, so some people who did the interviews with him, subtly suggested that so soon after returning to the fight can resist stress, which is associated with the work in Washington.
"When you talk about your service, you have to count with negative responses," said Cancian their sons.
The army's concern stems from the American indifference to the wars.
Success on the field of battle rarely gets recognition in the country, which has its own army just a little awareness and in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is only a few of his own benefit.
"As a nation have already nevážíme the army's heroism as was common during the second world war," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded us troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the recognition on the part of politicians and the public focus on the suffering of men in arms.
The soldiers are vyznamenáváni for the number of actions, which endured, the multitude of friends, which they lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The army is facing growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, will decide whether to start the process of 28 women and men against the army for alleged inaction in the case of rape.
If not, they are prepared to take action to the hundreds of other plaintiffs.
Private first class Elizabeth Lymanové was at night, when she was allegedly raped by his colleague from the army for 25 years and was at 11. week of pregnancy.
It happened in October 2008 and she was pointing to the barracks at the Miramar air base North of San Diego. After dinner with a friend on his male colleague bearing box of 12 beers.
He asked her if it can connect that with her in the room might hang.
"In my head I light came on warning light," described by Lymanová.
But the native Texan its objections ignored completely.
I thought: no, he's 19.
"It is from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
Claims that only a few minutes after they went to her room, the man walked over, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, 18. November 27, Lymanová and other existing or former members of the army, to wait for the verdict hearing which could have a historical impact. It will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it goes on, whether the charges against the former Minister of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald may fail, he gets up before the Court.
The indictment States that Gates and Rumsfeld have fallen short in the fight against the spread of rape in the military, which is in contradiction with the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The indictment was filed in February of a Washington lawyer, Susan Burkeovou, and the claimant was at that time the 17 members. During the following months, however, their number has grown to 28-25 women and three men who all claim they were raped or otherwise sexually attacked by their colleagues in the army and that the army after the notification of these útků failure in the investigation, punishment and any pursuit for justice.
Burke contends that the neck the most senior commanders of the army, because the problem starts with them.
"The army's direktivním system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent the pursuit of the imposition of measures against such action? The high command. "
Burke also asserts that since February has contacted at least 400 other survivors, many of them could be included in other lawsuits filed in the future.
Its strategy: rather than gathering all the charges in this case-packed all eggs in one basket, as she says-an application in several different cases, if needed, to pressure nepolevil.
A team of Defense Ministry of defence leads State representative of the United States Neil MacBride, which together with its collaborators initiative to reject the case.
Judicial documents, which won the Newsweek, are discussing a strategy of defence in detail-in principle, that current or former soldiers, the army cannot sue for injuries suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to the regulation of the Supreme Court from 1950 called as the Feres Doctrine, the Federal Government is not responsible for the injuries will suffer from the soldiers in active service.
"The alleged injuries relating to military service, the complainant," it says in the document.
The Defense Ministry refused to comment on this issue.
However, things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women still officially not serve in combat, it's just semantics: in modern wars can be hard to find a course that is the line.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have played teams of female soldiers increasingly more pronounced role, particularly in the area of communication with civilian women occuring in a war zone.
Result: between the wars was 150 soldiers of the female sex-two-thirds of them directly in combat.
Now is the time to have been modernised and in the army, "explains Burke.
In my fight is not alone. In addition to her case dealing with three other legal representatives.
The law school Yale prepare visitors veteránského seminars on the legal service of the action on the four main military Academy for developing atmosphere promoting hatred for women.
Irrespective of the non-profit organization American Vietnamese veterans gather supporting documents for their action aimed against the army. This action focuses on the diagnosis of "personality disorders", which was supposedly established for victims of rape to the army a pretext to their release, according to activists, such as Ana Bhagwatiová belonging to a group of human rights activists Service Women's Action Network, this is a perfectly normal practice.
Her group already in December filed a proposal for action against a State Organisation for negotiations with the veterans, which he accuses of discriminatory practices, which should occur in the processing of requests for help from the people who claimed to have been in the service of sexually infected.
In Congress, presented nine separate proposals, which has made the Group of Senators and members of Parliament from both political parties, and proposed a number of remedies in those measures.
According to the Office for the prevention and resolution of sexual violence, the Ministry of defense was in 2010 reported 3 158 sexual attacks.
This type of attacks remains, however, in most cases, wanders in the Pentagon's own estimates, this number is approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated number of 19 000 incidents occurring in a given year.
In a report issued in March is dismantled and the rate of criminal prosecution of the suspects: in 2010, the Court received 20 percent of the cases reported in the army-which is half compared to the civilian judicial system.
Prosecutors in the case of the Deputy Burkeové describe the attacks as just the first of a series of traumas.
Private first class Lymanová, for example, reported the alleged rape of a military police less than an hour after it was to follow.
During the night, he says, was asked to give details about his rape repeated eleven times to various members of the police, physicians, and commanders.
Underwent all the tests necessary to determine rape and her bed was found the attacker's blood-from the, which he has done on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, graduated from Lymanová hearing before a judge, during which it considered issues relating to that on the day of the attack she loved with her boyfriend.
It ordered six persons as witnesses on the reputation of the spoke in favour of the alleged offender, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day when a sentence," says Lymanová.
"I had the feeling that right there on the spot, shouting," Ellie-I ran out of the courtroom. "
"Put me to a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember that I was his commanding officer said: it wasn't his court. Was mine. "
Lymanové--visit a military psychiatrist, which it eventually diagnosed personality disorder, making her as unfit for duty.
In January 2010 she was from the army without honor and therefore not eligible for výsluhu released.
Whatever the case, the applicants ' Lymanové and other moves to the next phase or not, it's run on the long track, says John Turley, Professor of law at the Law University of George Washington.
However, he notes, "from my point of view, should be able to refer to other phases of consultation."
Between them and indeed, however, is the doctrine that has been criticized since the first time she saw the light of the world.
I am a lifelong critic of the doctrine of Feres Doctrine.
The military is decades behind, because their duties do not indicate to the same level of motivational incentives and deterrent devices.
He adds: "the odds are heavily against them. .. but it is important for them to try."
To change occurs only when the good people are willing to fight.
If it is not in the hearing decided in their favour, Burkevoá, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, collected hundreds of other people ready to take action and begins work on other causes relating to this topic.
"We are with the army to fight on this issue, where there is no reform," he says.
Or until we die, whichever comes sooner.
Walls have eyes: how scientists are exploring on Facebook
Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, was just another young man his anti-immigrant views presented on the Internet.
On Monday, the Braivik, who confessed to killing červencovému rage, after which left in Norway 77 dead, attended her first public court hearing.
Although Breivik to act alone, not lonely in cyberspace, certainly: during the preparation of the attack, he spent a lot of time at the computer, chatoval with some of the millions of nationalists supporting the right-wing groups on social networks.
The tragedy of this summer, the scientists want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy-just go to Facebook.
"We realized that to get it, it's not really that difficult," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of the recently released report of the British research team, which concerned the European digital populism.
Supply of personal information on Facebook is so comprehensive, says Bartlett that the scientists enough to simply take advantage of advertising on the pages and with absolute precision to determine the demographic you are looking for a group, something they do public relations workers for years.
Bartlett's team across Europe found half a million fans, right-wing groups, whereupon they focused attention and sent them the ads. However, instead of through their enchantments to the newly created group or offer them some dietetic products, urged them to fill in a questionnaire in which were questions relating to the level of their education, the relationship to violence and optimism due to their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans 14 various right-wing groups in 11 European countries-without ever having to leave the Office.
"It's a whole new way of conducting research," observes Bartlett.
Some of the results are not so surprising: on-line supporters of right-wing groups are mostly young men, which let him get to the growing rate of immigration.
But on the other hand, "those who its on-line activism combined with off-line activism are more sensible, more democratic and less násilničtí than those who remain constantly hiding behind the screen of a computer."
The work team of the DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new instrument in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health professionals, scientists and political scientists use these pages to study everything from health issues to social trends hiding status updates, news on the walls and pressed the buttons "I like it".
Facebook says more than 800 million active users. Each day, on average, provide three different data, which from this social network is literally "the information Supernova", which stands for the development of many new research. The number of academic theses, in whose name contains the word Facebook, increased as compared to the situation five years ago, to nearly 800%.
For some of the scientists is the magic of Facebook, it gives them the possibility to study the people, without having to bother somewhere on the street.
"Previously, if you wanted to conduct a survey among people from the British national party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You would have to get to the party, but you would never allow this" says Bartlett.
"All this Facebook hooked up-just go directly to them."
Others argue that the page can offer a way to identify the socio-medical problem and avoid them.
In a recent study, Dr. Megan Morenové of the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that college students who discussed their drunken outputs on Facebook, they were much more vulnerable to the problem of alcoholism than students who were silent about this topic.
Morenová proposes that the peers page monitoring and students came in with an offer to help the student who publish too many drunken forms.
"The problem can be solved if you can't diagnose him," said the Washington Post, Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Morenové and the Director of the Center for health, behavior, and development of children in the children's Research Institute in Seattle.
"We found a way to identify at-risk children that we did not have a chance to appear."
Facebook alone constantly sonduje the data of its users.
The information team pages prepared by the statistics relating to the context and the forms of relationship, of St. Valentine's day, voter turnout in 2010, and the coefficient of satisfaction of the people (mainly with the use of the information to which they had access-Internet freedom advocates have long claimed that the page should have their information available for research, and the treasure of the other).
But Facebook users know that the page is monitored, whether they like it or not-in exchange for the ability to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, it should be a page to provide your personal information.
But what if Facebook users to become part of the research, which they don't even know?
Scientists have clearly-defined rules on how to collect data off-line. On-line data, however, are accessible to everyone.
"I think most users would even scientists can look into their profile," says Neil Selwyn, London Knowledge Lab, the sociologist, a study in 2006, which was carried out with the use of public facebookových the walls of their students.
"When it came to them, so that the information is only between them and their friends."
Then also consider the question of methodology.
Even when off-line research, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
Facebook is not possible to check, how much of the information on the profile and contributions on the wall.
"What do you say on Facebook, and what do you do outside of Facebook, they are two quite distinct things," says Selwyn.
That is why you Selwin, who spent long years, research new technologies, he thinks that the pencil and the notebook remain the best possible tool that can be used in research.
"When you go into the real world and you're talking to real people, it's something that can't be replaced, '' he says.
"Social research should be about the company and social activities-and the hell a lot of social activity still takes place off-line."
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik participates in his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to planning the two attacks, during which it was this summer in Norway killed 77 people, during his first public court hearing in Oslo himself described as the "warrior" the resistance ".
"I'm a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian Templar Knight," he said before the Court, where 500 people gathered.
"I object against the Court of Justice, because the mandate you have granted the organization promoting the ideology of hatred, and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I confess to their acts, but I'm admitting to nothing for them to blame."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivika during this she said, because "he didn't want to give Breivikovi the opportunity that this hearing was used as a platform from which he could preach his views."
For the same reason he refused to Breivikovi, who brought a speech prepared, at the end of the hearings to address the relatives of their victims.
Nesheim also ordered police to Breivika held in custody another 12 weeks, his has banned any contact with the media for 4 týnů and announced that the final authorities for a period of eight weeks, full control over all of its visits and all merge.
The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives of victims and survivors.
Some come in the hope that Breivikovi will be able to look into the eyes of others, therefore, to ensure that it is kept tightly under lock and key.
They all attended in order to move the case to a speedy conclusion.
"I thought it looked cool and simply," said komentátorovi, one of the survivors of the attack NRK.
"It was not pleasant, but for myself I can say that after what I saw and heard the suspect, I mentally pushed back a little bit farther."
Breivik, in a dark suit and blue tie, he remained calm throughout the hearing and professional. On arrival and departure of the building without regard present žurnalistům and surviving in the eyes.
Despite the bizarre idea that Breivikově is part of a larger movement "resistance," judge naznal that is not crazy, and noted that there is no evidence that he had any accomplices.
For someone may be the consolation that the attacks of the 22. June appear to be the work of a single group of extremists and not radicals.
However, it automatically does not diminish the grief and confusion, which are still in the minds and hearts of the entire nation.
"I wish you to fell like a monster, but it is not so," said the relative of one of the victims.
"If Yes, everything is much simpler."
7 lessons from a lost interview with Steve Jobsem on in the movie to theaters this week
As soon as Steve Jobs 5. October died, began to discover the views of people who compared with Henry Ford-and chose him for his genius, the greatest modern inventor.
The recently re-invented Jobsově conversation, which was oprášen for a special film, who's heading to theaters this week, it will be for all the Apple fans, the fact that his creative mind perfectly understand business processes and work flows for standing behind its products.
He was an idealistic and hip, a member of the self-proclaimed hippie, but also pedantským the organizer and the man who every detail coordinates to the smallest detail-he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer from "the idea that it is actually a great idea from 90 percent of their work. [but] a great idea and excellent end product is still a long way to bite work. "
In 1995 he worked for Bob Cringely on the TV show, the triumph of the sighting, which dealt with the dawn of the personal computer. During the filming took place, more than an hour of conversation.
At the time, had already been ten years since he was forced to leave Jobs Apple, and he had his hands full with his new computer company NeXT, and impatiently looking how the general public will take the internet.
In the TV show was eventually used a short part of the whole Cringelyho interview and on the original copies of the interview was rumored that lost in the transfer.
Shortly after Jobsově death, however, the VHS copy found in the režisérově garage.
It is this material, slightly sestříhaný, forms the basis of 68minutového slide, Steve Jobs: the lost interview, which is heading into selected theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who was famous for his reluctance to provide more Jobs for the talks here is surprisingly enthusiastic, that thus on its technological philosophy and business strategies.
And it also shows a very thoughtful man.
Four times during the interview, between question and answer there is a longer pause-10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when you can see how the Jobs the answer perfectly considers that what that describes you and accurate as possible.
There are also moments when the surface of the leaves when perfectionism Jobsův Cringelyho matters is impatient, and popohání him to quickly get to important issues and topics.
The interview was filmed before the era of Pixaru, iPod or iPhonu and appear in it frighteningly prophetic ideas, Jobs, evaluate what others are doing society good and bad, and offers his own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
One thing is actually reading a posthumous assessment Jobsovy career, but on the Jobs, which we see here as rewarding the dreamer in the flowering of his genius, is something raw and inspiring.
Has his own vision of how a case can and should look like.
It didn't take long, and after his thoughts, he also put into practice.
A quick summary of the seven scenes from the lost interview ", which certainly is worth noting:
How to learn to drive enterprise:
"During the years of business, I always asked: why are you doing this? and the answer was always the same: No, it just does. "
No one knows why he does what he does, never on matters relating to the business, not in depth.
I found out.
Liposuction continues that describes its efforts to simplify the accounts in the company Apple.
He was totally confused of how they have been recorded costs-often begin with the word "standard cost", the amount thereof could only imagine. At that moment he decided to go their own way-has developed an automatic tool which guarantee that they could trade costs determine during the fly.
How did prank to the Pope:
Jobs remembers the "Blue box", which was built by Steve Wozniakem-a device that people give effectively hack into the phone company and free call anywhere in the world.
On the device, it was written in the past, but already many Jobsovo enthusiasm, when Blue box describes as an instrument of power, is contagious.
Tells how to Wozniakem have tested the device using the paid phone, and during a call to let the transfer from one network to another, while Wachovia to reap the greatest possible number of satellites.
"At least we like this way furtively through it belonged in circles around the world, so when we then shouting something to the paid phone, there's a minute later from another phone at the door," says Jobs.
"We were young and we have found that they can build a thing, which is able to manage the infrastructure for billions of dollars around the world."
Alone we made a tiny little thing that could control a much larger giant-it was an incredible experience and I never emerged without her Apple.
Jobs continues the description of a joke, which with Wozniakem almost dragged to the end. Through the Blue box in the middle of the night, they called to the Vatican and asked about whether it would be able to speak with the Pope, with the best flying Henry Kissinger.
Gradually drafted the increasingly above the status of members of the Catholic Church in the middle of the night to talk with an American diplomat, and only just before i woke up to the phone itself, the Pope, with a pair of rozchechtala and the receiver.
How to be in love with technology (and was on the phone with Bill Hewlettem):
When he was 12 and looking for spare parts, so that he could build a-, found in the phone book number on the Bill Hewletta and called him.
Not long after their 20minutovém the conversation already had Jobs provided in the summer a brigade of Hewlett-Packard Company.
"Incredibly influenced me. It was the only company that I knew at the time, and shaped my views on it, what kind of company is and how to treat their employees. "
Jobs later became one of HP employees who visited the corporate research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
He was as big as a trunk, CRT monitor, and I immediately fell in love with him.
As a teenager I'm HP went higher and higher, fooling around, and he began writing programs for it.
What's making the upgrade:
Several Jobs during the interview, he speaks about how to invent new products at runtime.
In the early days of his career, when he went to sell a couple of plates with printed circuit boards, one customer asked to forge together a whole computer.
Available only 30 paid days during which he had to invent, assembled and delivered the finished device.
If it was later in the company of Apple, recalls the problems faced in the development of the computer mouse:
"I remember how we were quite a wild fight. .. they shouted at me, it would take five years [build a mouse, which would cost US $ 300] when I got tired, I went outside and found a designer."
About 90 days later, we were able to produce a perfectly reliable mouse for $ 15.
How big companies there is breath:
Long before he led the revival of Apple, Jobs carefully predicted that many industrial leaders in their vision of the zakolísá and lose market share.
"Let's say that you work for the companies IBM, or Xerox, so you better copier or printer, and what's next?"
Do you have a monopoly on the market, so the company company cannot be successful.
At the moment it is sales and marketing, so companies šéfují the people who have to worry about this, as people have to worry about their own products are vyšachováni from the decision-making process.
Technological genius who led the company to its unassailable position, is now replaced by people who have no idea about the good or bad products-skill and technical knowledge are necessary.
That's exactly what happened in the Xerox ...
Xerox could have literally the entire computer industry.
Could be 10 times bigger than it is, could be Releases of the 1990s.
However, instead of the victory zadělali on failure.
Taking innovation as a form of art:
"Between a great idea and excellent end product is still a long way and a lot of work ... and what a great idea evolves, so changing and growing."
During that time, you'll learn a lot about him.
You must agree to the entire series of compromises-certain things just electrons, glass, robots or factories do to do either.
You must have in mind constantly 5 000 things-the different concepts-and put them together.
Finally, depends on the taste-you're trying to think of the best thing that humanity has called into being, and in a certain way, is trying to reflect on what they are doing.
Picasso said that good artists are copied, but the best artists steal.
I have never been ashamed of it, that I'm the best ideas to burgle.
The company was so amazing, and the Macintosh successful, therefore, that the people who work in it, they were excellent musicians, poets, artists, naturalists, historians and coincidentally at the same time also the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren't for computers and new technologies could be amazing in all other sectors.
Scalia and Thomas were having dinner with the opponents of the law on health care, at a time when their case in court
On the day when the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether to accept an objection against the law on health care, President Obama, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended the gala dinner sponsored by the legal firm, which will be before the Court participate in the negotiations.
The event occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the proposals.
One of the cases to be discussed was action by 26 States of discrediting the radical revision of health care, which last year approved by the Congress-a law which mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed that the proceedings be heard. In March, however, expects a 5-hour negotiations whose outcome still more unsettling the presidential elections, which are scheduled for 2012 and at the time of issue of the decision will be in full swing.
A lawyer, who stands before the Court of Justice and will seek to achieve the rejection of the law, will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as Attorney General of the United States under George w. Bush.
Clementova law firm PLLC, Bancroft, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner, the Federalist Society, a group that has long been engaged in the defense of conservative legal principles.
Another company which has sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations, the law, the so-called zpochybňujících. The National Federation of independent business.
Another sponsor of the was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., for which they are in the process of huge financial resources are at stake.
The dinner took place in the Washington Hotel several hours after the debate on the topic of the case.
He participated, among other, Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate and endorsed by the opponents of the law on health care.
And the placing of guests? Scalia and Thomas.
It's not new: this pair of judges with the actions of the Group participating in the Federalist Society for years.
And certainly it's not about anything, it would be contrary to the rules of ethics.
In fact, these justices relieved of the obligation to respect principles of behaviour, which are subject to a lower federal judges.
If it does not, however, would be their behaviour include: under the principle of the C4, which says that "a judge may participate in the actions, which are related, and other organizations in order to obtain funds, however, the judge must not be speaker, guest of honour, nor must it be placed on the programme of action."
However, the relationship Scalii and Thomas to two legal firms cast in the case, and also a company with a huge financial interest in this case, richly enough alerted the activists calling for ethics in Government.
"This shocking breach of ethics and indifference to the code behavior is contrary to the claims of several judges of the Supreme Court, acting under the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the organisation of the Common Cause.
"The judges were drinking and having dinner on the societal benefit, together with legal representatives, who are waiting to discuss your case before the Court."
Their presence and assistance in obtaining funds through this action undermines the legs of all claims to the cast, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas to his critics have demonstrated little understanding and told them that they also seamlessly combine their judicial duties with the actions of groups, such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas wife Ginni is a highly built a conservative activist.
Moreover, the Conservatives argue that the ethical issue has mainly judge Elena Kaganová and not Scalia and Thomas.
Kaganová worked as the General Prosecutor for the Government of President Obama, when he first appeared before the Court arguments against the law.
Critics of the Kaganové of her pushing to renounce participation in the case, and argues that if so many fought for the law to now be disinterested.
Kaganová not given any indication that she was about to resign.
Boeing gained a record contract on the jet aircraft worth US $ 18 billion
The Emirates airline ordering 50 dvouuličkových Jet Boeing 777 with options to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner airline Aman Air, which collected more than $ 1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 units of their products, most of it there is no reason to celebrate.
However, if the company aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the price of these 50 aircraft is a record-high US $ 18 billion, it's something else.
As well as important news is that, where Boeing won the contract: the Middle East, an expanding gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to the forecast issued on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will be in the next 20 years, need 2 520 aircraft worth $ 450 billion.
The Boeing Company announced over the weekend its largest order in the history of the dollar value of commercial aircraft-50 dvouuličkových Jet Boeing 777.
Sensational order came from the airline Emirates located in Dubai.
The Boeing Company at the fair 2011 Dubai Air Show said that the airlines have the option of purchasing a further 20 aircraft, thereby making the total value of the contract climbed to US $ 26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced then that the airlines, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, sometimes also called as the Dreamliner, which boasts significantly better fuel consumption and facilities for passengers.
The total price that these six aircraft exceeds $ 1 billion.
"This is an excellent report for the entire company, Boeing," said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these specific customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East is that the peoples of the oil-based producer.
This means that not only have the money to pay for the aircraft, but the increase in fuel prices-usually affecting the airlines, because of some of its largest cost-is not so critical, because the country itself at higher oil prices makes.
This is important, because they are not as likely as other airlines likely to cancel or postpone orders for aircraft because of the increase in the price of fuel, "says Dihora.
"They have a natural protection," he says.
Order from the airline company Emirates strengthens leading position on the market for Boeaing aircraft with a fuselage and fed into the narrow company Airbus SAS, which wanted to try to disrupt the dominance of Boeing with its transport model of the A321 is bigger than.
Victory to Boeing comes four months after the representatives of the company Airbus announced that the transposition of the first flight of their largest A321 is bigger than an aeroplane which is a direct competitor of the aeroplane 777-300ER.
To unhinge because customers demand greater utility to load aircraft and range, therefore, took the manufacturer time to deliver greater power engine engine.
The price action of Boeing Co rose 1.5% to $ 67,94.
Sister of Mexican President was apparently in the michoacánských election slaughtered
Luisa Maria Calderonová says that her opponent, Faust Vallejonovi from PRI, helped in the hunt for drug traffickers guvernérským Chair.
It seems that the sister of Felipe Calderona in violent state elections for the post of Governor in Michoacánu lost. On Monday, then declared that one of its opponents to victory dopomohli drug traffickers.

Party, the PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when the Presidency came in.
However, plans to return to power and the victory in the elections in Michoacánu is an important step in this effort.
Party, the PRI hopes that also prevails in July presidential elections.
It seems that Vallejo defeated Calderonovou, the day before the election, just very close.
Calderonová, candidate for the Conservative Party of their brother's National Action Party, or PAN, has refused to recognise as the winner of the Vallejona.
Third placed Silvana Aureolis, candidate for the left-wing party called the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which up to now had control of the Governor. For rozhádanou and pitch side pursued it before the presidential election in 2012, a very unfortunate defeat.
Aureoles also refused to accept preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, former Mayor of the capital city of the State on behalf of Morelia, of any relations with drug dealers and other candidates for certification encourages the results.
Michoacán has been long dominated by the drug cartels specializing on marijuana, heroin and metamfetaminy.

ADB Bank calls on Asia to help save the euro area
Bank, Asian Development Bank, called on China and India, in order to be prepared to help with the rescue of the euro area before its serious debt crisis, otherwise it could be to the overall decline in the world economy, which would have a negative impact on the growth of economies in Asia.
Rajat Nag, ADB Director-General of the Bank, based in Manila, said the two fastest growing economies in the world must "do everything in their power" to assist in the rapid recovery of monetary bloc through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements.
Warned that the States of the Group of the Bric [Brazil, Russia, India, China] all European problems are "too calmly," and said that the Asian financial assistance in combination with the European leadership and resources will help to defuse the prolonged collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So it is useful to anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis," he said during the interview for the Financial Times on the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia is, perhaps, to a certain extent protected, but is certainly not immune."
"So, if China and India can help, they should do it."
European monetary Association is already several months severely tested when a major debt crisis.
In recent days, borrowing costs have risen dangerously Italy and the Government of Italy and Greece, have withdrawn.
The growing debt crisis in Europe raised fears that it could download again the world economy into recession, and began appearing to call the newly thriving leading economies together and helped the euro area to find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that all the Asian support will be routed through the IMF, but noted that the mutual assistance-such as buying bonds Fund financial assistance of the European Union, institutions for the European financial stability-the Asian partners of European countries provided more negotiating options.
Anand Sharma, Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do what he can," to help the euro area because its own economy now suffering a downturn in exports and vyschnutím to the influx of foreign capital.
"Nobody wants to be the euro area remained unstable and restless," he said.
"We are faced with a difficult task and we need to maintain a high growth rate."
"It's not about an alternative, it is a hard fact, because how else could we find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that emerging economies, such as the Indian, they assist European economies when they are forced to face its own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, Professor at Brown University in the US, he said that it would be politically very difficult to explain the assistance for Europe 1.2 billion population of India, 800 million of them live on $ 2 or less per day.
"One could see that the Greeks goes to retire at 50 and enjoy the beaches, which would have them it's hard to explain," he said.
Lee Howell, Director-General of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why they should be Indian stocks used to keep them well paid employment, many Greek citizens in poorly managed and loss-making sectors, such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the euro-zone crisis threatens "the dangerous domino effect".
The Bank forecast that in Asia between the years 2011/2012 to 7,5% economic growth, now faces the "risk of decline" due to European threats.
He said that the vulnerable emerging markets it must create "plans for unforeseeable expenditure", to be protected from fall and significant outflow of capital from their economies.
The warning from the Pentagon about possible cuts in the field of defence
Defense Minister Leon Panetta on Monday in Congress get put under the boiler, when warned that the looming automatic budget cuts may undermine national security and cause financial chain reaction beginning in the Pentagon and continuing across the battlefield in Afghanistan to civil assembling lines.
The Pentagon will have to so spend the budget reduction of $ 450 billion over the next ten years, but now fears a reduction of a further US $ 600 billion, if Congress fails to conclude an agreement relating to the expenditure.
"The impact of such cuts would be devastating for the whole resort," Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, of Arizona, and Lindsey Graham 's, South Carolina.
He said that the inability of Congress to reach agreement on the budget and the resulting so-called attachment causes 23% flat-rate decrease and stop many new projects.
"Because of the way the huge reduction in use by this ill-judged way, it is not possible to carry out most of our building or ship's projects-you can't buy only three quarters of the buildings or ships. In addition, would result in serious damage to the other modernisation efforts, "Panetta wrote senators.
"We are Also forced to separate many of our civil servants, and, since the reduction take place so rapidly, we also have to almost certainly civilians sent to compulsory leave, to be able to fulfill the requirements of the target."
"These changes can shatter the faith of those who take care of our army and seriously impair its readiness."
Finally, the cuts to affect the combat units, said Panetta.
"Although the accounts for the financing of possible war operations overseas, these obstávka directly affect the operation, will be adversely affected by substantial changes in the other budgets," said Panetta.
"The cuts even in the contractual personnel, which will result in the delay of negotiated contracts that support the war efforts of our people."
"Reduced the statuses of paid employees, of which will flow and delayed payments to vendors and the subsequent disruption of legal and political aid."
The two Senators wrote off the Panettovi ten days ago and asked him about the details regarding the possible impacts on the automatic spending cuts in the Ministry of defence.
"The consequences of the obstávky at the Ministry of Defense could cause rapid degradation of the United States as a world military power."
"We are strictly against this tough measures," senators announced in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when make Panettův letter.
"It is not the conclusion that we could live, and it is certainly below we do not sign."
"The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not let that happen."
"Remains to be seen whether the Panettův letter and a fresh warning to increase pressure on Congress approving the budget and will reinforce the voices calling for the Pentagon's omission from the list of cuts.
Panetta was recently in talks on possible cuts to the increasingly more open, although he switched to his high position in the Pentagon with long years of experience with the approval of the budgets of Congress and the White House, so he knew that the real fight.
At a press conference organised by the minutý week Defense Minister suggested a brief image of what the resort waiting-the shell of the military, inside which, however, will miss the core.
"It will be like a ship without Marines."
"It will be like a Brigade without ammunition."
"It will be like the air force without trained pilots."
"It will be like a paper tiger, such as army barracks, buildings and bombs without a sufficient number of trained soldiers who could complete the mission," said Panetta at the beginning of the speech at the Pentagon.
"It will be as a unit without morality, unprepared and unable to cope with a possible enemy."
"As a result, it will be welcomed aggression."
In the annex supplied with the letter Mccain and Graham's Panetta specifies how the reduction will have resulted in "significant operational risks: late response to the crises, conflicts and disasters; significant limitations on the drops is this and deployment throughout the world; implied an unacceptable risk in future combat operations. "
Panetta also said that some of the biggest defense projects could wait for termination, including those, which are already being tested, even those that are only in the early stages of planning.
On the list, for example, the project, the planned new aircraft F35 bomber, ballistic submarines of the new generation, new coastal combat ship and new ground combat vehicle, which wanted the army and Marine Corps to replace the humvee.
Stopping the further development and testing of the aeroplane F35 would save over the next ten years to $ 80 billion, but its proponents argue that it is a necessary next step in the improvement of the military, which is important for the country to deal with possible threats from China and other rivals.
How to tell a lie
A cursory glance at the recent newspaper headlines suggests, how serious and pervasive lies and deception in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has his hands full with accusations that he sexually molested several women-both parties claim that the other is lying.
Administrators at the University of Penn State were accused of perjury, though they tried to hide the records that a retired football coach of sexually attacking a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been caught, how running a microphone says US President Barracku Obama, that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
A lie can destroy the career and zacloumat stability of many countries.
New York Congressman Anthony Weiner and Internet flasher making fool has published information that was immediately refuted by the unquestioned evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was charged that exploited the finances of his campaign in order to conceal his illegitimate attempted ratio.
And no one would never forget the media circus, which tore around Bill Clinton, when he lied during the second period, in function of their sexual relation with Monica Lewinsky.
Everywhere, with stories about cheating in school and at the University.
There are cases where teachers give themselves their students test answers, just to look good in their studies.
Mentoři who should learn to the contrary, they send a message that a lie and deception is acceptable.
How many scams are occurring?
Studies show that in one single day lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Suppose that many of them are full of lies.
Another study showed that foreign people in the first 10 minutes of the first meeting in my life lied three times.
Determining the lies, or "detection of lie" is the necessary skills that you should acquire each, whether from personal or work reasons.
It is, however, no social game, which would be similar to, say, a Charade, when a man screams: "I got you". Detection of deception is a serious science industry working with scientific data collected during the last six decades in prestigious universities in the course of detailed research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of research is that most of the old myths about the lies has been refuted.
Liar you can look in the eye.
It's not that zadrhávali, koktali, blush or ošívali.
However, the nevyvozujte of it, that it is somehow difficult to detect liars espy and.
Trained the lies he can reveal the truth of the sentence structure, small expressions on his face, the way of creating questions and their timing.
I spent several years collecting scientific knowledge of the extensive and developing sectors related to the detection of lies and it is clear that detecting deception is a modern skills, which can be easy to learn, and in today's complex world, you can help-especially if your responsibilities include hiring, arranging interviews, negotiation or leadership.
The good liar can read in the other, they are still wary, direct their emotions and intuitively realize, as the other party accepts.
From research we know that extroverti is a lie more often than introverti men making more "adopted by" lies, while the women say more lies "aimed at the other"-mostly because to protect someone's feelings-that married people lie less often their partners than single people (but the lies that they are usually "outrageous").
Also, we know that if you are perceived as a sinner, the others feel less guilty when you're lying.
How do I know that someone is lying?
First, watch the normal behavior of the body.
This is called "initial observations."
Thanks to him, will have a subsequent findings with what to compare.
Note the posture the body, its funny, work with your voice.
You should know, if someone normally taps his feet constantly, you wrongly accused of lying only because the middle of the meeting starts tapping his feet.
Then try to determine the clusters of false verbal and neverbálního behavior.
Consider it, however, only as warning signals, not as evidence of the lies.
People speaking a lie may stop to move the upper half of the body, as he tries to remember his made-up story, the toes bend over to get to the door, to the East, significantly change the posture or make known "relief after the end of the interview"-an a great relief it and change the position, when is a difficult confession for them.
The people conducting the interviews are often issue a false signal that the interview is over, just to see how it will look like a relief after completion.
Also feel the body language.
Famous is a story about how Scott Peterson once slipped and used the last time when he argued that the murdered woman is alive, which began a nationwide search for her body.
Klamající individuals may also express coldly: "I had no sexual relationship with that lady ... Miss Lewinsky" or difficult question of all be repeated.
The most common verbal characters are only very slight.
Anyone can use a lot of "zmírňujícího language" when answering a difficult question: "well ... to be honest ... from what I know ... According to the best of my knowledge."
In fact, such a reply too know and often regards the other warning signal.
There is no magic, which would reveal any lie, but it is possible to learn the skills, by means of which we can lie down.
Using these skills will have one more chance, that in his personal work and buys a liar and to the phisher.

In the Centre, to be appointed the new Italian Government
Appointed by the President of the Government of Mario Monti will meet tomorrow with the Italian President, introduced him to a new Government that will face a crisis that this country to the brink of economic disaster.
Appointed by the President of the Government of Mario Monti will meet tomorrow with the Italian President, introduced him to a new Government that will face a crisis that this country to the brink of economic disaster and which put into danger the entire euro zone.
The Presidential Palace issued a report in which he announced that Monti, appointed in Sunday, will meet Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that it can form a Government.
It is expected that the present Government, composed mostly of technocrats, although so far it is not clear when the new Government takes power.
Monti said he will present to the President the results of their talks, which led to the political parties in an attempt to create a Government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner, told journalists.
Monti said explicitly that he will be able to form a Government, but the tone of his comments suggested that obstacles are overcome.
"The framework is now well marked," he added.
Monti has completed the process of creating a Government in less than three days, in a much shorter time than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to fight against the political and financial crisis, for which the amount of the debt has soared to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Montim must approve a tough package of austerity measures required by the European leaders. Only in this way will it be possible to restore the credibility of Italy is way off.
The Monti is developed much pressure to hurry. Because of the instability of the markets have exceeded the interest from Italian bonds with a ten-year maturity BTPS 7 percentage threshold level, when Greece and Ireland have had to seek rescue.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian employers ' organisation Confindustria, said after the meeting with Montim told journalists: "we said that we will support this Government very".
We believe that this Government is the last option to prevent Italy from this painful situation.
Monti's chances of success are greatly multiplied thanks to the support of the PDL, Silvio Berlusconi's crisis forced him to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti's is destined to good results," said journalists Angelina Alfano, Assistant to the center-right parties.
Support for the PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because up to this point, many of its members opposed the Government with technocratic, majority, which assembles Monti.
Support for Parliament
New Monti's Government must have the strong support of the Parliament in order to promote unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in that effort might trigger a new and devastating assault on the financial markets.
Italian Association of foreign banks joined the coercion and warns that Monti's failure could mean disaster.
Monti began on Monday negotiations with the political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth organisations, and women.
Round ends on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday, President of Napolitanem, which allowed in response to the crisis, a very rapid procedure.
After a short decline from the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi submits his resignation, with the interest of Italian bonds returned to critical and react to the uncertainty of whether the new Prime Minister will reap success.
Save Italy whose public debt is in the range of 1.8 trillion euro, would be beyond the capabilities of existing cash reserves of the euro area.
Monti said that his Government should stay in power until the next elections, which are scheduled for the year 2013, despite the General forecasts, which argues that politicians give him the time only, to carry out reforms, and then declare early elections.
Monti said he would like to be his Cabinet, integrated policies, but major parties insist that the Government must be composed only of experts to take Italy out of the predicament into which the country was due to financial pressure.
Political sources indicated that mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties to make an attempt to integrate into Government and political personalities.

We waited for more than 20 years, but the Group assures that for them the possibility to play Costa Rica is a dream come true.
That said the bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is located on the South American continent, within the framework of the tour on the occasion of the celebration of 20 years of existence and Sunday, 20. the unique bus stop in Central America.
This day rise from 19: 30 at the National Stadium, along with the saintly Group The X and national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is a sample of the interview, in which the entire transcript, visit the website of La Nación on the Internet.
For your Costa Rica supporters, it's a dream come true. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realise what producing your fans?
Trip to Costa Rica, it is our dream that becomes reality.
In South and Central America, we're barely a second time and experience were great.
I was in Costa Rica just once, on vacation. It is a beautiful country and I believe that we will be able to stay for a few days.
So we're delighted that we can bring our music.
I ask, because here the Group literally adore, fans are enduring these days preparing intensively.
What do you think his nejskalnějším followers?
Thank you for so long in the us for many years.
It took us almost 21 years before we got to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and sorry it took so long.
Some people talk about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Makes you more pressure?
Some of the greatest show, which we showed in the last 21 years, arose within a few weeks.
We have some great show in Sao Paulo and we hope that we get to the forms of the concert at Costa Rica.
In fact, we are looking forward to the concert too.
We love this country, like serfujeme, we like the jungle. For the two activities is Costa Rica the best countries in the world.
How did you meet Costa Rica and its good waves for surfing?
We have a lot of friends surfers and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo. The waves are incredible.
My friends go surfing at Costa Rica or Nicaragua, or to Mexico. These are the best places for surfing. And so we learn about Costa Rica, through the people who love surfing.
If you look on your tour, you have prepared a huge show with many of the songs.
What you have planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Whereas, we never played, we have no restrictions on what they could do.
We'll try to show you what the best show with a variety of songs. We'll try to play a couple of songs from each album and imagine our fans a good and varied repertoire.
You never neopakujete repertoire.
Why?
I think that is partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes a different structure, therefore it is difficult to choose which songs we play every night.
When we have two or three in the Repertoire of songs that we have long advertisers, we focus on them and we also surprise, because considering why we love and that we may have forgotten.
So for us, the show more interesting, and therefore I think that it is more interesting to people.
Following the tour celebrate 20 years of artistic career.
If you look back, it is hard to believe everything you did?
Yes, that's for sure.
First of all, I think that none of us could imagine that we'll be in one large rock group and that we stay in it for more than 20 years. It sounds like a dream.
We realize how much we have been given and moves us, that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and love making music.
We're lucky that we can look at the place, which we've always wanted.
We could not have gone better.
What you meant that you were an important part of the formation of the genre grunge?
For us, that we can be part of this group, in which they are represented in all of the greats.
People from Soundgarden, Mudhoney, Alice in Chains are our friends.
It is surprising when the movement is from the Group of friends, very often, it never happens.
From time to time arises in the city group, but is much less common to one city at a time was obtained from five to ten groups.
We're proud of it and we are proud that we can be part of a group from Seattle.
Sometimes we play with some more.
Last year, we were at the Festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We're lucky that's all our friends and we are proud that we can be part of this movement, which was founded in Seattle, Washington.
Also, it is very unusual that a group like yours to keep together, and even after all these years still the same members.
Yes, the four of us we already 21 years and Matt (Cameron) is to join us 13 years ago, which, in itself, is much longer than the usual duration of the group.
I think that first of all we're all lucky that we're still in this world and, secondly, its role is the fact that we kept each other.
We are close friends and we have managed to open the musical paths, which are each sufficient freedom to his own experiment.
We trust each other, we appreciate the music of the second, and I think it could be better.
Your relationship to the word glory was not simple. However, thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you balance?
As we grow, gradually getting easier to find the right balance.
We're trying to tour at all too, because it is very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that the people came for the music, you must remind them that the music and what you gave her, respect. You may not get carried away by the celebrities, rock stars. This is not one of us ever really cared about.
How do you remember the next project of the Mother Love Bone?
I think that we were writing great songs and at the beginning it was something spectacular.
As a band we have existed for three years and we never had released any album, after he died, Andy (Andrew Woods).
It was very frustrating, because it took so long. The most important is that, even today, been friends for with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started out in the band with us. When you listen to a song, or a look at the photos, I remember Andy as he was incredible, as I having with him. It's always a pleasure to work with him, laughing, talking about music or about football and many others.
It was an incredible person and is missing.
National band Las Robertas will be responsible for that in Costa Rica started the show.
It is true that you know their work, in particular, Eddie Vedder, and that therefore you have selected them as the bands?
Yes, the production of the video sent to us with several proposals, and this group, we enjoyed the most. Therefore, we're wondering what Las Robertas will offer live and must be very funny.
Why always live changing words Yellow Ledbetter?
That's the question on Eda (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings and I think adds the first what comes to mind.
Who you as a bass singer affects?
A lot of people.
As the first I can think of Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, c. j. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski.
There's so many that I could talk all night about the basistech who I like.
How did Pearl Jam hold the grunge, although no longer in vogue?
I think we always felt slightly separate from the word grunge.
When grunge music, I'll introduce you the group that I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and all other which arose at the same time. And if it is, even today, this music is valid, so it is something great, because it is music worth listening to, and groups such as Mudhoney today better music than ever before.
At the beginning of your music slightly gloomy character and now is more positive.
What is behind this change?
That's interesting, because I have a feeling that, in the new album has a few songs that are lighter-style, but also there are songs like The End or Juste, Breathe, which are considered very gloomy, although it may sound like a positive.
In both of the two, is Ed, so I cried, and the songs are deeply dark.
I think that when you grow up and you're in the life of a trauma, you lose a family member or friend, these things will influence your art and music, and these two songs for me, this is what they represent.
Also, I think you can be a happy person, and i still do a gloomy music.

The Park or the mountains?
The architects met on the occasion of opening a procedure, which entails more than the controversy regarding the fees
Urban tender for 16 Gates once again opened the debate on the role of the Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s. years at the time of the greatest flowering of the already defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this authority to print several pamphlets in support of the Collserola Park.
Leaflet has defined mountain as a large park Metropolitan Barcelona.
What's more, he was accompanied by a numerical comparison with New York Central Park.
Then, in 1987, the lapse, CMB, park returned to the minds of many as the upper boundary of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolis is one of the few that are not set on the axis North-South, but up (mountain)-down (sea).
Collseroly qualification as a natural park, it is in this direction.
Reference has already been Central Park, but Yellowstone with boars instead of Yogi bear.
Such was the position until September, when the Town Hall announced the mega competition, consisting of 16 competitions for the same number of gateways to the Collseroly.
Gateway, of course, begs the more the idea of the Park.
Either this, or someone trying to put a gate on the field.
The only question is, therefore: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both in terms of purely organizational, as well as on the basis of reflection on the town, this question becomes the central theme of all Barcelona's architects.
It's already a topic as clich? d, such as when two members of this old caste of the chosen meeting in an elevator shall hand.
And this action is one of the rare matches between what he thinks three předstoupivší barcelonští architects and university professors.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: selection procedure has its merit.
According to Roldána, after had originally question side of the Bay, "it should be" discuss on the "mountain side", so speech Ildefonse Cerda Green apples not got dragged to the end.
"We have to be based on the principle that most Barcelona Park is the beach.
Inter alia, his great availability.
Collserola is more complex, "said the architect, for which the name" gateway to Collserola "carries" lexikologickou trap ": we have is to represent" as inputs to the Park, but rather as the definition of zones where it is possible to act ".
Modol, as well as Roldán and Bayona with experience from the world urbanism qualifies the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" allowing "some risk".
The danger of "uncertainty, which is a project of a public place" after the experience of the 1980s. years, which was in the area of Forum "my swan song."
The first concern is the very definition of borders, which should be built upon.
"Do Something to define the means already the next step", that is, in principle, to move a step further.
"It should be borne in mind, the new urban and planning tools, because the current (with reference to the General metropolitan plan (PGM)) may cause a a real disaster".
If we look in more detail the question of Modol believes that the Valley slope Collserola can be "considered a park", but the Barcelona of not, and for reasons that are purely topographical.
Modol also reminded that there is already work carried out Patronat de Collserola, which "may not end up on the rubbish," Although welcomes the fact that the town hall offers its context, that the project reaches from the "first time".
And, moreover, means that the proximity of the mountains and the town is a kind of pass, which allows architects to participate in the debate, but "doubts" that it should be this technical profile, which will lead multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skill", he says) that need to be created: "Architects should be only the Tools".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name of this game, is a complex, because the supporting documents for the tendering procedure is missing a global vision of the Collserola: "was published 16 competitions, which deal with all of the axis of the mountains-the sea, but there is no longitudinal studies, which would be the area watched and recognized it as a whole".
This has meant that at least he volunteered to all 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the project of one gate can be hindered on the concept and definition of architect neighboring gateways.
In his opinion, the City Hall to ensure that the zone immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should ensure in the entire length of the zone facilities, to ensure a smooth transition between the city and the Greens.

This team relies on the support of specialists and pupils, post-graduate studies from the National Institute of public health (INSP) and the Centre for research and advanced studies (Cinvestav) of the national polytechnického Institute (IPN).
Engage in research may also the general public, having or not having the permissions. People may come into participating in the sports centres of the IMSS in the Valle de México, where they each Saturday from 8 hours to carry out tests of adolescents.
He emphasized that the research he began in the sports centre of the Cuauhtémoc (Mexico State) and 8. October, this activity is carried out also in the Sports Centre Nezahualcóyolt (East of the Mexican State).
Once they obtained the data from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue in the Sports Centre Independencia (South of the Federal District), and finally in the sports centre of Morelos (North of the Federal Centre).
He explained that the aim of this research is to identify the elements and importance of genetics, regards the development of obesity, and track down the Mexican children and young people risk factors and thus prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the international day of the diabetes, which is celebrated on 14. November, he reminded that the aim is to collect the data from the three thousand children and young people between 6 and 14 years ago, with the consent and under the supervision of parents, for the application of specific questionnaires about nutrition.
The questionnaire will ask also for physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases with the aim of avoiding risk factors which might cause diseases such as diabetes or renal inadequacy.
Clarified that every Saturday with all participants carry out antropometrická measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), measure the blood pressure, determines the level of triglycerides, cholesterol, glucose, insulin, and to examine the genes (trying to identify genes that are involved in the formation of childhood obesity).
Cruz López stated that this study reflects concern over the growth of Medic alarmujícím children's weight.
' Health Survey undertaken between 1999 and 2006 have shown that in just six years only for boys, to an increase in obesity by 77% and for girls of 47%. The dramatic increase took place also in the case of overweight ', said the expert of the IMSS.
Stated that one of the reasons the search for indicators is the assumption that the population of the country is different from other populations of their genetic history.
Reported that the average Mexican's 65% of the indiánsko-American genetic predispositions, 30% European and 5% African. This fact is reflected in the genes that are responsible for diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in General, genetics of obesity is commonly explained as inability to burn excess energy, which konzumujeme (calories), and which is stored in the form of fats.
The scientist explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that they receive in the overall assessment of the situation of children, which finds that show any known of overweight or obesity.
He said that even the presence of wrinkles dark colors (acantosis) on the neck and forearms indicates the probability that the individual will suffer through problems and předcukrovkovými States.
The information is confidential, it shall be transmitted in writing to the parents, doctors and explain them all measurements and lifestyle changes, which must be carried out so that their children can avoid illness.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: the sedentary way of life, indicating the lack of daily physical activity, all day sitting in front of the TV and use of means of transport instead of walking for short distances.
Overweight causes also a large intake of food, that is, the greater the consumption of sweetened drinks, carbohydrates (bread, tamales, pizza, burgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and genetic burden which is the subject of this research.
In the Asphalt from the UNAM are bumps
Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the chemical Faculty of the UNAM creates Renault with polymers and creating a combination of having a better functionality, regardless of the weather conditions and temperature
If properly handled on the Cobbles, it would not be correct to almost 200 thousand potholes after each rainy season in the metropolitan area, the Valle de México, said Rafael Nájera Herrera, a scientist from the chemical faculty (FQ) of the UNAM, who added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt pavement was adequate, there would be a significant reduction of potholes, or even could be completely removed.
In his lecture, the Technological cause potholes said in the framework of the international year of Chemistry Laboratory, announced that under his leadership, develops Renault with polymers, which should emerge from a mixture of having similar characteristics as the asphalt, but also greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Nájera is of the opinion that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely hot climate, for example, in some cities in the North of the country. Improve the functionality and reduce the creation of potholes.
Explained that the asphalt, the hardest part of oil, is a group of molecules of hydrocarbons, molecules with large molecular weight, which are called asfalteny, and the other with a low molecular weight, which are known as malteny. Together supplying asphalt typical viskoelastický character.
Viskoelastický the character of asphalt lies in the fact that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, behaves like a fluid, at 120 degrees has a high viscosity and at 50 degrees is almost solid, while at low temperature asphalt has tendency to worry, he added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt on the streets is not uniform, but it varies during the day, according to the weather conditions and temperatures, said an expert on chemical engineering.
A scientist from the chemical Faculty of the observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de México it is covered with a flexible tile, which consists of six layers of materials, of which the last three are mixed with asphalt.
Between the layers of the nejsvrchnějšími is the tar file, consisting of small stones drenched in asphalt and then compressed.
He emphasized that every stone, which forms the Insert, it is through the asphalt.
Passing cars or when creating the pressure it is possible to force the pavement right up.
If it was modified asphalt, decompose would be even better, believes a chemical engineer.
He added that on the asphalt pad is placed on the last layer called the cloak, consisting of fine sand, stones, also filled in the asphalt.
Whereas, this layer will be coming into contact with the rims of vehicles, must have greater mechanical strength than the tar file and must ensure that the friction of the road.
Whereas, as part of the pavement will be exposed to large loads, must have a cloak of sufficient thickness, and care must be taken to the material from which it is made.
Climate, in particular the humidity and temperature changes, they are also a very important factor that you should keep in mind. In particular, the water has a large influence on the functionality of the asphalt.
As soon as the ground is wet, water travels inside and it is hard to get out, it causes softening of all layers of pavement and the formation of potholes.
Explained that during the creation of potholes in the film as the first coat and then leads to damage to the asphalt. Damage but does not occur in a single moment, but it is a gradual process that should stop at the first signs of using appropriate maintenance programmes.
As a member of the national system of scientists also explained that the burden of vehicles is another important factor in the creation of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each layer of the tile must match the load of vehicles and must guarantee that this burden shall not exceed. Only in this way can we prevent the frequent emergence of potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that as regards the asphalt, still waiting for us a lot of work and research is at the beginning. It is worth mentioning, for example, asphalt emulsion, which are in other countries, are already available on the market and enable you to easily fix the bumps without the use of high temperature.
What was missing from the top of Valle, to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of factors that have contributed to the fact that Melina Ramirez Serna has not received the Crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle so gaining 14. the title of the first vícemiss.
Valle del Cauca has once again regained the Crown of Miss Colombia.
Melina Ramirez Serna had to be content with that ended up on the podium of Wimbledon, won the silver Crown and sash, on the basis of which become the new first vícemiss Colombia.
On the basis of the results of the previous finals in Cartagena, which won and the sceptre took Miss Atlántico, the Department gained 14. the title of the first vícemiss. Melina has joined the masses of women from Valle del Cauca, which came within reach of victory Crest, but eventually was declared the first vícemiss. They include Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuelo Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The question many are asking. What is missing?
The result is the defeat of the great Sultana, which in all previous rounds has shown that he is to become the new Miss Colombia, and not in vain, became Queen of the police and the prettiest face Joile de Volgue. These titles have reached, for example, Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, which subsequently took the title of Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury has decided to appoint her, only the first vícemiss, is the fact that I didn't answer his question: "which book you liked the most, and why?", which put the Martín Murillo Gómez from literary editors Leamos.
To the question, she replied:
"I read a lot. Very I believe in the role of literature, I believe that it is one of the forms of zkulturňování. The book, which influenced me most in childhood, "the little Prince", a very deep book.
Currently I'm reading "crime and punishment". It's a book that is part of the worldwide literature, which we should all know. And today I've got a book by Irene Nemirovski, Russian authors. This is a beautiful book with the name "El ardor de la sangre".
This response, like the term "culturize," and, secondly, because she did not explain her individual mentioned the book marked.
After the awards ceremony Melina declared that it is easy, and my joy from the result: "the world is wise, what has to happen.
And you people read, if you can. Little Prince is a wonderful book. "
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the position.
Bogotský journalist, suggested that that candidate was from the beginning of his favorite, and the one who took all the previous price (Gastronomic challenge or Ostyor, title to the public for the best artistic dress and the Queen Mother), aroused the envy of other uchazeček, vystresovalo Queen, who then failed once on stage.
It was evident at the first presentation of the swimsuit on the beach Hilton, and during the two weeks before the final coronation.
Although both shone, it was evident that she lacked the strength and enthusiasm, which demonstrated a reprezentantky from the Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of "at home" on Canal RCN believes that that Melinda has won the title of the first vícemiss is confirmed by the fact that the candidate who wins the most during the competition titles eventually leaves with the Crown of the Queen ".
In addition, Valle in recent days suggested more hostile position to the media, and he did not serve.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to persuade the jury about his interest in social work, which are the basis for the national competition of beauty.
Just on the edge, two days before the election of the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that looking for a woman who will be aware of the social needs of their country.
"In the competition of Miss Colombia beauty in itself is not enough, you need to see something more than just physical beauty. It is necessary to focus on the social feelings. It is important that female candidates before entering the competition, have been involved in such projects, "she said.
It also speculates that she lost points due to shortcomings of the Valle of his background and fibrosis, which was on the tail. But this is completely contrary to the jury that it indeed has chosen miss natural beauty "for the healthiest body proper nutrition, physical activity and responsible.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who the Queen is preparing, acknowledges that Melina was not the best body that there were better girls, "but the problems with the specialist on the tail, which in my opinion was not very apparent, she stepped down points until the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos from Cromos magazine believes that-born from the Valle made a mistake, when it underwent several surgical procedures.
"Surgical interventions are fine, but in the Valle they screwed up.
The body was never her strong point and here takes its toll ".
Because of this award, which the National Assembly for the first time udělovalo beauty, after the show in a bathing suit to harsh predictions, which is filled. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo Melině took her to finally grant the highest Crown.
Whether it's true or not, it is certain that Melina launched today a year of his reign, not as a Queen, but as a Princess, from a position which gives her the possibility to represent Colombia at various international competitions, where it will be designated as the National competition.
However, entered into history as one of the Queens, which, despite amazing success in Cartagena to the highest crest.
Such was the work of the people of Cali, which has identified the dead body of Alfonse Cana
An expert on fingerprints from Cali went into history as the man who confirmed the death of the "Alfonso Cana".
The work of these officials is the key.
4 November last year, an expert on the fingerprints of the HONOR in Cali entered history as the man who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader of the Farc: "Alfonso Cana", through the comparison of the fingerprints.
Of seven experts on fingerprints, who work in the Department of honour, was this week to Eliazar Gonzálezovi, men from Puerto Tejada, who was 21 years he works in the field of research.
At the beginning of his career, González was working at City Hall in Chocó, where he often more than five days, pushing their way through the forest to get to the place where the dead bodies, that it was necessary to identify.
In 2000, he moved to the capital of Valle, after he completed the relevant courses, he began to specialize in fingerprints. The science dealing with the study of the friction of the skin, hands and feet.
In the week, when it was carried out operations against the aforementioned Alfonsi Canovi, Eliazarovi they said to take clothes to at least three days.
Expected something big.
Friday night into the Cauca River in the helicopter from Palmira.
He knew he would have to identify two corpses, and that suspects that one of them is the man who led the oldest guerillu in the world. It therefore requested to take the card with fingerprints Guillermo León Sáenze (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigating team at the spot where the body was, it didn't recognize because of physical appearance. He looked completely different than in the media.
Had a beard, dressed as a villager in the area concerned, without glasses, much leaner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Together with galtonovou magnifying glass, ink and transplantátorem and light Eliazar began to compare the Dactyl records corpses writes from the card.
Eye nezklamalo it: it was the "Alfonso Cano".
That same night a man originating from Puerto Tejada was assigned to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzónovi, confirmed that it was indeed the Supreme Commander of the Farc.
Search for tracks
For daktyloskopa of Sijín de Cali is the recognition that Eliazarovi Gonzálezovi showed President Juan Manuel Santos at the press conference of operational services against "Canovi" very significant.
A lot of people know our work.
A fingerprint is an exact science, without the possibility of errors, which can play a key role in determining criminal offences.
In addition to identification of corpses help these people in the research of criminal offences such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of trapped persons.
When it is caught, a lot of delinquents presenting false documents or have no papers at all.
We we fingerprints and we're looking for is in the database.
The investigator said that, in the case of injury, he had in the House to remove a piece of wall of the House, because at this point the thief leaning against his locker full of jewellery and money.
The walls are difficult, because they are not intended for the collection of impressions, but in this case, we could obtain the fingerprint the entire hand and identify the perpetrators, who was involved in several robberies, "he said.
Fingerprints can also confirm or deny suspected in a murder case.
Recently, they found the dead man with the bottles of alcohol around you.
On the basis of the investigation, it was found that the murder could be a responsible one of the members of the family and the fingerprint on the bottle it really confirmed.
Although you can't absolutely confirm that he was really a killer, it is clear that appeared on the scene of the crime.
An expert on the fingerprints of HONOR explained that of the subjects of the fingerprints "blur by using chemical or physical reactive substances".
When it appears, so for their subscription uses the transplantátor or a tape.
The prints are then sent to Asif, which is a database of offenders, or to open the filing cabinet.
"The problem is that there are currently many Colombians, whose data are entered", said the expert of honor.
He explained that not everything is as it appears in the television programme CSI.
As well as all that glitter is not gold, not at all what you touch, brush remain.
However, if it can be used, it must carry out the appropriate comparison.
"Indignation" protest in New York
Hundreds of manifestantů crowded the square Zuccotti, where to camp.
A large part of them waited for orders evacuation of the area and into the middle of the Park.
The members of the movement Hit Wall Street Tuesday provoked a representative of New York, when the court order sought to again get on the square, Manhattan, where they were baffled by the morning. Then tried to take over another New York park.
Hundreds of manifestantů crowded the square Zuccotti, where to get thanks to a court order, which permits "resentment" to return to the camp is. The second part, the movement reacted to the clearing that took park in the North of the city, where further detention.
"If the Court will not allow a return to the square, we settle in another place, and we'll continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, both through the Assembly, peaceful rallies," said one of the speakers, the movement "Obsaďme Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the answer "exasperated" on the evacuation of the camp, which he ordered the Mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg, was to court, where judge Lucy Billings has released command, which prohibited the forced resettlement places and allowed manifestantům to continue to set up camp.
In addition, the "outrage" took another park, located at the crossroads of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and backlot rectory in Trinity Church.
At least an hour to take place, but then the police came and arrested some of the manifestanty. Bray did not know the exact number, but stated that he saw that the bonds have deployed and some journalists.
The Organization assured that on-the-spot usídlilo, several hundred people. Also the delegation of religious leaders came to them expressed their support, and also tried to negotiate with the police.
In the meantime, square Zuccotti, which is private property, remains closed. It is expected the negotiations to which should be just on Tuesday, during which should analyse the legality of the morning evacuation.
Some of the relocated manifestantů even they were passing and a copy of the court order and even gave the nationals who patrol the square, which led to "some small conflicts," said Bray, who denounced the fact that some of the officers of the manifestanty Bill.
A court order prohibits the authorities to evacuate members of the movement "Ocupa Wall Street" or use "laws that were published after the conquest began, or disable access to the manifestantům Park with shops or other places, which previously used".
Mayor Bloomberg said for printing, that the view of this court order, the city suspended the reopening of public space and manifestanty pointed out that local laws do not allow them to go back to the tents and sleeping bags.
The highest representative of the city personally defended the morning evacuation square Zuccotti, an operation that was suspended on 200 persons and to which the DAV manifestanti, because "broke the law".
Bloomberg said that he ordered to evacuate the square because it was "the place to which people did not protest, but violate the laws and in some cases the harm to others", because "some stores were given the threatening letters" and "neighbors worried about the quality of your life."
"Morning clearing was appalling and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests at the expense of the American working people", said the spokeswoman, who accused the Mayor, that "the respect of freedom of expression".
The representatives of the movement "Ocupa Wall Street" also said that it plans to organize a "great action" on Thursday, in cooperation with the community and trade union organisations, to remind two months, after which they insist the protests. You have started to 17. September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other major Canadians appear in a television programme, "It's a Russell Peters" Christmas "day 1. December
Pamela Anderson says she was Assistant Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", a lifeguard in "Baywatch", in "Playboy Bunny" rokového, the wife of the musician Tommy Lee and now the actress will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show Canadian television.
Private television station CTV today announced that Anderson, together with singer Michael Bublé sentimental songs, and other major Canadians appear in a television programme, "It's a Russell Peters" Christmas "day 1. December and will represent the Virgin Mary.
CTV television showed footage of the today programme, in which Anderson, also known from the website of the domestic pornographic pictures, appears with her former husband, engine "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, as the Virgin Mary holding the baby Jesus in a doll representing the.
As Josef Peters appears on the scene, well known Canadian actor of Indian origin, who recently served as moderator on tour "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" Charlie Sheen.
Besides Anderson and Peters in a special Christmas broadcast, CTV will Canadian singer Bublé, who got married at the end of March in Buenos Aires to the Argentine model, Luisanou, Lopilato and which is close to the controversy.
Recently the American Kim Kardashian Bublé call on one of its concerts in New York, "the Fox".
Japan, after the devastating earthquake returns to life
GDP is growing by 1.5%, thanks to the consumption of households and ending period of falls, which started in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy was paralysed, now recovering from a devastating earthquake, which has burgeoned in the nuclear crisis, the worst disaster, which had to face from 2. during World War II.
The first estimates of the tokyjské Government vyčíslily material losses to the 300 000 million dollars, despite a difficult world situation good healing.
After three quarters, GDP value falls between July and September she got into such a position that it was possible to definitively turn the page: GDP grew by 1.5% compared with the previous quarter and by 6% per year.
The results of the second quarter-for the Japanese fiscal year starts in March 2012-Moreover, assume the largest growth rate in comparison with the period January to March 2010.
Recovery can be partially explained by the purchase of machines, which are necessary for the reconstruction of areas destroyed by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
Companies increased their investments by 1.1%, expenditure will fall by 0,9%, compared to the period January to March. This is the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real waking up the Japanese economy is based exclusively on impulse, which makes use of the crisis to the left, or to the restoration of infrastructures. It's about to take advantage of the lack of it, to start completely from scratch.
Japan is awakened. In particular, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable is increased by 1%, thanks to the increase in expenditure on the vehicle, travel and leisure activities.
Stigma yenu
Flows are told in the hands of the internal market, when the yen-Japan currency-became one of the "life values" for investors who, fleeing before the debt crisis of the euro area and the US before znepokojivými forecasts. It's a privilege, but it is also a burden for export businesses.
With the stronger currency are products more expensive abroad, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial soundness of large technology groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony situation their weak results in July and in September a course just yenu.
While the markets continue to throng the peripheral countries of the EU, Government Yoshihiko Noda is prudent.
"We have to watch out for risks which still remain, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand, and the rapid increase in yenu", said yesterday State Secretary for economic policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for economic cooperation and development (OECD) stated that most Member countries showed a clear in September, the characters of the economic slowdown.
Pointer, which foresees the inflexibility in the world economy, showed that the economy of the major powers slows down.
Decreased by four tenths to 100,4 points over 100,8 in August.
The euro area is even got below average, which is located at the level of 100. She got to the level of 99,13 points.
Athens once again spreading uncertainty
Papadimos says that they will be approved austerity measures, but Conservatives will not sign any written undertaking
With rapid and risk-bearing edge guarantees and uncertainty, which again, was Greece increasingly gets to the labyrinth, which leads to the exit from the great debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that "match" the new transitional Greek Government is given rather than a genuine belief requirements Brussels political forces are beginning to confirm.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday admitted that there is no alternative for the structural reforms and the period of 100 days, which he got on his appointment, it will be probably short for their application, the Chairman of the conservative party, New democracy, Antonis Samaras, he said that the new austerity measures in any case will not support and reiterated its request to dump the new elections on the planned date of 19. February.
"The main task of this Government is to apply the decision of the Summit of the 26. October, "he said during a parliamentary debate last night Papadimos, which will culminate in tomorrow's vote of confidence for the Government.
Package of 24 programs having to promote employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of the officials and the new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, the message does riot clarify doubts Samarase not his position: "we pledged to help the Transitional Government, but nothing further we ourselves."
The President of the Conservatives went further in his speech to the EU and the IMF. These organisations have the unblock 8 billion, which Athens they urgently need. At the same time but said he will not support and does not sign any commitment in respect of the implementation of the austerity measures.
The European Commission already furious impact, which caused Papandreovi games with the referendum, yesterday stressed that its requirements are by: neodblokuje any help, if the new Government and leaders of the main parties won't they "written undertaking without ambiguities, and as soon as possible".
A spokesman for Economic Affairs, Patio Altafaj explained that inspectors from the Troika will return "very soon" to Athens, and will negotiate with the new Government, "what he needs to pay for the sixth part of the" 8 billion. But there is no definitive date.
Greek přadlena has a moment of what to knit.
Queen Sofia: "there are tools for progress and hope"
Queen highlights the privileged position of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has achieved a significant position on the global level, in terms of microfinance".
Queen Sofia, yesterday pointed out that countries in the last two decades to become the second donor of the planet, as regards this instrument of cooperation, whose essence lies in the fact that it is a tool of social progress, justice and hopes for a better future for all mankind. It is a tool based on trust in the man ".
The Queen yesterday launched a 5. the global summit of micro-credits in Valladolidu with the belief that "there is no doubt" that this kind of operation "is the imperative" for it to achieve the MDGs set by the UNITED NATIONS by 2015. "In particular, the objectives of which are to reduce by half the number of people who live on less than one dollar a day, with the amount, which fixes the poverty threshold".
"Spain will continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and take this task responsibly", stressed the Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and the contribution to the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "will create a better capacity and opportunities for the poorest, and in particular for women", which these loans are intended, in particular.
"We have already one" and "many challenges are still ahead of us".
Summit on mikropůjčkách should be not only debating forum, but also a platform to promote the "basic objectives".
Her Majesty explained that the objective is that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families have access to financial services and that 100 million families have received above the poverty threshold, below which is currently live.
The concept of micro-credits in Spain and in other States of the world after "what happened on this path has the pioneer ideas of Muhammad Yunus ', said the Queen and she added that this is" an act of Justice and the necessary recognition ".
The father of this instrument is described as a "wonderful idealist, who embarked on the path of struggle against poverty". His work met 15 years ago, when released into the Bangladéže to meet directly with his policy of loans.
After this experience, followed by next. The first global summit in Washington, and other meetings such as in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, in Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings I could find the constant development, said the Queen, who thanks to his support of this project also brought about yesterday, the title" head of the family ", which in the Valladolidu bestowed" movement of the poor ".
Queen Sofia ended his show by inviting participants to engage in discussions and the search for solutions, and to continue the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, declared that "solidarity" is the ethical imperative ", which must be observed by all democratic States.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries only with the balohobytu, because this cooperation is "permanent".
Jiménez believes that include represent "a serious and fair policy to eradicate poverty", and now more than ever, Governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not to just solidarity has become victim of cuts.
Mikropůjčka for Spain is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
Minister of State for international cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept based on the fact that we have the confidence of the people, all the others close the door. The Mayor of Valladolidu, Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed the participants in the city, which "opens its doors to a spirit of solidarity, which is contagious".
The CDU proposed to elect the European President on the basis of universal suffrage
Without serious trouble for the Chancellor and his Prime Minister, the Christian Democrat Angela Merkel took place on Monday, 14. November in Leipzig for the first day of the Congress of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU).
The question of the future of Europe on the program originally was not, but her in the autumn, in particular, that they were satisfied by the party members, who consider the policy of the Government to the Greeks today and maybe tomorrow against the Italians at lax.
The proposal concerning the President of the European Commission brought the leadership was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the number 1001 delegates was against and 10 delegates abstentions.
Although standing ovation at the conclusion of performance of Angela Merkel and then a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäubla, very pro-European Finance Minister, did not leave room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summarized in the slogan: the answer to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe."
Not only that, Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
According to Chancellor in Europe, "it is time for change."
This could make changes in the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the Member countries of the euro area, but also it could result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage, "in order to give Europe a face".
This is in any case one of the thoughts of the proposal adopted by the Congress, whose inspiration is clearly, Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is unlikely that all twenty-seven countries in this revolutionary step quickly agree: against the United Kingdom, and the leaders of the CDU, thinks that the same approach shall deliver also, Nicolas Sarkozy.
But the direction is vytýčen.
As delegates rejected by a large majority a proposal to evaluate the weight of each country in the Board of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of its economy, which will result in the strengthening of the weight of Germany.
Guided by the concern to calm the climate within his own party, the Chancellor has made several references to the Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. Try to get Congress to talk about "small" European States or States which are in difficulty, willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal concerning Europe devotes one paragraph of the importance "of Franco-German friendship", Angela Merkel, France never quoted.
Only indirectly.
When reminded that two hundred years ago there was a bloody battle at Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most pokořujících defeats the Napoleonic army.
What constitutes fraud in incapacity?
After aid run party UMP and the Government offensive against the working neschopnostem.
Nicolas Sarkozy will on Tuesday 15. December in Bordeaux and visit the Office for granting social aid, where it delivers a speech on the theme of recurring from 2007 on the fight against social fraud and redistribution of solidarity.
As the escorts of this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased stringency, but is no less clear from the perspective of right-wing of the presidential campaign, he wants to focus on right-wing majority of incapacity.
First, because of budgetary savings, the Government intends to impose upon employees of the private sector on the fourth day of the incapacity before they start taking aid in sickness.
Clearly, without the consent of the company, the employee who gets sick, lost four days wages, at least 15% of their monthly income.
The measures, which risks cause many bad blood, but which, according to the worksheet, Les Echos can bring 280 million euro.
And also measures, which should be accompanied by other measures of a symbolic range: give civil servants a day unpaid incapacity (so far, they have no failure compared to three days in the private sector).
While these questions are the subject of the discussion, the right-wing majority runs also the theme of fraud aimed this time at abuses tied to labour neschopnostmi.
"Checks will be much larger and in addition: If you are caught, you will be coming back," said Xavier Bertrand in the interview provided by the station RTL Sunday 13. November.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification appear somewhat disproportionate to the truth about the misdeeds of the working neschopnostech.
These were in fact subject to the standing monitoring since 2002 and the political onslaught which brought its fruits.
The French are more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Consider the first of several official numbers.
According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM-State health insurance) in 2006 paid more than 237 million euros per diem refunds.
According to the French Institute for research and documentation in the health sector accounted for in 2008 the daily compensation allowance to their 11.3 billion euro, 5% of the expenditure in the health sector.
Of this amount, with 46% of the involved parent contributions and work accidents and 54% of the covered the working inability of, i.e.. 6.2 billion euro.
Therefore only 2.5% of the cost of health care.
According to a study group Alma Consulting were the French in 2010, an average of 14,5 days of incapacity, compared with 17.8 days in 2009.
Average, which carries certain derogations: another poll published in 2007 on the pages dealing with jobs Monster.com has shown that 75% of the 40,000 French employees of the respondents replied that all lessened by no day of the incapacity.
Another study, this time by the sickness insurance institutions, States that, in 2010 37,8% working inability was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to three months and 11% took longer.
When compared with their European neighbours, French staff are not more than elsewhere, prone to work neschopnostem.
One long study carried out in 2010, two researchers CNRS (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 total absence (for health reasons or not) in France has alternated between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Cheating in neschopnostech represents only a very small part of the work on the black.
As regards fraud, these are just small scale.
Strengthening of legislation from 2002, there are systematic checks on the incapacity of more than 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM stated that when the 1.5 million checks were 13.8% of 285,000 carried out due to short-neschopnostem "of irregular or too long", i.e.. 37 050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled the inability of more than 45 days, with 22, 11% of the cases, "nepřizpůsobených" or "irregular" to 1.2 million checks, i.e.. 132 000.
A total of 169 000 "irregular" cases to the several million workers who were sick.
A number that represents much less than the figure expressing the work on black.
According to the members of the UMP, the author Dominique Tiana June report on this issue, this number would be a 9 to 15 billion euros missing in the collection of taxes for the year, i.e.. more than the total amount of the daily allowances and therefore infinitely more than fraud associated with the last mentioned.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply the new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue program to recover its economy.
On Monday, 14. December he said these words before the Parliament the Prime Lucas Papademos and added that the 100 days of his Government of unity will not be enough to fulfil this task.
"To put up our economy, we need the support of our European partners, and new life-financial plan", said the head of the Government, when he spoke on Wednesday, his first public speech at the start of a debate on a confidence vote in Parliament.
Application of the decision adopted by the 27. October in the euro area Summit will be "the main task of the new Government, as in the game is the participation of our country in the euro area, he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos assumed that the public deficit will be from now until the end of the year "in the area around 9% of gross domestic product after 10,6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Right rejects the new austerity measures
The right leader Antonis Samaras said on Monday its support for the already approved measures in order to attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but warned that his party does not commit to any additional austerity measures.
"For any new measure hand gun", emphasized the Samaras to rendezvous with the members of his party, New democracy.
We agree on the objectives relating to the reduction of the deficit and debt, and the fight against waste, but we are against any policy that would impede economic recovery.
Mr. Ollimu Rehnovi, the European Commissioner for the economy and currency, which he warned that the IMF and the EU neodblokují the necessary loan 8 billion euros without written guarantees of all parties which support the envisaged measures, Antonis Samaras said that his word is enough, and that does not sign anything under external pressure.
It should be legalized euthanasia and legalise, says the Commission of experts
According to the report of the Royal Canadian society is the Canadians refused to die.
In the matter of palliative care Commission urgently requires that the Government institution in charge of health and doctors were working together to ensure the best palliative care and even in the cases of cancer.
A Canadian company is the idea of withholding death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accepts the option to talk to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die, and take decisions in this sense.
It's one of the findings of the comprehensive report of the Royal Canadian society, which involves six experts working in different fields, among which was the ethics, law, and medicine.
The Commission recommends that the Government amend the criminal law to legalise euthanasia is permitted and, if this option as necessary for the patient to be considered competent to take such a decision.
At the beginning of the experts cite a recent independent survey Agency, Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet.
Although Canada post on 10. place, the study notes that "medikalizace death in Canada gave rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death."
Medikalizace Yes or no, 77% of Canadians have access to palliative care, communicate to us the experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian society.
And despite the wish to die at home, which has a majority of Canadians, 68.6% of them dying in the hospital.
This average shall be valid for the whole of Canada, while in the province of Quebec is the highest with 86% of persons deceased in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate question of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the messages reach the conclusions that go against the position of the Federal Government, which has already said that the criminal law relating to euthanasia and assisted suicide does not want to change anything.
According to the experts, who also have put control of all the countries where these approaches are legalised or are not considered criminal case, there is no evidence that this causes a odkriminalizování abuse in the application, i.e.. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide to the persons nepříslušné or mismatched.
On the contrary, p. Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed yesterday, in teleconference more than numerous cases of these mistakes in the countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not been legalized.
"Euthanasia shall be carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal".
"Assisted suicide is carried out also in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
The Canadians are in favour of euthanasia
Noted that, according to investigations carried out by the Forum by Angus Reid in 2010, 85% of Canadians already spoke in favour of euthanasia because it believes that the persons at the end of life can ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we send the message that life of old or hendikepovaných persons has a smaller price.
As regards persons who practise legalise, 41% of the surveyed persons believe that they should not be subject to judicial prosecution.
In the matter of maintenance or disruption of patient care, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.
Also in the list of its recommendations propose that in the criminal law stated that the withdrawal from treatment, for which there is legally confirmed the rejection is not a crime.
The Commission of experts also requires that qualified doctors were educated to respect the obligation to refuse medical treatment at the end of life without the fear of prosecution.
In the matter of palliative care Commission urgently requires that the Government institution in charge of health and doctors were working together to ensure the best palliative care and even in the cases of cancer.
Finally, in the matter of paliativního or the final cessation of the already widely used in Canadian health care facilities, the Commission requires that it be considered at the moment already does not serve to reduce physical pain, euthanasia, and to be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations of the other experts
Some experts on medical law has already submitted its reservations concerning the conclusions of the report of experts of the Royal Canadian society.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, qualify for the position of the experts-the signatories of the messages as "extreme", inter alia because it does not restrict the practice of euthanasia on sick in the final stage.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who was tired of life, and which should more than 18 years of age, could request to help him commit suicide," says Pierre Deschamps, who yesterday had studied the résumé reports.
P. Deschamps also stressed that it looks as if the authors of the report opposed the autonomy of the person above all other values that shape the social fabric of society.
Because "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions".
Specialist in medical law Margaret Somerville expressed "strong objections to the findings of the report which it described as" a manifesto for euthanasia ".
Margaret Somerville, which is itself a member of the Royal Canadian society, has doubts especially on data messages relating to the absence of failures in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are been legalized, i.e.. in the Netherlands, and in the u.s. State of Oregon.

According to the ISIS Institute widely financed from documents of the IAEA would in. Danilenko (born 1934) had to work three decades from the 1960s in the Soviet military research centre in Chelyabinsk (Urals), where he was to address the production of synthetic diamonds by the explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, had to leave the Centre in Kiev founded a company producing "nano-diamonds".
The economic problems of his company, he should bring it to contact in 1995 Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Prior to his return to Russia should then work together from 1996 to 2002 among the programme.

Strong yen
Noda is a new intervention in foreign exchange markets

Energy policy:
the facts must prevail over the dogmaty
If there is a topic that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balance sheets or emotions, then it's energy policy.
Availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and the competitiveness of enterprises.
It is natural that the meeting when the election was an opportunity for thinking of such deposits and on-the-spot, which takes energy from the core.
The debate will be successful only when exploring all the economic, social and environmental consequences of proposed options.
The French must base its position on the objective facts and rational data.
So far, on the planet of 7 billion human beings, but the demographic development occurs from now on, by 2050 the duplication of electricity demand, if we want to get rid of a considerable part of the world's population are important components of life.
At the same time will need to face the lack of fossil resources, in order to continue to produce electricity, and not to forget the essential need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to combat climate change, which is the subject of, which currently goes for environmental debates.
An accident in Fukušimě has no effect on any of the following parameters.
And that is why Germany is alone in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
That is not the case in Belgium, which makes its decision necessary to find some other source capable of replacing itself, or Switzerland, which considered the right to build only the last generation.
On the contrary, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue with determination in their projects.
The United States, after the Fukušimě decided to expand its park one unit restoring the construction of one power broken after the crash power plants Three Mile Iceland.
If the German model based on renewable energies are sometimes presented as an example of a reality that is contrary to.
The choice of Berlin will affect the high electricity prices, increased energy dependency on gas imported from Russia, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions due to the construction of power plants to natural gas, and coal.
All these effects have already during several months.
The case of Denmark deserves to be above it appreciated.
The European champion in wind power plants, of which removes 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas because of the irregularity of the wind, which are CO2 emissions and higher price of Danish electricity by 65% and 50%, than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the permanence of our energy policy will pay our neighbors invoice for electricity by 40% higher than the payment of French households.
While in the globalized economy, energy costs represent a key factor of competitiveness and guarantee of keeping the industry on the national territory, French businesses to enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would produce a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make iluzorními a beautiful Declaration of renewed industrialization of our country and the preservation of purchasing power.
The price that the great majority of French people refusing to pay, as well as are fundamentally committed to this energy, as the polls.
Noted that the energy policy of our country has allowed the industry to build 125,000 direct jobs and with 410,000 downstream jobs.
A strong export sector for them to international markets a large number of small and medium-sized specialized firms producing jobs that cannot be transferred abroad.
If France has decided to leave the core, sacrifice would be a large number of these small and medium-sized enterprises, and she'd come by 6 billion euros per year, which gets on export of nuclear equipment and services.
Who is the owner of the power plant would have ordered nuclear reactor designed to work 60 years, while he was scheduled to decline its producer?
In addressing the energy equation is necessary to admit that there is no magic source of energy production, and that there is no evil.
Development of establishments producing low emissions of CO2, nuclear facilities and installations using renewable energy sources by the French Industrial Group AREVA is indicative of the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy is an absolute necessity to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France we have the State Office for nuclear safety, which carries out rigorous and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power stations as well as over the construction of a new power plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, they have the idea of safety in the blood.
In fifty years, the nuclear industry recognized three serious accidents.
Only one in Three Mile Iceland happened in conditions of normal operation and remained without a human sacrifice, and the consequences for the environment.
Chernobyl reactor caused the drama concept and unjustifiable human error.
In the case of Fukušimy, it seems that some people forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters unprecedented scale, which caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
Nuclear industry to take lessons from this accident, just as it did for the two previous.
Fruit of this step and cooperation between French and German authorities dealing with nuclear safety, operators and designers is that the reactor type EPR is a concept able to resist such a phenomena.
While all interested parties who wish to build a nuclear power plant, to him as, cessation of its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to competitors of the company Group AREVA and EDF and the release of the way to ensure that they took over the leading position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate search for the best solutions to energy for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let that emotion, dogmas and machinations dominate debate so decisive for the economic, social and financial situation in our country.
It is a burden for the economy of immigration or chance?
Policy in the field of immigration carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles-congestion, the police, the courts and the administration under policy number, compatibility of this policy, the status of the country of human rights ", in which France boast.
Recently, it was the administrative harassment to whose object were foreign students, which became the current when the Minister of the Interior (see sheet of Libération from 23 May) said that France "does not need a foreign talent, Masons and the waitress".
But it has been rarely rozebírána angle of economy.
Must be said that in this area, the fairly wide agreement between left and right.
The right tone in 1976 gave Jacques Chirac, his statement that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in the country, where there are 2 million immigrant workers" and on the left, Michel Rocard, when, in 1990, he said that France "cannot accept all the misery of the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity
In 2005 he was the fear of invasion hordes of Polish plumbers on the French territory is shared to the right and to the left.
In both camps are immigrants seen as a burden for the economy and the French company.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity, uráčíme immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande limited to banalities, indicates that the joint development will allow you to solve our "immigration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and the problem is maybe in the elections, economically, but is very expensive.
How do economists like Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in his recently published book syntetizujícím the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, may 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 str.): there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migratory movements on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries which immigrants accepted.
Reducing immigration paralyzes growth and bad for employment.
Concerns about the effects of the migrants are based on the idea that these people may replace the French workers, especially those less skilled, and create pressure to reduce their wages.
But experience shows that immigrants are in fact much more than adding replacements for French workers, by carrying out work in sectors with the lack of staff.
Low-skilled immigrants in sectors that don't attract the French workers, and those most qualified in dynamic sectors in which training is not enough places menu.
Positive effect on wages
As well as the surgeon will have a problem with the work in the country where the lack of anesteziologů, this tween between the Frenchman and migrants make the additions of immigrants have a positive impact on wages and employment of the French employees.
Giovanni Peri so reckons that the growth of migratory movements of 1% will cause the long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And it does not take into account the fact that the diversity of the přinášená immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalised immigrants among us holders of the Nobel prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay, and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also in the European countries, net contributors to social systems amounting to 1% of the total budget.
The world labour organisation e.g. It is estimated that in Germany one immigrant přišedší at the age of 30 years will bring in all my life to public budgets of net contribution (revenue minus expenses) 150000 euro.
Nicolas Sarkozy spoke at the beginning of his mandate, the desire to collect for a missing percent growth "with bared teeth.
The teeth used to deter immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, democracy remains to be explored by the European
Democracy is a precious and fragile goods.
The European continent would you should remember, however, that in Athens, two thousand years ago, has seen in the course of the XX. the century of the tragedy of the world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also of Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the colonels in Greece.
Some people believe that to ensure that democracy finally triumphed over their adversaries, will be enough to make the choice and implement it in the most direct manner.
He knows, however, from Napoleon, was an ease of mind.
Universal suffrage, while it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition, and may become a "tool of oppression" as once said Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organisation and control of power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, the judiciary.
The crisis of Europe, which we are experiencing, is a crisis of economic, but is just since the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy.
Return errors of Greek referendum in a Yes-or-no in this direction will have the value of double exposure: detection of the need for a large return of political power, but also reveal alarming sense of his inability to, its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be promýšlena so that it can be overcome.
The truth is that the front line of the democratic struggle now to shuffle, and that many of the Republican fighters already back in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain, if we require a series of national referenda held pursuant to the need and in a disorderly way.
Blank drawn European an monarch or jump with tied legs into the void of nationalistic depths: what kind of selection for the citizen!
No, we don't want the knives of the guillotine, but common, a full, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at the European level.
Not the crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal-or indeed, we didn't know where the list of stop-since the crisis in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe looming before the diktat of the markets and the rating agencies, which suffers for their inability to and their lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe, which is reduced in the international arena.
Zneklidňujeme when sovereignty to Europe-but it is the whole of Europe, which is slowly losing its sovereignty and each of its Nations.
Urgently need to return control of the European project of democratic sovereignty.
As the only Europeans will be able to reduce the responsibility of their debt, get rid of government markets and investing to prepare for the future.
Exit from the crisis will assume the decision at European level, which will not be able to be taken without the full democratic legitimacy, would have led to the disaster.
After what we have long fought against this proposal of the Socialists and Jacques Delors, now we strongly request European economic government.
So Be It.
But to think that without a stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such citizens, would be the new craziness and new dead end.
We have to take on a new stage in European construction.
To create a Republic in France, it was necessary "to be," Republicans.
Revolution in interests to under-estimate.
This lesson shall continue to apply.
We must build a Europe that will be more economically integrated.
It will be able to carry out building a Europe more politically democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Staňme with the Europeans, to build Europe.
"Non-contact" smart card spreads
In the optimistic atmosphere opens Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris world fair of chip cards.
Year 2011 Standard should, according to the Cabinet to end the increase in world sales of cards with microprocessor (bank cards, telephones the SIM card) by 11% to more than 6 billion units.
Most key segment is non-contact technology, which lets you pay in bulk transport or processing purchases simply by fitting the tabs to the reader.
This year should be sold around the world, 460 million smart cards against 320 million sold a year earlier.
Their market share should still stand in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and achieved approximately 10% of the total market in chip cards (6,925 million cards).
After a long time in tow of the APEC countries, Europe is gaining terrain in contactless payment.
Approximately 26 million bank cards Visa is already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals is accepted.
In France are the beginnings of a more modest: it was issued of 400,000 bezkontaktních cards Visa.
But the large multiples are working for two.
Carrefour so this year has issued 2.5 million bezkontaktních cards Pass MasterCard.
We joined the higher gear, it is necessary that from now on the banks of their memories of their clients.
"Two large French companies have undertaken to distribute systematically in the future their clients touch-less bank cards", announces Gérard Nébouy, General Manager of Visa Europe, France.
Banks tested the payment of cell phone
But this is only the first stage of the payment means the future: mobile phone.

"But the real expansion should take place in the next year".
"For the year 2012 we estimate their sales in the world on the 80 to 120 million units," explains Marc Berta 's, President of Eurosmartu.

Terrorist front extends from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris concern the links between Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and sector _boko Haram.
Long-term suspicion that there are bundles of terrorist group Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the sector of Niger _boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Deputy Foreign Minister of the Algerian Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria about from now on, "he assured".
"The way in which both organizations are operating, and intelligence reports show that there is a great synergy between them," explained without further clarification.
It seems that Paris has a similar analysis.
Investigation of the abduction of the two French people in Niger in January 2010 could help illumine the passageways.
After they were abducted by members of the AQMI from one restaurant in Niamey, should all be Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory following day killed at the same time as several of their kidnappers in an operation carried out by French special forces.
Sifting through the rubble after the intervention, were French and nigerijští investigators found several phones with chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis carried out by the call leads to several persons in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to the station, Radio France Internationale (RFI) interested investigators especially two numbers: one leads to the Nigerians, who long resided in Maiduguri, a city in the North of Nigeria, which is the cradle of _boko Haram, and second to the man, which he says is close to AQMI and sect.
"It's progress, but it should be without a doubt wait for more evidence before we start talking about the operational cooperation between the AQMI and _boko Haram".
"But it is possible."
"We know already for years, that the sect enjoy external financial and intellectual support and that is reflected in the increasingly more actively," the gentle statements Nigerian counsel Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months this "aid" is more and more obvious in the development and expression of _boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which now include human victims, or still more complex explosive devices the same way of implementation, such as the equipment used by AQMI.
The international community on the forehead with Washington since then put pressure on Nigeria to take into consideration the issues raised by the _boko Haram.
Nigerian authorities, in fact, long considered a group of the community of enlightened Mystics little worthy of interest.
Quick success
Sect _boko Haram was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around mosques, schools and fundamentalists Mohammed Yusufa. _Boko Haram, which in the language of the haoussa means "Western education is a sin," approves the creation of the Islamic Emirate's Government would in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region has such rapid success.
Sect, the politizuje, and requires strict compliance with Islamic law šaria, while her supporters launches fight against ' central Government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, the _boko Haram become extremely active and multiply their attacks against police stations.
The reaction of the Government is, as usual, still the same.
The army moved in in the city and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of the sect, Mohammed Yusuf in prison is captured and killed.
Since then, the Group radikalizuje and leave their point to the North.
Christmas 2010 takes place in the city of Jos, where 80 people are killed, then another in the capital, Abuja.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where the _boko Haram to attack the headquarters of the police at its first suicide attack.
And in August, the local Office of the UNITED NATIONS first international target.
Create a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, from now worries about all the security specialists.
Now, when the Al-Qaeda Islamic Maghreb surrounded the Mali and iger and Somalis from the movement Al-Šabáb operating in Kenya, the _boko Haram appears as a new threat to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in an interview with President Alain Juppé Goodluckem Jonathan said that France is in a State of alert and is ready to "transmit all information".
The world according to the candidates for the President of the
In matters relating to China, Iran or help Israel with Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry have in simplifying and neznalostech.
Can America weakened crisis manage world using simple or even simplistic ideas?
When listening to the presidential candidates would voters might think.
For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and other repeated stormy statements and brief instructions in the matter of foreign policy, which is traditionally a strong point of the Republican party.
Often spurious slogans about China, Iran or Israel coincide between themselves.
Mitt Romney, the candidate is the best umisťující in the race for the Republican nomination "Grand Old Party", threatened by the Chinese before the World Trade Organization and their handling of the allegations "because of their currency", which is the topic of migration in America alive all parts of its business to Asia.
Worse, if this must have run a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, the former Obama's Ambassador in China and the only candidate with a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost choked when the position to "smoothed" emotions.
Require a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (President Obama's current position).
But the Huntsman, who is on the last places in the voting estimates, remains neposlouchatelný.
In the image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear programme.
"If I am elected, one of Iran", said fanfarónsky.
"If Obama will be re-elected, will have the bomb."
Also promised to increase military assistance to Israel, obviňujíc Obama that failed in their obligations to this partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second best candidate umístivší, shows a troubling lack of documents.
Recently called for a sharp stance against China's military threat because Beijing "tries to develop nuclear capacity"-apparently ignorant of the fact that China's own nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to strikes against Iran, itself says that it is prepared to send American troops into Mexico to fight against the drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists prohibited Obama in 2009 it is also recommended that you couldn't be sure, Perry and the other candidate, Michele Bachmannovou.
They are all far elsewhere than in the 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain, heavy weight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current President, they say that Reagan was too simple ideas, and still won the cold war.
Recall that Obama himself was an amateur, and that adding water to your wine in the matter of the fight against terrorism.
Highlight the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the abrupt departure of the "boys" from Iraq, his excuses relating to Libya and by attributing a label of the weak
But the attack is not easy.
Population assesses President Obama's national security policy, which removed Ben Laden, rather positively.

And with the argumentacemi, it is necessary to reconstruct America economically, in order to resuscitate its leading position, is knocking Obama more correct place.
Nord Stream, a new input port of the Russian gas to Europe
-Remote Nord Stream napojující directly to the Eastern Europe to Russia and held for the bottom of the Baltic Sea started to work.
Must provide gas equal to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian natural gas giant, he wanted this event to celebrate properly.
More than 500 guests, among them 4 heads of State and Government, last Tuesday attended the inauguration of Nord Stream, the new pipeline, which under the sea connects directly to Russia and Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned together control around the valve management entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
This new pipeline begins to flow each year into Western Europe additional 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas the first pipe of a length of 1 224 km connecting St Petersburg region is the land of Mecklembursko-Pomerania.
The second pipeline, which must be completed at the end of 2012, will deliver a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, which is a quantity that is equal to the whole of the French consumption.
And no longer resembles the option to build a third pipe pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom has the timely completion of this huge construction character of victory.
The project is strongly protesting against Poland and the Baltic countries.
Nord Stream will actually deliver gas directly to Germany without it, that would be conducted on the ground by a third State (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time these two countries are losing a bit of power: the ability to push Russia to threats that his close access to Western European markets, it becomes more difficult for them.
The most it Warsaw, when she likened to Nord Stream to "new German-Soviet Pact", referring to the Alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means to say that it is a politically sensitive topic.
Western Europe with its support for this project in the Russian won the greater certainty of their purchases.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe energy, because the project has created a rift among Europeans from the East and the West.
Russia managed to barely 5 years ago to promote its vision of direct Alliance between Russia and the rich Western States with high consumption of gas, the bearings are coming to an end.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, new Street, which connects us organically," said François Fillon at the solemn opening of the pipeline and has demonstrated the extent to which point are large natural gas contracts things as political and economic power.
All of this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom leaders present in large numbers in Lubmin, place of supply of gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an important technical offence.
Underwater pipeline is of steel bearing the mantle of concrete to be protected from anchors seagoing vessels.
It rests on the bottom of the sea in the average depth of 200 m.
When its construction was necessary to avoid minovým fields originating from the period of 2. during World War II.
"Because of the security they have had to be nearly a hundred of them deleted or destroyed", says Jens Müller, a spokesman of the company Nord Stream.
Need too build up measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long metal snake weighing as 242 Eiffelovek, which on its entire length is nowhere interrupted nor valves and stations maintenance.
One control platform should be built in the vicinity of Sweden, but it was rejected by the project manager when the Swedes were just a few greedy to see the Russian State-owned company as permanent implants on their coast.
"In the case of failure to stop the passage of gas in less than 1 minute", explains Jens Müller.
In the case of a leak in the gas contained in the pipeline will escape into the air.
But this case is considered the likely little builders, it welds was designed so that a leak was created once per 100 000 years.
Check the condition of the pipeline from the outside by an underwater robot-driven ships, while the Interior of the pipeline is controlled by a device that circulates inside.
This device is shaped with a diameter of 1 meter is introduced to the inside of the pipe and is firmly held gas.
In destination throughout the three days of travel at a speed of 3 m/s shall provide accurate information on the potential deformations of the metal components.
Long-distance gas pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without the slightest correction.
Gas circuit is simply to ensure the pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar destination.
For the realisation of this project, five companies joined forces.
Leadership remains to Gazprom, which holds a market share of 51%.
It is joined by the German company e.on and BASF (15,5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies formed a joint venture called Nord Stream is responsible for the construction and operation of a gas pipeline.
The company has its registered office in the city of Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely convenient.
Gazprom then this company has leased for five years, which may be renewed, all of its capacity for the transport of gas.
"Gazprom will have a profit of the entire capacity, the quantity of gas to any real," explains Jens Müller.
Finance the construction of ensure of the 30% of the shareholders and 70% of bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach a 7,4 billion euro for both pipelines.
For group GDF Suez so investment costs have risen to 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are sure that their costs of returns, because the risk takes only Gazprom.
Gas pipeline from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin to sand with the pine forests.
Valves high 4,5 metres form the output gate gas.
The sensor measures the pressure, temperature, and other characteristics of the incoming gas, before it is transported to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this Terminal receives every hour one million cubic meters of Russian gas.
Upon reaching full capacity will be 3 million per hour, and in 2012 6 million.
Moleskine-brand notebook
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded 50 years ago, wants to again provide the joy of writing.
Brings the smell of the adventure, the hours spent typing by the light of candles.
Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable by his black rectangular plates and their leaves faded the color white as time zestárlými.
After all, Moleskine notebook, such as we know it today, was born in 1997.
Italian firm Modo Modo based in Milan at the time, decided to place on the market a new designer, but he notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the firm, takes the new product launch.

The situation is remote stealth production of the first years, when it was made only 3 000 notebooks.
Moleskine exceeds the Italian border and exports to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to build an artificial image of the buyer, since the notebook takes the businessman as well as a student or professionals.
The image belongs to Moleskine notebook that its owners are cosmopolitan, sophisticated and open-minded spirit.
A small Italian company, which in its early days had 12 employees, is today almost a hundred and from 2008 has two offices, one of which is in Milan and the other in New York.
His notebooks distributed to bookshops and through the chain of stores, FNAC in small boutiques in the centers of cities, where he was to assert their identity.
"We followed the spirit of the period and this need for new writing, despite the turbulent development of the e-mails ', explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature is accompanied by the development of the Moleskine notebook: recently, Mark opened the exhibition "my way", where architects or artists display their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of film festival in Locarno also said the new Board, notebook, reminiscent of the Leopard.
Moleskine profited mightily from its success and this cultural aura and diversifikuje their products: bags, diaries, pencils, notebook cases. The mark shall be extended to a wide range of media.
The success that aroused envy: in fall 2006, the company was bought by investment funds in Modo Modo SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, píšícími a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is it so high share of unemployed hendikepovaných workers?
Around 19% of the hendikepovaných people looking for work.
Today opens a 15. Week for the employment of hendikepovaných.
Via the voluntaristickou public policy established in 2005 the percentage of unemployed persons hendikepovaných twice higher than the average, i.e.. 19% compared with 9% for the whole population.
It's depressing?
"No, underlines the Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Association of Adapt, which organizes the week for the employment of hendikepovaných."
"Progress achieved in 15 years is remarkable."
"At that time, the percentage of the unemployed was not twice, but three times."
"However, it remains still much to do."
It should be noted that for the unemployed handicapped persons there are numerous obstacles before their arrival to work.
This is an older persons: 37% has more than 50 years ago (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% have graduated high school and from 2,3 million students of universities is only 10 000 hendikepovaných.
And finally-the long-term unemployment is very high: 53% in hendikepovaných compared to 38% on average.
In short, those are the criteria which especially complicated by the return to work and which constitute the "core problem", according to Christian Grapina, General Director of the Association of Tremplin, which was founded in 1992 to help businesses to receive handicapped workers.
As regards the objective of the brake.
Leaves neřečené, ways of thinking, which of course evolve, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by IMS Entreprendre pour la Cité found that respondents managers have a "low level of knowledge about hendikepovaných persons" with the "exaggerated notion of the persons on the gauze and psychological or mental deficiencies".
The result is that private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from that in order to achieve the objectives of the employing 6% hendikepovaných of workers laid down in the law of 1987.
Last known numbers that originate from 2008, indicate the status equal to 2.6%.
"Now we are around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General of the Organization of the Agefiph, in charge of collecting fees from businesses that fail to comply with this law.
The proof is the number of "pokutovaných" of enterprises, as well as amounts paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 culprit on 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"Act of 2005, which increased contributions, has created a strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also demonstrates a real awareness, especially in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of labour only 59% of businesses with 20 to 49 employees employs handicapped workers, compared to 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: "lucky"
Before Tuesday night (20h45) invite the French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens to hide the pleasure they bring this friendly match.
We won't go so far as to write that there was conspiracy between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other in the stands of the Auditorium, the Stade de France, in short, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard.
Five months after his attacker to read gesture in the match against Turkey was a Belgian coach to his players only words of praise.

Not to omit the term "joy".
Play against the Bleus, which encouraged from 7 years and in their victorious campaign in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan of," he says.
This necessarily contribute even more to the "special" nature of this meeting.
All the more, because, "they are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)", recalls.
"We were cruising at once."
"Able to play against them, it's just a pleasure!"
As Leekens said i "pride".
"Pride" win "the game-holiday".

"Laurent Blanc made a great piece of work", rozdychtil.

"Our little Belgians become big", he underlined.
"That is something we are building, the players are ambitious, have healthy hungry."
"You realize that for the next games." Including that against France.
Portugal very self-confident
Portugal coach Paulo Bento launches with great optimism play-offs against Bosnia Bosnie (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
On the way there both teams lacked realism.
"At the end of the 90 minutes we'll happy team and, above all, safe countries".
Paulo Bento had sees in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no shadow of doubt. The Portuguese national football team, for which the helm is from 2010, qualifies for Euro 2012.
Portugal divided by happiness in fact 90 minutes.
Left to play one game and one opponent-Bosnia.
In Friday's result (0-0) in hell Bosnian Zenice, it seems clear that there is nothing to tie the game.
Portugal was more than an hour, but was not able to give a rare goal, which would relieve him.
"It's a good result, however, contains a risk because we're outside they góla."
But at home on their amazing Stade de la Luz in Portuguese Lisaboně are convinced that forward before an audience, which should create a boiling cauldron, although the game certainly appears to be a "very balanced", says an optimist, but a quick-minded Bento.
"We expect a very balanced game, but we are confident that we can have the upper hand," he said, 42, the Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance to be on the Euro 2012", yet the relativizoval successor Carlos Queiroze.
Undecided Friday's game in Bosnia, forcing the Portuguese to score and win.
Indecisive struggle may be enough Bosňanům who also need to give the goal.
"It's a good result, however, contains a risk because we're outside they góla", regrets the Bento.
"We're playing against a team that has great technical quality and that has players with large individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will have to develop an interest in the Bosnian team right from the start the maximum pressure to "give them time to think."
Good idea, under the condition that this will prove to be realistic.
