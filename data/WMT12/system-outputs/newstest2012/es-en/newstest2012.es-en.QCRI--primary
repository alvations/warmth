The parliament did not support an amendment to liberate Tymoshenko
Ukraine's parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment of the section of the Criminal Code condemning the opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the release of the expression minister, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the alleged signing of an agreement with Russia disadvantageous for Ukraine on purchase of natural gas.
The ruling is not yet firm, the court of appeal has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West have raised doubts about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code which condemned the former prime minister was supported by 147 Members in the vote.
For approval is required 226 votes.
The victory Libya
The history of the Libyan release, or the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Qaddafi was buried in a secret location in the desert and without it there is no longer any war.
Remains to define who is the winner
As is customary in the region, the Islamists won the elections, but now it is a question of whether it is moderate or radical
The National Transitional Council has come into force the traditional law, the Sharia, which already in a way we know.
Libya will become a country without crime, because the thieves were cut off the hand.
Women can already be forgetting to emancipate and apostates awaiting execution and so forth.
Instead of the person of the dictator, society, composed of warlike tribes, will join in the Koran.
Libya will be established in an order that we cannot even imagine and that certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is not the only or objectively the best and probably did not suit them, instead, Libyans already mentioned.
It is true that leaves no surprise that the Islamic fighters accept grateful for the help of dogs infidels.
The only justification was that, from their point of view, the NATO attacks not ran an American general, but Allah is great, whose greatness held after each of successful interventions.
When they seek winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are trapped in a shooting that serve the Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without guarantees of profit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, not deal with Libya militarily.
In this case, the local is a problem not expel the "crusaders"
But, without occupation is oil companies will be done with the Libyan black gold only with good words?
It is quite possible that no, but it may be that finally the West can boast of protecting human rights.
Whenever the followers of the Sharia we are not cross.

Daily menu of a child obese: Not desayuna sausages and dinner
More than a third of children aged between 9 and 13 years have problems of overweight, where the overweight affects the 9% of the school population and obesity to 5%.
Obese children are mostly from families with a lifestyle that is not healthy, according to current investigations.
Becomes to show what the importance of the environment where it grows to a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
In the table, obsessive children are, for example, of sausages at least twice as frequently as the children of families with normal weight.
For dinner, more than 19% of the obese had cenado chips on the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention programme "The obesity is not a coincidence."
In the families of overweight children there is no tradition of sports, which applies to most families today, where only 15% of children responded that their parents, at least once per week, found time to exercise.
Survey 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and participated in the same almost 900 children of Basic Education throughout the Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of the programme of "The obesity is not a coincidence," which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the company Unilever.
Until now, have participated in the project more than 12,000 children from the fourth to the eighth grade.
A proper diet and exercise in family are determining factors, which are significantly reduce the number of overweight children and even obesity.
"Only half of the children polled have responded with five meals a day, according to the regime: Breakfast, lunch, dinner, tea and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," says one of the results of the survey.
Without breakfast for dinner but with sausage
Specialists warn that, in a healthy development, are important, moreover, the details, which also include, for example, have a fixed time for breakfast in the family.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of families of schoolchildren eat breakfast at the same time.
In the majority of families, each desayuna alone.
But the worst was to discover that in 10% of households are not desayuna nothing.
Breakfast, however, is the basis of a daily diet.
The study shows that in the families of obese children consumed much more often unhealthy the chips.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drink daily sweet drinks (70%).
As a general rule make sport more than 40% of the children surveyed, however, between their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15%.
Diet Fabrícate your
The next phase of the study made it possible for kids elected (204 boys and girls of 13 schools) creates its own expenses from all the offers possible according to their tastes and opinions.
"Food preferences of Czech children aged between 12 and 15 years, from the point of view of a healthy diet, they are far from the ideal."
Among his favourite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
"It is especially alarming the popularity of the drinks sweet," is in the final report of the study.
As the main meal takes the biscuit pasta and closely follows the poultry meat.
Practically, children are always the pulse) and a taste for the fish and vegetables is very low.
Healthy habits change
At the same time, the study shows that children are ready to change their eating habits if they receive fair information.
"In the control group of participants in the study who completed the questionnaire after ending the prevention program" The obesity is not a coincidence, "was in many cases a major change in favour of the principles of healthy eating," noted in the results of the study.
Draws attention, for example, the sweet lemonade, where many children would start to prefer the ordinary water.
Children also choose more frequently in the questionnaire poultry meat and fish for food and would restrict the consumption of fresh food and derivatives of flour.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, argue professionals
In the introductory article, how they learn the stylists, because I complained a little of that initial lessons were already pretty loaded.
I had no idea how things would go.
Conferences of three professionals in the field, how to dress problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of entertainment.
And it will be worse.
The closer are the final exams, more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course is conducted every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a pin.
Once we have studied with the director, NAFTA, (in no man) on how to dress for the woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And so is the vast majority.
Someone is cuellicorto, someone has a stylized figure without adequate curves and someone is overweight.
The hairdressers know optically soften a broad shoulders, extending a neck or recreate the necessary curves
They have given us some tricks on how to highlight the body of women of the kind of Jennifer Lopez, breasts and hips huge but narrow waist and at the same time not customary in a way too challenging
If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is such that skirts or trousers are not tailored, it is worth asking sewing at least an extra piece of cloth to measure.
Certainly not regret it, because the clothes that feels perfectly is invaluable.
With a tailored skirt will feel much better than with a not to move, get up, dance around the waist, etc.
Stylised body can afford to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidery or drapeados.
There are certainly many different types of information and bodies, so I am pleased that I have all week to bring order in my head all this information.
And even then, I fear that with the task assigned, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course assigned two famous, who must devise two rooms: One for the day and another for the night.
We must take into account the current aspect, the style of fashion that is appropriate to the person in question.
I was touched "dress" to Miranda Kerr, perhaps speak of the campaign of Victoria's Secret.
Cry inside, for me, is much better than, for example, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, who recently gained weight will be around 100 kilos (please take into account the exaggeration), or the jovencísima Selena Gomez.
Dresses have to cut from magazines or on the Internet search and printing, and then develop it graphically.
The moodboard, which is called the outcome is as complete, further expresses our personal style and our relationship with the graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic of the styling.
The hairdressers, therefore, is not only physically, but also deals with, for example, in the pages of products in magazines (of specific issues, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
All this we spoke the stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But all this is already on Sunday.
The stylist has to have a global vision.
The three guests specialists encouraged the conference on Saturday with information on all kinds of bodies.
The stylist Honza Pokorný, the fashion designer and Jakub Polanka fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and stylist saberle should take advantage of this.
And a good stylist known to work with the same item of clothing in various ways.
The variability is, in this case,.
As well, such gabardina (or as they say in English, trench-coat) you can wear it with jeans and T-shirt classic, but also serves to wear the naked body with tacón shoes and photographing him as if it were in fact a dress.
Or just arremangarla and raise the neck to obtain a totally different picture.
"Jugad with this," he insisted.
What I appreciate is the following advice: "To start work, we need to first may know all the rules."
"Then you can break them," said Jakub.
Finally it is clear why memorizamos all these formulas, which combines with what, why, if it turns out that in fashion magazines are different results.
This is without mentioning the parades.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know that a stylist must have more types of clothes in the reserve of which aims to photograph.
So, for a history of fashion that takes 10 pages (hence, ten outfits), we must be prepared, ready for use, at least 15.
And in addition to the photos clothes works in combination with other clothing, all of which are different from those that are used in reality.
All this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and style are themselves, in many cases, half of success.
Just look at Madonna, which is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the márquetin have made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, for the moment, there is not even a clear trend to use the services of the stylists.
Until the famous people also are useless (I enough my skills, my physical appearance has no such importance).
And when someone asked our services, we must bear in mind that it is very likely that indicate a very different size to his right (lower).
Then there is only guglear and find out if the magazines of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has fattened/lost, etc.
Sunday, Honza and Mario we insisted that the stylist is not enough focus on fashion, but has to understand outfit.
During his work, especially to communicate with people who dresses, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
Knows assess people, there is no less, defends his views.
"When a director is hired to beneficiaries.35 clasifiquéis clothing and completéis with fine clothes, you can't catch and throw everything they had and say, 'Oh la la what horror". "
"Encontrad at least a couple of things that you consider and recommend to someone they can get," says Mario.
He also showed us that everything must be on the so-called "placovka," that is, the stock market.
This is set around the waist and there have all the necessary tools.
Are objects as scissors, scissors, quitapelusas, or imperdibles. There are also nylon thread (which he serves the stylist during the meeting of photos of products such as handbags or hats), special pliers clothing enganche ahead, whichever is greater (the pins and other attachments are not permitted, because it could damage the fabric), or a game of sewing.
Not to stay in the passive listening and put something in place, we have learned to take the often of shoes.
Even during the sessions of photos in the study, on a flat surface, it could damage the often and much more outside.
And we did not do more to take and take.
We could not touch the shoes with scissors so as not to harm by accident.
So we had to be very skilful.
Mario has given me a joy to commend my work without reservations.
The truth is that does not give me very well these skills.
This is only a small part of all those who have heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I have already noticed that styling to devote myself to the professional level is not a path of pink, but it gives me exactly like what people say.
In need for speed: The Run it competes across America.
Overview
A trip, in principle carefree, is complicated because of a series of improper omissions of a routine trip during the morning.
To some extent they managed to meet expectations, but it is no use, if, in fact, it was not intended to do anything extraordinary.
The new delivery, which is added to the title The Run, awakened great expectations even before its premiere.
New promised to give up the old saga of careers need for speed and, as a result of the show, appears as a game that should not end up being another kind of action.
We are also curious to know how the scenes would be inserted, where the main character is descended from the car and walk on his foot.
As is often the case in the series of NFS, the results will not vary much about what we had hoped.
There are careers that can be taken by acceptable, but the total lost points because of failures absurd, which are already appearing in the series for years.
In reality cannot be or call mistakes, but it is more about the unwillingness of programmers incomprehensible.
The adventure begins very well.
Beneficiaries.35 is introduced in a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has some personal problems; to solve them, he offers to participate in an illegal race across America.
Os sentáis at the wheel on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get the first to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into 10 stages and then, in more than 50 careers.
It follows that every race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite different and interesting.
That way, one is not remotely the feeling that the game offers is always the same.
Some are even pleasant environments in sight, although the technical level of the figure is equivalent to that of previous rendition of the series.
Therefore, it is nothing of another world.
But the walk in the desert, the autumn landscape or the high mountains covered in snow produced a very pleasant visual effect.
, is racing to diversify from time to time by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert beneficiaries.35 encontráis a storm of sand that diminishes visibility.
In contrast, in the mountains we must be careful not to beneficiaries.35 sepulte an avalanche.
According to this, each of the racing is very well developed.
There are only a couple of models, but this is enough.
For a time, intentáis advance to a number of rivals demanded (as normal in a classic race), after whom to gain time (classic duel timed) and then you expected a duel against a single opponent.
In the midst of all this is sometimes the police, but that does not make things even more difficult.
Novelty are the landscape outside the car.
When Jack interactive animations are, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, provided by clicking the button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are fewer landscapes in the game of what might be expected (in particular, there are only three).
But the end result is positive, because this element is not to be disturbed and, in the context already mentioned, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The model is driving the fingerprints of the previous episodes.
This means that today is no longer a big deal, but you cannot say that it is bad.
If buscáis a realistic simulation, because you can look elsewhere.
But in a race designed with enough action suits rather this style of driving, although we can find something better between games of competition.
So far, all in order.
But the problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the right models of driving, because this is not the case with collisions.
Games of this kind cannot expect recreated with deformities and collisions complicated, but in fact before a coup against any object, you cannot predict how they will react to your car, so that not everything is in order.
It is typical that, to make a very tight overtaking or move the car with a normal traffic, has only slight friction, but in other situations almost identical, your car just doing gymnastics uncontrolled.
Or even just totally destroyed.
Thanks to the system of reseteo, no major problems arise, but may settle your differences now in a bad mood.
The reseteos are scheduled in such a way that, when you suffer an accident or you salt of the runway, the game you rescue restores the last point on the runway.
However, in every race is available only five reseteos available.
If the consumís all, you have to restart the race from the outset.
So it is no more than a help in the event that something is not going well, but it is not very reliable.
Sometimes, nor the reseteo aid, only learned the aid of the stage in memory.
A big disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, is to enter a specific way; otherwise, are impossible to take.
Other times you encontráis somewhere vehicles "civilian" always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or lleguéis five minutes sooner or later.
This makes rabiar especially in situations, when VEIS that two cars that are going to the meeting in opposite directions, your opponent is without problems, but when you, you must be either curb.
It is like when lleguéis, because it is scheduled for the "surprise" always happen in front of your nose.
The opponents also have an advantage.
Throughout the game llegaréis to places where, without taking into account the time, you are always at the same opponent in the same place.
Furthermore this happens at the end of the game, in a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must come before you, whatever the cost.
When it is in front of you, you makes the vision of cars that come from front, so that you can make porridge to start the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum dose of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that surely disappoint you immediately.
And it is a pity, because although the model of the journey is simple, the game is fun and action, so often it is not possible to continue to detail what happens or where.
And really gives equal, if the credit takes the idea with 50 clues exclusive or the classification in the race to avoid boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during the careers.
You must be alert to the petrol pumps at the side of the road, because then you must change their car, although in the vast majority of cases you what you will suffice.
Cars are divided into three categories.
The sports are suitable for urban areas, strong American cars for motorways and the exotic superdeportivos straight for a driving technique, for example, on mountain roads with curves.
In addition to main narrative thread is also a thread of challenges parallel, i.e., racing in specific locations that are known for the stories.
Conseguiréis here not only medals, but also points to experience for your profile, which serves both to the challenges as the tales.
To reach the highest level, the driver he opened several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds to the profile.
At the same time, there are connected a role Autolog online, which compares your results with those of other players and other Community disponibiliza functions.
One of the most difficult to understand is how it is made the last race in history.
With the car you until the subway tunnel (pass), where beneficiaries.35 ponéis to run in the dark on the tracks (go).
The os marks a speedometer between 150 and 200 km/h (go) and, suddenly, you get behind the convoy subway and goes ahead without further.
In the drafting may have a discussion about this for several days, whether during the programming of the game a little or none thought even if the authors we really taken by a bunch of stupid crooks.
The technical side of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects are in the majority of cases, pleasant, sometimes so impressive.
Because what a pity that, in the most tense moments it reduces the quality of image and, at times, in a serious way.
This particularly affects accidents where there are many players involved, when the quality of continuous image is no longer valid.
The audio is good and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to make the most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of his father and his mother," but you can assume that anyone would buy the game only for his music.
The final sense of need for speed: The Run is therefore quite confused.
If the game to avoid mistakes absolutely stupid, we would have problems in saying that The Run is the best game of NFS in recent years.
Gives the feeling that the game is not over.
The fun is insured, but preparaos because the mistakes will attack you in the eyes with the force of a spotlight on airport.

The ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation for manifestly and Eurosceptics.
"The Lisbon treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions'
"I had hoped that montase a merciless war."
"Will last five, six years before the situation has stabilised somewhat, calming and the new players to become accustomed to their new roles," so he began with conviction its conference in the Faculty of Law, the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová.
How does not take seriously its motto "clearly and openly about Europe," he said in the first part of the conference, when managed to describe each body of the EU and its relations with such precision and clarity, because it would be the envy of many speakers of the Faculty of Law of the Carolina Ulrich.
Vicenová also commended the work of the new permanent president of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first arise criticism, that if it is bland, an official grey, capable of taking any role, but I have to say that left all confused, because it takes its role to perfection."
"He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the 27 states, communicate with them and that has a clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new post of representative of the Common Foreign and Security stems from the question: "Who is this ΕU? What number can call it? 'Because it is an important step towards the unification and clarification of the political union for states such as China or India.
Nobody wants to prevent us from the cheese Olomouc
Vicenová has also dealt with the agenda was, is and will continue to the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago was a success.
The Czechs were emerging from the economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and held a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at the time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU has for the moment many commitments.
In the words of the ambassador: "A good fuss," not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is now being treated.
On the other hand, we must approve the budget for seven years in the EU, caused by the current economic situation, much more complicated.
If the budget is more simple and effective, what will have priority sectors, which countries will receive more support and less? This is something that will be on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled its main slogans, with those who came to Europe: "About Europe with clarity."
"The truth is that I do not like the abbreviations Ugly, the extranjerismos or the jargon that people do not understand."
"How can a citizen to understand that in Brussels is not fabricate really cucumbers cucumbers or curved free round, plátanos of various sizes or that nobody is going to ban the Olomouc cheese?".
It also aims to get more of the atmosphere of the EU and bring more Czech citizens to the European institutions.
We expect Europe of the speeds
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation of Eurosceptics and people perceived rather negative aspects that the positive.
Also regretted the low turnout of the Czechs in the European institutions.
The fault lies with a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write messages of motivation, but also the little support for the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, underscored the strength and the cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me when I go to a Polish and Hungarian and I was on a Slovak, a Frenchman in my hand, I said:" What, you have already left, those of the Visegrad Group?, "and you see that there is no laughing."
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenová, faces new regulations harsh budgetary policy for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, more than the new "European Federation."
"We need countries in the eurozone and countries outside the euro zone."
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
"Said for the first time that only those countries that want to cooperate and those who do not, to be left out."
"These procedures will be increasingly and strengthen the two-speed Europe", is expected Vicenová.
In this sense, also stressed the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the application of the principle, according to which all the issues that affect the entirety of the EU should be discussed between the member states, not just between the members of the eurozone.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM enters its second century of existence
If you seek a term defined with great precision the strategy of IBM, the clearest would be "long term."
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and, however, have already passed 100 years since its founding.
The basis of this character largoplacista the became the first head of the signing, the visionary Thomas J. Watson.
Because he coined the slogan that many of the world's problems can be solved if people are willing to think.
Its slogan "Think!" Became his trademark, around which will build the life of the future (giant was also the title of a magazine that IBM internal began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a culture of company carefully lifted.
"For us, IBM involves a long-term thinking, a continuous movement in the direction of the future.
IBM has survived and prospered over 100 years for that reason, because remained faithful to its basic principles, but without fear the changes around.
This has enabled us during our first century, transforming technology, business and society.
Hope prosper even more in our second century, "said during its anniversary, the current director of the company, Samuel J. Palmisano.
A sophisticated system
Watson, as in the 1930s, took care of their employees as the employer of Baťa in the Czech Republic (IBM employees were among the first American who enjoyed operators paid vacation, sure, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated system of remuneration that rewards the best inventors and sellers.
The same sophistication in the long term keeps IBM in the relationship with the customer.
Right from the beginning, the company was able to discover talents (to be one of the first global companies ending any kind of discrimination, could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan of IBM, which Palmisano to replace him next year a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has been working 30 years at IBM, where he has been head of sales, márquetin and strategies.
During the past few years, IBM has participated in the so-called virtual meetings, rain of ideas online, of which there are countless future strategies and innovations.
It is no surprise that allowed ideas, because in the signature work almost half a million people.
An institution with good reputation
The fixed position in the business gives the company a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM held a concept of institution rather than technology company," says the economist professor at the Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for users of technology," said George colony of the consultancy Forrester Research.
As the company itself says there is a difference between going into the business and create a business.
IBM - or the "Great Green" - as it is affectionately known in the US because of its logo, has become the last hundred years in one of the largest companies in the world.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (develops both hardware and software, infrastructure and services accommodation website within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
Holds the largest number of patents of all American technology companies and five of their employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among their inventions are the cash dispenser, payment cards, the swaps, the bar codes and diskettes.
IBM billed this year 220 billion dollars. This year has become the second technology firm by market capitalisation (the first is Apple), when for the first time Microsoft in 1996.
The future looking
Not all products and innovations have just to satisfy the taste of customers and the time (IBM not opted for its own operating system, os/2, online services Prodigy or computers IBM PCjr).
"If your business is based in advance, cannot emotionally anchored in the past," acknowledged Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problems in building their bases in other platforms (and equally, if they do not work, the leaves).
And this is the difference of competition, Microsoft, which basically is and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Of future technology
In terms of sales, IBM is devoted primarily to services, of which about one-fifth of programmes and one fifth of equipment.
However, even in 1990 equipment accounted for more than half of the quota of suppliers.
From the year 2000, IBM has sold low-yielding assets with a total value of $15 billion. During the same period, has invested $58 billion in the purchase of technology in the future.
Investments have followed since 2008, when for the first time was the modern global financial crisis.
IBM acts according to the premises of his first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investments.
It seems that until now the company IBM has managed to weather the crisis.
The value of the shares of IBM since the start of 2008 has grown estratosféricamente up to 120%, the net profit of the company has continued to increase.
The currency of IBM is change everything, except its value.
Can therefore expect that when the next crisis comes, this giant aguantará flexible.
IBM history: From the cutters of cheese until space flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, with its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM already adopted in the year 1924 - originally was a brand used in branches of Canada and South America.
The basis that resulted in the birth of IBM stems from the merger of four companies that date back to 1880's.
Possessed inventions such as the famous "clock out," which allows us to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired its supervisory board.
Flint fichó at the head of a company in competition, Thomas J. Watson, to assist with the management of the company.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (the ideas remain the firm basis on which underpin the corporate culture and identity).
Watson led the company until the year 1952.
IBM, as its name indicates, began with the production and sale of all kinds of devices for business, from cutting meat and cheese until tills.
During the first four years that Watson ran the company, billing doubled in 9 million dollars and began the vast expansion of the company by the continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company, almost 40 years after taking the chair of the leader, was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson junior.
Under his direction, IBM began work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, the staff and the computers of IBM helped NASA to guide flights into space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the series IBM System/360.
The classics "pecés", which established the standard of computers at the time, came to the market with the IBM 5150 in 1981.
20 years later, IBM sold its production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, became part of the consulting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer a complete advice and high value-added services.
The strategy that has paid IBM these last three years is the concept Smarter Planet, i.e., "a smarter planet."
Its aim is to make a more rational use of technology, but have not yet been planned or areas has been improved the circumstances, for example, in regard to transport and the administration of cities.
For the commercial sector, IBM introduced not long ago the platform "Smart Commerce" that allows retailers to manage the business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 opened a branch in the then Czechoslovakia, the first country that took in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR operates along the strategic center of outsourcing in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe has is in Prague. Here, too, there is a world-renowned research team that works with voice recognition.
Rychtářová about her husband infidel:
Iveta it, stay in that donkey, which I no longer want to!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it ended!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become the sole protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina remained hopeful that Josef woke up from his dream pink and would return home.
However it is not going to wait and has set clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can return home, but no longer as my partner," explained Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová hosted during the summer to Bartošové at home, could not even imagine how would your marriage.
Despite the request, Iveta had not been moved 30 days after Říčany and Pepe left to the singer.
So publicly stated that he loved.
With time, Darina resigned itself, apparently accepted the relationship of her husband and even sacked him forever.
To Rychytář does not care who goes to bed with his wife.
If one day Rychtář broke with Bartošová, his wife did not expect at home with open arms.
It is the biological father of my children and, if you want to live the rest of his life in our house, no one else will. "
"But here he would live no longer as my dear old borrico that was wrong, but as a man I have certain ties," said Rychtářová and added that had already been desenganchado of her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Josef until now does not care that woman he has closed the back door.
"I accept the decision of my wife."
"I will be with Iveta and there is no change possible."
"My wife established this as a marriage on the role and I respect that."
"The company remains in force, I make the arrangements of home care the garden, the home, make purchases."
"Darina and I talk to normality, the only thing is that we do not share a bed, said Rychtář.
If Rychtářová found a new love, he would not object.
"No you sleep together, and she does not interest me, or where it is going, or if you have a boyfriend.
I know that it is my fault, I enamoré of Iveta and I take full responsibility, "concludes Josef.
The worst vices of women: They relate to you?
If pedís men who are able to cite a few vices typical of women, in general, each of them will appoint them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize the following lines, citing certain vices female who manage to make the blood boil men?
To go shopping
Do you accuses his orange average of dependence on purchases?
Is that bought at least one trapito in week?
Would you like to buy often in rebates?
Then, in his case, it can say that shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that should appease his passion for purchases, at least a little.
But to see what woman could resist the temptation to walk without further by the clothes shops, finding clothes well adjusted and probárselas after all in the tester (ideally in all different colours)?
But for most women go shopping as a pastime, for men can become virtually in hell.
Just remember how many times he has already said his best cohabitee waiting in front of the door.
The constant dissatisfaction
"I am not too eye?"
"Would need to lose weight at least five kilos - should begin to exercise?"
"You really happy?"
Do you not ring these phrases?
That yes?
It is one of those women obsessed by their.
It is not that you should stop caring, but many men are allergic to listen to their partners complain all the time of their physical appearance.
The strong sex also agrees that the more increases the frequency of complaints, more annoying are women.
Order and the first cleaning
Infinite is like a merry-go-round.
Cleaning the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, mopping the soil, dust, mopping the bath and all that at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner that he has set foot on the soil with a clean dirty feet, their children that have marred newly cleaned a toilet and a shelf with glass doors that both cost clean?
If you suffer this "diversion," proves to be aware that nothing should be overstated and that the order and cleaning probably should not be be paramount in the family.
This desire harmless cleaning could threaten their relations and family welfare.
Make nasty comments
"The underpants used are left with the dirty clothes."
"You want to get those socks tomorrow also used"
"The damp rag not be left on the ground!"
If these comments to a couple more times a day, knows that it will take it out of their boxes.
Of course, you do not want to say anything bad, only wants to ensure that everything is in order.
Maybe, if they knew that men, women, for its part, would not make many comments.
And gossip slurs
Some women, they are also the smears, the gossip, but also the offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women are concentrated in relations, so I like to talk together of things the type who, where, with whom, how and why.
To the best to each of us sometimes is aware of a small and harmless setup.
With hand on heart, that is home to almost all women.
On the other hand, there are women chismosas of those that are not controlled, who love chismorrear and do so often, despise each and are dangerous for the surrounding them, especially in a female labour team.
Jágr Voráček and helped with their attendance to defeat the Philadelphia
The striker hockey Jaromír Jágr participated in the meeting on Monday with two NHL attendance that brought the victory over the Philadelphia 5:3 on the field of Carolina and returned to the Czech players at the forefront of the competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux took the game to the star of 39 years, and went a step further and was declared the best player in the game.
Was awarded two attendance in the party and also the Jágr, Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, Jágr claimed before overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a big night.
"I had said before the match that would triplete."
"Presentía."
"Sometimes seem ambushes," explained Jágr, after his performance to give him a goal for Giroux, following the first trallazo the Flyers.
A short time after the second intervention of the Czech team had a trail.
Voráček seized disk behind the goal for the Hurricanes and moved between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who got goals.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was thrown out, but since the beginning of the second part already dominated the Flyers.
Specifically Giroux.
After working with Jágr got the third goal, after his shot was colase for the fourth of the goal of Wayne Simmonds.
"I love to play with him."
"I am not saying that it is the best player on the field, but certainly is among the three best," weighed Jágr at its plant.
"I never would have happened at the end of my career was going to play with a sportsman like him."
"I am very happy about this."
"I want to play for him."
All these years in the NHL, my colleagues playing for me, and it now produces results, "adds Jágr.
Carolina even turned the match in a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and then again Dwyer, penalty, to get a goal away.
Matt Read did not allow more complications, but ended outnumbered two against one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
"Cleared the disk, I took speed and Read went to the most remote."
"I tried to atinarle the disk and I am happy because I managed," Voráček described the final goal of the game as he lived.
With his victory, Philadelphia has been head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav Špaček, not played until the end of the game against Buffalo, in the second quarter withdrew with an injury in the upper part of the body.
The Canadiens not only lost a player with a lot of experience in defense, but also by a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec failed to take advantage of one of the shootings.
More than the points lost to the local coach lamented the large number of injured in the last row, and play the game with only five defences.
"This is bad."
"We are the only party with a veteran player, the rest were inexperienced."
"In the end, but is against that nothing can be done, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"Both rotate players turned against us, we were able to resist."
"We had to further simplify the game, make the disk of our countryside."
"And so we leave gaps," explained one of the defenses, P.K. Subban.
The goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed 30 interventions of Winnipeg in the victory of 5:2 on the Tampa Bay.
The goals of jets were marked by five players that put an end to a series of defeats that has already lasted five parties.
How have evolved the prices of travel since 1989
Until 1989 in the then Czechoslovakia had only five state travel agencies authorized: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies of the time sold in most cases only travel to the socialist bloc, then travel to the West were very restricted.
Czech tourists were, therefore, on holiday to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union, in Crimea in the Black Sea to Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when you could travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime tipped towards the west and travel to the Czech tourists were then fairly restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e., also the Checoeslovacos) are not allowed to travel freely and individually or even by the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, Poland and the Soviet Union, needed a letter of invitation, if not, the individual travel was not possible.
Travel agencies in those days will also travel to the West, but one was put in the queue with a sleeping bag and spend it all night, or have "well known" in the agency.
Still not everything was won.
The so-called "promise of change" that was the condition for travel to the West, is not attached to the "people politically unreliable," that they could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without a guarantee of change, it was not possible to obtain resources (the West) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so we had a large number of huts and houses of summer, that the Czechs grew. This habit still persists.
The way to travel from the Czechs has suffered since 1989 a real revolution.
While until 1989 for us was not going over the holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs did 4.5 million holiday trips to countries around the world.
Is nna great paradox, which today because we are not aware of the fact that the current favorite destination, Croatia, until 1989 could not travel freely, because it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of the 1990s was imposed the exemption of visas to travel to the neighbouring states of Western Europe, which caused a huge wave of short-term visits, especially in Vienna or Germany.
The checoeslovacos, for a long time, there were sick of the excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see at least for a time.
For example, slept in Paris groups of Czechs in parks in tents, because our income then we were not allowed to pay for a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the Czechs at that time was carried with them (canned food, sausages, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech koruna, so our tourists could finally, after decades, buy freely Western currency.
Our standard of living and with him also increased average wages, what about 1997 led to an increase in demand for travel.
With the increase in demand for travel agencies began, from 1997 onwards regularly, to prepare for journeys using the connections of charter flights, which was incredibly lower fares in comparison with the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for the volume of passengers.
At the end of the 90 of the last century, because the Czechs travelling without a visa to almost all developed countries, except the US, which further simplified our trips.
Another interesting time in the history of tourism post-revolutionary happened back in 2000, when it was organised, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to a country exotic, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, are all those years direct charter flights with Czech tourists was distant countries and warm. This winter is already fly directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries currently visiting the nearly 100 thousand Czechs per year.
Another interesting time of this era, which symbolises our development post-revolutionary, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the US removed visas for Czech tourists, with what our country went to be among the world's most developed countries.
In 2008, Czechs, for the first time in its history, have spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in its history, have been spent on trips abroad more than 15 billion Koruny per head, including expenditure in the place of residence.
Ordinary General Assembly convened to elect the president, which could end up again in deadlock.
For nearly five months without Czech football is chairman and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Hašek as President of the Czech Federation of Soccer (FAČR), will not be known or after the convening of the next General Assembly meeting that will take place this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, it has not yet reached an agreement on the voting rules to follow.
Without them, will not even vote to choose between the three candidates.
Stakeholders to chair the Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned in June, but not before convening his colleagues with the aim of finding a strong person who knew the football in the future.
However, after the conclusion of the era Hašek, triggered a dispute between the two federations of partnership unable to reach an agreement to choose a candidate.
This was in evidence on 16 September when he had to be elected the new president.
General Assembly delegates gathered in vain in the National House (Národní dům), located in the district of Smíchov praguense, because the talks had been blocked and not only in terms of the method of choice.
No consensus was reached or in terms of who in the General Assembly had a right to vote - only the legal representatives or delegates with full powers.
From that moment, and because of this single point, there was a partial agreement, backed by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which the representation for full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation could not shed or the Executive Board, at its meetings, regular or extraordinary, basically did not solve anything.
The opinion on the possibility of vote has changed a couple of times already, but the worst point remains the same.
The question is: How to proceed in the third round to avoid the deadlock?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, which, from the direction of the association, which represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round win the candidate who has a higher percentage of support in the federation to which will present his candidacy.
The Region of Moravia is willing to reach a compromise so that it can win the candidate with a higher percentage of total votes in both federations.
The Bohemian, however, under the condition that the winner, according to these calculations percentage should have the majority of at least two-thirds.
"It would, however, the connection to the two previous rounds and completely negate the concept of a bicameral system," as Svoboda understands the objections of the Morava, according to which it would be better not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
With this, surprisingly, agrees also Tomaš Paclík, even if it means that the electoral rules laid down by the Statute of all candidates should be more Pelta.
"I would like to be voted the most in accordance with the statutes."
"Not to invent any nonsense about representatives at the last General Assembly," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is running for the first time as a candidate and that his comments directed mainly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, in Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes that the candidates in the future to cooperate constructively.
"All the passions are apaciguarán with the party today of our national team at the European Championship.
"Football will be a major player, and cooperate more at ease," says the representative of Jablonice, which of the three candidates has more experience in management of football, both professional and regional level.
Rajchl is the more reticent.
"I hope that an agreement is reached, but, unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated."
"This is not about the conflict between Bohemian and Moravian, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience."
"This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly."
"Anyway, I hope that common sense will prevail," said Rajchl.
Because there is not much time for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be made in Montenegro, but who can know until we start the party if the football team will be complete?
The special plane, which had to travel to Podgorica, among other vice-presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not emerged this morning by technical problems in Prague, having to find an alternative to transport to the executive committee will take place at the place where the party of classification.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, finally, it could be that will take place at ministerial level, which, according to be held this Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, I would very much like to incorporate the parties divided the country's most powerful sports organization to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: State subsidies, the credibility of football and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak federation of sport (ČSTV) that will try to give a new direction to the Czech sport after the financial problems of the house of Sazka lotteries.
Paclík will strive to reach the presidency, because there is a more suitable candidate.
If the head of the footballers of Pilsen, Tomaš Paclik, before the General Assembly extraordinary knew the name of a suitable candidate that would satisfy all his ideas on the new chairman of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), or run as a candidate for a seat as relevant.
"If there is a right person, I would be fighting for it and not me as a candidate in the elections."
"But until now it has not been able to find such a person," said Paclík for the Czech News Agency (ČTK)
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of block Pelta, the presumed winner of the elections, which opens the way for the presidency of the Czech Federation of Soccer (FAČR).
Paclík also points out that, in case defeat, would remain in the office of president only until 2013, when reached the turn of ordinary general assembly.
In that role he would like to see an expert and a good manager who is not too connected with the football events.
"I have already spoken to some people who could take into account."
"For me it was crazy to hear some say that at this moment not even want to identify with the Czech football."
"I would like to change that vision," he adds.
What supposedly more upsets Paclík at this moment is Pelta's relationship with the president of the Football Association of Regional Plzeňský Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the little world as a powerful lobista with ability to influence the vote of delegates in the General Assembly.
For Paclík is as unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the chair.
"If it wins, it would maintain the current status in football and nothing will change."
"With the support of Berbra, a businessman ambitious, football will draw even less advantage," said Paclík.
Also mentions the fact that a few years ago the name of Pelta was associated with a wiretapping during the investigation of a case of corruption, of which Pelta went unpunished.
"I don't know what football prestige could bring the victory of Pelta."
"And with what eyes we will look UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, which also takes some caution with his earlier statement that "it would sell the club Pilsen if Pelta becomes president."
In the case of winning the elections on Thursday, Paclík cooperation with Pelta could arise in the future.
Of same opinion is the other candidate, Rajchl, which has been supported by Paclík before the General Assembly in September that ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to be followed."
"It is very capable."
"I could imagine, for example, as head of the representation."
"But not as manager of a partnership."
"I am not the nose where I am not capable," added Paclík, which attracted a lot of attention in September to support the suspension of the referees committee chaired by Ludek Marcel, replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that dare to manage the partnership.
Uses its management capabilities of private companies, since last summer, is also the Director of Pilsen, with its support held in May the triumph in the first division.
"I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to their practice safe."
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary committee and appeal, producing unpleasant situations, said Paclík without burying its antipathies toward the president of Sparta Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities also would be to strengthen the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which exerts pressure on political leaders to spend more money to the sport of taxes in the lottery.
"It is one of the key problems that should be devoted to the new president."
"If you raise taxes on gambling, as it announced the political parties, would support their arguments, but, frankly, they have to tell us where it ends up all this money," says.
Moreover, Paclík now does not take into account even its association with the of Club Pilsner, although he says that the President of the FAČR must be "non-partisan."
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla Prague.
"It is not ideal."
"But I see no sense to give hypocritically my actions of the Club of Pilsen to another person and then to return there after a year and a half," said Paclík.
FAČR Pelta promised the new statutes that would end up with the deadlock of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, would ensure that the FAČR had a new statutes that definitely serve to solve, in the future, the controversies regarding the electoral rules.
The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about the meeting this Thursday in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Even before the elections not made in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely in the representation and raise funds.
Decided to participate in the last minute at the last general assembly, so this postponement of two months I could go either to defend and present, in a broader context, their ideas on the management of football.
"The people of all levels of football is a long time ago and hopes to know this Thursday, the new President."
"They feel that the time has come for someone to manage the partnership," thinks the man who is associated mainly with the Club of Jablonice, but who worked in the Sparta and in the executive committee of the Association.
For this reason, believed to have enough experience to manage the Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, in the General Assembly in June were approved the statutes that were not as perfect as we thought."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we need a president since September," Pelta warned.
Exactly the readjustment of the most important document of the Civic Association was used as decoys to win the delegates.
"If I am elected president, I take it as a personal challenge and I am ready to respond in the event that it fails."
"It is a matter of principle, without which we cannot exist," says Pelta.
Moreover, in theory, is trying not to mess with their opponents.
Already in the past had warned that it was working with Henry Rajchl, respect for their training in law, be aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
It was a long time without attacking Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, left no puppet with head.
"Takes more than a year in the world of football, and has already achieved some successes."
"Their attacks but were shameful and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
"So many of them have doubts about its true nature," he said to his opponent Pelta, which remains faithful to the statements already announced in September.
Its most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from lower competitions until the superior.
The latter should be a showcase of promotion of football.
"Also, try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of the corruption scandal last year."
"Immediately after I would involve in negotiations with the public and private sectors, to ensure that there is enough money for all football," he said two months ago to ÈTK the candidate of 46 years.
Then also promised that his appointment as president of football will not lead to any change staff of the workforce.
"Should know first tasks of each employee," he said referring to Strahov where, after a long period of lawlessness, there is an understandable anxiety.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios predicting that before the next general assembly, he believes that the delegates will not travel in vain to Nymburk this Thursday.
"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, certainly we shall overcome.
"Football needs credibility, which will recover only if finally takes a leader," still two days before the day more decisive in his career of representative, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises, that under his leadership, the FAČR would start to work with renewed vigour.
If, in the fourth General Assembly elected the current vice-president Jindrich Rajchl as the new chairman of the Football Association, many people would probably be resentful.
Rajchl promised that, if elected, he would work hard.
It wants to implement a systematic change and make that members of the executive committee are responsible for each area of football individually.
Also undertakes to resolve the case of the Bohemians, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, get more money for football and continue with the work begun by the former president Ivan Hašek.
"As president, I would like to devote myself full football."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA until the selection, via professional football or the training of young footballers of high performance."
"This is not to say that it would do everything alone," he said in an interview for Rajchl ÈTK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the powers of the executive committee in such a way that each member can engage in a specific area."
"And asignaré difficult tasks for that football can, in each of those segments, go ahead with a lot of momentum."
"To many people that probably would not be happy, because it will begin to work very hard and not just to criticise the work of others," he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, said that he had considered the possibility of not stand again as a candidate.
"You know, that work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this makes sense and that there will be people behind me and I will stop at every turn," explained the reasons for his indecision.
"A lot of people told me that I must not give up, because then they would give up others."
"It is to have faith in order not to leave as well, without more," he said.
They say, also motivates him to continue the work already started with Hašek.
"During those two years, it ended a large part of the work that I do not want now be lost."
"There are processes that had begun and that will have its effect within a couple of years and I would not like to see someone the stop," announced worried by the fact that, if you choose to another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the partnership could return to be as it was before the era of Hašek.
"I believe in order, and that is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
"Behind him is especially all those people who would take care of football to be just a privilege for a select few."
"I can blame a lot of things, but not the fact that I am in favour of someone."
"Attempt to be objective."
"I would like to make a football for all, because only then will be well all and not just those elected," said Rajchl.
Also rejects the idea that only serious bohemio the president.
"Although some people are trying to pretend otherwise, I have in mind to do the utmost to Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about the fact the split second division in a Czech side and another Morava, whose winners would go to the first division."
"Does not give the current situation in which we have only three teams of Moravia, which is a problem for the Moravians young players," said Rajchl.
Although the battle of the presidential elections joined Tomaš Paclík, president of the Club Pilsner, Rajchl continues to believe in his chances of being elected.
"I still have a strong support from the Czech Federation, which I chose as his vice president and who knows that there are clear successes behind me," said Rajchl, whose successes include saving tens of millions of kroner disadvantageous contracts, negotiations of television contracts and negotiations on the law of the lottery.
On the other hand, recognises their share of the blame for the federation is not united.
And while Pelta proclaims that it is "disqualified to restore confidence in the Czech football," believes the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
"Nobody can deny that did a great job in the Pilsen that year."
"In the event that is elected, probably will continue to what already began Ivan Hašek exchange rate and not significantly the number of staff in the committees."
"I do not want to use that in my favour," assesses their rivals Rajchl.
Europe's most beautiful swimming pools
The blue leap
Julia Stanek for
Swimming pools from an incredible perspective, sumptuous restrooms in Budapest: Who visit Europe can live their wonderful blue, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their weary legs in bathrooms bubbly.
A book shows where is the best welfare in the water.
When Iris Meder conducted a research trip during the past year and a half, there was something that could not be lacking in their luggage, a swimsuits shown.
Backs lying down on the water, looked the artistic leadership at the top, swam towards the angelotes of marble, that the expected on the edge of the pool and pool deck asombraba before the modernist meticulously restored.
I liked the bathroom, noted in his book at the time of all the interesting details about the style and the history of the building.
The architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way and presented in his recent book "Badefreuden": Swimming pools covered in Munich, the historic palaces of bathing in the Black Forest, "concrete buildings" in Taunus.
Made his "journey by the most extraordinary baths of Central Europe" by 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, visited places of Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This German 46 years is a real fan of the culture of the bathroom.
Wants nothing to do with the sport, said Meder, only water is different.
Only bothers him that fans will have to settle for bath blue tiles and smell of chlorine, while fans can breathe fascinating to run the smell of forests of fir trees or listen to the cheerful trinos of birds in the park.
"One day I wondered why the swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the head of Vienna.
"I began collecting fine swimming pools."
The surface of the water double the architecture.
The chapoteo in the swimming pool and the ethereal oils of the sauna. The factor of welfare in the swimming pools is so great because it addresses all the senses, according to Meder.
And if the builder strives, covered swimming pools can be a real gift to view: "Instead of soil, in the bathrooms are covers an area of water."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand, reflects the beauty of the whole building."
All bends optically: High vaults, the tiles of colours, the launch pads.
The book with photographs in small format "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data on the architecture and history of art in the historic oasis of welfare, but, one might be tempted to jump to the blue.
Meder, the collector of swimming pools discovers the copies in its investigations in Hungary.
Alongside the magnificent medicinal baths as the Széchenyi of Budapest, 100 years, are the waters with nitrates in a unique kárstica cavity (baths in cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as a spa, whose swimming pools are alkaline water and are in a building with a bottle (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Many swimming pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular view: While the entire city puts the eyes in the swimming pool of Zurich overhead, you can look at Arlberb, covered in snow, from the outside of a swimming pool in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bath is a window from which you can see the practice in the ski runs.
The design, perhaps, more extraordinary expected to customers in Längenfeld: The cathedral of water Ötztal seems a ovni just land in the Alps.
Steam rises from three sources open in winter, while in the mountains of Ötztal standing up in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
At Meder, the collector of swimming pools, it was invading the smell of chlorine in all the swimming pools.
Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, in the bathrooms of Árpád in Békescsaba, Hungary, the plague on diesel is so strong that people think we have reached a health bathing.
The smell comes from medicinal waters containing bicarbonate and alkali and whose loam sticks to the skin to enter into the swimming pool, a Enjoyment welfare in a special way.
Iris Meder is also disappointed in a place in their quest for beautiful places for bathing, when he wanted to visit discovered swimming pools and baths sun bathing in the Czech Luhatschowitz, found itself with a blocked field.
The bloodbath 1902 the architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the windows of the building abandoned modernist red, white and yellow, saw the undergrowth grow between the tiles.
Counters the decline in a lovely pool in the Black Forest: The Palace spa in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction behind; not only can discover neorománicos elements in times of its construction in 1844, if not an Arab hall style Alhambra, added in 1900.
Since his diligent modernization in 1995, the Palace spa bath is the favorite of the collector of swimming pools, Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural for the Black Forest.
"Has a lot of merit merge different architectural styles in a unit so fantastic," says Meder.
In a palace immersion in the swimming pool and spa apparently has no great importance.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank analyzes the business of raw materials
To Christian Teevs
Does renunciation Deutsche Bank to its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to Spiegel-online, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to see the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the matter is clear, according to a study by 84 per cent of Germans do not find it acceptable that banks speculating with agricultural commodities such as wheat and maize.
Two-thirds of respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions will be withdrawn from this business because intensifies the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study was based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann shows that betting on the global commodity exchanges are up prices, and banks are burdened with the responsibility of the global problem of hunger.
The campaign of the ombudsman is aimed in particular to Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although the big banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting in a similar fashion.
Originally, betting on raw materials are thought to protect traders of swings in prices.
The main experts agree that the players have been decoupled from the offers and demands, and reap profits of the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism differently than the American competitors: Promised to review the claims and said that no business "deserves to compromise the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
According to Spiegel online, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the report of Foodwatch.
The analysis should be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the directive of Deutsche Bank, along with the recommendation of how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the management of the bank will report of the consequences.
The end there could be a reduction in the business of raw materials, or even its total abandonment.
Ackermann is trying to fix its image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news, but reaffirmed their criticism of the financial sector: "Betting on rising food prices are particularly dramatic how ruthless the banks are currently the public welfare."
Ackermann stands as the largest banking lobbyist, especially in the obligations.
"Deutsche Bank should cancel all investments in his portfolio in the game to put in the money for stakes of food prices," said Bode.
"It does not matter if Ackermann is the subject of people suffering from hunger or the fame of Deutsche Bank."
The inspection of Ackermann is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect picture a few months before leaving his post.
Monday, Deutsche Bank wrote that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different to what had not planned on the board of directors.
With the abandonment of the controversial land speculation can improve its image.
And needs that barely interested potential losses, this will be his successor.
Two-thirds would rescind the investment in raw materials
Foodwatch struggles to keep the pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 netizens have participated in the campaign of the organisation.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey by the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Barely 10 per cent considered legitimate that Deutsche Bank offered investments in the bet that food prices.
Many bank customers showed personal consequences to discover that his bank was involved in such business: According to the survey, two-thirds would rescind all investments of the money that comes from land speculation.
The 43 per cent would advise against such a bank to their acquaintances, 49 per cent would, after reflect, cancel your account and would change to another institute.
The house 21 in Vienna
Moved the flag
Ingeborg Wiensowski on
A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the flag of the Austrian exhibition in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, was in Vienna for a museum, was empty and collapsed.
Now it reopens as home of exhibitions.
The architecture of modern postgerra passionate about, forms clear, the halls of glass, the bold curves and new construction materials, typical of thought on the technical progress, for which the Austrian flag of architect Karl Schwanzer for the exhibition of 1958 Brussels is a good example and known.
The Pabellón of Schwanzer won the Grand Prix of Architecture for his slight and floating construction of steel and glass.
The building is considered to present a milestone of the contemporary architecture.
To the well-known architect who also built the flag of Austria in the next exhibition.
With his legendary tower for four cylinders MBW more the adjacent building bulldozed in Munich, became internationally known.
Its flag, designed as a temporary building for exhibitions was lifted after the exhibition in the Schweizer Garten alongside the station south of Vienna, was amended in 1962 and opened a museum of the 20th century, was called the "house 20."
The building was appropriate but lacked the appropriate technology and space for a museum; no wall to hang art, or a good atmosphere.
Despite this was used until the contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building is empty since 2001 and increasingly lapses.
Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the flag, now calls it "home 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
Tuesday afternoon opened the Belvedere museum, which owns the house, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in some way.
Agnes Husslein-Arch, the new director of the Austrian Belvedere gallery since 2007, achieved a new beginning.
Husslein-Arch, doctorate in art history with a remarkable career, among other things, artistic patinadora on ice in his youth, later in ', the Guggenheim museum director and founder of the modern art museum of Salzburg, made the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established its use.
With the exception of contemporary art, are the work of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the foundation document -, there should be a bar and a bookshop and also built an office building.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.
Not only because reformed so sensitive the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, expanded and was awarded the contract, if not because studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the flag was for him a "important place and immense," which was "almost every weekend" exhibitions.
Knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his transfer to Vienna in exchange for use with generosity and easily.
In the current reforms there are big problems, the building was "a devorador of energy," said Krischanitz.
It changed the profile of the windows on the facade of glass, was installed an insulating glass fibre reinforced glass and replaced the glass ceiling for a special safety glass.
The thermal bridges and steel beams were strengthened or substituted and the ceilings of asbestos were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a panel of light declined between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the building almost new, but still the flag of Schwanzer.
Remain the original external doors, the house is painted in shades old mahogany and protected against rust.
And the cinema is exactly as it was before.
And all this with a strict control on the part of the office of monuments and a low budget.
"Often had to find material that was good, cheap and also would like to the office of protection of monuments," says Krischanitz and warns of a harsh land in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and light.
Flag as "that came from Brussels" has been difficult, said recently Krischanitz, a typical "casual appearance in the history of the city."
An architecture that is "always in the wrong place," and that is why I wanted to "raise awareness appropriate."
In this case the house 21 is not in the wrong place, has been planning a stroke of luck. The entirely new and planned "district of the central police station," with houses and offices, sits alongside the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps happen another stroke of luck: The house 21 could receive a strengthening of other construction of Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the room of temporary art and Berlin, as you hear, negotiated with the city on a neighbour in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn is planning a package of crisis of winter amounting to millions
The company has devised a plan of crisis, which would prevent the unserviceability of trains in winter.
To double the number of staff.
It costs millions.
In the fight against the unserviceability and train delays caused by the winter, Deutsche Bahn has been spent on this year more than 70 million, according to a newspaper report.
The newspaper Bild "reported, citing an internal crisis plan of the group, planned investments until 2005, out of a total of around 300 million euros.
So what should be better availability of vehicles and the rail network even with a long pass.
Among other things, plans to double the internal and external employees to 16,000 jobs to remove snow from the tracks and platforms.
The aim is to clean up the snow and ice platforms for the operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for the operation at the end of four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, chairman of Deutsche Bahn, warned breakdowns and delays to trains also during this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in passenger transport, because, among other things, he failed reservations about adverse weather conditions.
Many regional train for years waiting for a new authorisation of the federal railway office.
There is a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to see the axes of high-speed trains often in the workshop, after a high-speed train was the rupture of an axis in the central police station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank pays millions in fines in the US.
After the tumult on the president Josef Ackerman, there is a new problem for the US, Deutsche Bank must pay a fine millions.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutche Bank, its past in the US is the giant of the industry, the Institute of Frankfurt pays $145 million (106 million euros) in a deal to end the feuds due to the bankruptcy of five major credit unions during the financial crisis.
Is the sale of mortgage securities.
The regulation of financial markets NCUA criticizing many big banks induce credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; they have downplayed the risks.
Such titles lost their value during the financial crisis and lead banks to the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank does not admit any fault with the agreement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which forced a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, chairman of the NCUA, held the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for credit unions in the US and provides support in the event of bankruptcy to protect investments of customers.
The NCUA tries to reintegrate the losses caused millions.
The agreements are currently closed its first type.
The regulator had also asked accounts to other big banks and in summer filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of the dubious mortgage securities, are the so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing loans.
When the US housing bubble burst in 2007, led to the downfall of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results came a few years ago, currently a wind is blowing complicated for US banks.
Investors and inspection countless processes have begun to receive compensation or punish mistakes.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has been the greatest number of demands.
Accuses the 18 major international banks that the two US state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were seized in the business of mortgages in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has a demand of the FHFA, it is business for $14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection demands that the Institute of Frankfurt responds to "substantial losses," without naming an exact figure.
Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that he wants to defend himself.
Warren Buffett helps with 10 billion to IBM
The guru of finance, Buffett, invests heavily in the company of Information Technology IBM.
Since March has acquired shares with a value of more than $10 billion.
Until now, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not invest in companies of computers or Information Technologies since the forecasts of the long-term development of companies are negative.
But he has read the report of IBM and changed his opinion on investing in the sector.
Due to understand much earlier than IBM offers on all services and tries to computer systems for the departments of Information Technologies of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment from Warren Buffett is regarded as an honour.
Therefore, the primitive Information Technology should be called "Sir IBM."
Buffett unveiled today in the station CNBC economy that has acquired IBM shares valued at $10.7 billion dollars since March.
His Berkshire Hathaway investment has risen to one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a participation of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said that IBM failed until now nothing of the compromise.
Praised the direction that dealt with the ordinary benefits in the economic crisis.
"They have done a brilliant job," said Buffett on the strategy.
IBM set for some time the services of the Information Technology lucrative as the operation of centres of calculation.
The old computer pioneer of more than 100 years also offers advice as well as powerful software and equipment for businesses.
Buffett avoided technology companies to date.
He said that only invested in companies whose business understood.
On the contrary, Buffett used the occasion in a freight train, a manufacturer of lubricants or a mechanical engineer.
His Berkshire Hathaway owns nearly roughly 80 subsidiaries own, as well as part of a whole series of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81 years, took charge of the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 60 and, with wise investments, the expanded into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his lifestyle is humble.
This is an idol for countless investors around the world.
Its rapid and foolproof way to earn money has given him the nickname of "Oracle of Omaha".
After discovering the investment from Buffett, the actions of IBM in stock exchange rose one percent.
"The giant blue, as it is known to IBM, has a stock market value of more than $220 billion dollars and, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, said Buffett, does not want to cooperate.
Bill Gates, its founder, is a close friend.
The threat is
Following the discovery of "the cell of Zwickau," the Turkish media have doubts about the state of German law.
A newspaper spoke of a "bloody ideology" that returns to be rekindled.
The murders of eight small entrepreneurs tricks and Greeks between 2001 and 2006 have a background of the extreme right.
In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin has reacted with fear and concern about this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin returns a ghost who believed died long ago, since the attacks with the form of fires in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, had not happened more episodes of violence with extreme right-wing background against Turks.
However, it has never been questioned in Germany there is xenophobia.
The rightist network uncovered reveals a magnitude dimensions were not far from predictable.
"Hear to reignite the bloody ideology?", called the Turkish newspaper's online edition "Haberturk."
The newspaper "Sabah" highlights on the contrary to one of the authors of the crime was an informant for the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the Pantanal far-right.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, the weekend reminded the victims of racist violence with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin with German politicians and Turks reflected in a solemn ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
Coexistence was on the scene with gaudy colors, as a story with a happy ending.
The information came to some Turkish media as a slap in the face, "the German gift for the 50th anniversary," says the title of an article in the Turkish internet platform, "Haber X," referring to the background of the string of murders.
The German emission "'Hürriyet'" nor insists chart this mental connection.
"Begins to smell bad," says the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
Stresses that those killed were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with his work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In Internet forums of Germans of Turkish origin, the behavior of the police and their subsequent success in searches are discussed very critically.
The authors have been amazed that the German authorities have not sought much earlier suspects in the circle of the ultra-right.
One is the less rhetorical regarding the drastic means: "From now on there is lost, immigrants have little more than self-defense and weapons."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"Germany's domestic peace depends heavily on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the entire network.", writes "Selen."
Which means that, if the domestic peace of Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen will be clarified in 90 years.
The image of the ruins of the fire of Solingen has been etched in German and Turkish memoir.
No other event showed more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a specific threat, and the Germans, who mistrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks are exacerbating the feeling of group of the Turkish side.
Not to repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press was criticized then mainly the deficiency of German politics after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of Mölln.
Following the attack in the form of fire in Solingen sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president and Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister, replaced in the funeral of Cologne. Kinkel detailed in his speech what they contribute to the taxes the Turks in Germany.
It is clear how it calculates the value of a person according to the amount of their taxes.
The current information Turkish media returns to show how deep it is, since then, the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort of a comprehensive explanation and a reassessment of the extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, this time we need frank words.
The bank of Lake Zurich scandal
The bank more risky in Europe is not in Italy or France, if not in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and since then slid from one crisis to the next.
Now directs a German.
Not sure that Axel Weber had thought.
After his dramatic departure from the summit of the federal bench in July was known in 2013 would start in a new and almost equally spectacular work: President of the administrative council of the great Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber is happy publicly praised for its beauty and Switzerland's UBS for its newly acquired solidity and leaves fall kind remarks about their future colleagues.
"The USB has achieved a revitalization."
"I am happy to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September, it became clear that everything would be entirely different.
A USB financial operator in London avoided all the bank's security systems and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, director-general of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to go.
The chairman of the administrative council of USB was seen since then also touched on, and all asked: When is Axel Weber?
Weber was known to advise the bank since February 2012.
And will take over the chairmanship of the administrative council in May, not at the beginning of 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
This is hard to Axel Weber.
It is not a banker, rather, economics professor and adviser and has had a period of adjustment is probably necessary.
Coup is responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just returned to prove that deserves the title "the biggest bank of the scandal of Europe" for some time.
On the one hand, the USB is enormous, until recently, was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, is mired in a scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, he saves at once so proud Swiss bank.
Began the financial crisis.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the Swiss property manager discreet and solid, but also tricky, combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a large number in the investment banks.
On the one hand, with 1.6 trillion, the USB manages more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, advanced as investment bank in the league of big banks in the world.
This impressive.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and subsequent professor of banking in Zurich for many years, explains: "To my students, I have always described the USB as a model of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, one wonders: How could be wrong?"
Was in a big mistake.
In 2007, it came to light that something went very wrong in the sticks.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, director general, which until then was regarded as a brilliant banker and very intelligent, surprisingly resigned.
A few months later, suspected the reason.
The fund's investment bank embarked on losses with high-risk securities and had to write off billions.
To shoulder this, the USB announced a capital injection of nothing less than 13 billion francs.
For this found investors, of course that some look with contempt until shortly before: A state fund Asian and opaque of Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, which had never been heard his name.
This was only the first blow.
In April 2008, worsened.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, the chairman of the administrative council, in 2006 in the second-best paid administrative council of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, continued the disaster, in view of its misguided investments, the UBS was found in the financial crisis facing bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought distressed securities to the UBS by many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, which became co-bank.
All Switzerland was affected, it said the dramatic that was this for a small country, if all such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007 was more than five times greater than the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"We cannot go back to rescue the UBS," said Geiger, an expert in banking.
The first disaster joined the second.
A few months later, the UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and was ready to hand over details of wealthy clients, which may have disappointed taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, adopted a figure of 780 billions of dollars, reimbursement of unwarranted benefits of these business with compensation for payment.
With this, the UBS confessed more or less have helped in tax fraud.
At the same time lost something that had always been its capital in the competition for wealthy clients: The glow of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secrecy is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the chairman of the board and the president of the administrative council.
And the exodus of funds of clients.
In this way, in a few months, the bank lost its credibility in its two key areas: In the investment banking through the erroneous speculation and in the administration of goods through aid for tax fraud.
And just when he returned to be more calm, just when it was thought that the UBS returned to achieve this, it is this wretched history of the operator, an individual operator defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realised that something was wrong.
And it was unveiled, apparently, this still does not work well with the management of risk in the investment banking.
"With the case Adoboli statesing that risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, a professor of economics and finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem of the UBS is not that dominates the risk controls."
So the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers were submitted for some time, be the guardians of the greatest assets of the world: No risk too big, on the other hand, the safety of the money it wants to break on the other side of the Alpine republic.
Security deposits of Swiss banks were the symbol of the iron reliability, as Lindt chocolate Sprüngli and real.
The plant of the UBS in Zurich does not fit with the cliché of the strong Swiss private bank, is only a little higher.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters in the street Bahnhofstraße of Zurich, which runs from the main station directly to the lake in Zurich, surrounded by snow-covered summits of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, rents are among the highest in Europe.
Here are smash as Tiffany's between traditional business as the Swiss confectionery Sprüngli.
Living here for years the Swiss banks: From the national bank, through the palace of Credit nothing, until the elitarios private banks as Julius Bär.
It comes into the reception room of the UBS through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are lined with marble, before they are large leather chairs, along with the bank's logo is a great sign to indicate the "security".
The UBS knows what the customer wants here: Security.
The two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit nothing, at some point have shifted the idea of the big Swiss bank, or have betrayed, as does the president of a small Swiss private bank.
Prefers not to read her name in the newspaper, after all, as all Swiss bankers, also with the business of the two big banks.
The UBS has become too big, believes, mainly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
The Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And have been used for a long time to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
Indeed, the UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, gave his first major gain and then came the disaster, no European financial entity had lost so much money in the jungle of high risk as the big Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was obvious.
"This Wednesday, the coalition government of the tiny country of seven million decided the greatest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash" ("The crash of the UBS" in Spanish).
Politicians gave up to 68 billion francs, or approximately 45 billions of euros to save the big bank of bankruptcy.
How it happens?
Talks with Swiss bankers, see the problem in the dimension of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merge into a powerful consortium.
There is a bank that, due to the merger, was too big for the small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So that served for the two different banks precursors of the UBS complement: A bank rich but slept with the heart of the administration of goods in Zurich and internationalization poorer but stronger.
Suddenly, investment banks internationalized arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, which could make a great financial bike.
There are two names associated with the rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the Association of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then president of the administrative council.
"I always thought that Wuffli Ospel and were a perfect team," says the expert on banking Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, that meant a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, intuitive that managed to make headway since learning in the bank until the summit."
Finally, Ospel relied on Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "Thought that their models were a reality," said Geiger.
"It is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: The Nonsense came before the event.
Employees of the UBS clearly remember meetings of managers, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same slogan: Lowering the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
Topped the "League tables," classifications that then documented the success of the banks.
The UBS wanted to be at the summit.
Some steps he went well.
In the operations of foreign currency and in the negotiation of actions was higher.
However, the business advisers charged showed a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the language of banking "fixed income," there is a huge compensation for the big banks.
The UBS has gaps in the American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, the UBS began an adventure that nearly cost him his life.
Eager for growth, invested so much the same bank as one of its hedge funds created American investments in high-risk.
Transformed itself into a powerful machine to securitise mortgages American and then sell them, maintaining certain risks to their own account.
And also, as other banks sought the fall for a long time.
"In the summer of 2007, as the American housing market was in flames, the UBS bought there," said Geiger, an expert in banking.
So great euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave, because the attempt to organise turned out to be more complicated than expected.
Posts in the UBS became proyectables seats and are unsafe until today.
Currently, who heads a large bank, has an almost impossible job.
Must find a strategy for a bank, to which all the logical business models are lost.
Geiger, an expert in banks, has an idea, put an end to the investment banking, concentrate on property management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go so far (yet).
But the investment banking should reduce much, it is clear today.
The next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new president of the bank, will present its future strategy to the world.
In reality, it was only in the Italian-Swiss 51 years as a transitional solution, because the bank the bank is surprisingly Grübel separated from his predecessor.
In the meantime, he imposed: Should conduct permanently business of UBS, told the bank in Zurich on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-1990s.
Deletes 3,500 jobs.
But this is not enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is?
What he wants to earn money?
These are the questions that are sure Axel Weber.
So far only said that first seek a house with his wife in Zurich.
The next year.

Smart Grajos spread in cities
In many places the grajos are considered "birds problematic": These are not expelled inteligentísimos animals of cities for a long time, say experts.
About love, others want to get rid of them very quickly, for years the grajos belong to the image of the city, but in many municipalities accumulate complaints from neighbors in the dirt and noise of animals.
Although there has been no way against the "birds problematic" until now.
The grajos no longer out of cities, say experts in the first symposium on grajos to read, East Friesland.
There the specialists throughout the national territory argue about possible solutions.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Environmentalists attribute the problems of the cities to migration from the countryside of certain grajos protected; chemical applications in agriculture have visibly with the traditional habitat.
Hunting, the growing construction and falling trees that the guests make the lives of birds.
The grajos are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 reproductive partners in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as read.
There in 2005 jumped to the negative headlines of the press a controversial project to kill grajos en masse to the district.
Critics have described the hunting of the animals through traps for birds and murder with sticks as particularly brutal.
"And throwing ahuyentándolos of normal way achieves nothing," said Werner Klöver, 's landscape and read.
Shoot with water to the nests or throw trees tend to be unintended consequences, also says Manfred Kaiser, an expert in environment of Lahr and Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are diverted, the large colonies of divide and distributed in other places."
Chasing them away is only conceivable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We must live with them, no longer the atrapamos."
Without the vicinity, does not solve the problem in cities, believes Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of reading.
It is possible a combination of scaring animals in residential areas and sensitive bait to return to settle elsewhere.
"Information panels instead of chainsaws' Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and against etnóloga advertised in order to treat animals in a completely different way:" The best thing is that we can withstand a peak in the face with aplomb. "
Jürgens cofounded in Schleswig-Holstein the circuit on the teaching of Ascheberger grajos, where signs are reporting on the lives of the intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has its own opinion about the criticism by the noise of the birds: "Are all forms of communication, have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the grajos not only exploit the resources for accessing bocados shale, if not producing tools to use them as resources.
Recently, etólogos of Cambridge University found in four grajos far does the intelligence of birds.
In an experiment, the birds learned quickly that they had to drop a stone on a platform in order to achieve a larva of moth.
Without much training, acknowledged with determination the size and the form it should take the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second test, the shrewd grajos had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small bucket with a moth larva of in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach their prey with the peak.
But researchers have left a piece of wire.
With the four animals were a hook, which caught the bucket in the sharp of the tube.
Three of the four grajos they did in the first attempt.

Personal level massacre
The intense and generous new book by Peter Englund, The beauty and the pain of the battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An intimate story of the First World War, "begins with a long dramatis personae of the kind that can make one falls the soul to their feet.
Here are some tips for action: Start mildly this page and make it a their brand pages.
It will be very familiar with these people in the narrative novelística of Mr Englund, and this dramatis personae will work as their GPS, a beacon for those few moments in which, as one of his men and women, is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr Englund is a historian and journalist.
It is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
What he has written here is an unusual book, which describes, rightly, as "a work of anti-story."
Contains some notable names, treated important or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It is not so much a book about what happened, explains, "a book about how it happened." Is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and states of humor."
"The beauty and the pain of the battle" combines the experiences in times of war of more or less ordinary men and women 20, on both sides of the war, from schoolchildren and Gardens to escaladores, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrative.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, or lose its members, will become crazy or die.
Their lives parpadean here as votivas candles lit in a church; new ones are added to the mix, while others turn off lights.
The book by Mr Englund is a departure from the standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that the First World War, was the only fatal trench warfare on the western front.
"The beauty and the pain of the battle" moves of expertly through other theatres of war: The Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, eastern Africa.
Soldiers in this book I fall over the hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the flies fly-fly are an intractable problem.
This is a book moving, almost from the start.
The war is swamping the lives of these people as a natural disaster, a Hurricane Katrina that reeks of cordita.
When the artillery fire was heard in the distance, and you're a woman who is at home with your children, are there or huyes?
Anyway, who comes?
Almost nobody understands what is happening, or even why it has to fight this war.
"Lack of facts," observes Mr Englund, "has been filled with speculation, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams and nightmares and rumors."
"The beauty and the pain of the battle" continues to individuals as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor of the fleet of the high seas.
Their stories have been mostly of memoirs, letters and other material already published earlier.
Explanations of their lives can be frightening or moving, but are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, details lost, Mr Englund.
Many of these are about deprivation and make do with what we have.
About tell the story of a German schoolgirl says: "Substitutes, substitutes for all parties."
"Ersatz coffee, aluminium false, imitation rubber, paper masks, wooden buttons."
Still talking about the food substitute in Germany.
Describes "meat made from rice cooked and rolling carnero fat (and topped off with a bone false made of wood); tobacco fact roots and peladuras of potatoes dry; shoes with soles of wood."
There is, observes, "837 permitted substitutes for meat in the production of sausages, 511 coffee substitutes registered."
Some stories are about the honor and courage.
An American acknowledges its own momentum towards the savagery and says about the war: "Sientes that, after all, this is what men are designed and not to sit in chairs with a cigarette and a whiskey, the newspaper of the afternoon or a bestseller, and pretend that the veneer of civilisation and means that there is a barbaric behind this pechera almidonada and tachonada."
Instead a British soldier realises that probably will die, and that no one will notice or care.
"Once you are resigned to the thought of sacrificed, you would think that could happen in front of the public," he writes.
Instead, it is horribly similar "to a convicted being strangled in secret."
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," writes Mr Englund, "a war between factories."
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiario of the young century: The mass murderer eloquent and convinced ideologically with good clothes of clothing that executes its carnage while is sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways; there are both ignoble behaviour as heroic.
Mr Englund speaks of the soldiers who tried to actively take a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way of evading the service in the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen trade gonocócico., soldiers and buy embadurnan with their genitals with the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate looking it over their eyes, which often leads to a lifetime blindness."
In this translation of the Swede made by Peter Grave, the prose of Mr Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly suited to the task.
In dozens of small scenes reflects the way in which the war to "exceptionally uncontrollable forces unleashed: Extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People start to ask why their leaders are doing to combat them.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and Modern Memory of Paul Fussell, or novels as Without novelty in the face of Erich Maria highlight, rather than comprehensive stories.
The volume of Mr Englund joins a pantheon unconventional.
His book is one of the most devastating end that I can remember in a work of non-fiction.
Not will reveal.
But it is as if it had come from his book, torn between your fingers of this page dramatis personae, and had burned with a match.
After a false step prior, a planned assault at the minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them carrying riot helmets.
They chose the night from Monday to Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret, except for a few high-ranking officers, saying initially to others who were joining a year.
The detective Raymond W. Kelly was at the centre, their presence underlined how the operation was had infested of challenges for the police department.
They could not be repeated episodes of recent weeks, as the espray of pepper spray on the protesters, in breach of the rules of the department and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the "okupas."
And why the police operation to clear the protesters from Zuccotti park was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
Agents had been prepared seeing as they had developed occupations in other cities.
A bigger disaster drill was taking place on Randalls Island, with one eye looking to Zuccotti.
Agents increased unrest - known as the training of counter-terrorism measures that involved mobilizing quickly to a large number of police officers - to focus on the Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on the evening of Monday, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to enter the park arrived at the last minute, "said someone familiar with the orders, which referred to the mission only as" an exercise. "
"The few polis I know that they were called for this, they said it was to enter Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew that they were going to enter the Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned for the city.
On 14 October, some players wanted to clear the park, but declined when hundreds of protesters came ahead of time after having heard about the plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved officers from several police units, including special forces around the municipal district - dozens of mobile operators who regularly used to flood the neighborhoods with high crime rate.
Mr Kelly said that many people, such as those who commute to work, had been bounced back and forth the park during the day, making the 1 a.m. a good time to enter.
"It was appropriate to do so when he was the lowest number of people in the park," he said.
Trucks from the Emergency Services Unit with pockets and loudspeakers gathered at the junction of Pike buyers with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and the pre-recorded messages from the loudspeakers that retumbaban seemed to intimidate many demonstrators.
Community affairs officers were at the park with his clear blue windbreakers, many demonstrators simply picked up their things and they were.
There was no shop until 1:45 a.m., said the police, giving time for the protesters to gather their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen gathering on the perimeter to enter if they needed to make arrests in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman, said that it was for their safety.
But many journalists said they tried to avoid that saw the police go into action in the park, and had been treated rudely by agents.
Mr Browne said that the mobile television in Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As the police was moving towards the west through the dense thicket of personal effects of demonstrators, including luggage and garbage bags of paper and plastic clothes overcrowded, teams of the Department of Cleaning followed them, picking up what was left behind.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were dragged out, appearing images on the Internet shortly thereafter.
A core group of protesters took positions near the kitchen area of the camp, near the center of the park.
Some did a barrier, and the police came to arrest them methodically.
Around 10 people at the epicenter of the camp was candaron between them for the arms.
And two people were chained to trees, said Mr Kelly.
Emergency service officers were called to cut the locks.
No arrests have been made in the park until more or less the 3:30 a.m., said Mr Kelly.
Clearing operation was complete about 75 minutes later, said the police.
Mr Browne said that a 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for "disturbing public order and resistance to authority," he said.
The highest-ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the senior uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the chief of detectives of the department, was also there.
Mr Kelly, while he was here, "was not conducting operations," said Mr Browne.
A second group of players expected along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, in case they had to enter.
Rose up barricades in Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and the Pine Street, a block south.
From these positions, was to the police by extending the perimeter even beyond the Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a number of players, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people to outside.
There were some 28 people in the northern perimeter.
Some of the most vocal of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of the Pine Street, a demonstrator jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen taking the air of the wheels of a police van.
At any given moment, a piece of plywood went flying from the crowd.
At the end, an agent and a demonstrator were hospitalized.
The workers' union will require support to the city by redundancies
The union that represents hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that the redundancies were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools that serve poor students.
Demand is, perhaps, the ultimate weapon available to the union, the municipal district 37, in their effort to repeal the redundancies.
Six hundred and seventy-two assistants from school, the coordinators of parents and other employees who were among the worst paid the city lost its work on 7 October, in a move that the union leaders have described as a political vendetta for his refusal to allow the spring, access on the part of the city to a health care fund in charge of working groups to close its budget gap.
Municipal authorities have strongly denied that accusation.
At a hearing in the city last month, the education adviser, Dennis M. Walcott, said that the redundancies were part of the budget approved in June.
A member of the Council contraatacó saying that nothing in the budget specified that the members of the school support staff would be made redundant.
The 37 municipal district officials said they filed the complaint in writing, warning to the Department of Education that would be sued and held a press conference Wednesday to announce the official presentation of the demand, in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Demand will include Mr Walcott and the Department of Education of the city as defendants, and has eight workers made redundant as plaintiffs, all of them black or Latino, like most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman of the Legal Department of the city, said that the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on the specific allegations.
According to a draft of the demand obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs at schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more assistants, as it had been subsidized chronically underfunded.
It Noted that while there was no redundancies in Staten Island and a few redundancies in schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school workers lost their jobs in the District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were fired in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by the Public School 36 in Harlem, where the 68 percent of students live in poverty, the complaint says, "This is not a district of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit."
The district's budget P.D. 36 fell 3.26 percent this year, and also lost money when the city has changed the way it calculates the additional funding for each student enrolment for poor in schools.
The union also states that the directors of secondary schools may have been deceived by the language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of the coordinators of parents.
The memorandum used the word "surplus" to describe the action, despite the fact that "surplus" describes more often the act of moving to a master of the payroll of a school in a bag of work, whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six coordinators of parents were made redundant," says the draft of the complaint, "and not only in surplus."
Mission completed, Congress prepared to reach an agreement on Libya
It seems that Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are willing to agree on anything related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was that the rebellion had success, that the veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi was captured and killed and the participation of the United States came to an end.
Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by the chairman John Kerry (Democrat from Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, applauding Libyans for his successful rebellion and US troops for their "courage".
"This resolution is to honour the brave people of Libya, to begin to rebuild their country," said Kerry.
"It is an affirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
The language may seem harmless, but nothing on the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers of both parties fought among themselves and with the White House over the wording of a number of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the US military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution authorizing the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide margin bipartisan, and never came to be voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funds for US operations in Libya.
That left the US mission in a kind of purgatory of legislation - with Congress sufficiently troublesome as to criticize the handling by Obama of the mission, but not so angry enough to actually mow the grass under his feet.
Then, the indecision of Congress was overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of the Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs "congratulates the people of Libya for his tremendous courage and remarkable resilience to free themselves" and "pays tribute to the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States and its coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Ganará does the new measure the full support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, or divided lawmakers as it did the bill June?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the top Republican on the committee.
The spokesman of Venue said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all the Congressional Republicans and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by the Republican Bob Goodlatte of Virginia (Republican), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that achieves a vote by the entire assembly in the House or the Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have not succeeded so far to get their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of trying.
The Goodlatte is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicated - the same bill proposes in both the House and the Senate - and others with slight variations among themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget Amendment only in the House, and another handful that "will control federal spending."
Some of these projects bills also are identical among themselves, but they give their sponsors - especially novice Republicans seeking to refine their resumes - the opportunity to boast that they were the "authors" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required that both the House and the Senate vote an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution that supports the idea that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that members of Congress can meet, while the Democratic representative José E. Serrano (in New York), wants to take the two-term limit for presidents.
The representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Christian by Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments which guarantee the right to a quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment banning gay marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one that prohibits the burning of flags.
Some legislators also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of the states.
So enthusiasts who have been members to propose amendments, there are moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 changes, and 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable in comparison with that of the 1990s, when members regularly presented more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Library of the Senate.
But not had much more success then than they are now.
The last amendment added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Battered but not defeated," Giffords said in his first interview since the shooting on TV
Ten months after a gunman fired him at point-blank range in a constituent act in Tucson, the representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona (Democrat) appeared on national television Monday night, sang with the melody of Broadway "The sun will come out tomorrow," and said that he wanted to recover more of what I wanted to return to Congress.
In his appearance on ABC News "20/20," with Diane Sawyer, Giffords fought to form prayers and needed help to walk.
The programme documenting their difficult path back to the damage caused by a bullet that broke his skull and drilled the left side of his brain, and that step from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, returned by surprise to the House to cast their votes triumphant in the agreement of the debt ceiling.
In his first television interview since the shooting in January that killed six and injured 13, Giffords smiled, Rio and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked how it feels, Giffords, 41 years, he replied: "Quite well".
The interview with Giffords and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special programme of "20/20" a one-hour, which was issued on the eve of the publication of the new book, "Gabby: A story of courage and hope."
The special programme analysed the recovery of Giffords since the shooting of 8 January.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, sees in his hospital bed, with the head shave and a long scar across his face.
She can only have one or two fingers stand tall, while her husband the encouraged.
Months later, sees Giffords seated in a wheelchair while therapists taught him how to make simple actions.
A movement.
A fruncimiento the lips.
And then, his first word: "What".
In a few days, Giffords delivered another word - "marmalade toast made," a request for a change in its breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: Sees the congressman therapists singing along with the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" of Cyndi Lauper and "Free falling" Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, which makes two hours of therapy every day, said he does not remember the day of the shooting.
That her husband was leyéndole Giffords said in a newspaper article about the murder of 12 March when she stopped to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspected gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a prison in Missouri and is being forcibly medication while awaiting trial.
"Many people died," he said Giffords to Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of recovery of his wife, she said: "I have been defeated."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, has not been defeated,'" said Kelly.
"Only has been hit.
And you are going to get out of this, and you go to recuperarte and you are going to come back stronger than ever. "
Troops felt more pity that respect
The event was a display of Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a Ballad about the impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines stormed their posts around him.
The crowd of label got up and applauded.
"The men and women were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraising of spring.
A senior military officer in the display, also known as the then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops in a different way.
"The showed as a kind of orphaned children," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I am sure that the organizers had good intentions.
That they had.
But it was not respect, really. It was unfortunate.
The conflicting views starkly illustrate the difficult relationship that has taken hold of the military and an American public often distant, sometimes adorador.
Troops are lavished with praise for their sacrifices.
But the praise has a price, say members of the service.
The public increasingly acts as if he were death those in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and Afghanistan will soon towards.
"But it seems that the only way that some show their support is set to us in the role of souls helpless."
The issue is a very sensitive issue for the military leaders, who do not want to seem ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
Also realize that anger faced by troops who returned in recent years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, the majority of the talks on the pity are carried out in silence and in private between war veterans.
After his two sons returned to combat with the Marine Corps, Colonel withdrawn Mark Cancian warned that people apart from the military would consider its service from two perspectives.
Some would regard them with a sense of fear because it clashed with insurgents and travelled to exotic places.
Others wonder whether there would be a "veteran angry and violent beneath the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high level of government in Washington.
During their search for employment, he said, felt that some interviewers subtly had asked whether it would be able to endure under the pressure of a demanding work of Washington immediately after his tour of combat.
"When you talk about your service, you need to address the negative impressions," recalled Cancian contándoselo to their children.
The military concern stems, in part, of the American indifference toward the wars.
The achievements in the field of battle are rarely elected to the praise from a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefits of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, we no longer military heroism in ways that were quite common in the Second World War," said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public focus largely on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
The troops are recognized by the number of tours that have endured, the number of friends who have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The army faces growing pressure to end the violation
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 men and women have a case against the army for its alleged failure to rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are being organised for the next.
The soldier first Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years and 11 weeks of pregnancy night in which she says she was raped by a colleague.
It was October 2008, and was on his way back to his barracks at the Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met with a colleague who had a package of 12 cans of beer.
He asked if he could join her in her room to take a drink.
"Sounded an alarm signal," Lyman said.
However, the Texas native left aside their concern.
I thought, no, has 19.
"Is of Texas," he says.
"I had listened to my instincts."
A few minutes of entering the room of Lyman, the man approached him from behind, tirándola down and raping her, he argues.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other members of the current and former military personnel anxiously await a court decision in a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide if the demand that have filed against the former of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go on trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in the reduction of the widespread violation between the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., demand was initially to 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of them say they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the army failed to investigate, prosecute, or provide adequate justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke said that will by the top brass in the army, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a structure from the top down," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of reprisals? The high command."
Burke also said that since February, have been in touch with her nearly 400 more survivors, many of whom could be part of future demands.
His strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all our eggs in one basket, so to speak, will present a number of cases, if necessary, to keep up the pressure.
The defence team for the Department of Defense, led by the federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has tabled a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detailing the defence strategy, in essence, that the military cannot be sued for current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces.
By a judgment of the Supreme Court of 1950 called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the damage suffered by the staff in active service.
"Damage alleged are part of the military service of the plaintiffs', say the documents.
The Department of Defense refused to comment for this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear the front lines.
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, the teams of women soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.
The result: Between these two wars, 150 women soldiers have died and two-thirds of them in combat situations.
It is time that the army was also modernize, says Burke.
She is not alone in their struggle, and three other demands are in place, in addition to the hook.
At Yale Law School, the Legal Services Clinic for Veteranos is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly promoting an environment misogynistic.
On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is making a complaint against the army, which focuses on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" allocated to victims of rape in order to give them the high of service -- a common occurrence, according to activists, as Anu Bhagwati of the Women's Action Network in Service, a human rights group.
His group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans administration, accusing him of discriminatory practices in the way it handles complaints of benefits for people who claim to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
There have been nine separate bills in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010 was 3,158 sexual assault reported, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Assault Response and the Department of Defense.
However, the attacks are significantly below reported, and by the Pentagon's own estimates, that figure in approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19000 incidents that occurred this year.
The report, published in March, also examines the rates of prosecution: In 2010, a 20 percent of the cases reported in the army was on trial - half that in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in the case of Burke, describe their attacks as only the first of a series of trauma.
In the case of Lyman, denounced the alleged violation of the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, he says, he was asked to count the details of its violation 11 different times in a crowd of policemen, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and the blood of his attacker -- a court in its brazo was found in his bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about who had had sex with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people testified as witnesses of personality on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day when was read out the verdict," Lyman said.
"I thought I was going to go to work, I found myself screaming from the room."
"I put in the psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember that I said to my commanding officer," That was not his trial. This was my opinion. "
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed with a personality disorder, which did not fit for the service.
In January 2010 was excused from service under terms less-than-honorable, which prevents him from receiving any benefit.
As to whether the case presented by Lyman and his fellow demand continues, it is a long shot, said John Turley, a professor of law at the Faculty of Law George Washington.
However, says, "In my opinion, should be able to move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was published for the first time.
I have been a critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence that raises the responsibility.
And he adds: "The odds are heavily against them... but it is important for them to try."
These things only change when the good people is ready to fight.
If the audience is not on his way, Burke, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, will put the queue to its other hundreds of applicants for future cases.
"We are going to continue to fight against the army in this issue until the reform will take place," he says.
"Or until we muramos, what happens first.
The walls have eyes: Researchers are studying how you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another kind that aireaba its anti-immigration views online.
Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having carried out a massacre in Norway in July, that left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, was far from being only in cyberspace: Had spent most of the time that preceded his attack to her computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support the right-wing groups in social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But, how to find them?
Only easy - you have to go into Facebook.
"We realised that it was not so difficult to reach them," says Jamie Bartlett, principal author of a recently published report on the European digital populism in the centre of British studies demos.
The cache of personal information on Facebook is so encyclopaedic says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the tool of advertising to determine their desired demographic characteristics with a scientific accuracy - the way that sellers have been using for years.
The team of Bartlett found half a million fan of right-wing groups across Europe and then I turned announcements, but instead of a new band vincularles or product of diet, advertisements invited users to complete a survey that asked about their level of education, attitudes toward violence and optimism about their own future.
Arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 extreme right-wing parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
"Is a completely new way of doing an investigation," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of the right-wing groups tend to be young men and angry about immigration.
However, in a kind of swing, "those who combined his activism in line with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen."
The work of demos is just one example of how Facebook is becoming an important new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and scientists politicians are using the site to study everything from health problems for social trends as expressed in the "likes," messages on the walls and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users by adding an average of three pieces of content per day, "supernova of data" of Facebook is creating a boom of research, boosting the number of scholarly papers with the name of the site in the title until almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it enables you to look at the people who you could not acercarte with a file on the street.
"Before, when intentabas surveying people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You go through the party, and they never would allow you access," says Bartlett.
"Facebook removes all that - you go to them directly."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address the social-health problems.
A recent study by Dr Megan Moreno, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and his colleagues found that university students who spoke of their feats of binge on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having problems with drink that students who remained silent on the issue.
Moreno suggests that the fellow students, such as residential advisers, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who publish too many updates of state with its binge drinking.
"You can't deal with a problem if we can diagnose," said Dimitri Christakis, the co-author of Moreno and director of the Centre for Health, Behavioural Child Development at Seattle Children's Research Institute, told the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk that otherwise would not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly "nudging" to his own people to obtain data.
The Team Supervisor of the site has produced statistics on the state of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expectation of electoral participation in the middle of the legislative period of 2010, and a National Happiness index (mainly using the information that can be accessed - digital freedom advocates have long argued that the site should make available to other large amount of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching you, whether you like it or not - the sacrifice on the power play Scrabble with a friend to thousands of kilometres away is to allow the site undermine your personal information.
But what happens when users of Facebook become part of a survey that do not even know?
While researchers have clear guidelines on how to collect their data out of line, online is a free lunch for all.
"I do not think that many users have thought even in the fact that a researcher could be looking at their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist of the Laboratory of Knowledge of London, on a 2006 study conducted with the walls of public Facebook students.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is the question of the methodology.
Even outside line, there is no guarantee that a subject of research this being completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know that some of the information in a user's profile and the messages of the wall are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," said Selwyn.
That is why, despite his years as a researcher of technology, Selwyn believes that a pen and a sujetapapeles remain the best research tools that anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for entry into the real world and talk to real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about the social - and a lot of social still happens out of line."
"Cold and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the mastermind of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a fighter of the "resistance" during his first public appearance in court in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and the Knights templarios of Norway," he said to a room full of 500 people.
"I am opposed to the court, which received the mandate of the organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the facts but I plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim aborted Breivik during that monologue, because "I did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express their points of view."
For the same reason refused to allow Breivik, which brought a speech writing in advance, go to the families of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 weeks, denied access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would have to keep a tight rein on all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Around 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came with the hope of Breivik look in the eyes, others to confirm that is kept under lock and key.
All were with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
"I thought that seemed cold and inhuman," said one survivor of Utoya ​ ​ the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked to journalists and the survivors in the eyes when it entered and left the building.
Despite the bizarre notion of Breivik of being part of a movement of "resistance" greater, the judge ruled that is not mentally ill, and said that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
It is possible that some are some comfort that the attacks on 22 July appear to be the work of an extremist instead of a radical group.
But that does not automatically relaxes the pain and confusion that a whole nation still feels.
"I would like to look like a monster, but not think so," said a family member of a victim.
"It would be much easier if it seems."
7 Lessons of the interview loss of Steve Jobs, are in a theater this week
Following the death of Steve Jobs, on 5 October, there were some who compared with Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of modern technology as the Great inventor.
But what the fan of Apple could find more revealing, in an interview with Jobs recently discovered anew that has been dusted in advance of a series of special projections in the largest markets this week, is how much this meant creative minds about business processes and workflows of products.
It was certainly a designer, dreamer and hippie autorreconocido, but it was also a meticulous and an organizer of the flow flowcharts - a man who believed that many executives were "a disease that is to think that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the nerds (The Triumph of the nerds) on the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At that time had passed barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and has worked hard on his new computer company next, waiting for the popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview was used in Cringely nerds, said that the original interview disappeared during transport.
It was only after the death of Jobs discovered a full copy VHS in the garage of the director.
This archival material, slightly reprinted, is the basis of Steve Jobs: The Lost interview, 68 minutes, which arrives in cinemas Landmark this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate the in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose their philosophies technological and business strategies.
And very muses.
In four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between the questions and answers - 10 to 15 seconds of thoughts, where Jobs is clearly weighing their thoughts, seeking clarification.
There are also moments when the perfectionism of Jobs goes to the surface, where it seems impatient due to questions of Cringely, empujándole to go faster towards the issues and arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the age of Pixar, the iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic interview in The Lost, when Jobs assesses what sees that other companies are right and wrong, and offers its own vision of the future of computing.
It is one thing to read posthumous assessments of the career of Jobs, but there is something crude oil and inspiring in the Jobs that we see here, the dreamer keen on the verge of greatness.
He has a vision of as you can and must be things.
Not long after explain everything in detail here, and it did.
A quick summary of seven major sequences of The Lost interview:
About how he learned to carry a business:
"Over the years in the business, I always wondered:" Why are you doing things? "And the answers that you are invariably:" Oh, this is just the way it is. "
Nobody knows why he does what he does, in business no one thinks about things very deeply.
That is what I found.
Jobs leads to detail their efforts to simplify the accounts of Apple.
Taken aback by the way they tracked the costs - often starting with a "standard cost" that was as a rule of thumb, and then followed with a "variable" - developed an automated factory that claimed that could determine the costs of trade in detail.
On the joke Pope:
Jobs recounts the "Blue Box" which he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allows people hackear effectively the telephone company and to make free long-distance calls.
It has written extensively about the device, but the euphoria of Jobs here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak proved the box through the use of a public phone, making a call, and then connecting from a network of AT & T to another, while creating a loop with the largest number of satellites as possible.
"We were wrapping things around the world a half-dozen times and gritabas through the public telephone and came back a minute later on the phone to the public next door," says Jobs with a risita.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
Us two, we did not know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing - was a lesson incredible, and I do not believe that Apple had never existed without it.
Jobs continues describing a glorious joke that he and Wozniak nearly abandoned, knocking the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to speak with the Pope, as did his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two broke out in laughter just before the very Pope was excited to go to answer the phone.
Fall in love with the technology (and the sale by telephone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12 years, the hunting of spare parts to build a frequency meter, sought to Bill Hewlett in the telephone directory and I made a call.
Shortly after his telephone conversation of 20 minutes, Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"That was a considerable influence on me, was the only company that had seen at that age and formed my vision of what was a company and how well they dealt with their employees."
After Jobs became one of the employees of HP who visited the research laboratories of the company in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first table computer ever made."
It was as large as a suitcase, had a small screen cathode tube, and I enamoré him.
Get a trip to HP as a teenager and lose the time with this machine and would write programs for it.
Improvise on innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobs speaks about inventing new products on the march.
Early in his career, which was devoted to sell a handful of collectors, a customer asked if I could put the whole team.
Working with only 30 days of credit, had to find out the assembly and delivery of finished devices.
Later, while I was at Apple, recalls the battles that clashed in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember having dramatic arguments... I shouted that it would take five years to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I harté and I went outside and found a designer.
90 days later, we had a mouse that we could build on 15 dollars and that was completely reliable.
On large companies losing strength:
Long before that lead the rebirth of Apple, Jobs prophetically foresaw the way in which many leaders of industry encountered in his vision, and would lose control of their market share.
"I gave that you have worked at IBM or Xerox, for what you do best copiers and printers, and what?"
You have the monopoly of the market share, so the company has no more success.
Sales and marketing departments are increasing success, so are the kind of people who end up running companies and individuals responsible for the products are driven out of the forum for decision-making.
The genius of the products that led to this monopoly position it rots because of people who do not have the notion of good vs. bad products products - the knowledge of the trade.
That is what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have hijacked the entire computer industry.
Could have been 10 times its size, it could have been the Microsoft in the 1990s...
Took the defeat of the victory.
On innovation as artistic expression:
"There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as it develops the big idea, changing and growing."
Learn a lot about the subtleties of the same.
There are sacrifices that you have to do - some things that you can't do that make electrons, glass makes them, the robots, factories make them.
5,000 you have to keep things in your brain - these concepts - align them all at the same time...
In the end it all comes down to taste - exponerte rebate to try to better than a human team has done, and then try to adapt these things that you are doing.
Picasso said that the good artists copy, great artists steal.
We have never had shame about stealing big ideas.
What did in large part to the Macintosh was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoólogos, historians, which coincidentally were the best computer scientists in the world.
If it were not for the technology, could be doing wonderful things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas cenan with rivals of the health care law while the court accepts the case
On the day that the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the issue politically controversial whether they would accept the challenge to the healthcare law President Obama, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were agasajados at a dinner sponsored by the signing of lawyers who will set out the case before the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges gathered at a preliminary hearing to consider carefully the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a complaint filed by 26 states defy the total reform of health care passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying cry for conservative activists across the country.
The judges agreed to admit the demand and, in fact, is expected to be a historic plea for five and a half hours in March, and the result will probably will further muddy the presidential race of 2012, which will be in full swing at the time that the court's decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear before the court and will claim that the law should be scrapped will probably be Paul Clement, who served as US attorney general during the administration of George W. Bush.
The signing of lawyers of Clement, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has been many years devoted to the defence of the conservative legal principles.
Another signature that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a hotel in Washington, hours after the court's preliminary hearing on the case.
Attendees was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health care law.
The special guests at the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
Is nothing new: The two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
And it is not something that comes into conflict with the ethical standards.
In fact, the judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of the lower federal judges.
If it were, it could be said that fall under the Code of Canon 4c, which says: "A judge can attend events to raise funds to organizations and other related to the law, although the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honour, or be on the agenda of such an event."
However, the proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two law firms in the case, as well as a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm the activists of ethics in government.
"This impressive breach of ethics and indifference towards the code goes against the demands of several judges that adheres to the court by the same rules that apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Common causes (cause).
"The judges were agasajados in a fundraising gala with lawyers who have cases pending before the court."
His appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and it is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in the critics who say that too easily mix the activity of the court with the agenda driven by groups such as the Federalist Society.
And the wife of Thomas, Ginni is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives argue that is Judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as solicitor general for the Obama administration when it introduced the first legal challenges to the law in the court of first instance.
His critics have pushed for Kagan refrain from watching the case, saying it was too involved in defending the law as to now be impartial.
Kagan has not given any indication that it will do.
Boeing receives a record of 18 billion dollars
The Emirates airline asks 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle aircraft, with an option to 20 more.
Boeing also sold six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a transaction valued at more than $1 billion.
It is rarely news when a company gets an order of 50 units of its product.
But it is a great transaction when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the sale price for the 50 planes amounts to a record of 18 billion dollars.
It is as big as the place where Boeing received the order: The Middle East, a gold mine in future growth in orders for aircraft.
In a study released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years, airlines in the Middle East will require 2,520 planes worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced during the weekend its biggest-ever asked for commercial aircraft for its value in dollars - 50 Boing twin-aisle 777 jets.
The successful asked wine of the Emirates airline in Dubái.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would bring the total sale price to 26 billion dollars, Boeing announced in the Salon Dubái in 2011.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had asked six Boeing 787-8s, known as the Dreamliner, which boasts a fuel savings and services for passengers spectacular.
The sale price for six of them is more than $1 billion.
"This is clearly a huge positive effect for Boeing," said Morningstar analyst Dihora Neal.
"The quality of these customers in particular is very strong."
Many airlines in the Middle East are the property of their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only have the money to pay for the planes, but that an increase in fuel prices - generally bad for airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not so bad, because the country is making money with the increase in the price of oil.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay orders of flight when fuel prices rise, said Dihora.
"Have a natural protection," he said.
The order of the Emirates solidifies the leadership of Boeing in the market for wide-bodied aircraft and helps to keep at bay the attempt to its competitor Airbus SAS to invade their dominance with the A350 passenger jet.
Boeing's victory at the fair of the air comes four months after Airbus said that would delay the debut of the larger A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
Delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in the payload and range.
Boeing Co's shares rose 1.5 percent to 67.94 dollars.
The sister of the president of Mexico, apparently defeated in the vote of Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon says that drug traffickers helped his opponent of the PRI, Fausto Vallejo, in the contest for governor.
The sister of President Felipe Calderón seems to have lost his candidacy for governor of Michoacán during the elections of violent state, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers helped tip the race in favour of one of his opponents.
The preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state of Fausto Vallejo, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The involvement of organised crime throughout the electoral process and, above all, yesterday, is alarming, not only in Michoacán, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview a day after Sunday's vote.
"Threatened to our candidates, our electoral workers... It seized the polls, installed barricades... and ordered people to vote" in favor of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the scene of a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI has the hope of winning the presidential election in July.
Vallejo appears to have overtaken by little room to Calderón, who had led the polls before the election.
Calderón, a candidate of the conservative National Action Party of his brother, or PAN, refused to recognise Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which currently holds the post of governor, was in third place, a major defeat for the left divided and unfortunate before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied links with drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specialising in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the home state of President Calderón, Michoacán and he chose to launch a military offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence has persisted.
A mayor of the PAN was killed a week before the elections while was campaigning by Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates left the local candidates for fear.
Although the PRI, unpleasant as the elections of Michoacán, a victory will help boost the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in presidential elections, Henry's grandson, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I believe that this victory should be very encouraging for the next year."
ADB urges Asia to help bail out the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has appealed to India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone of its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a recession in the long term that would prevent the growth of the Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the Asian Development Bank in Manila, said that the two major world's fastest growing economies in the world had to "do everything possible" to speed up the recovery of economic bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries who are watching the difficulties of Europe in a "impartial" and said that the financial assistance of Asia along with the leadership and European resources would help to avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We are all in this together."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview in the framework of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune."
"So if China and India can help, by all means."
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have soared dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased fears that could push the global economy into recession and has led to calls for the major emerging economies to join to help the eurozone to find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled through the IMF, but said that the bilateral assistance - such as buying the bonds of the EU's bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered a greater bargaining power for the Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, India's Minister of Commerce, said that "India is going to do everything possible" to help the eurozone since its own economy was now suffering from the fall in exports and the depletion of foreign capital inflows.
"Nobody wants the eurozone remains unstable and troubled," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It is not an option, it is an imperative, because where we find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no responsibility in helping the rich European when faced with their own and deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell the aid to Europe for the $200 billion people in India, of which up to 800 million live with nearly $2 a day or less.
"At some point you realise that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 years and go on holiday to the beaches and that will not fall well," he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also questioned why the reserves of India should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid public sector workers Greek, in jobs of companies badly managed, and loss-making as the railways.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis threatens to "significant effects on chain" across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank forecast of 7.5 per cent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 now faces the "downside risks" due to the threat of Europe.
He said that the vulnerable emerging markets needed to make "contingency plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows of their economies.
Pentagon serious warnings about the possible cuts in defence
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, calentó Congress on Monday, warning that the automatic cuts looming budget could undermine national security and trigger a chain reaction in financial from the corridors of the Pentagon, on the battlefields of Afghanistan, the assembly chains civilians.
The Pentagon is already digesting the $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears a further reduction of 600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "kidnapping", would lead to a 23 per cent of global reductions and a high of many new projects.
"A cut so great, this applied indiscriminately, would make the most of our naval construction projects and could not be carried out - you cannot buy three-quarters of a boat or a building - and seriously harming other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"Also we would be forced to remove many of our civil servants involuntarily, and due to the reduction would be so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to license civilians in order to meet the target."
"These changes would break faith with those who keep our army and seriously would damage the readiness."
The cuts in time would reach to the combat troops, said Panetta.
"While funding for times of war in the accounts of overseas contingency operations are not directly affected by the kidnapping, the efforts of the war would be adversely affected by the severe disruption in the budgets of basis," Panetta warned.
"The recruitment of staff would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and supervision of the contract that supports the war."
"The staff on the payroll would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to suppliers in time of war, and the legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information about the possible impact of the automatic cuts in the Department of Defense.
"The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would lead to a rapid decline in the United States as the main military power in the world."
"We are firmly against such draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday evening, when published the letter to Panetta.
"This is not an outcome that can live, and it is certainly not one that we should impose ourselves."
"The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and must not be allowed to happen."
If the letter to Panetta and the recent warnings of the senators will increase the pressure for a budget compromise or intensified calls to exempt the Pentagon cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly vocal about the possible cuts, despite the fact that came to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of experience in budgets in Congress and the White House and knowing that it faced difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, Defense Secretary painted a grim picture of what could be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It is a ship without sailors."
"It is a brigade without bullets."
"It is an air wing without sufficient trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to carry out the mission," Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that is suffering from low morale, poor preparation and is not able to keep up to date with the potential adversaries."
"In fact, invites aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta provides new details of how the cuts "generate significant operational risks: Delay in time of crisis response, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and previously committed around the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the major defence projects could face the axe, including those who are already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
The list includes F35 fighter plane, the Joint Strike Fighter, a new bomber planned, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new combat ship coastline and the new combat vehicle on land that the Army and the Navy need to replace the HumVee.
Halt development and the additional evidence of F35 could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but his supporters say that is the next vital step to improve and address potential threats from China and other rivals.
As a lie
A look at the most recent headlines shows us how serious and pervasive are deception and lies in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman presidential is busy exchanging accusations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accused of lying to the other.
The trustees of the State University of Pennsylvania have been charged with perjury for allegedly concealing reports which said that a football coach was withdrawn sexually abusing children.
Last week, the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, was "caught" with an open microphone saying the US president, Barack Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and troubled countries.
Congressman for New York and exhibicionista on the Internet, Anthony Weiner, made the ridiculous with their denials rebatidos quickly by the irrefutable proof.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of offences in the financing of the campaign related to the cover-up of an extra-marital relationship.
And, again, no one who lived will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton during his second term by lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Are widespread legends about the traps in the examinations of school and university.
There have been cases in which teachers have given the answers from the tests to students in order to be better seen in their assessments of performance.
Mentors should be taught to the contrary are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How deception we are?
On any given day, studies show that you can lie anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That is for sure, many of these lies are white lies.
Another study showed that the unknown cheating three times in the first 10 minutes of unknown.
Detect lies, or "the location of lies," is an essential skill to acquire all, for reasons both personal and professional.
Far from being a game of table similar to, for example, charade, where the goal is to say: "You have," the detection of deception is a branch of the serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the last six decades in prestigious universities who conducted in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths about the lies have been rebatidos.
The liars do look in the eyes.
Does not always tartamudean, stuttering out, ruborizan or worry.
We cannot conclude either that the liars are difficult to detect or expose.
A lie detector can be trained to learn the truth about the structure of the declaration, the expressions microfaciales, training of questions and the times.
I spent several years exploring scientific discoveries about the deception in the vast and always emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and help navigate our complex world - especially if their professional responsibilities include the recruitment, interviews, or the management of negotiations.
The good liars have the ability to read well to others, making them feel at ease, running their own emotions and felt intuitively how others perceive.
We know from research that the extrovertidos lie more than the introvertidos, that men are more telling "lies geared towards themselves," while women say more lies "geared towards others" -- usually to protect the feelings of someone -- that married people lie less frequently to their partners that people who are not married (but the lies that usually say tend to be "huge").
We also know that if you are perceived as a malefactor, others will feel less guilty to lying.
How to know if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal conduct of the subject.
This is called "to create a baseline."
Aid to provide benchmarks to measure after the changes.
Look at the position of the subject, laughing and vocal feature.
It is better to know if someone normally golpetea with the foot all the time for not making accusations unfair when I see the golpeteando feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then, seek groups of misleading behavior, verbal and non-verbal.
Consider these groups of behaviour as warning signs, not as proof of deception.
People who cheat can freeze the upper part of the body to try to remember their history, they can point their feet toward the door, leaning toward an exit, changing its position significantly or exhibit a "confession postentrevista" -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of position once all the hard questions have ended.
Interrogators are often falsely that the interview is over, only to find that postentrevista relief.
It also draws attention to the vocabulary of the subject.
Scott Peterson got the leg to the bottom and used the last time while stated that his wife killed was alive, launching a search for her at the national level.
People who cheat can also use a language distanciador: "I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky..." or repeat a difficult question in full.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Anyone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when a difficult question to answer: "Well... to tell the truth... so what I was... in my view."
That makes the response is a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning sign.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but to develop skills to uncover deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid being victimized by the scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial plan of the pipeline diverted after the threat of US delay in its approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the adoption of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- infuriating the unions, while apaciguaba environmentalists -- the company that seeks to build the pipeline says he is ready to redirect the project to return to return it.
TransCanada said on Monday night that move the pipeline planned outside the area of ecologically sensitive Sandhills in Nebraska, and is confident that the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Capitol in Nebraska.
The manager of TransCanada, Alex Pourbax, said that the company maintains its confidence that over time the pipeline will be approved, albeit with a different route.
This comes after the announcement last week by the State Department to delay the decision by a federal permit for the project to explore potential new routes to avoid areas of Nebraska Sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast underground water supplies.
"This is a real path of progress," said Representative Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Department of State is possible that apart from any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials denied that politics was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department's request, and they expressed its full support.
The pipeline, 1,700 kilometres would stretch from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
Lead 700,000 barrels per day of the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
For this, it would be necessary to crossed six states.
Is hated by environmentalists, but beloved by the working groups, who have opted for the estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the region of Sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact study of the State Department found that the project had only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said that the department's inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the Member of the lobby hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the programme.
The other is whether a firm that was contracted to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because he was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child vomitara of fear
A family of New York says that the music diva disk, Patti LaBelle, behaved like a crazy in the lobby of his building in Manhattan, aterrando his youngest daughter to the point that vomitó of fear.
The tirade of the singer of "Lady Marmalade" frightened to Genevieve Monk, 18 months old, both suffered "personality changes, sleeping disorders" and "increased its fear of strangers," says his family in the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on 10 November last year when the scene-shifter Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, professor of kindergarten, and Genevieve were preparing to go to a family trip.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk fell at the entrance of the building of the Riverside Boulevard, with their luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said that stopped near the door and put her daughter in the soil for a moment.
"Someone came up and said, 'Do you know what you are doing your daughter?" He said' yes' and I went to take it, "he said.
LaBelle admonished angry the pregnant woman.

Climate adversity halt the economy
During the first year of management of Mario Lopez Valdez, in Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, fell foreign investment and the economy shrank
The 2011 is a year that will be remembered in economic history of Sinaloa, this is the first year of government of Mario Lopez Valdez, self-styled of change, which generated great expectations to developments in the economy, but given the climatic adversity of start of the year, there is growth, instead it is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures in February, in addition to causing billions in losses for the agricultural sector, limited the scope of the state economy to grow, caused a contraction of economic activity in general of 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic collapse of 31.16% in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of the impact of frost, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, had damage to 582 thousand 835 hectares cultivated, of which the 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 per cent had partial damage, the victims were the main crops of vegetables, corn and chick peas, lupin.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the state unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year saw a rapid growth, because while from January to March 1,053 sinaloenses 55 were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the economically active population, for the second quarter the rate became 5.28 percent, and the average between July and September continued rising to 6.19 percent, a rate that number of people cast more than 74 thousand sinaloenses unemployed, an increase over the first half of 18 thousand 969 individuals.
Lesser liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifaceted, to the economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, director of the School of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions of public policy have been made.
"What we are seeing is a growth in unemployment that has to do with a number of factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market for effects of a restriction of resources for the legislation that was passed in Congress to combat money laundering, as for the people who he seizes dollars illegally is not easy for the work, and used to invest in something", he said.
Detained migration
Lopez Cervantes pointed out that the rise in unemployment, there is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who are going to the state in search of work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first by the difficulties to enter, and secondly because entering already have too many difficulties in finding work, these people is falling and is demanding jobs here in the state, which means that unemployment rises," he said.
Informal sector
The analysis of the labour market sinaloense is compounded when considering the high level of informality that prevails among working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60.38 percent of the working population in the state is working without being contribute as worker with no institution of social security.
Joined to unemployment and informality, another of the state's labor problems are low wages, the body has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Security.
The average monthly income of workers sinaloenses was, until September, 5,352 billion pesos, well below the national average, located in 7,375 pesos.
Of FDI contraction
Coupled with the fall in economic activity and the rise in unemployment during 2011 recorded the largest decrease of Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs from January to June FDI 69.7 state joined 630 billion dollars, representing a fall of 87.74% compared to the $143 $312 5 million registered during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the state government recorded a total investment of 17 thousand 280 billion pesos in the year, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The debt 
Before the stage of economic contraction, the government of the state requested in July to state congress approval of a loan for 3 billion pesos, which would be earmarked for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities, with the aim of reviving the economy, the approval of the local congress was for an amount of €2,600 million pesos, and until November have not seen the benefits of debt in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions to
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of government of Mario Lopez Valdes gives shows a lack of management capacity of the government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Industry of the transformation, expressed that during 2011 it lacked the harmonisation of wills of the various sectors, including the state's own government.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been very poor, we must work hard to regain the ground lost in this year, in 2012, we must redouble efforts, lacked need to align the effort of all, and above all the good progress synchronized because of this new team of government, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slow pace
Loredo Lopez said that events such as the frost in the beginning of the year they stopped the state economy and restricted their performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including the frost, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not return quickly enough to generate an economic dynamism that will have an acceptable level of flow in the processes, products and services, and therefore we are closing at the end of the year, well below the expectations that we had," he said.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Mexican employers in Sinaloa, said that requires the state to productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms we have noted that it has been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redefine the vocation and the state's economic course, because it is important to detonating the full potential of the material and human resource of Sinaloa," he said.
By work to
The chairman of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future that channel the efforts of the government.
"In general terms, I would say that the government has been striving to give good results in various areas, in terms of economic development, there is some progress but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
Noted that the current administration has shown progress in its way to drive public policy.
"There are elements that may say that the government is being more inclusive, what I can say is that there is work done and I believe that the government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.

The Director of Social Development municipal indicated that although until now labourintensive programs have made progress, we are at risk by not complying with the government of the state with the contributions that you are a resource which joined more than 11 million pesos in the three programs.
Pointed out that in total investment in these three programmes is almost 50 billion pesos, of which the state is up 25 per cent and that until now only the Federation and the municipality have provided resources for the works, so that the delay in the completion of these is in force.
"They are nearly 12 million what they must do, and despite the fact that the year is about to conclude we have not been given a fifth, when since July should give us a hand", he said, "we have begun to delay the work and are well advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the state did not meet with the contributions for them, so that at the beginning of the administration, the municipality had to apply for a loan to cover the more than 7 million that was at that time the state administration.

Court validates "analogue switch-off" in Mexico in 2015
The switch from analogue to digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has seen in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed constitutional disputes that brought the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analogue switch-off" from 2021 to 2015, failing to meet the eight votes needed to overturn it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, found that the President Felipe Calderón is not exceeded its authority by issuing the decree detailing the actions to make the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this outcome, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for failing to reach a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality of the decree or Unconstitutionality, and this is in force.
The draft judgment drawn up by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare unconstitutional the decree, owing to the regulation of the subjects of radio and television is a right reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve of law.
Voted in favour of the draft only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Moon and own Sánchez Cordero.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional disputes to contest the decree, and to accept the demands, the minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the implementation of the decree and all actions as he prepared for the digital transition.
Full of ministers decided to dismiss the case brought by the Chamber of Deputies, without going to the discussion of the draft, also in charge of the minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the president said does not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general rules measures so that the public administration prepare.
"Nor do I believe that if it did it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector within the federal executive, who is constitutional mandate, the stewardship of the state.
The switch from analogue to digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has seen in recent years, and translates into a better use of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more channels.
Postpone the change, he argued, would be to postpone the benefits of digitisation, which implies a decision of public interest, which is not only a technical dimension, "because it covers economic, social, political and national security."
These issues, he stressed, "require the operation of the whole system established under the principle of economic stewardship of the state, includes a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the power of the state Executive."
Recalled that a large number of countries around the world has already completed the digital transition, and has done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
We cannot conclude that the Executive, challenged by issuing the decree, which will in any way the purview of Congress, since it is providing administrative enforcement of laws issued by the Legislature, he assured.
Look at the possibility of a count "vote by vote" in Michoacán
According to data produced by the Prep the difference between first and second place in the election for governor is only 27 per cent, even without the votes counted for 879 6,000 74 minutes total.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality in terms of the electoral process this year in Michoacan, where according to data produced by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (Prep) the difference between first and second place in the election for governor is only 27 per cent, even without the votes counted for 879 6,000 74 minutes total.
In this regard, the chairman of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán, Maria de los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, barely on 9 November, the electoral body adopted a series of guidelines in order to harmonize the local rules with the federal reform in electoral matters.
As you will remember, Miachoacán not accredited its Constitution nor his Electoral Code of the state or its Electoral Justice Act, which Congress approved reforms of the state shortly before the legal deadline for concluding that could come into force in the current electoral process and the governor, Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication on schedule in the Official Periodic Law of the State, on the grounds that he had some reservations.
The same 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) settled the dispute constitucional promoted by the local legislature and described as "illegal and invalid" the vote of the state agent to constitutional reforms, which does not have the right to "punish or veto."
Interviewed on the possibility of the "vote by vote," Maria de los Angeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the approval of the remarks made by the General Council of the IEM it will be possible to implement total and partial counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
That way, the partial recount of votes, in one or more electoral packages, may be on the assumptions that: The results of the records do not coincide; there is no record of voting and counting in the file of the box or not in possession of the chairman of the same; or, if there are obvious errors or disruptions of the proceedings.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all the boxes of the election will take place when there is evidence that the difference between the candidate presumed winner of the election in question and which has won the second place in the vote, is equal to or less than one percentage point; if and when at the start of the sitting there is the express request of the representative of the party and/or coalition that applied to the second of the candidates.
The total count of the vote will take place at the end of the counting if Extrabudgetary establishes that the difference between the candidate and the presumed winner located in second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, if and when there is a specific request from the representative of the political party whose candidate was in second place, in which case will be electoral packages that have been the subject of partial recount.
It is worth mentioning that in this situation is the choice of Morelia, where according to the Prep the difference between the first and second place is only with 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.

Will be formed on Wednesday the new Italian government
The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the chairman of Italy to present the new government will face a crisis that has put the country on the brink of economic disaster
The Italian prime minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday with the president of Italy to present the new government will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has endangered the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that can form a government.
It is expected to present a cabinet made up mostly of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will assume the post.
Monti said that the president will submit the outcome of its talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I would like to confirm my complete confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult stage," said the former European Commissioner for journalists.
Monti did not say explicitly that will be able to form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
"The framework is now staccato," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, while Italy fight a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of its debt to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti should adopt a harsh austerity package demanded by European leaders to restore battered confidence in Italy.
Underlining the pressure on Monti to hurry up, the volatility of the markets posted the bond yields on 10-year Italian BTP above 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, head of Confindustria, the Italian employers, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said that we would support a lot to this government."
We believe that this government is the last opportunity for Italy out of this emergency situation.
The chances of success of Monti were driven considerably by the support of the party LDP of Silvio Berlusconi, whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are destined to have a good result," he said to the press Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party.
The support of the LDP, the biggest party in Italy, is significant because until now many of its members had been opposed to the government of majority technocrat who is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new government of Monti must have a strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in their efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks joined the pressure to warn that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began on Monday its consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as with youth organizations and women.
Will put an end to his round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled a transition extremely fast in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of the week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between the uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will be successful.
Rescue Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 billion, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the eurozone.
Monti said that his government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions about which politicians only give him time to implement the reforms before early elections.
Monti said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that must be formed only by technicians, an indication of their objections to a process required by the financial pressure.
Political sources noted that the mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The friction of the Spanish is higher than that of the ticos
Of the 22 footballers called Spain, ten exceed 50 international games.
On the side of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 called came to the 50 matches.
A major contrast to Costa Rica, comparing the 22 convened by both countries for the friendly today, 3:05 p.m. column., in the National Stadium in San José.
While the world champions and Europe's number one in the FIFA monthly ranquin, recorded a strong record of class A interselecciones games, the Tricolor only owns the defender Michael Umaña as the only one that has the 50 international matches.
That figure has reached the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), in the Rommel Fernandez.
The Spanish footballers who play in the League of the Stars and powerful clubs in the Premier League of England, maintain a year intense activity in the domestic league and cup championships, and high-level clashes in European and Champions League crown.
To this he added the experience with the Spanish fury in eliminatorias complicated of the European Cup and the World Cup of soccer.
Footballers Ticos (Costa Ricans) are on the contrary, they have a limited international friction in an area, such as the Concacaf, which is considered to be the lowest-level within FIFA.
We see that the maximum registration of the Spanish Selection is arquero Íker boxes, who the previous Saturday before England (fall 0-1 in London) matched the registration of exportero Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Boxes will play today before the Tricolor and will set a new record of 127 internacionalidades for Spain.
Xavi Hernández, cerebral wheel of Barcelona, has 106.
Boxes and Xavi, even, were recognised the previous week by UEFA alongside the other team's centuries-old Iberian, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the battering ram of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Almost near the centuries-old figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
I still Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andres Iniesta, with 62; Cesc FabreAubrespy, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
The rich, and close to Michael Umaña, are the left side Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and the gunner Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five exceeded the 30 parties: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The less.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain are Gerard Pique (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiol (31).
The national side, with fewer than 30 presences, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel El Centro with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not about to the 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar has only one and Ólman Edder Nelson Vargas and debutan not yet.
The historic scorer of Spain is David Villa, with 50 targets, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
By Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the many more records with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintet included the country in his tour of celebration of two decades of record
"Go to Costa Rica is a dream come true."
In an exclusive interview with Viva, the downward Jeff Ament, Pearl Jam, said that the band is ready to offer one of the best concerts next Sunday in the National Stadium.
There have been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band ensures that they, too, will be turned into reality the dream of touch in the country.
So assured the downward and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The grouping is in the South American wing of his tour of two decades of work and Sunday 20 will be their only scale in Central America.
That day will be presented at the National Stadium, from 7:30 p.m. column., along with the band Angelina The X and nationals of The Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose full transcript is at The Nation on the Internet.
To his followers costarricenses, is a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica, are aware of what they are experiencing their fan?
Go to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us, too.
This is only the second time in South and Central America and until now has been great.
I was in Costa Rica only once and holidays; it is a country so beautiful and I believe that we will be able to stay a few days there.
So excited that we carry our music there.
I ask because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fan living with intensity the previous days.
What do you say to their most ardent supporters?
Thank you for staying on our side through all these years.
We took almost 21 years to reach Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so long and we regret that it has taken so long to get there.
Some people even refers to his concert as the largest show of the year.
Does that adds a bit of pressure on his visit?
Some of the larger shows that we have fallen over the past 21 years occurred during the last couple of weeks.
We touch a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that we have put into shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
In truth, we are very eager to play there.
We love this country, we love surfear and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How was that discovered Costa Rica and its waves to surfear?
We have a lot of friends who are surfeadores and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and waves there are incredible.
My friends are always going to surfear to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surfear; this was how we learn, by people who loves the surfing.
To see the tour, have been handing out huge shows with many songs.
What they have planned for his presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never touched there before, then we do not have any restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best show possible with a good variety of songs; we will try to touch on a couple of songs each album and give our fan a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why is this?
I think it is partly because we have nine discs and can touch more than 120 songs and each likes different songs, so it is difficult to choose which songs touch every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we are now not to touch, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of why we liked these songs and that we may have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and, therefore, I think it becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, are celebrating 20 years of record.
Looking back, it is hard to believe everything we have achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
First, I believe that none of us can imagine that we would be in a large rock band and have done so for more than 20 years ago that seems like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and we are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all want and we love to create music.
We are fortunate to go to places in the world to those who always wanted to go.
Things could not be better for us.
What it meant for you have been a fundamental part of the emergence of grunge?
It has always been an honour to be part of this group of big bands.
We are very friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement stems from a group of friends and is something rare.
From time to time, there is a band of a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten bands come at the same time in the same city.
We are proud and honoured to be part of the group of Seattle.
Still we touch with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were in a festival with Alice in Chains and were in Canada with Mudhoney, Soundgarden we saw in his tour, so we are fortunate to be friends of all of them still and we are honoured to be part of that sound of Seattle that emerged.
It is also very strange that a band like you stand united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us are together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) we joined 13 years ago, which, by itself, is much more time than last many gangs.
First, I believe that we are fortunate to be still alive and, secondly, we are all concerned about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to this, have also been opened musical avenues that give freedom to each of experience.
We trust each other with the music of each and could not be better.
The relationship of you with the word fame has not been simple; however, thanks to its success, have been able to do what they want.
How find a balance sheet?
As we have been growing, it has been easier to find a balance sheet.
We do not be too of tour because it is easy to fall into that game of the large crowds and the people who loves your music.
While one remembers that people are there for the music, that you remember that you must respect the music and what brought, without just concentrate on being famous and be a rock star, something that none of us really interested in.
How recalls his another project Mother Love bone?
I believe that we wrote songs and very good at the principle was something grand.
We were a band for nearly three years and never published a disk until after he died Andy (Andrew).
There were many frustrations because both duration and the most important thing is that we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), which began in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how I was laughing, was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
It was an amazing human being and we were shocked.
The national band The Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you are familiar with his work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that is why the chose to openness?
Yes, the production we sent videos with several proposals and that was the band that we liked, so we are eager to see what The Robertas can offer in alive and must be very entertaining.
Why are always changing the letter of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I do not know.
He sings and I think that it does with the first thing that would happen.
How downward, what are your influences?
Are so many.
Within the first that spring to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many who could talk all afternoon on the bear that I love.
How has managed to Pearl Jam maintain relevant the grunge despite not being a fashion?
I think that all of us we always feel a bit disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands that I mentioned earlier, as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, nirvana and all that emerged at the same time, and, if there is relevant now, I think that is a wonderful thing because it is music that is worth listening and Mudhoney bands and music are doing better now than ever.
At the beginning, his music had a darker content and now has become more positive.
Why is this change?
It is interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that might seem lighter, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe songs that qualify as very dark, although it may sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed touched me, I wept when I heard the songs and are deeply dark.
I believe that when far and there are some trauma in your life and you lose to a family member or a friend, these things are beginning to influence your art and your music and those two songs, surely, is that for me.
Also, I think it can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.

Fujimori is boarding again for medical examinations
The former president Alberto Fujimori was detained on Tuesday in a public hospital to be assessed by the loss of muscle strength that presented in the legs, informed her family doctor.
Fujimori, 72, serving a sentence of 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), is suffering from various ailments, including a cancer in the language that has been operated on four times and that is kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, said the Canal N television Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and the loss of strength of its members.
Aguinaga said that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, said that he does not wish to do so because they are innocent.
It was operated on four times of cancer to the language, has a weight loss of weight of 18 kilos which have joined other diseases such as erosive severe gastritis, the quiste of the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, listed the doctor.
Fujimori meets confinement since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the police.
In April 2009 was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the killing of 25 people at the hands of a squad of annihilation of the army that operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official convoy, led by chairman uruguayo, José Mujica, and comprising several ministers and businessmen, will begin this Tuesday a visit to Mexico in order to expand trade between the two nations and deal with political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet on Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political authorities, trade and a meeting with the collectivité Uruguayan resident in Mexico, according to the agenda disseminated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "conducive to the exchange of information on what are the political issues between the two nations," according to published the Presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to ensure that Calderón supports Uruguay in the incident with France emerged when the French leader Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community to those countries that remain tax havens, which led to the rejection of the so-called Uruguay and in consultation with its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico since November chairing the G20, a group composed of the most powerful developed and emerging countries in the world, and has worked with the South American country, since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the implementation of agreements on the exchange of tax in order to get out of the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), formed of countries that have not implemented all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
On the trade front, Mexico and Uruguay have in place since 2004 a Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
Bigotudo the plumber is the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought, tireless, over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but until now had never done in three dimensions: In "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the love of the girl in High technology.
The title, which comes this month to stores around the world, has been designed from the outset to seize the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which can play in three dimensions without the need to use glasses.
"Mario is the person who has to say how to operate the estereoscopía without glasses," asserted the official press Nintendo specialized in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the videogame in Madrid.
Alvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first of Nintendo videogame originally intended for that support," because until now successes as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The spokesman for Nintendo has argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a videogame "accessible" that allows us to enjoy a smooth and rapid departure.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: The first part is "simple" to the entrapment users less clever.
Once overtaken, the most experts will be able to give a "second round" to the levels of the game, this time have greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose between a real time "D aggressive" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the various challenges and "not to succumb to optical illusions."
This incursion of Super Mario in all three dimensions is also the return of the person to a portable console, which was not produced since 2005.
In this Nintendo videogame a wink to the followers of the saga and repeated the formula for success of previous deliveries, whereby the Moustache plumber will have to go mined platforms of dangers with the aim of freeing the princess Peach.
Although the player will find new movements, settings, the costume and enemies, and also a Luigi "jugable."
Colom endorses Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced this Tuesday that gave trámite to the extradition of exgobernante Alfonso Portillo to respond in the United States for conspiracy to laundering $70 million.
That ends the process for Guatemala responded to the request from the country in the north that claimed to Portillo to judge there.
In a press conference, Colom said that its decision is due to the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a court ruling had already ordered the extradition.
He asserted that during his mandate "not got their hands" in judgments and gave all the extradition procedure that has known.
In addition to Portillo be extradited Sergio Ruano Marroquín, for murder and grievous bodily harm, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Done by Colom is a trámite executive after exhausting all the constitutional and judicial authorities to prosecute the exmandatario between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with resolutions of the fifth Criminal Court and the Court of Constitutionality (CC), Portillo be extradited once it has settled their legal situation in Guatemala and guarantee their human rights.
Portillo was acquitted of embezzlement of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the process that predated the extradition, but the prosecution appealed and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The body was born in order to avoid the fall in the margins of boys without training
The results of the first 25 years of life of the entity Trinijove social support is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received aid to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter of a century.
Airports are over 100 jobs made today for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock at an event held in the old manufacturing complex of Fabra i Coats attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the district of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with problems of dogradicción or fall in the margins.
The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu focused to a large number of responsible for bodies and institutions that in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in full election time, showed the unitary character of the work done by Trinijove.
Along with the president of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the event was attended by the Education exconseller socialist, Ernest Maragall, and the current mayor and councillor exteniente ecosocialista Gomà Ricard.
Also went to the great hall of the Fabra i Coats the current Social de Benestar conseller i Família, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the director-general of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current so is, but added that the work done so far "is a good basis."
The president put Trinijove as an example as to fight the bad circumstances and to give hope to people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not something new to the body and for the work it does," he said.
Vacated a farm where they were macrofiestas okupada
The invaders had grabbed 11 of the 13 floors of the building, Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the farm midday yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that lived the neighbours of 51 of the street of Balmes has come to an end.
Twelve people left the building voluntarily midday yesterday that were illegally, and where organised macrofiestas desesperaban that the neighborhood, by court order and without the need of a police intervention.
Ended when the operation, it changed the lock on the door to avoid a repeat of the situation.
"From now on there will be a control of access," said the manager.
The okupas, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are habitados, were all part of the electrical and water, in addition to paint the walls and leave residues of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of mass celebrations, lasting up to two days and desesperaban tenants.
On the side of the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also has been damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europe Press that since the building was occupied the business has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque notes that the invaders from the farm is unfair competition, which sold the canopy to three euros, while in the discotheque worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the local leisure had had to respond to neighborhood complaints about noise, while, as noted, not the cause inconvenience customers of the disco, but the inhabitants of the house okupada and, above all, those attending the celebrations organised there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbors in the area.
The head of the disco explained that the inconvenience were so large that even came to an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago that "forgiven" rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that over the last few weeks had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The Chairman of the group of the PP in the municipal council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "immediately vacate the property to deal with the problems of coexistence and civility that produce the neighbours, as well as the degradation of the area."
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building occupied, but over the past few months the okupas had gone entering all the floors of the building and in almost all the flats, and some even have been thefts.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to end impunity and be strong against the incivility that has been generated in the farm."
Also yesterday, the Mossos cleared a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m. the police turned up to 35 of the streets of Mont-RALs, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had noticed that four people came to the building.
The four were arrested at the time.
Does or mountain Park?
The architects coincide with the opportunity of the convening beyond polemics on fees
The municipal contest on the 16 door reopens the debate about the role of Collserola in Barcelona
Amediados of the 1980s, at the height of the now defunct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this Administration printed Ones tracts of promoting Collserola.
The leaflet defined the mountain as the great metropolitan park of the Barcelona.
Is more, was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the Central Park New Yorker.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was placed in the imaginary of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital of the few that are not based in the north-south axis but above (mountain) abajo (sea).
Collserola rating as a natural park is in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the jabalís in the role of Yogi Bear.
In these was until, in September, the council convened a megacompetición composed of 16 competitions for so many other doors to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of park, without doubt.
Either that or someone seeks to put doors to the countryside.
The question goes alone: Collserola, or mountain park?
The competition, both for his side purely organisational and by what means of reflection on the city is the topic of conversation among all the people of Barcelona architects.
It is almost as a recurring theme to fall back on when two members of this ancient caste of elected are recognized in an elevator.
And this gives rise, precisely, one of the few similarities between what they believe three architects people of Barcelona, and university teachers, which have been tabled.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayona: The contest is timely.
For Roldán, having dealt with the coastline, "it is necessary to" discuss "the face of the mountains," given that the speech Ildefons Cerdà, green apples, has not been carried out.
"It is assumed that the park more extensive Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for his great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex, "ruling the architect for whom the title of" gates of Collserola "contains a" trap léxica ": We must not think about them" as the entrance to a park, but the demarcation of areas where we need to act. "
Mòdol, as Roldán and Bayonne with experience in the urban world, described the proposal "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers."
Dangers of "uncertain that is now projecting the public space" after the experience in the 1980s, and that was in the area of the Fòrum "his swan song."
The first fear is the demarcation of borders on where they can build.
"Limit is set for the next step," i.e., exceeding.
"We need to think in new planning tools, planning, because the current [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can lead to real disasters."
More confined himself to the question, Mòdol believes that, simplifying the Collserola vallesana aspect of "can be understood as a park, the Barcelona, not", by a matter purely topographic.
Mòdol reminds us that there is already a work done by the Collserola Patronat of that "must not fall on deaf ears," though he was grateful for the opportunity that the City offers his body to intervene in this project, "from the first moment."
And even more, understands that the closeness of the mountain with the city is the pass that allows the architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" about whether this is a technical profile that must lead the multidisciplinary teams ("a success story," said) that have had to create: "The architects should be only a tool."
Bayonne insinuated that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because in the foundations of the tender lack a global vision of Collserola: "There have been 16 revaluing transversal competitions in the mountain-sea, but there is no longitudinal reading, watching and understands the area as a whole."
This causes, at least in his case, which has chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
In other words, a project for one of the doors may clash in programme and definition of the architect of the next door.
In his opinion, that yes, the council should ensure that the strip immediately superior to the Round of Dalt should provide, in its entirety, an area of equipment to make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Spares casino Jonás Larrazábal and will be free
After 72 days of belonging, the network's legal hold Casino granted a pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that was followed by alleged blackmail
After 72 days remain imprisoned, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal hold Casino YEN granted forgiveness before the Second Circuit Criminal Court, which is a process for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
Following the attack at the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino YEN, Sergio Gil García, issued a series of photographs and videos in which he allegedly Manuel Jonás demanded the payment of a fee for the economic council regiomontano operation allowed illegal betting the house.
After the public denunciation, the state Procuraduría opened criminal proceedings against the brother of mayor panista and September 2 was arrested and rooted for 30 days.
After four hours before the official of the Public Prosecutor 3 in property crime, was transferred to the House of arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the capital of the state.
There remained over the 49 days following the dictársele a second order of establishment after the agent of the Public Ministry throw out the crimes of corruption and organised crime.
On 19 October was transferred to the prison of Cadereyta allegedly by blackmail with one and a half million pesos to the owners of the Casino Network; however, only stayed a few hours at the medium-security only because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial held in the cells of St. Nicholas of the municipal Garza.
On 25 October arrest warrant was issued by the Secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yáñez, who said that almost two months of inquiries were found sufficient evidence to determine the guilt of Jonás, such as the recovery of 1.5 billion pesos to the representatives of the house of stakes in exchange for allowing the operation.
This Monday, the legal hold Casino Network, Victor Aldo García Gómez, came before the judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor regio; so that in the coming hours could regain their freedom.
During the legal diligence, the agent of the Public Ministry attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned whether to Garcia Gomez had been repaired the damage and who the partners of the house was betting that gave the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of the record 197/2011 confers a legal pardon to Jonás Larrazábal and thereafter will not stand any complaint about the process that was still; and that it will require repair damage or punishment.
After the hearing to hold legal betting the house, near the 15:50 were ordered the immediate release of the Breton Larrazabal.
Secretary of the court, Jorge Yáñez, went to prison in the municipality of Saint Nicholas Garza to notify Jonás which has been pardoned legally and his case will be shelved.
Also notify the order of immediate release issued by the judge.
The Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the crash that killed the secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven more people
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results on the accident which killed the secretary of the Interior, Francisco Blake Mora and seven others, indicate that the helicopter was hit directly on the ground in complete structural integrity, without which the pilot could try a hard landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Perez Jácome, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before taking off the plane, the pilot found that weather conditions were right to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the aspas had contact with trees to 25 metres where the unit lost the fuselage."
Also reported that the unit was designed to 19 people, so we had the requirements needed to transport staff.
In addition, said that the inquiries made in the area of impact is not brings the emergence of pieces on the ground.
"In a search reported that there is no parts or components of the ship in another place, the impact was presented in a structural.
"The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, had subpoenaed suitable for shipped to passengers.
The ground presents a pending seven degrees to the 30 degrees of bias.
For the moment, the secretary assured that it is a priority to have the results before possible; however, the investigation could take several months, even a year could reach.
For its part, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, director-general of Airports and Related Services, asserted that at the moment of impact, the Chiefs of the Presidential helicopter operated in cruising speed and that this happened in a soft ground upward.
"This information strengthens the assumption of a normal cruising at the moment of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the holder of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant element in the research:
Visual flight:
Under the aviation regulations the flight was conducted under visual flight rules, this means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM located right conditions at takeoff, the aircraft is moving towards the border area between the DF and the state of Mexico layers of cloud cover at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that the cloud the crew has sought an area of lower elevation and greater visibility into the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location the impact.
The coordinates of impact and the last recording of the aircraft radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersal of remains of the aircraft in a small area:
The information available so far suggest that the impact occurred in a straight path and hand.
The pattern of dispersal of remains of the aircraft may assume that the helicopter was hit on the ground in terms of structural integrity.
Has not been detected evidence of fire or explosion:
At the site of the incident are still not be disclosed evidence in the remains of the ship of some kind of explosion or fire.
Recent research results indicate that could have had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the work of countryside have been found pieces of the aircraft to an increase of 9,000,200 feet above mean sea level, the ground is a slippery from the seven degrees until 30 degrees of bias.
The photographs show the sequence in which is expected to be disbanded along this route.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After a thorough search in a wider area cordoned off the site, around the accident, have not been found scattered pieces of the aircraft, which strengthens the presumption that the impact was presented in conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find obesity gene
The Social Insurance an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people; it is supported by specialists from the negative tendencies towards
The Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) announced that conducts an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, so-called protocol "Temptation of obesity in children and adolescents', which will count with markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in biochemistry of Medical Hospital Medical Center of the National 21st Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that incorporated a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, social workers and nutriólogos.
The team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (negative tendencies towards).
In research to be invited to participate in the beneficiary population or not, go to sports units of IMSS participants in the Valley of Mexico, which carried out the tests to minors, every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
Stressed that the protocol began in Unity State of Mexico Sports Cuauhtémoc (west) and that since 8 October, the activity takes place in the Sports Unit (State of Mexico Middle).
Once it complies with the aim of bringing 500 or 600 children, the study will continue in the Sports Unit Independence Federal District (south) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity in children and young people and identify Mexicans risk factors to prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
To be held this November 14 World Diabetes Day, saying that the aim is to bring together three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific questionnaires on food.
Also asked about physical activity and background heredofamiliares of diseases, with the aim of avoiding risk factors that would trigger ailments such as diabetes or kidney failure.
Detailed that Saturdays are applied to all participants anthropometrics (weight, height, waist circumference of), the taking of blood pressure, blood glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetic (it seeks to identify genes that are associated with child obesity).
Cruz Lopez noted that this research is due to the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in children.
"Health surveys of 1999 and 2006 pointed out that in just six years, there was an increase in the case of children, 77 per cent in obesity, and girls of 47 per cent; in terms of overweight is also observed a dramatic rise ', highlighted the IMSS specialist.
Indicated that the justification for the search of the markers is based on the country's population differs from other genetic history.
Reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent of American Indian heritage, 30 percent in Europe and five percent African and this condition is reflected in the genes that are associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn excess energy we consume (calories) and that is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive assessment of children, which makes it possible to detect if they have some degree of overweight or obesity.
Indeed, he said, the presence of folds of dark color (acantosis) in neck and forearm, indicating the likelihood that suffer metabolic disorders and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, doctors delivered by writing to the parents, who are explains each of the measurements and changes in lifestyle that must be done to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic ailments: Sedentarism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, remain the largest part of the day sitting in front of the television and use means of transport rather than walk short distances.
It is also due to the high caloric intake, i.e., the increased consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high in fats and proteins and genetic analyses in this protocol.
UNAM would avoid bumpy asphalt
Rafael Herrera, researcher of the Chemistry Faculty of UNAM, develops asfaltos modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental conditions and temperature
If the signals it sends the pavement were met, it would not be necessary to repair potholes around 200,000 every rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt pavement is the right one, the potholes could be reduced in number, or even be eliminated entirely.
In his conference A view of the technological potholes, handed down in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, reported that the laboratory to office develops asfaltos modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with greater resistance mechanics, both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this kind of asfaltos modified could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities in the north of the country, to improve their performance and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
He explained that the asphalt, the most heavy oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, a high molecular weight, called asfaltenos, and other low molecular weight, called maltenos, which together give him to the pavement viscoelástico his characteristic behavior.
Asphalt viscoelástico behavior is that to high temperatures, near the 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, to 120 degrees centigrade its viscosity is very high and 50 degrees centigrade presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but which will be amended during the day in accordance with environmental conditions and temperature, warned the specialist in chemical engineering.
The investigator of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City mostly covered by pavement flexible, which consists of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve the asphalt.
Among the surface layers is the tar, composed of small stones covered in asphalt and then compacted.
Each piedritas that constitutes the kit, pointed out, is awash with asphalt.
The transit vehicles and generated efforts, it allows the forces are spread very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt would be disseminated even better, felt the chemical engineer.
File on the tar, elaborated, it puts a final layer called rolling file, which is made of a material fine stone, i.e., a sand also washes in asphalt.
As it is the layer that is going to be in contact with the tyres of vehicles, must have more force than the tar file mechanics and provide friction along the way.
To be part of the pavement that is to receive and disseminate the efforts, the rolling file requires, we also have the proper thickness and must take care of the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially the humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because significantly affects the performance of the tar file.
When the ground is wets, water spreads in the interior of the kit and it is difficult to leave, this causes a reblandecimiento of all sections of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
In the process of formation of a bump, he said, the first to become blunt is the film and only after rolling it affects the tar file, but the damage is not instantly, but that is a process that should be given to the first signs with proper maintenance programs.
Also a member of the National System of Investigadores explained that the vehicle burden is another important factor in the formation of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of the pavement must always be used in connection with the burden and to ensure that it meets, to avoid potholes are frequently.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on the asphalt, for example, the tar emulsions, which in other countries are already in the market and to repair the cracks easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What it lacked the Valley a candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected to Melina Ramirez Serna did not reach the crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valle receives its title number 14 princess.
Again the Cauca Valley is left with the appetite of the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramirez Serna had to be satisfied with being on the podium of winners, wear the crown of silver and the band that credited as new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic rose with the crown and sceptre, the department has risen to 14 titles of Princess and Melina is one of the legion of women vallecaucanas who have been close to the crown but were proclamations princesses including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domíngez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorraine Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria solace Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catherine Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today, the big question that many are is what was lacking?
Because the result represents the defeat of a big favorite in each presentation showed that she had to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles that obtained queens as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first is considered a key factor in the decision by the jury of designating First Princess is that were not impressed with his answer to the question, "What is this book you set for yourself and why? Made by Martin MURILLO Gomez, Leamos literary cart.
The interrrogante the vallecaucana replied:
"I read a lot, I think quite in literature, I think that is a form of culturalizarse, definitely I think that the book that I set of childhood is" The Little, "is a book rather deep.
Currently read "Crime and Punishment," is a book of world literature that we all need to read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a wonderful book called "The ardour of blood".
A response that little liked first by the term "culturalizarse" and second for not explain in particular how each of the books that have been cited.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said feel calm and happy with the result, "the universe is wise is what needs to happen.
And for all the people, please read a little bit, "The Little" is a great book '
Between the hypothesis dropped says that to Valle the burned the favoritism.
A journalist used in Bogotá hinted that to be the favourite, the ovacionada and the candidate who had all the preliminary prizes (challenge of gastronomy Oster, the public vote for the best traditional costume, and Queen Mother), "that sparked jealousy of the other candidates, estresó to the Queen and therefore not shone in the scene."
And that it showed in his first appearance in bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton and its two parades in the evening of coronation.
Although in both lució safe, it was clear that lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic showed itself.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme "As at home," Channel RCN opined that the fact that Melina outside designated princess' notes that the candidate who wins more awards during the competition is not as queen. "
In addition, Valle was at the last very elusive with the press, and that was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is in the past, the essence of the National Competition for beauty.
For something, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty said that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of their country which.
"The beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, we need to look beyond the physical and focus on their social sensitivity, who before entering the contest are already involved in projects," he explained.
There is also speculation that Valle was lethargic for their shortcomings in the derriere fibrosis and he noted in his abdomen, but it is contradictory because the jury chose her as the candidate 'natural beauty "with the body more healthy, good nutrition and physical work responsibly.
The preparer queens Jorge Hernáan Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, which had better, "but his problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very visible, I dropped points in the last day."
Meanwhile the journalist Guido holes, the magazine horse trading believes that the mistake of the vallecaucana were surgery that was performed.
"The surgeries are fine, but not the Valley was able to do.
His body was never his strong and here is the cost. "
For this award, which for the first time delivered the National Competition Beauty, after the parade in swimming trunks emerged a cruel prediction that last night was, as it was said that this was the contentillo that Raymundo awarded to Melina so as not to give him a taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the fact is that Melina from today begins a year reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives him the chance of representing Colombia in one of the international competitions for appointment of one's own National Contest.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens that despite its overwhelming step in Cartagena, was elusive the crown.
It was the work of caleño that identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lofoscopista of Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano."
The work of these officials is key.
On 4 November, a lofoscopista CTI Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the maximum leader of the FARC, "Alfonso Cano," through the comparison of their fingerprints.
Of the seven lofoscopistas working in the CTI seccional, this week visiting "availability" Eliazar Gonzáles, a man of Puerto Tejada leading 21 years working in the area of judicial inquiry.
At the start of his career, Gonzáles worked in municipalities of collided, where many times had to enter the country for more than five days in the jungle to arrive at the site where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 was moved to the capital of Valle and then to make the appropriate courses, has specialized in lofoscopia, which is the study of the skin of friction, that is to say, the palms and feet.
The week of operation against alias Alfonso Cano to Eliazar warned him that carry minimum clothes for three days.
Something big is expected.
Friday in the night went to the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmyra.
I knew that was supposed to identify two corpses and suspected that one of them was the man who ran the world's oldest guerrilla, so I asked him to carry the fingerprint card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when it came to the research team to the site where the body was not recognized by their physical appearance, because it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
Was without a beard, dressed as a farmer in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
Fingerprints but do not lie.
Accompanied by a magnifying glass galtoniana, ink, a transplantador and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card.
His eye is not ruled: Was "Alfonso Cano."
That same night, the man who hails from Puerto Tejada was commissioned to confirm the defense minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was the maximum leader of the FARC.
In search of the
For a dactiloscopista Sijín of Cali's recognition that made the president Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González, at the press conference for the operation against "grey", is very significant.
Many people do not know our work.
The dactiloscopia is an exact science, no margin of error, which can be key in solving crimes.
Apart from the identification of bodies, the lofoscopistas support investigations for crimes such as theft and manslaughter and confirm the identity of those captured.
When caught, many criminals are false or bonds have no papers.
We will take fingerprinting and seek in the database.
Told the investigator that, in a case of theft, I had to remove a piece of the wall of a house, because in that place the thief had supported its power to draw a strong box full of jewels and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not appropriate to draw a land fingerprints, but in this case we were able to obtain the footprint of the entire hand and identify the offender, who had participated in various thefts," recalled.
Fingerprints may also exclude or reaffirm suspects in murder cases.
Recently found a man dead, with bottles of spirits around them.
Through research, it was determined that a family member could be suspected of the crime and, indeed, a mark on the bottle was.
Although this does not guarantee that was the killer, they located at the scene of the crime.
A CTI dactiloscopista explained that the objects' fingerprints are drawn with physical or chemical reagents. "
When they appear, it uses a transplantador or tape to lift them.
After this, the impressions are sent to Asif, which is the database delinquency, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," said the CTI expert.
He clarified that not everything is as shown in the television programme CSI.
As well as not everything that shines is gold, not everything it touches becomes mark.
However, if it can be used, if it makes the comparison.
The "outraged" defy authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators in the Square agolpaban Zuccotti to camp out.
A large part the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
The members of the movement took Wall Street defied this Tuesday, authorities in New York to try to enter again, under the umbrella of a court order, to the square in Manhattan where they were evicted from early morning and try to occupy another park of the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators agolpaban at Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access through a court order allowing the "indignant" return to camp out in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction occupy a park further north of the city, where there has been new arrests.
"Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us to return to camp out in the square, we are going to install somewhere else and we will continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations," said one of the spokesmen of the movement "took Wall Street," Mark Bray.
Bray elaborated that the response of the "outraged" at the eviction of his camp personally dictated by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the forced evacuation of the place and allowed the demonstrators to remain camped out.
In addition, the "indignant" proceeded to the occupation of a new park located at the confluence of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and ownership of the parish of Trinity Church.
At least for an hour managed to take the place, but then the police came and proceeded to detain some of the demonstrators, although he could not confirm the specific figure, while Efe assured that saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization ensures that there are several hundred people who had been installed at that point, which has already been sent a delegation of religious leaders in a show of support for the members of the movement and has tried to mediate with the Police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a forum of private property remains closed pending the conclusion of a court hearing scheduled for this same Tuesday in which they must examine the legality of the evacuation of this morning.
Posted some of the demonstrators were carrying so far at this time and distributed copies of the court order and even delivered to the players who were guarding the square, causing "some small clashes," said Bray, who complained that some officers beat the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities to evict members of took Wall Street or implement "laws that were published after the occupation began or ban protesters to re-enter the park with tents or other properties that used previously."
The Mayor Bloomberg indicated to the press that, due to the court order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and to the demonstrators, who warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to re-install with tents and sleeping bags.
District personally defended the eviction carried out dawn of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which they proceeded to around 200 arrests and that it was decided because the protesters were "violating the law."
Bloomberg explained that gave the order to evacuate the place because it was turning "in a place where people were not to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to do harm to others," because "some businesses had received threats" and neighbors feared "for their quality of life."
"The eviction of this morning was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests than those of American workers," added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of 'lack of respect for freedom of expression. "
Those responsible for "took Wall Street" also indicated that they intend to organise "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months for the protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas special television
Alongside Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television programme "It's to Russell Peters Christmas' next December 1
The Canadian Pamela Anderson has been the assistant Tim Allen in "Home Improvement," lifeguard on "Baywatch," conejita "Playboy", the wife of the rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (baladista) Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television programme "It's to Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December, giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed pictures of the television programme in which Anderson, also known by the wide distribution on the Internet of pornographic housekeeper a video in which appears along with her then husband, the battery of "Mötley Crüe," Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a manger a jack representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently served as a presenter on part of the tour "My violent torpedo of Truth" Charlie Sheen, appears as José.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the Christmas special of CTV account with the Canadian singer Bublé, which at the end of March was married in Buenos Aires by Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and that there is no stranger to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called "should" to the American Kim Kardashian during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows 1.5 percent thanks to the domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of declines that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy was paralyzed, still convalescing by the devastating earthquake that became a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country which suffered from Japan's since World War II.
The first estimates of the government Tokyo material losses estimated at $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have eased.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, the figure of Gross Domestic Product between July and September served to turn the page, definitely: GDP rose 1.5 percent compared with the previous quarter and a 6% annualized rate.
The recorded in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - is, moreover, the highest rate of growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is explained, in part, for the rally of the purchase of machinery to restore the areas ravaged by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Indeed, companies increased their investment in a 1.1%, compared to 0.9% decline in capital expenditure to be observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the real trigger of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian stimulus that invites to take advantage of the crisis to reinforce - or rebuild - infrastructure, use the shortcomings to grow from scratch.
Japan has aroused, above all, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable climbed 1%, driven by the increase in spending on cars, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen, Japan's currency -- has become one of the "values haven" selected by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the euro zone and the murky forecasts for US, a privilege that hangs like a bombshell in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic survival is determined by the health of large groups of technology.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blaming their weak results between July and September to the value of the yen.
While the markets remain with their siege to the peripheral countries of the EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda not lower our guard.
"We must be vigilant to the risks that persist, as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand, and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said yesterday, the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And, indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that the majority of the Member countries presented in September more visible signs of economic slowdown.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points in the global economy showed that the major powers are slowing down.
Since it fell four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to $100.8 in August.
The euro zone, even, stood below average, which is at the level of 100, the rush to the eight tenths 99.13 points.
Athens is to feed doubts
Papadimos said that it will approve the adjustments, but the Conservatives do not sign any written commitment
With risk premia peripheral fired and uncertainty reinstated in the wooden floors, Greece is still stumbling into the maze that leads towards the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new transitional government Helleno comes more imposed by the demands of Brussels for a genuine conviction of political forces begins to be confirmed with facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to the structural reforms and that the period of 100 days agreed on his appointment may fall short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, claimed that will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated its call for new elections for the scheduled date, on 19 February.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decisions of the summit on 26 October," asserted Papadimos yesterday by opening a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence to the new Executive.
A package with 24 programs to boost employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras not dispels doubts about his position: "We are committed to help the transitional government, but we have not committed to any more."
The Conservative leader was taking a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the bodies that should unlock the 8 million that Athens urgently needed, and made it clear that it will give its approval to any letter of commitment to meeting the adjustments.
But the European Commission, escocida even by the impact caused by the referendum órdago Papandreou, reiterated yesterday that his demand is strong: Not released the aid if the new government and the leaders of the main parties helenos does not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible."
The Economic Affairs spokesman, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government, "what is needed to pay for the sixth tranche" of 8 million, although there is no deadline.
The Greek knot still has thread for now.
Mrs Sofia: "Are instruments for progress and hope '
The Queen highlights the place "dominant" of Spain in relation to this type of finances
"Has reached a major place globally in the role of the microfinanzas."
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become these last two decades in the second donor in relation to this raises a tool of cooperation, whose "essence" pointed out that lies in being an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity, based on confidence in the human being."
The Queen opened yesterday the V World Summit of microcredit in Valladolid with the belief that "there is no doubt" that is kind of operations are "absolutely essential" to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations with horizon 2015, and, especially, as anyone who has the goal of halving the volume of people living on less than a dollar a day, with which sets the poverty threshold. "
Spain "is working" to expand the network of beneficiaries' to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility," said Sofia, who waited that initiatives and contributions that originate in the summit, which runs until Thursday, "ensure the creation of new skills and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women," main beneficiaries of these loans.
Are "many achievements" and "many of the challenges we face."
The Summit of microcredit arises not only as a forum for discussion, but also as a platform to promote "two basic goals."
Thus, His Majesty explained that it aspires to be the end of 2015,175 millions of poor families who have agreed to these financial services and that 100 million of those homes out of the poverty line in the living.
The momentum in the concept of microcredit in Spain and in the rest of the world "has followed the path that began years ago a pioneer" by Muhammad Yunus, I emphasise Sofia as an "act of justice and due recognition."
And is that described the father of this tool as a "universal idealistic admirable in the cause of the fight against poverty," whose work known for 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn on the ground its policy of loans.
This experience followed a year later the first World Summit in Washington and other events, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada 2006, and "I saw all the continuing evolution," explained Her Majesty, whose link with this project gave him yesterday described as the "head of family" gathered in Valladolid on the part of the "baquero of the poor."
Finally, the Queen Sofia concluded his speech by encouraging people to participate in the discussion and in the search for solutions to make progress in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative '
The foreign minister, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that the solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for all democratic state.
In this sense, explained that it would be a mistake to link the cooperation with developing countries in times of economic boom, because it is a "permanent obligation."
Jimenéz found that microcredit pose "a serious policy and rigorous dedicated to eradicate poverty," and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let this be a victim of the cuts.
In Spain, the microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation."
For his part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded the "success" of giving "confidence" people "from whom all the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León of the Riva, welcomed the present to a city that "opens infected the spirit of solidarity."
The CDU proposes to elect the President by universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday 14 November, in Leipzig, has passed without major difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democrat party.
Initially had not been included on the agenda for the future of Europe, but the issue was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy the militants who believe that the government's policy is currently too lax with the Greeks and could be in a future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, it took almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, there were only nine votes against and 10 abstentions.
The standing ovation for several minutes to be won, with their speeches, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhile Finance Minister, will allay any doubt as possible.
The main thrust of the Chancellor, and the motion, are summed up in a slogan: The response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe."
Not only because Europe is peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to open way in Europe."
This could result in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to enable strengthen the control of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the countries of the euro zone, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give a face to Europe."
In any event, this is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, clear idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Without doubt, it is unlikely that the 27 quickly come to an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the leaders of the CDU seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy, too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, the delegates have rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to ponder the weight of each country of the directive of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of each economy, which obviously would strengthen the weight of Germany.
Eager to calm tempers within his party, the Chancellor has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but neither is it has tried to win its conference at the expense of the "small" European countries or distressed countries willing to criticise the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of "the Franco-German friendship," Angela Merkel has not-discussed in France.
Except passing.
Recalling that, two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for the army of Napoleon.
The incidence of fraud in the sick leave
After the subsidies, the UMP and the government launched an offensive against the sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday, 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a box responsible for family allowances and give a speech on the subject, as recurring since 2007, the fight against fraud and causing social.
Moreover, to accompany such offensive, that part of the desire to save rigorously, but even so reminiscent of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on the sick leave.
First, to implement budget cuts: The government plans to impose on private sector workers a fourth day of absence before they can take the low.
In short, unless there is a specific company, a worker who fall ill would lose four days of pay, that is, a minimum of 15% of their monthly income.
This is a measure that could lift a wave of anger, but that would save $280 million, according to Les Echos.
In addition, would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic: Impose officials a day of absence without pay in the event of low labour (so far, they have no shortage, compared to the three days that apply in the private sector).
As we discuss these issues, the majority is put on the table the issue of fraud, this time focused on the abuses of parental leave.
"Will be increased considerably controls and, furthermore, if someone was caught in a fraud, it must reimburse the amounts," warned Xavier Bertrand speaking on RTL on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement seem slightly disproportionate to the reality of fraud in terms of sick leave.
Indeed, since 2002 is a constant monitoring of this issue and have launched several offensives policies that normally have borne fruit.
The French do not become ill more than in the rest of Europe.
Look at carefully, first of all, the national figures.
According to the French Institute of social security (NCWA), in 2006 were paid more than 237 million in benefits for low labour.
According to the French Institute research and documentation in health economics, subsidies for the low accounted for, in 2008, 5% of health care spending, rising to 11.3 million.
Of this amount, 46% corresponds to maternity and occupational accidents, while 54% is related to the sick leave, a figure that amounts to 6.2 billion.
Consequently, 2.5% of spending on health care.
In 2010, the French have picked up an average of 14.5 days off work, compared with 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the group Alma Consulting.
An average that, without doubt, hides deviations: Another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75 percent of the French respondents claimed 40,000 employees who had not taken a single day of sick leave.
Another study, in this case the Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 the 37% of the sick leave lasted less than 8 days, 22% of between 8 and 14 days, 15% of between 15 days and a month, 15% of between one and three months and 11% were more protracted.
Compared with our European neighbours, French workers are not more likely than in other areas to take sick leave.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two researchers at the CNRS indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absence from work (both for health reasons and otherwise) ranged in France, between 10% and 11%, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in UK or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in the sick leave is not particularly significant in comparison with undeclared work.
Fraud has a fairly limited scope.
The strengthening of the legislation, since 2002, has led to the controls of the sick leave more than 45 days are systematic.
In 2008, 1.5 million inspections, the NCWA found in 13% of the 285,000 made, that short-term casualties were "unjustified or too long," i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of the casualties of more than 45 days, subject to regular inspections, it was found that 11% of cases were "properly adapted or unjustified; a figure that, starting as a total of 1.2 million, $132,000.
Consequently, there is a total of 169,000 cases "unjustified" among several millions of workers who caught a sick leave.
Without doubt, a figure insignificant compared with, for example, the black economy.
According to the Member of the UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of tax revenue of between 9 and 15 billion a year, or more than the total cost of subsidies for low and, without doubt, considerably more than the fraud in this area.
Papadémos: Greece will have to implement a new plan of adjustment
Greece is going to need a new plan of adjustment to straighten out its economy.
This is what declared on Monday 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos before Parliament; also added that the 100 days that have been given to his government of union would not be sufficient to achieve that goal.
"To make efforts leading to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new programme of budgetary adjustment," said the head of government, he uttered his first public speech during the opening of the debate on the confidence vote in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of the euro zone on 27 October will be the "primary task" of the new government, because it "is at stake," the permanence of the country in the euro area, he added.
Accordingly, Papadémos has predicted that the country's public deficit will be "until about 9%" of GDP before the end of the year, after reaching a 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, showed on Monday its support for the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said during a meeting with members of his party "New Democracy."
Said that he agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, as well as fight against waste, but against any policy that prevents the economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, which warned that the IMF and the EU does not desbloquearían the loan of 8 billion euros needed written without a guarantee of support from all parties of the measures envisaged, Antonio Samaras has responded that his word would be enough and would not accept anything because of outside pressure.
A committee of experts says that should be legalized euthanasia and assisted suicide
Canadians live denying the death, according to the report by the Royal Society of Canada
In the area of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.
The Canadian society living denying the death.
Indeed, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk with your doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make provisions to that effect.
This is a formidable of the conclusions of a report by the Royal Society of Canada, with the participation of six experts from various fields, including the ethical, legal and doctor.
This committee recommended the government to amend the Penal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient is such an option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
For a start, the experts cited a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks 10th post, the study notes that "medicalisation of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of death."
With medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to the experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And, despite the fact that the majority of Canadians want to die at home, just 68.6% of them died in hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this regard the records Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
With regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report came to conclusions that do not coincide with the stance of the federal government, which has already declared that he does not want to amend the Penal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all the countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offense has not led to an abuse of its implementation, i.e., the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with people not competent or who had not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, we saw more excesses in those countries where there have been legalized euthanasia or assisted suicide.
"Canada is practiced euthanasia, although it is clearly illegal."
"Canada is assisted suicide, although it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
The Canadians, pro-euthanasia
Let us remember that 85 percent of Canadians have already spoken out in favour of euthanasia, because they believe that would allow people whose death is next to alleviate their suffering, according to a survey by Angus Reid made in 2010.
In addition, 66% believes that the fact legalise euthanasia will not to understand that the life of the elderly or disabled has less value.
To the people who have been assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believed that should not begin proceedings against them.
In connection with the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not so clear, according to the authors of the report.
Moreover, among its recommendations suggest that in the penal code indicating that the withdrawal of health care, if they have rejected legally, it is not a criminal offence.
The committee of experts also calls for training for health professionals in the duty to respect the fact that a patient will reject the attendance at the end of their lives without fear to deal with a complaint.
In the area of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, in relation to the palliative sedation or terminal, which is already used widely in health institutions in Canada, the committee calls that, except that will serve to reduce the physical pain, is seen as euthanasia and be subject to the same procedures.
Other experts expressed reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations in relation to the conclusions of the report by experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described as "extreme" the position of the experts who signed the report, among other things because it restricts the practice of euthanasia to the terminally ill.
"This leaves the door open to a situation in which someone who is tired of living and has more than 18 years can ask for help to commit suicide," said Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seem to give priority to the personal autonomy on any other value of society.
However, it adds that "in society, there are labels and limitations."
The health law specialist in Margaret Somerville also expressed its "strong opposition" with regard to the conclusions of the report, which described as "manifesto in favour of euthanasia."
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, calls into question the lack of abuse, especially in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide is legal, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan urges the President al-Assad to leave power
Damascus complaint a 'plot'
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad marched yesterday before the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday intensified diplomatic pressure on Syria's Bashar al-Assad, with the support of Russia, the reluctant and complains that there is a "plot" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria from the Arab League, the European Union has stepped up sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, have spoken in favour of the abandonment of power by President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday was the first Arab leader who called on President Bashar al-Assad to "abandon power" in Syria, where they have already died a quarantine of civilians and members of the forces of the regime.
"If Bashar really cares for his country, he should resign, in addition to create the conditions for a new phase in the Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, Syria's neighbour, in an interview for the BBC.
For its part, the head of the Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has complained that the mediation efforts that Turkey has made since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and will not be able to satisfy them, will be leaving," said alluding to Syria, neighbouring country with regard to which Turkey is taking an increasingly tough stance.
For its part, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has concluded that it has "strengthened the consensus against Assad and the actions of the regime".
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are taking an increasingly harsh tone" with regard to the repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
Meanwhile, have already killed 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the forces of the regime in the region of Deraa, in the south of Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians have died "during bombings and shootings with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGOs.
During a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid al-Mualem, believes that the country is moving towards the end of the crisis. "
Moreover, has reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus of their functions, which in their view is "a dangerous step."
"Will definitely not," he added, ensuring that "cooked up plots against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is considering a "mechanism for the protection of civilians" and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppé, has also expressed its support for the deployment of UN observers to help protect civilians against the repression of the regime that, in his view, it carries in the "paranoia."
It is scheduled to hold a new special meeting of the League tomorrow in Rabat to hone the implementation of the plan to exit the crisis adopted on November 2, which provides, in particular, the withdrawal of the armed forces of the cities that are in the hands of the opposition and the release of detained protesters.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, has tried yesterday as "incorrect" the decision of the Arab League, while China urged Syria to implement the plan to exit from the crisis, although not expressed its support for the implementation of sanctions against Damascus.
Italy,
Monti calls time on the markets and sacrifices Italians
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, has asked for some time to markets to form his team and put in place a programme that will include "sacrifices" intended to restore lost credibility during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with political parties and today met with trade unions and employers.
It should be a relatively limited cabinet, composed of technocrats outside the Parliament.
"Monti spoke of a broad programme with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small groups who participated in the meetings, having met with the President of the Council appointed.
For his part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has said that he hopes that Mario Monti request Friday before a vote of confidence in Parliament to ensure that the new government has enough support.
The consultation will end with the presentation by Mr Monti, a limited list, without doubt a dozen ministers, the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti said the nervousness of the stock markets and the bondholders yesterday, asking them time.
"Democracy, there is a clear time frame" to form a government and prepare its programme, he stressed, adding that he is "confident that the markets will have patience and you will understand."
His appointment by President initially received the blessing of the markets, but was imposed after concerns, particularly after an unexpected drop in industrial production in the euro area in September.
Prime Minister-designate should create a team mainly made up of technocrats, even if he has stressed that he would like to include "politicians."
The new government will have to operate until 2013, the date of the next legislative, believes.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive the vote of confidence in Parliament before Friday.
Monti is committed to that, when I take office, will work in view of the urgency and with the aim of Italy "to regain its leading role" in Europe.
A spokesman for the European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, it will vary our diagnosis of the Italian economy."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of achieving a balanced budget in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted during the last few months, has called for the adoption of new measures of rigour.
"Boss of bosses" Italians Emma Marcegaglia, you will see the kill, also stressed the need to boost the economy, "as a country that does not grow cannot comply with the requirements in terms of deficit."
Monti, famous for its competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), is a "change of time" to Italy after 17 years of "berlusconismo"; "professor" stands for "the challenge of seriousness" and "other Italy," according to the editorial page.
The big question will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, since Italy has to put before April 2012 some 200 million euros in state obligations.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has worked with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used in a nuclear weapon, according to said on Monday, an American NGO specialising in the nuclear risk.
For the identification of the investigator, the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and in other documents issued by the agency of the UN.
IAEA last week expressed its "grave concern" for a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based in detail in documents of the IAEA, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since the 1960's, in a Soviet military nuclear facility in Tcheliabinsk (Oural) and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 and 1991, would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamantes" in Kiev.
The economic problems of their company would have led to contact in 1995, with the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Later, it is believed that cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA says that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of an expert abroad, which not only knew well the technique, but also, as reported by a Member State to the Agency, worked for most of his career in this technology in the military nuclear programme of their country of origin."
The crimes and crimes against Muslims have risen by 50%
The crimes and crimes against Muslims have risen nearly 50% between 2009 and 2010, while, in the same period, the other types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics published by the FBI on Monday.
According to those figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has gone from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e., has risen by 49%, compared to an increase of 13% in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a reduction of 4 percent in crimes against Jews and an overall increase of 14% in the number of crimes and offences anti-religious.
The total number of "hate crimes" has grown slightly until the 6,628 cases, of whom a 47.3 percent is due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that have risen again this type of crimes and offences," stressed the human rights organisation Human Rights First, "the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is particularly significant," the organisation added in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long been pointing out that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered as a serious violation of human rights," adds a responsible for the organisation, Paul Legendre.
"The US government can and must strive to put an end to these abuses," adds, given that such efforts could include an improvement of police reports on the "hate crimes".
"Hate crime" in the US federal law is inherited from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to the race, color, religion, descent and, now, the sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing its platform and is more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter on Monday changed the presentation of his platform to enable its users, in particular, to see the activity of the people who remain, which causes its service looks a little more to Facebook.
A new Tab "activity" and other so-called "name" to allow more legiblemente and direct the activity of other "Twittos", i.e. those netizens whose messages ("tweet") is still on the Internet or to follow you.
This allows us to know whether monitor messages, if you paid to new accounts, if they describe as favorite any message, etc.
This new formula of Twitter was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before making it to the rest of the network on Monday, according to the AFP has indicated the spokesman of Twitter, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its operation little instinctive, with slightly esoteric terms (TNs to send a message of another person, followfriday pour recommander of suivre another utilisateur) faisant des initiés for him, 's ouvre Ainsi to a large public plus a comparable to maniement plus avec celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google +.
On the Net, users have discussed to blow to "tweet" with different views the interest of this innovation.
"It is useless, it is invasive and it seems too to Facebook," writes @ jemb123.
"The role I Activity will help to better some elements of my Twitter stream," writes @ dannykronstrom.
Austria,
Introduction of a "golden rule" in the Constitution budget
The grand coalition Government of Social Democrat/Christian Democrat who is in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a "golden rule" budget to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible deterioration of the sovereign note of Austria by rating agencies (triple-A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann, who announced the decision following a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a figure well above the upper limit of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly inferior to the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If you reduce the solvency of Austria in a single level, from AAA to AA +, we would have to pay $3 million more in interest each year," said the Christian Democrat Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria responds to a request from the Brussels summit to member countries of the eurozone last 26.10.98: In it, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, before the end of 2012, the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or an Act equivalent value.
The measures adopted by the Austrian Government is close to the "German model", as Germany was the first European country that took that kind of "rule."
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should decrease each year in a 0.75 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017, the federal government's structural budget deficit should not exceed each year 0.35% of GDP, while the regional states, as well as the communes, should submit balanced budgets.
The aim is that, by 2020/2021, public debt will be reduced under the criterion of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threat with a new exchange market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again the marking of change if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene, as we did the last time, if we see that there is an excessive volatility in the exchange rate of the yen, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was up to levels close to the record highs that produced the intervention by the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo massively sold yen for dollars to lower the value of Japan's currency, which had reached a new record since 1945 in comparison with the US currency.
But the yen has been increasing steadily since then, driven by purchases of investors who see it as a "value refuge" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar to re-quotation on Tuesday at least 77 yen, and the euro has fallen below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to those that caused the last speech.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was quoted at around 120 yen, and the euro to more than 160 yen.
This explosion of Japan's currency hurts exports of the archipelago, as more expensive products Made in Japan and reduces the value of overseas earnings of Japanese companies when converted to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" after the earthquake and tsunami of March 11, which devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), highlighted Noda, who fear that the rise of the yen following court of the weak recovery.
The third world economic power has returned to growth in the third quarter (1.5 percent compared with the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to increased exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister believes that the high level of the yen did not reflect the "economic foundations of Japan."
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened on Tuesday, a two-day meeting of its monetary policy, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the deputy governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures," implying that it should not expect greater currency flexibility on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the institute of emissions rose by five trillion yen ($47 million) their purchases of Treasury bills, driving the 55 trillion yen (519,000 billion) the threshold of funds dedicated to the acquisition of various financial instruments to flood the market liquidity.
Euro zone:
Rates are increasing, the stock markets falter
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis is hurting European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the types of the countries most weakened continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the stability of the euro area, European stock markets sink a little more negative in the area on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 lost 1.4% and puts 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt lost 0.4% and 0.1% in London.
"Taking into account the new tensions in connection with the returns of loans from euro-zone states most affected, stock markets around the world are paying part of their recent gains."
"Investors, nervous, are well aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, institutional trader at IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters news agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a fall of 0.7%, renewing concerns of the inspectors of the market in relation to Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, as the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe and exchanges will continue in a margin of small variations, so that investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized,", said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The reappearance of the concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level for a month and a half ago.
At 10 a.m., the European currency worth 1,3570 dollars, a fall of 0.4%.
According to brokers, has lost value after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, which met on Monday in Congress, adopted a motion that provides, in particular, the option of a country in difficulty pulled out of the euro zone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far exceed 6%
Credit rates of Italy and Spain remain very worrying levels.
Tuesday morning, the yield on the 10-year Italian bonds reached 6.85 percent, while the Spanish titles at the same time offered a 6.2%.
These tensions in connection with interest rates of the countries of the south, but also of France, are stoking fears of conductors.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked for time to markets in order to improve the situation in Italy, which runs the risk of being smothered under the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for its part, has said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of the eurozone on 27 October would be the "primary task" of his government.
Spain is in the sights of the markets, while Sunday legislative elections will be held there.
The difference in rates ("spread") between the obligations to 10 years in Germany and Spain, has reached a new record high.
In anticipation of the growth figures for the euro zone
Statistically, France has seen an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, that is to say, a figure that is more favourable than the 0.3%, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has been revised downwards the figure for the second quarter, with a drop of 0.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In addition, the fourth quarter is the one that really worries economists.
Germany, for its part, has recorded a growth of 0.5% in the same period.
Provides the initial forecasts for the whole of the euro zone at 11 a.m., after the European Commission has warned about the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must assert more than the dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be dealt with considerations of short-term or simply thinking about emotions, is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and the competitiveness of businesses.
It is appropriate that an electoral meeting is the time to reflect on these issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will be useful only if studying all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base its opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic trends will result in the doubling of demand for electricity by 2050 unless it deprives a huge part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, we will have to alleviate the increasing scarcity of fossil resources to continue producing electricity continuously, without forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains alone in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case or Belgium, which makes its way to the need to find a source able to replace it, nor of Switzerland, which only aims to build power plants in the last generation.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, for example, are forward with determination with their projects.
The United States, by his side, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to the park, picking up the construction of a plant suspended after the accident at Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on renewable energy, is sometimes as an example, the reality is against such a speech.
The choice of Berlin will lead to a rise in the price of electricity, greater energy dependence on imported gas increased the need, in particular Russia, an increase of CO2 emissions for the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, will be felt the harmful effects.
We must think about the case of Denmark.
European champion in the wind industry, which gets 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the biggest users of coal and gas due to the wind intermittency; for this reason, their CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are, respectively, a 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the record of our energy policy, our neighbours paid an electricity bill 40% higher than the French households.
While in a globalized economy, the cost of energy is a key factor in the competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the utility industry in the national territory, French companies benefit from cheaper electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction of nuclear energy would be a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would realism to the wonderful statements on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.
It is a price that the vast majority of the French are refusing to pay and, in fact, are not opposed in principle to this type of energy, polls show.
Remember that the energy policy of our country has lost to build an industrial sector with 125,000 jobs director and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Largely export-oriented, covers a galaxy of small and medium-sized enterprises specializing in international markets and non-relocatable that can create jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, would be the sacrifice of a large part of these SMEs and the loss of $6 million annually in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What would an electrician EPR designed to operate 60 years, when it is expected the collapse of its manufacturer?
To solve the equation of nuclear energy, we must admit that there is no miracle source of electricity production, as there is a diabolical source.
The development by Areva of solutions with low CO2 emissions, nuclear and renewable, shows the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of security.
In France, we have a security authority that exerts tight control and transparent on both existing plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with security.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Just one, the Three Mile Island, occurred in normal operating conditions; not provocó consequences or to people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and a human error unforgivable.
Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented scope, which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did in the previous two.
Thanks to this progress and cooperation between the security authorities and the French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR design presents a capable of resisting such phenomena.
While the study all the players who want to build an electric power station, the termination of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift to competitors from Areva and EDF, because that would leave them a free hand to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and they have a command partisan maneuvering such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, is a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
Immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: The saturation of the police services, judicial and administrative subjected to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with self-proclaimed the status of "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, is the administrative harassment of foreign students who jumped to the headlines, with the Ministry of Interior (see the newspaper Libération on 23 May) proclaiming of past that France "does not need foreign talent, workers or waiters."
However, rarely discusses from an economic point of view.
The point is that, on this issue, there is quite a consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the direction in 1976, declaring that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country with nearly two million migrant workers," while on the left, the tone was set by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take care of all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both left and right shared the fear of invasion of the national territory for a multitude of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, it considers that immigrants are a burden for the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the extent of generosity with which act with regard to immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande is limited to include trivia, indicating that the co-development will solve the problem of migration. "
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, perhaps it is profitable electorally, but economically is very expensive.
As economists point Ian Goldin, Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book that sums up the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will defines Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press; 352 PP.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows in economic growth, wages and employment in the countries that receive immigrants.
Limiting immigration weakens growth and is detrimental to employment.
The fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that these can replace national workers, particularly the low-skilled, pushing to reduce their salaries.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are complementary rather than substitutes for national workers and are mainly professions in sectors with lack of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants working in sectors that do not attract national and the most skilled workers in dynamic sectors where the training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country that has a lack of anaesthetists, complementarity between citizens and immigrants causes the arrival of recent will impact positively on wages and employment of nationals.
Taking into account the above, Giovanni peri calculated that a 1% increase in migratory flows is a rise in real wages in the long term of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, without taking into account the fact that the diversity that provide immigrants contributes to creating ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of Nobel laureates and naturalized American companies such as Google, Intel, PayPal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants also are net contributors to the social systems, because they provide an average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that in Germany, an immigrant who arrives with an age of 30 years will make a net contribution (revenue less costs) of 150,000 euros in public budgets on average throughout his life.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go to seek the points of growth that he lacked "with teeth."
These teeth, which discouraged immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, you only need to think in a European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset, but also fragile.
The European continent should be able to remember it because, although it was invented in Athens over two thousand years ago, during the 20th century has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also to Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that, for democracy triunfase definitely on their enemies, would be enough to vote and the most direct way possible.
We know, since Napoleon "Little," that it was something thought.
Universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and even can become an instrument of oppression, "as the philosopher Etienne Vacherot formerly Republican.
No, democracy requires much more: A public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation of powers and control, an education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis that we live in Europe is an economic crisis, but is on the verge of becoming a political crisis and democratic.
The Greek referendum palinodia of true-false had, in this regard, revealing a double effect: Showed the need for a strong return to the political sphere, but also the worrying sense of its failure, his inconsistency.
Must consider this ambivalence to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the battle democrática have now been moved and, in many cases, soldiers Republicans no longer are moving in the right direction.
Stands to gain if not demand a succession of national referendums, organized around the needs and disorderly manner.
A blank cheque to the European monarch absolute or a high into the void of the nationalist hole: What options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to coups, but a joint exercise, fully-fledged, calm and steady, options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would have no idea where to end the list), because there is only a crisis, the crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is that it is bowing to the orders of the markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe suffers a humiliation in the international arena.
We worry about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but all Europe is slowly losing the sovereignty and, with it, every one of their nations.
The most urgent is that popular sovereignty to regain the helm of the European project.
Because it is only together can Europeans to reduce the weight of its debts, free markets and prepare for their future through investments.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that may not be taken without a full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead to disaster.
Having fought for a long time against this proposal of the socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone calls today a European economic governance.
That it.
But think about it without further political integration and democratic, and without being seen as such by the citizens, it would be a new madness and would lead us to a new deadlock.
We must take a new stage of European integration.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "do" Republicans.
The Revolution motivated by interests would not be enough.
This lesson remains applicable.
Need to build a more integrated Europe from an economic point of view.
It can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a real European popular sovereignty.
To build Europe, do Europeans.
Chip cards with "no contact" is widespread
Lounge global chip cards began on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an environment optimistic.
Indeed, the year 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of cards with microprocessors (bank cards, telephone SIM card, etc.), with a total of 6 million units, according to calculations Eurosmart cabinet.
The segment is the most powerful technology without contact, which allows us to pay the transport in common purchases or simply approaching the card at a reader.
This year will be sold worldwide 460 million cards with chip without contact, 320 million more than the previous year.
Should continue to increase its share in 2012 (includes 580 million units) and represent nearly 10% of the global market for cards with chip cards (6,925 million).
Europe, which has long been behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the area of payment without contact.
Around 26 million bank cards Visa already have this function, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: They are using 400,000 Visa cards without contact.
But the supermarkets are working for four.
Carrefour has issued this year 2.5 million cards Pass MasterCard without contact.
To get the gear, however, it is necessary for banks to make them available to its customers.
"There are two major French establishments that have been undertaken to disseminate systematically in the future, among its customers, bank cards without contact with the system," announces Gérard Nébouy, director-general of Visa Europe France.
Banks tested the payment for mobile phone
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: The mobile phone.
At present, there are few devices equipped with the technology NFC (near Field Communication), essential to make transactions.
"Are falling behind."
"But should finally see a real boom next year."
"We anticipate that it will sell between 80 and 120 million units in 2012 throughout the world," explains Marc Bertin, chairman of Eurosmart.
But banks take the lead.
The bank Crédit agricole yesterday announced the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhone are equipped to around 200 customers and partners with a sheath that allows the payment without contact.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société générale also said yesterday that he is preparing the marketing of an offer to allow their customers pay without contact via their mobile.
The Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram, on which they suspected for some time, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that Algiers already "has the certainty."
"The way in which both organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that they are cooperating," explained, without providing further details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the gateways.
Abducted in a restaurant in Niamey by people associated with AQIM, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of his kidnappers during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French researchers discovered several Nigerian and telephone chips that belonged to the terrorists.
Of terrorist axis
The study of calls made indicates to several players based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers attracted the interest of researchers: One leads to a Nigerian who remained for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who, presumably, is close to AQIM and the sect.
"This is progress, but certainly we should expect to have more formal evidence before talk of operational cooperation between Boko Haram and AQIM."
"But it is possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys foreign financial support and intellectual and that is increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "support" had been increasingly evident in the evolution and the speeches of Boko Haram or in their operational modes, which now involve the use of suicide bombers or explosive devices increasingly complex, and in the same style than those used by AQIM.
The international community, starting with Washington is pressuring Abudja since then to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long been considering the group as a community of enlightened little worthy of interest.
A success fast
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which means, in Hausa, "Western education is a sin"), encourages the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing a quick success.
Be politicized and requires a strict observance of Sharia law, while its militants launched the fight against the central government godless.
These are the first to churches, pubs, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active and multiplied attacks on police stations.
The Abudja reaction was, as so often happens, widespread.
The army attacked the town and there were 800 deaths.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in life, receives the death in prison.
Since then, the sect is radicalizing and abandoned their fiefdoms in the north.
Last Christmas, calls for an attack that causes 80 dead in Jos and, later, another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram returns to attack against Muscat, particularly against the headquarters protected by the police, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes his first international goal.
The creation of an axis of terrorism in Africa, which would cover from Mauritania to Somalia from Nigeria, anxious to all security specialists.
While AQIM has attacked Mali and Niger and the Somali Al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé has warned against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all the information."
The world according to the Republican candidates for the Presidency
In relation to China, with Iran and with the aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman presidential and Rick Perry vie in naivety and lack of knowledge.
An America weakened by the crisis, can manage a complex world with simple ideas, or even simplistic?
Listening to the Republican candidates for the presidential elections, voters might think that is the case.
A few days ago, Mitt Romney, Herman presidential, Rick Perry and the other candidates are becoming more statements estruendosas and shortcuts in terms of foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of Republicans.
Extend the slogans, often infundamentados, on China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the candidate best placed in the race for the nomination for the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to take China to the WTO and denouncing them "by manipulating its currency," a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of their sector towards Asia.
As if that means the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador of Obama in China and the only candidate who has a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost drown before an attitude that "apabulla 'emotions.
Has called for a dialogue, but constructive, with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, which is stalled in the depths of the opinion polls, remains inaudible.
Reagan-style
Romney has also promised a military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear program.
"If re-elected, will stop Iran," fanfarroneó.
"If Obama gets re-elected, they will have the bomb."
Also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of having failed in its obligations in connection with this partner.
The businessman Herman Cain, the second candidate best classified, shows for its part a shameful lack of such issues.
Recently, urged to counter the military threat of China because Beijing "is trying to develop nuclear capability", apparently ignoring the fact that China already has the military atom since 1964.
The Texan, Mr Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says that, for its part, is ready to deploy the US military in Mexico to combat the drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists banned by Obama in 2009, will also recommend Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
There are considerable differences with the Republican nominee in 2008, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current President Reagan answered that also had a simple ideas and who won the Cold War.
Recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
Insist, with reason, in the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, in the hasty exit from the "boys" of Iraq and its distortions in Libya, and labeled as weak.
But the attacks are not simple.
The population is of a more positive assessment of Obama's national security, which ended with bin Laden.
In Iraq, is wary of military interventions that generate a collapse.
And, arguing that we need to rebuild America economically to resurrect his leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more fair.
The Nord Stream, new gateway of Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which connects directly Western Europe with Russia through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.
To supply gas to meet the needs of 30 million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, has wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the shores of the Baltic, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate bufet, at the opening of the Nord Stream, the new pipeline that connects directly under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart in the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have been together the wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas in the network of Western Europe.
With this new pipeline, will each year 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas to Western Europe via a first had to 1,224 km connecting the region of St. Petersburg with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube should be concluded by the end of 2012, which will provide a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, that is to say, enough to cover the entire French consumption.
Moreover, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third tube for the same way.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project presents an air of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had been firmly opposed to the project.
Indeed, Nord Stream will allow supplying gas directly to Germany, avoiding the course land for third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
In one fell swoop, these two countries are losing some of its power: For them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia threatened to block access to the markets of Western Europe.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw has not hesitated to compare the Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact," in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
Is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian draft, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of the Europe of energy, given that the project has created a rift between the Eastern and Western Europe.
Russia has known, in just five years, to succeed his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and Western countries rich, big consumers of gas reserves and increasingly limited.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that unites us of organically," confirmed François Fillon during the inauguration of the pipeline, showing the extent to which the big gas contracts are as political as well as economic.
All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the managers of Gazprom, many in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine is made of steel tube cement covered to protect it against the anchors of ships.
Rests on the bottom of the sea, to an average of 200 metres deep.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from the Second World War.
"It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, for caution," says Jens Müller, spokesman for the Nord Stream society.
Also became necessary step up measures to protect the flora and fauna.
The tube is a long snake of metal that weighs as 242 Eiffel Towers and is not interrupted along its entire length: Or valves, or maintenance stations.
Scheduled a platform of control in the waters of Sweden, but those responsible for the project renounced the same to see that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state society was permanently in the sea off its shores.
"In case of breakdown, we will interrupt the passage of gas in less than a minute," said Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas pipeline will be released to the atmosphere.
But the builders considered unlikely that there will be a leak, because they have planned gaskets, according to forecasts, will have a flight per 100,000 years.
Control of the state of the pipeline is guaranteed by a robot submarine, dragged by a ship, which is carrying out external inspections, as well as through a device that circulates in the interior of the pipeline.
With the shape of a cigar, introduced inside the tube, which has a diameter of a metre, and moves with gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three metres per second, provides accurate data on potential deformations of the metal.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for 50 years without the need for any kind of redress.
The movement of the gas is simply because of the pressure.
The principle is 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to be able to carry out this project.
The company is leader Gazprom, which owns 51 percent of the shares.
To her, joined the German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream to build and operate the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where the imposition is particularly favourable.
Later, Gazprom rented to this society, for a renewable term of 25 years, all the gas transport capabilities.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas that is really transport," said Jens Müller.
Funding for the construction of the pipeline has been carried out by 30% with the input of shareholders and 70% through bank loans.
The total cost of the project should reach 7.4 million for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached the 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure that does not exceed their investment, because Gazprom alone assumes the risk of expenses.
Baltic emerges the pipeline in Lubmin, in a sandy coast planted pine.
Some valves, with 4.5 metres high, form the exit door of gas.
There are a few sensors that measure the pressure, the temperature and the specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before being transferred to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a report card.
Created a half-century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people a taste for the script.
Has an air of adventure, hours of writing to light a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pasta, his gum, their white sheets broke, as aging at the time.
However, the Moleskine notebooks with the current side were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Mode Mode, based in Milan, decided at that time to market a notebook of design, but distinguished.
Maria Mr. Sebregondi, then a consultant to the company, saw the launch of the new product.
The book was inspired by an ancient technique of production, though the skinheads (skin of mole), which refers to a cotton barnizado that was used, among other things, to cover the stools.
This kind of book was highly valued by the writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the current taste an object old and forgotten, an icon of the pioneering artists until the 20th century," Maria Sebregondi account, which since then became responsible for the brand in Mode Mode.
And reached the success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose by 26%, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
Far remained confidential production of the first few years, in which only 3,000 books were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the borders of Italy and exported their products in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the notebook attracts both businessmen and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-mindedness and cults.
The small Italian company, which had 12 workers in its infancy, now owns nearly 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: One in Milan and the other in New York.
Distributes its basis in bookshops, from the FNAC until small shops in the centre of the cities, and has managed to impose its identity.
"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of e-mails," explains Maria Mr. Sebregondi.
This signature cultural goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: Recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects and artists out his own book.
In August, also launched a notebook with lids of leopard, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this aura cultural, Moleskine has managed to diversify their products: Handbags, agendas, pens, computer blankets... The marks covers a wide range of media.
A success that causes envy: In the autumn of 2006, Mode Mode was acquired by the investment fund GS Capital Europe, currently Syntegra Capital, written a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why the unemployment rate for disabled workers remains so high?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
The 15th Week for the employment of the disabled begins today.
Despite a resolute public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among the disabled is twice the average rate: 19%, compared to 9% for the whole population.
How daunting?
"No," says Éric Blanchet, director general of Adapt, the association that organises the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress made since 15 years ago are considerable.
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times higher than the average.
"However, there is still much to be done."
It is worth mentioning that the unemployed disabled still face numerous obstacles to access to employment.
They tend to have an older age: 37% has more than 50 years (17% on average).
Have a little high level of qualification: 80% has not finished high school, and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is rife among them: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
That is to say, there are many issues that impede the return to the world of work and that "are the crux of the problem," says Christian Grapin, director-general of Tremplin, a partnership founded in 1992 to help businesses to hire disabled workers.
These are the obstacles.
In addition, there are those who have not been mentioned; the mentality of the people moving, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the association for the IMS-entreprendre Cité indicated that the directors surveyed have "a level of knowledge on disability under", with an "over-representation of people in wheelchairs, poor physical or intellectuals."
The result: Private companies with more than 20 workers are very far from the goal of hiring a 6% of disabled workers, a goal that was set in a law... 1987.
According to the latest figures available, dating from 2008, reach a ratio of 2.6%.
"Now we reached around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, director-general of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not respect the law.
The test: The number of establishment "subjected to this contribution," like the sums disbursed, have fallen between 2007 and 2011, from $59 to $46,000 (and 606 to 480 million euros).
"The law of 2005, which increased contributions, has generated a great deal of pressure for businesses," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, especially among the large groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies that have between 20 and 49 workers account with disabled employees in its workforce, compared to 82% of companies of between 100 and 199 employees.
Hazard: "A joy '
About to face the bleus Tuesday evening (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that creates this match.
We dare not say that there was collusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side, on the podium in the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard really have made amends.
Five months after the gesture of resentment of his striker against Turkey, the Belgian selector has no more than praise for him.
"I was very pleased by Eden, for their progress and Belgian because it is."
"I want to move forward," he responds the striker of Lille.
In terms of the contrast between their presentations in his team and in the selection, "is a whole," has been justified.
"In Lille, I am all year, which does not apply to Belgium.
"I have to put myself."
Convened to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis, finally, "shine."
Without forget the "pleasure."
Has been encouraging the bleus since he was seven years, as well as during the victorious campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I have always been a fan," says.
Without doubt, this will strengthen the character "particular" of the meeting.
Especially because they face "Mathieu Debuchy, Yohan Cabaye and Adil Rami," recalls.
"We have just face recently.
"Playing against them is always a joy."
With simplicity, Leekens has done its part by reference to "pride".
"Pride" in play "a gala party."
"Pride" also by check, as "a neighbour," France "is becoming a team of very high level," nearly a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous job," he said with enthusiasm.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be delighted to be able to share with the plane bleus towards... Brazil in 2014.
"Our small Belgians are growing," he stressed.
"We are building something; the players are ambitious, they are hungry.
"To see it in the next few games." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows great confidence
Portugal's Paulo Bento is faced with a great optimism the party back against Bosnia (22h00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the one-party, lacked realism to both teams.
"When within these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a country happy."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt; the Selecçao, which runs from September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Indeed, just 90 minutes separate Portugal of happiness.
But there is a party that play and a rival, Bosnia, that defeat.
Bearing in mind the party trip (0-0), on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems clear that the matter is not resolved.
Portugal dominated the party for more than an hour, yes, but could not make the valuable goal that would have given the tranquillity.
"It is a good result, but at the same time, carries a risk, since we have not scored away from home."
But at home, in the bright Stade de la Luz of Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that will pass, before an audience that should be just as excited, even if it is clear that the party "is well matched," Bento dixit an optimistic but lucid.
"We hope that the party is well matched, but we are absolutely convinced that we can take the lead," said the Portuguese coach for 42 years.
"We still have a 50% chance of participating in Euro 2012," has, however, put the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
Friday the stalemate in Bosnia obliges the Portuguese to mark and win.
Bosnians they could get a draw, but also need to make.
"It is a good result, but at the same time, carries a risk, because we have not scored away from home," Bento regrets.
"We are going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and we have players with a great individual quality," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exercise, from the outset, a maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "do not give them time to think."
A good idea, provided that, this time, is realistic.
