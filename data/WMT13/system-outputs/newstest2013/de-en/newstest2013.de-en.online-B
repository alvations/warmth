A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policy with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center holds the latter to be a myth by reiterated that the election fraud in the U.S. is less than the number of people killed by lightning.
The lawyers of the way Republicans have found in 10 years in the U.S., only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
One thing is for sure: these new rules will have a negative impact on turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine some of the USA 's democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states for the conduct of the elections in each country are responsible.
In this sense, the majority of American governments since 2009 has announced new laws that complicate the procedure for registration or ballot.
This phenomenon has gained after the elections of November 2010, meaning, in which 675 new Republican representatives were registered in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, which may restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require that voters present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, the time periods for early voting are also reduced by these laws, the law declared invalid to register on election day as voters and citizens denied the right to vote, for which a court file.
Before the elections of 2006, no U.S. government has requested that the voters show off a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state, which has raised such a demand.
The Supreme Court of the United States in 2008 confirmed the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
The republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other states.
Over the last two years they promoted in 34 states draft laws, which the voters are forced to show off a photo ID.
It is important to note that the U.S. citizens as opposed to Quebec do not have a universal health insurance identification card as the card.
In fact possess 11% of U.S. citizens, ie 21 million people eligible to vote not issued by a government authority of their state photo ID.
They also feature five million new voters in 2012, does not have such a card.
However, often more than one hundred dollars to be paid to obtain the required ID.
Limitations of the new young people, minorities and people are disproportionately affected low-income.
In fact have 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than$ 35,000, 18% of people over 65 and 20% of voters 18 to 29 years do not have the required photo ID.
This goes even further.
The students who are considered voters who cast their vote for Democratic candidates increased, it is not allowed in several states to use their issued photo ID from their facility.
On the other hand, allow members of the same States fishing or hunting clubs that choose more for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Prior to 2004, no state has called for choosing a proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state, which introduced such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws that require voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly from it, limiting the Hispanic vote.
For it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have sponsored legislation in 2011 in eight states with which the registration of voters was abolished on election day.
In addition, you have the right of individuals and groups is limited, those voters to provide assistance that would like to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the voter registration drives in the general elections in 2004 helped to register about 10 million citizens.
Because the proportion of the registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006 decreased by 17% by the measures adopted since 2009.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have passed in five other states laws that aim to shorten the period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance, African- Americans, although they make up only 13% of voters in the state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, making the whites, who constitute 76% of the voters, only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, the Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have vigorously opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills were blocked by the veto of Democratic governors.
The Advocate General of the United States has intervened to suspend the controversial laws.
They were able to limit the damage partially.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws that require the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly complicate the exercise of the option.
Democratic critics decry the partisan nature of the adopted laws and see them as a clear objective to influence the results in the crucial states for 2012.
A report by the Brennan Center from 2011 shows that those countries that have adopted these laws, 171 of the 270 ballots amount required in the Electoral College to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these amendments to the legislation on electoral system a significant impact on the outcome of presidential elections in 2012 will have.
But one thing is for sure: these new rules will have a negative impact on turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine some of the USA 's democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening : the test should be done or not?
The PSA test, in fact sometimes erroneous results, but also with false negative or false positive results, leading to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater reluctance of an indecisive men for performing screening tests.
The test should be done or not?
We have sought the opinion of two doctors.
In the studies conducted in the United States passed numerous confounding factors between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and to provide clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection is.
This study has also shown that in a follow-up after 12 years, the probability of the formation of metastases by 30 to 40% higher when no screening was performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 years or 40 years if you have a direct relative who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer.
In men, African-American ethnicity also have a higher risk.
The important thing is to make the right decision when a cancer is detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and indolent others.
The patient must be the degree of risk of his cancer be truly understood by the possible options it identified where prostate cancers may remain untreated if it does not affect the quality of life in the long run, and it is in these cases active rather for monitoring the disease decides.
Today is no treatment for many men with cancer has been recognized, instead, because her cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.
You propose to actively monitor and provides them with disease progression on treatment.
Is determined with increasing accuracy the criteria for deciding who should be treated and who does not.
That's why I still recommend running the test.
Most important, however, to speak with his physician to determine whether he should be executed or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology Movember has developed a tool, with which it is possible to evaluate the pros and cons of PSA testing.
This document (currently only in English, but a translation will be available soon) can be downloaded at the following address : http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening
Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no panacea for the prevention of cancer.
Despite advances in research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle is the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone would eat well and get enough exercise.
"If there was no smoking, this value would increase to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several remain completely unknown.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers remains.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancers.
There is also a risk factor for a number of other cancers.
It severely damaged the health of the people.
"Today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," regrets the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data : 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette decreases the risk of dying from cancer by half.
weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk for breast, colon, rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer Grimm," he adds.
the diet
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities it increases the risk of developing cancer of the rectum or a Grimm.
Meats should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
vitamin
In recent years, several scientists have the association between vitamin supplements and cancer investigated.
But their studies are currently inconclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While a study has found that reducing the risk of prostate cancer, showed another rather an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stressed how important it is to talk to his doctor about his concerns and his family history.
"The implementation of a screening test does not lead to cancer."
Das Higgs - Boson analysiert
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson has attracted some attention last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence from the standard model - was, but not yet observed empirically predicted - our best or "least wrong" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter.
But for physicists, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
We know beyond a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is similar to the predicted by the Standard Model Higgs boson strongly.
Moreover, this seems to be confirmed by new data, which were presented this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto, but there are still missing data in order to be completely sure about it.
Let us nevertheless assume that it is indeed the Higgs, since apparently only a low risk of being mistaken, and we look at what it is.
There is in this world a necessarily inevitable law, which means that two objects can not coexist in the same place.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and not try too hard, because you are going to hurt yourself.
Even if the particle is a really strange world, it turns out that they are also such a law applies: the Pauli'sche exclusion principle, which states that two particles can not occupy the same space at the same time if they are in are the same "quantum state", which is "state" broadly from some of their properties.
Assuming the particles share the physicists into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens who are called fermions and obey the Pauli -like principle.
And in the other to move the bosons, an evil gang of anarchists, where nothing is sacred - definitely not this principle, which means that they can be located in the same place at the same time, in fact.
These bosons are divided according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which is absolutely amazing by the way) into two groups : the mesons, which we will not discuss here, and the "force particles", which spread through the great forces of nature and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
It must be emphasized, however, that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as you might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, it is only thanks to an extraordinary banality of boson : the photon or the "light particles", which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
If that is accelerating a particle with an electric charge or changing the direction of the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" exactly in this place, something like a pebble that was tossed into a pond.
Through this "disturbance" created an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the bosons "holder of power".
stable field
The same is true for the Higgs boson, with the difference that a different field, the Higgs field has to be "disturbed" so that this boson shows.
However, the Higgs field is much stronger than the electromagnetic field, the pathogen must reach a little like a frozen pond whose surface could be furrowed only by a very large rock very high energies.
Therefore, a giant particle accelerator like CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! - To achieve such high energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
Not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field, in fact.
Some, like magnets do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never think of yourself on the refrigerator.
And equally not all particles interact with the Higgs field : those who do it have a mass, while the other (just like the photon) have no mass.
For what all this research can now "be good," Ms. Plamondon ask?
For science, they are designed to review the Standard Model (SM), and they also allow physicists to investigate any discrepancies between the observations and the predictions of the SM accurately.
Incidentally, there are many physicists who fervently hope that such deviations are found, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and plug some holes of the model.
It must be said that the latter still has major shortcomings, as it offers no explanation for gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter in the universe (again ups!).
However, at CERN such differences were not found until now.
effects
The implications of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there were none.
Incidentally, in the early 60s, the pioneers of the laser at Bell Labs have not believed that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who has worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and in 1962 even the first continuous-wave laser (the first were pulsed) has developed - already said that the laser was viewed more as a "laboratory" games at the beginning.
Imagine...
In addition, applications can result from all of the instruments that surround the research.
For example, turn in 1969 developed a small light sensor during his work in optics Willard Boyle.
Although it was not the original purpose, all digital cameras, this sensor is now used worldwide as "eye", and in 2009 earned him the Nobel Prize for Physics.
Of course this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it does mean that you can never really know...
Palliative care - the best way to die... | Le Devoir
With her committee for "death with dignity" Quebec has discussed the sensitive issue of end of life recently.
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to look at this closer.
A few weeks ago Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
Of prostate cancer, the aufzehrte him had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I've done seven years," he said half-heartedly, in his bed at home for palliative care Victor- Gadbois lying in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
"However, it 's always a shock, it is not to be prepared," he says.
The disease makes their work : an immense weakness prevents him alone to go to the bathroom and even to eat itself.
On the table in front of a delicious lunch sitting, he agrees resigned to seek help when eating.
Boldly, he succeeds to even smile and talk to the stranger who work around him, give him his medication, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest desire is that you heal my diarrhea because it is humiliating," he announced.
A few hours later, the team has found a remedy for this evil.
"Throughout our lives, we learn that a man pees standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, Psychologist Home Victor- Gadbois.
Return to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"That depends on the ability of the person" to accept a step back, he notes.
Because several people who work in palliative care to view large events take place in the midst of this regression.
The patients who are admitted to the home for palliative care Victor- Gadbois, all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage they are not overwhelmed by the doctors and nurses who care for them with so -called "curative" care.
For Mrs. A., 89 years is the worst fear, "consciously and by suffocation" to die.
But by the disease, I learned my children really know.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no desires in life," she says, before she accepted that touches her a mask that helps her breathing.
Awaits them in the next few days still a last visit her son, who comes from Italy.
Victor- Gadbois in the home provides you with a group of volunteers and personal care assistance at the time of food intake.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options more.
To make dying more comfortable.
In Quebec, comes to 11,700 inhabitants a bed for the palliative care.
This is very little when you consider that one day we will all die.
Here life continues under the best possible conditions, says Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
It grants the dying as desired an oral care with brandy or Pepsi.
The diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is a part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer Mr. X, who died during the night.
Today morning drink the beer at the feet of the deceased, his son.
"We help families and patients alike," says Nursing Director Nathalie Savard.
Victor- Gadbois in the home is not a day like any other.
Next to an old man of 93 years who enjoys the last family gathering in the courtyard and is well supported by his pillow, while stumbling in his honor, died a young man of 36 years, that of his parents, his wife and two young children surrounded, tragically, after trying everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds are always occupied with cancer patients aged less than 45 years," Dr. Christiane Martel divides troubled with.
53% of the home Victor- Gadbois admitted patients come out of their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, ie a care that will alleviate the suffering of patients, when the latter have reached the final stage of life, both at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, like the home of Victor- Gadbois and the Society for palliative home care in the greater Montreal more or less specialize exclusively to the care of cancer patients.
Exactly this great deficiency in the Quebec health care ensures that more specialized in palliative care doctors passing a law for the regulation of euthanasia and assisted suicide look forward with concerns.
Since the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, which was signed by prominent figures of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel of Quebec 's health care system is not powerful enough to ensure that all rights to high-quality palliative care have, before accepting a move to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I have seen a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency room, without that one has taken action to relief.
I fear that the only reason why patients want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
While several oncologists treat patients despite their worst predictions doggedly until the last day.
The survival of Hélène Richard 've been minimal, as it has canceled an arduous chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I will stop the treatment, they answered me that they regret that I give up the fight, she said.
However, she had told me that I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die, to thank the nursing staff that it has not granted this request, after their pain has been alleviated by a team of palliative care.
But it should be clear that palliative care in pain management is not omnipotent.
After Elsie Monereau, Director of the Palliative Care Society of domestic Palliative Care of Greater Montreal 8% of patients do not respond to a pain treatment.
At the very end of life, the doctors so often refer to the terminal sedation, which comes down to it, either sporadically or permanently euthanize the patient up to the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend as if we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief are increasingly have the ability to access this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved, all say the same sentence : "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean "I want you to euthanize me" but "I want my pain to be relieved."
The realization of this report was made possible by a journalism scholarship Canadian Health Research Institute.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the Office Road, the main construction companies, fundraisers political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia every day to tell what they know about a great "system" that are involved in the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso.
An "industry", which was very expensive for the taxpayers of Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is strange how the system breaks down, since you have taken drastic measures," quips Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec Member of Parliament and former head of the Montreal police.
The scandal was uncovered by him due to an in-depth investigation of embezzlement in connection with the contracts for road construction in Quebec, the then Prime Minister had agreed only reluctantly.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, secret funding of political parties and bribery of public officials.
"Since the beginning of the study in 2010," he says, "the Department of Transportation would only saved a billion dollars in contracts", as some like reined her instinct to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," he adds, in the hope that it succeeds, "identify the individuals behind the tactics."
A 2011 launched, permanent anti-corruption unit
The 2011 launched, permanent anti-corruption unit is taking with their troops to auditors, determining and government analysts also great efforts.
In addition, the police officers ' Marteau force "that caused since 2009 that the" sewer cartel " of Montreal in the artificial inflation of contracts cautious going...
In recent weeks it has serially made raids and charged with fraud and corruption allegations against local elected officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is alleged to have repeatedly received bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Were explicitly accused by the way of road construction engineers from Montreal office, as well as business owners of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has caused a stir by having explained how the "system" for obtaining public contracts of the Commission.
He has for several years paid 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal on a related with the Mafia agent who transferred the money to the Union Montreal mayor Gérald Tremblay 's party.
Mr. Zambito was everywhere in the 2000s had a hand in the game by (about 68,000 euros) were more than 88,000 Canadian dollars in provincial parties, especially at the time gewesenen Liberals in power.
He also confessed to organizing an illegal fundraising for the liberal former Vice President Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewerage contracts whose costs were artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant has described this before the Commission : in ten years he received from contractors gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes in the amount of$ 736,000 in exchange for sewer contracts whose costs he artificially inflated.
Other officials of the Road Office have admitted that they could be lubricated by using false invoices ballooned the additional services artificially by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay that he has deliberately overlooked a shadow budget that filled his coffers with dirty money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay has resigned in early November, which Montreal plunged into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first members of Montreal, which sounded the alarm.
As Mayor of the Borough of Rivière -des- Prairies, to the east of the island, she leaned from 2010 against the sale of community land to that acquired for$ 5,000,000 and was sold for 1.6 million to property developers in the booming real estate market.
70% of black money in election campaigns
Of the investigation, which is ultimately carried out, it says that it "pulls a thread that makes it possible to understand how the infiltrated by ant system to stop the evil and denounce the guilty."
She says that the process "painful but positive" is.
We are going to clean the wound, however, have to have specific only for Montreal detection unit, as well as a plan to prevent a return of questionable practices.
How to make clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, in turn, noted that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but makes mainly thinking about the role of the "elected officials who are about tactics in the picture" when they were not involved in the fraud!
Starting with a 70% share of black money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he quips : "I was told that this was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to political parties to$ 100, which according to him would not change the situation ". Solange campaign spending are not strictly limited, Black money in politics will be in circulation"
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for the award of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "We can not fall lower, as we go to things with courage to the bottom, we can visit the house on a more solid base with more controls and laws again build on."
If this story 's international reputation and that of Quebec Montreal damages, Mr. Duchesneau calls on those who laugh, to look in their own backyard...
"PSG is the FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have assumed a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
One can explain it by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I 'm making progress on their side.
The technical staff has also given me a lot.
These elements inspire me every day to to to improve my level of play.
And in a game this is even easier.
In football everything happens very quickly.
But I did not burst into enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings in the center of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine until my season at Saint -Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
So you make the introduced Carlo Ancelotti's competitive advantage...
The new additions this summer are accustomed to stage matches very high levels.
You also know that each workout is crucial.
This means that a player like me, must provide the forehead and wants to give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my playing position.
He is assisted by assistant coaches like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the right person for the job?
Course.
Ancelotti instills a respect for all technicians.
In Ligue 1, there are no comparable person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January I made an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time I had just recovered from an injury series.
The confidence he has placed in me, is also an explanation for my performance.
What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?
In Ligue 1 Lyon has taken us to the place of the leader.
We lurk in ambush.
One of our main goals is the Champions League we qualified for the knockout in this manner.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything is possible.
However, we will have a say against very good European teams our word.
First we want to be the first of our group in front of Porto, so that we can play the second leg of the second round as a home game.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He already has the budget for it...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and make a name in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG is the means to make this project for addressing these issues.
Would it be a big failure, not to win the title in Ligue 1, as was the case in the last season?
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
This year it is we really at heart, to skim this item.
In the last season we were close to it.
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to carry off the victory.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have finished with 79 points.
Normally you should be with 79 points Master...
But another team, those of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux compete for the title, I think we have what it takes to win it.
Do you think that the media expect too much from PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players we have, it's normal that a lot is expected of us.
We accept that completely.
However, if we win at home against a Troyes 4-0, and you still find something that you can accuse us, that's a bit frustrating for sure.
One wonders what people expect more.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We try to create a game concept.
A team builds up with time.
In the Champions League we have demonstrated strength.
Look at Manchester City, a club does not make the last two seasons to qualify for the knockout stages, and also the huge spending has made !
With regard to the amounts invested were believed you to break with 15 points ahead!
This would mean that our opponents and the French title would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well in the last season were "boosted" by the new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we will be the smiling winner in May and tell us that we have finally won it in spite of all difficulties.
The PSG seems to be entirely dependent on the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
All the better that we speak of a "Zlatan dependence."
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and has many goals.
So he came and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue first
Wherever he played, he was made aware that he is a great player and an international star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, it also allows all others to make progress.
How have you experienced with the French Euro 2012 squad?
As a disappointment.
It was close to my heart, to take part in these championships.
Unfortunately, I was prevented my injury, knock out some play time.
I have seen things there, from which I emerged stronger.
Today I manage to achieve good matches for the national team.
This was my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson and now we have to set an example behavior on the day.
What is your opinion about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is strict, the players standing near and stimulates to victory.
Laurent Blanc as it was.
But I would like to make any comparison.
Blanc had achieved his objective by had qualified for the European Championship.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will be the "Bleus" lead to Brazil.
Represents the 16 October in Spain forced draw (1:1) represents a first game?
This game has given us confidence.
Each has worked for everyone else.
Prior to this meeting in Spain I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
Pay with Bitcoin and selling is possible without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties.
Moreover, as often happens in these technologies, a political vision tangible: the belief that the current, designed by banking monopolies monetary system, leading to financial crises.
In fact, this is by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) invented both a virtual currency Bitcoin (but in dollars, euros, etc. convertible) and a protocol for the secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network already about 200,000 transactions were recorded.
Several thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as payment.
After the price of Bitcoin in June 2011 had reached a high of$ 30 (23 euros), five months later he fell over 2 dollars before he has now recovered to around ten Dollar (bitcoincharts.com the courses are listed on the website).
Nothing particularly impressive in comparison to the real world of trading currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown in a paper published in the October report on virtual currency interest for this.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "compete with the dollar or euro" and "similar to conventional currencies."
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, such as the "credits" that are used to move forward in a video game that you win by playing or buy (and sometimes change back) can.
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, every time the trade is controlled and operated by a central authority.
Bitcoin all nodes are of the same depository account book, accountants, money issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Each transaction takes place between two users in the form of an email in reality between two e- mail addresses.
With the difference that the user can select a different address for each payment, which ensures the anonymity.
A number of related with this transaction data is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the contents of the file it is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoins are available in the widely throughout the network account book of public accounts.
The crucial step consists in introducing this new transaction in this book.
This is done using a mathematical task that is started on the computers with the winner, which is a kind of provisional central banker who has the privilege to add this extra line.
There is a fragmentation of the file, ie the conversion of a large file to a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computer "accept" the new transaction and add it a number added before the whole "hacking" is.
The goal is to find the number that yields a specific fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number is found, the other nodes can easily check if it's the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
When a user wants to pay (less than 10 minutes) with the same money to cheat twice very quickly, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other has no link, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer has solved the task receives 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The outstanding Bitcoins are thus limited to 21 million, but divisible up to one hundred millionth of what can be some leeway...
Moreover, the difficulty of the task increases with every improvement of the computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and stole the Bitcoin deposits.
"The vulnerability used does not affect the actual protocol," says Pierre Noizat who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for paying with real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, Cash also has on these shortcomings.
Major players such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind
By others as the blog platform WordPress to be accepted.
Recently, Adi Shamir, and Dorit Ron have the Weizmann Institute in Israel, and analysis revealed that almost 80% of Bitcoins are in circulation, the account book.
Was launched in November "Mega Sale".
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul that converts bitcoins in gold.
Noizat Pierre, who is also the author of a book on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin for validation of transactions and that they are cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and thus can remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented at the dealership, and the latter need not install any new programs or computer terminals.
You just have to specify only one address can be "photographed and recognized" by a telephone, Pierre Noizat indicates the insured that he has thousands of users.
It can be observed a general trend, be reconsidered in the hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontally oriented systems.
"It will take some time before Bitcoin interspersed but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB sees in their report, incidentally, to evaluate the different, now regarded as high risk in the event of success of this new currency.
We are withdrawn from Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the U.S. should follow in late 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army to take back possession of their territory, and that the Afghan people will decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we punished the Afghan farmers, as we have seen them as terrorists.
And us. Yourself with our 88 soldiers killed, and the injured and maimed
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also from farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
They want their age-old traditions and archaic defend them even if jihadists Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks have connected.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by the local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when the Western countries are discrete.
The withdrawal of French troops from the base in Nijrab, I 've watched from a hill planted with almond trees, which was financed through loans took French, properly.
The overflown by helicopters, trucks and armored convoys have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014 there will be no influx of the Taliban in Kabul.
Since her irresistible rise from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
At that time, Kabul was empty and covered the land because of the different insurgent groups fighting the war.
Their assumption of power was then considered as a kind of liberation and return to safety.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of overwhelmed by the Al-Qaida organization peasants, but their situation has not improved today.
Former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the Taliban have current to keep the common desire of women in a subordinate position.
The major figures of the anti-Soviet war in 2001 have come back to power.
You have turned into traders, by having the government seized land to them as land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan to sell and subjected to benefit from the massive American subcontracting.
You have brought into disrepute, and most of them were not even involved in the fighting.
I've heard it in the campaigns, the people want a government that is not composed of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, as well as those who could make donations to the American advantage : the flight of capital is substantial.
The young people are tired of the war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed its benefits.
Approximately 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one fifth of the total population.
In the cities, public schools are full of girls as boys.
These young people, who want neither to return to corruption of certain executives for obscurantism of the former parties, you will need to provide jobs.
Everyone, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones, television with its Turkish series, which are a modern world, is looked everywhere.
An army is now available.
If the authorities under whose authority they will be seen as legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle already to try to restore the militia in the province, which will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the land of mountains with strong local identities should benefit from a certain degree of decentralization on the example of the western nations, but by abolishing the post of prime minister, which existed since the Constitution of 1964, the U.S. wanted from him a centralized state with a strong presidential power to make.
President Karzai wants no foreign checks, especially during the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country is dependent since the 50s, and already long before on foreign aid.
Industries were not rebuilt, functional dams are not available and important irrigation system were not repaired.
Everything is imported, apart from fruit and vegetables produced nothing.
The private initiative is left of priority.
In a country that was ruined by 30 years of war, a state control of the infrastructure would be required.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan possessed immense mineral resources.
This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only locally in order to take possession of it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on the spot, or without transport for export over the mountains no mining is possible.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine already, let the international archaeologists do (financed by the World Bank) on the huge buddhist site of their excavations and remain the major employer in the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, the extent of the imports and exports depend, restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French troops fight was on 20 November finished.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aids: girls and boys grammar schools, Department of French at the University, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural area, the archaeological support delegation.
Since 2009, a Service "civil- military operations," the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was set in 2012, in dozens of mountain villages numerous charitable works and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture carried out and can be carried out by a tiny French non -governmental organization to try to "win hearts and minds" and to achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
This works for many local workers were required to have can help to suppress the rebellion : irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil conservation, and increasing agricultural land.
What gift can we return to military spending by two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help to improve local living conditions, which are very tough these often lying at an altitude of more than 2000 meters valleys.
In the message written inquiries dozens of small agricultural projects of municipalities in the province of Kapisa were received.
Help farmers get rid of the uprising led by foreign groups, what is their desire for their own statements, the continuation would be less well controlled and it required right of respective civilian assistance in their favor.
A Constitution with a crowbar in Egypt
It is a new poker game of President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt in relation to the constitutional declaration that temporarily suspends all powers granted to him more than ever remains divided, he has decided to put everything on one card.
To everyone's surprise he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would adopt the next day its final version.
Just a week ago, the head of state this Chamber had granted two additional months for the completion of its work.
Egypt for nearly two years now, is based on a provisional, multiple amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess.
This new initiative has provided for an even stronger division of the country.
For his opponents, the President remains in his "autocratic Delirium" by continuing "breaking his word" and "the law tramples".
On the part of its supporters have been assured that there is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and speed up the transition process.
Within 14 days of a referendum should be held.
A very short period of time, which forces the brothers to abandon their plan, the text explaining the Egyptians, section by section.
For the president, it is also a way to find his public and democratic legitimacy, while the protest is raging across the country.
After affirmations in an interview with the American newsreel Time Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favorably.
Especially since the Egyptian people with this Resorting an ultimatum is placed on a hasty vote: "Either you vote for my design or do I keep the unlimited power of attorney", the latter should supposedly come to an end after the adoption of the Constitution.
85 mostly Islamist members of the Constituent Assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of liberals has not complied with the request.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration mid-November, they have turned away because they feel that they have not been able to bring their perspectives to bear.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities and civil society alike have traded.
Were to achieve the quorum yesterday morning in a hurry 11 people, alternates added.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that most of the articles were adopted unanimously.
The commentators found it entertaining way, that the only difference of opinion of the day... has come in the time of prayer expressed, as some members of the panel were of the opinion that the pendulum of the Constituent Assembly was not accurate.
The text, which was adopted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which attracted all the attention, finally remains identical to that of the Constitution of 1971 and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties for the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had hoped "the Principles" be replaced by "the rules", which would have made possible a stricter application.
For the Islamists, is the fact that this article was not changed, a proof of their good will and their respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy" return the liberals who see this as a propaganda blow.
Because according to them is the Islamization of the Constitution on other items.
They have particularly in mind Article 220, the Al-Azhar University confers an advisory role, particularly in relation to the verification of compliance with the laws of Sharia.
According to the Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is troubling since " are the persons who will be invited to provide comments, not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You may herein see the first signs of a theocracy. "
The fears of liberals are also nourished by the fact that the next rector of this university will be much less moderate than the present.
"Currently, no specific religious commitment can be seen.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked in this text are not ulema, but academics who have been trained in the French system of " appeasing Alexis Blouet to write a doctoral thesis about the Egyptian Constitution transition.
But he admits that " in terms of Article 220 of the ambiguity may exist, as the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
It refers in particular to the "Fiqh" [ Islamic jurisprudence, ed ].
And in the future, the question might be raised as to what extent civil courts are competent to decide. "
In addition to its religious aspect of the text adopted yesterday is heavily criticized because of the far-reaching powers it grants the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argue that these are compared with the former regime significantly reduced.
Another point of contention : the powers of the army.
In accordance with the desire of the military examination of the defense budget is not submitted to Parliament, but on a national defense council.
There will also be no prohibition of civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations have called for the defense of human rights.
The latter also share their concerns about the text that they see as threatening freedom.
The offense of blasphemy is maintained, and insults are forbidden now, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Furthermore, no article on the protection of women's concerns, highlights Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in Article 36
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television yesterday evening, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Proponents of the head of state will parade Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect holy sites, the navel of the world, a sea of salt

The Dead Sea is even warmer and there all year about being bathed.
Incidentally, this unusual sea with a layer of 417 meters below sea level, situated at the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise water has a high salt content, thus contributing even non-swimmers easily on the surface.
The surrounding countryside is beautiful beyond words.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural brine) and mud as well as to treat skin inflammations, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, and to calm stressed nerves.
Touch the mysteries of antiquity
These secrets does the old city of Tel Aviv, namely the city of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city was the famous ship, the Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia combined with each other.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah was building his Ark here, and Perseus rescued Andromeda, and beautiful, with whom he had a long and happy life in this place.

"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow : Migrants save money for language
While MPs and civil discuss what benefits the law on mandatory language tests for immigrants, criminals are already acting with fake certificates
Every year, 13 million migrant workers in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia : Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money for the upkeep of the family remaining in the home.
On 1 December a law came into force, which states that any migrant worker a test of knowledge of the Russian language certified, must pass.
Previously, this rule applies only to migrants who want to work in the local housing industry and retail services sectors.
However, the tests should be compulsory with time, according to Federal Migration Service for all future guest workers.
One has to not only take language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the basics of the legislation.
Language skills must be provided for both the receipt and the renewal of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
Also excluded from this law are people who have received their training certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Sense problems and protect the rights
The whole of the examination bodies will be under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian language, the Russian Peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can take the tests in all cities and even now more than 160 centers have been appropriate in Russia opened.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
Contrast, civil rights presented before the enactment of the law in the press several times the following question : What makes the whole thing?
What changes does the requirement to have to show language skills both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
Especially, spokesman for the reply migration authority, it is a matter of reducing the number of forced laborers.
"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the Head of the Representation of the Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
However, their rights must be protected prior to their departure.
Only an organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Encounter problems migrants without occupation, education, language skills and medical examination.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrants will inevitably encounter without knowing the language people with evil intentions, which put him under the guise of aid in a dark, narrow barracks where he persevere with dozens of his peers months without food or documents and 12 to 14 hours will toil day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"At home, you will be the one promised, and upon arrival you will be cheated to get their passports taken and did not receive the promised reward," says the head of the Main Administration for labor migration of Tajik Migration Service, Tolib Schwaripow.
Do not scold, boss!
Nevertheless be many citizens of the Central Asian republics in Russia who want to earn their money, that they do not speak not only the language of the destination country, but also in their own language can hardly be expressed in writing.
Of course this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil : Few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can also only afford a reasonable primary education.
Because their families can not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school supplies.
As a teenager, these children then immediately take the first opportunity to make money.
"It is difficult without knowing the language," they give.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Emphasize civil rights law regarding the following important aspect.
Must pass the test only migrants with legal status.
You do not have this status, so there is no check and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of guest workers has continued illegally in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Unauthorized access prohibited"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and of course the language difficulties.
In addition, the legalization costs money : 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be done quickly and for only one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents mostly fake and we are not registered, and then emerge from cases of extortion.
"You want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow told journalists expressed.
"Just no cost for false papers shy"
Already on the day on which the Act came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be faked.
Some fake certificates, certifying the completion of the language tests were already fogging taken by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
The fake documents were printed with a standard color printer.
Of course, the new owners were not in vain this : Every migrant who hoped to thus saving themselves the tests, paying seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the test official : It costs a migrant three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption to ensure that licenses can not be purchased easily, both officers and civil rights are in agreement.
For the moment, the authorities of guest workers who fall through the test the first time, just promise that they will get time for a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers are offered without knowing the language points in areas where there is no active communication with people is necessary.
Home Office ignored illegal arms market
Proportion of legal weapons at extremely low crime
The Russian Interior Ministry plans to tighten the Firearms Act for private gun owners.
So that the authorities react to recent events : Injured during gun at weddings and seven deaths in the rampage of the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov.
The police want to ban the wearing of non-lethal weapons in public and put up the age for gun ownership from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal, the chairman of the Duma committee on security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, support and promised that the changes will shortly be submitted to the Duma on gun laws.
Not all are happy that the Russian authorities want to tackle the problems through "attraction of the screws".
On the Internet, an open letter was published, its author - representatives of various associations weapons - calling on the authorities to take note of "senseless tightening" distance.
The percentage of crimes registered with weapons is very low, expressed the criminal lawyer, Vasily Leśników, the Russian service of BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Interior registered 142 crimes with the use of weapons were committed in the course of six months in 2012, while for the same period a total of 1,168 thousand offenses were recorded.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners criminals will not keep you from having to operate on the black market.
Currently, one can, according to the authors find any weapon for little money in Moscow.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry stressed that the proliferation of illicit weapons is under control.
Suppliers : from the factories to the officers
The weapons go through multiple channels on the black market.
There are five main channels such says a former colonel Viktor Baranez who served ten years in the Education Ministry and the General Staff.
Takes screenshot of a website that weapons orders
The first channel is the army or the military, ie weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen from both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel are illegal weapons that law enforcement officers by criminals are stolen.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons that were stolen from both the armories of the police as well as directly by employees of law enforcement agencies.
More illegally sold weapons taken from military stockpiles.
In many military camps were frequent explosions.
"There is evidence that it acted in some cases of arson to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military members.
A contribution to the black market, according to afford Baranez the weapons manufacturers.
"Nowadays, there are countless private armament factories that do not withstand the international competition and therefore the weapons in hand on the black market, about in Moscow, squander," says the expert.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many pistols and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a separate, sometimes craft production, as well as a mafia, organized the smuggling," said the former military personnel.
Where are the weapons?
Experts calculated what percentage each of the five channels on the supply of the black market in illicit weapons was about.
In 2011, a report was written by the Center for problem analysis and public management.
The experts analyzed reports of the Interior Ministry and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data on portals on arms.
The vast majority of illegal weapons comes According to investigators from the army and law enforcement bodies.
Half of the weapons on the black market there are "get out of debt managers, who in their work have to do with weapons" by the, according to the report.
According to the data of the researchers are 17% of the weapons from conflict areas, 14% go on thefts in the production of weapons back, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant for a weapon shop that does not want to be named, asserts that weapons that are found in illegal excavations, long no one buys because they are outdated.
According to him, it is likely that dealers obtain the supplies in an arms depot.
A cadet is a weapon, for example, bought a gun-type TT.
The weapon is issued and handed over by the fence.
"The dealer puts the weapon into the city and sold them there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says
"The police, of course, knows all about it and therefore leads if they can not comply with the plan for the detection of crime, periodic test purchases at merchants through which offer illegal weapons," added the Salesperson.
"How in the luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers can find each other through acquaintances most often.
I had websites and blogs viewed me as someone who was aware of me and suggested that I come to the station to "Begovaya" where a person would wait for me, which would bring me to a certain place where we could negotiate the price.
The price of the gun I found out there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"In order to get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have a friend, but I do not trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but there you have to go and meet up with a code such as "by Ivan Ivanovich, which can be aligned, that the daughter has lost a tooth."
I 'm even currently on some brass knuckles on a friend, in whom I trust.
He gives me the knuckles also only because he knows that I do not verpfeife him.
Newbies looking for weapons in various ways.
The former military members Viktor Baranez tried in the mid- 1990s as buyers of illegal weapons, when he wrote an article on this topic.
The scheme, according to him have not changed.
He got a photo album in which "everything possible" was displayed.
"I felt like in the luxury shop," the military personnel recalls.
The buyer does not get loud Baranez the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
I, as a potential customer does not buy just, but go with the seller in the forest, and there we provide a target on.
"Then I can shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines display search results pages and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
There are neither needed nor is there any papers face meetings.
"You only need the right amount of money," it says "buy combat pistol or rifle" in the advertisement on the website.
Where users enter on your orders and make inquiries.
Will also be sold to minors?
"Of course, without a license," asks users "Ivan" (direct quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow," was the laconic inquiry of "Fedorenkow".
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless ticket websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons, the service will abound in the net.
People come like hungry fish at feeding time and then land in Siberia and may shoveling coal

I have heard from the following scheme : The site is normally registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The leaders take the orders.
The buyer transfers the money on an ATM.
"In response he receives a photo and a description of the hiding of the gun," said the spokesman of the nonprofit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baranez stressed that one can also get nothing in the end and come behind bars, when you place a request for a web page.
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless ticket websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons, the service will abound in the net.
"People are like hungry fish at feeding time and then land in the Siberian labor camp and may shoveling coal," he says.
A Makarov for$ 100
When buying illegal firearms experts say to expect with prices from 100 to 900 U.S. dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a Makarov pistol type for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is spent in military arsenals from overseers of intermediate rank.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of Interior, the number of crimes with illegal weapons in Russia in the period from January to October 2011, 7% to 22 900 back, while the number of cases of theft and extortion in connection with weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices shrank by 7.8%.
In the U.S. strike fast food and supermarket employees

In recent days there was anywhere in the USA to massive protests against low wages in Walmart stores and restaurants popular fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict whether the protests will further swell or if you again soon run out of air.
The protests are supported by several trade unions and left-wing non-profit organizations.
Besides increasing the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast food workers follow the organizers of the protests aim to form unions.
So far, this sector of the economy is hardly unionized.
46 cents in the year?
The protests started last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called Black Friday, the United States took place at the sellouts that attracted millions of customers, which sometimes led to melee.
On this day, put some Walmart employees, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, down their work and went on strike together with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain whose target group are low and middle income people.
Walmart sells all products of diapers on hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Goods in Walmart stores is on average 8-27% lower than in large supermarkets.
Why buy a lot of slightly paid Walmart employees only in their own workplace.
The prices and the range of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in the U.S..
Critics Walmart may only sell the goods as low therefore often because employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain of severe working conditions, such as lack of forklift or hand-held scanner.
The participants of the protests on "Black Friday," demanding wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to the company's own health insurance from 30 to 100 dollars a month was up.
A typical Walmart employee who earned 9.5 U.S. dollars an hour, this increase could not afford, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that, if the company's average wage increased to$ 12 an hour, it would cost$ 3.2 billion Walmart.
That is about 1.1% more than they now donate to pay.
Walmart would completely swing the wage increases on to customers, any future purchase cost them only 46 cents more.
Per year that would be for them compared to today overspend of just 12.39 dollars.
Proponents of Walmart notice satisfied that there were protests in only nine states and the companies they bestowed no losses.
Black Friday took to his store of 8 clock in the evening on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
Overall, the Walmart Cash led the "Black Friday" from almost 100 million transactions.
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington Post that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees stopped work and the protest action only "another PR trick" of the trade union, the protests, the organized, was.
"Free Checkout"
The protests went on in New York this week, where their goal but not Walmart stores (which are not desirable in this progressive city and therefore are non-existent so far), but were McDonald 's and other inexpensive restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billion servings, and yet you are granted no sick days, and you will not get paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage is in accordance with federal and New York law at$ 7.25 an hour.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too strong, and in their simple average employee get in New York 8.90 U.S. dollars an hour.
No less than they deserve in this expensive city.
How is it possible to do in New York with so little money, is beyond me.
There was once a time in which stood nearly a quarter of all U.S. teenagers after school at McDonald's behind the counter, but the young people were still living with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw it as the main source of income or planning to stay there longer.
Now I constantly encounter in interviews with employees of McDonald's people who complain that they get along with this job and sometimes even have to feed their children.
On the other hand, there is the forum of the Wall Street Journal a comment, the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, the morning before started on Thursday at 6.30 clock McDonald's, 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashier and cooks of fast-food restaurants receive a minimum wage of$ 15 an hour, which is more than double the current minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
The U.S. law prohibits corporate management to stand in the way of this goal and admonish or dismiss union members.
On the other hand, the management does not make it easy.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry is difficult but also objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff turnover.
dissatisfied
Loud protests took place on this day also from many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protest was a gathering at noon in front of the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including City Council Member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sells billion servings, and yet you granted you no sick days, and their will not pay for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that "we should jointly support the fast-food employee so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve economic prosperity, the every New Yorker deserves".
According to the New York Times it was the largest action of its kind in the history of the U.S. fast-food industry.
However, only a few hundred people on the spot, by far not all of them are employed in the fast food industry in which to work in New York, tens of thousands were.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize all the masses.
"The brain can have only moderately outsmart"
Popular with fans of modern technology theme of augmented reality is perceived lately, usually through the lens of special glasses.
Google first unveiled in the summer at its annual conference, a working model was then announced in November that Microsoft also had a corresponding patent.
In an interview with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies in the Microsoft lab in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, but it is clear that the glasses for the scientists of the company was only a transit station.
You intrigued by the possibility virtual objects in the air with his bare hands to manipulate and create virtual open spaces.
- Please describe briefly what your group conducts research.
- We deal with the interaction of man and machine, but it will extend the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, humanity has remained largely stuck in the phase is worked in with pixels on flat screens that are sometimes affected.
However, we want to look ahead 5-10 years and foresee the radical changes that interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a step forward, and now no more Xbox without Kinect is sold, as all interested in motion control.
- What else awaits us in the future?
- Even though the Kinect has brought interaction to a physical level, many things still playing on the flat screen off, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet decisive.
We're trying to change, to work on real three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We need to lay off the computer world into our physical world and make them tangible.
But for this it is necessary that not only the user but also its environment is detected.
Then we could add a lot easier the real world with virtual objects.
And first of all we should be rid of this stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
She is popular, but it is not overrated?
- It is certainly not the general purpose solution, since it raises privacy issues because you do not always inform all bystanders about its actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction is good with computers, but each in its particular niche.
For example, we worked in the field of control of objects in public places on a project where we are. Using short and concise, rather than experimenting with sweeping gestures
In this case the object is not the gesture camera, but by a bracelet have been recorded, the registered movements of the bones and muscles.
Yet it is relatively large, however, could theoretically be reduced to the size of a wrist watch.
But overall, but the future belongs to mixed control types, such as gestures and speech.
- How so?
- We would ask me, for example, you can of soda to pass this?
You say it and interpret it at the same time.
- I usually just say it.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to detect.
- Does that mean you want the user to conform to what can make a machine at the time and what not?
- Not necessarily, but it is about a rapprochement.
I think we need to be focusing their efforts on the development of new types of sensors in the near future, making it possible to capture responses from people more closely.
This can for example be laser sensors as they offer a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What are your requirements based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors in modern cameras?
Lack of resolution, depth or something else?
- The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, 8 megapixels would not be bad with a velocity of 1000 fps.
But the main thing is not the megapixels itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Seen in all current technologies for us is not good enough, because the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It must be taken into account not only the resolution along the X and Y, but also along the Z -axis.
Also, the speed and the number of images per second are important.
The movements of the people are told extremely dynamic and open, the current 30 fps is not enough especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed in our laboratory in Redmond a touch sensor with an adjustable processing time between 1 to 100 milliseconds, the present commercial sensors are closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand how much it affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work I needed just such a device, but without touch control and with more frames per second.
- Should the number of cameras can not be increased?
- Kinect currently uses three "cameras", one of which is actually a second infrared transmitter and a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras could possibly solve the problem...
Or amplify the problem, since more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice a flexible, Kinect -like system in which we could play with different inclinations camera to determine how helps us in determining a three-dimensional position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft unveiled his glasses unlike Google not to the public.
Do not you think that in view of the application of the technology of augmented reality in everyday glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course it is not pleasant to go always a smart phone in his raised hand to hold, but I think the following: The greatest variation would be a "changing" augmented reality, in which we could switch through a cloud of the glasses on the smartphone,
The glasses are a personal gadget and therein lies their strength (Private, only you can see), but at the same time also its weakness, because prevents augmented reality using glasses that you can collaborate with others on virtual objects.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also mere mortals.
There is a problem, often point to the critics of this idea: There is no tactile response!
The hands feel nothing!
What answers will give your group to this objection?
- In my lectures I speak of often that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently using the second hand is somewhat unusual projection surface.
It takes pressure true outstanding!
There are also technologies that are actually designed to give the "pictures in the air" something tangible, for example, produces the interference of some directed ultrasound beams at a certain point where the finger is, a feeling but currently is still so weak, as someone blew over the palm.
There are also bands for the wrist, which act on the nerve endings in the fingers, too, is a potential direction.
- Have you tried to trick the brain?
It make you think that it feels, what it should feel when it looks just a little?
- That's a good idea, so we have not tried it yet.
Here lies a further object, with which we will have to fight for a long time, namely to allow a person who is physically located in a closed room, believing he finds it instead in an open, practically infinite space, where we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), mobile platforms, and big balls.
So far, the brain can only moderately outwit, and before us are many busy years.
That's what makes the work in the field of virtual reality for a researcher so appealing : For many issues, we are only at the beginning.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt implementing the project "Petersburg avant-garde" continued dedicated city dwellers who form the vanguard of art and culture.
On the fine list already landed high-ranking representatives of the St. Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the limits of the city, and often find recognition in Europe, without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the flamboyant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the bearded man dressed in red that is found once at the Russian Museum, once the summer garden, meeting times at scene or at openings.
Wherever the images of Kirill Miller also be issued, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical social- philosophical Petersburg artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant personality of the St. Petersburg avant-garde late 80s or early 90s.
He is also a man of the city and conjures through his presence on the road to his fellow citizens a smile on your face and makes them in a good mood.
He recently grabbed a barrel organ and became the Petrograd barrel organ player, he finally felt ready for this difficult role in his artistic life, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always on the go in red and not, for example, yellow or turquoise in town?
I have chosen the color red as a fashion designer who deals with the optics and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artist, image consultant and society.
In society, all calls, which is slightly different from the standard gray, aggression and bad behavior out.
But I want to come by my provocations with people this week.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation for an interview.
- When did you know that you have to be a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Palace of Culture Nevsky, when my work was exhibited.
I realized that I have to go this route.
Then the time of the ancient free, but not officially recognized painter was then ended, and painters such as new and free I were incomprehensible.
I made friends with the painters of the new generation, that the representatives of the "Gazonewschina" him to create "Puschkinskaja 10", and was once the end.
I am drawn to the theater, to fashion, to music, actually everything except literature.
- And all the combined type in your clinic... - It was important for me to be at the center of St. Petersburg culture where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995, I occupied a room in the Puschkinskaja 10, and there were renovations to the club for a musical and artistic bohemians, the home of the St. Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born there : NOM, Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how cord with his project "Ucho Van Goga" came there.
Cord and his friends sang simple songs for playback, wore tight shirts and them was the now trendy composer Igor Vdovin.
As the group began to play live, was from her "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg hosted many programs before the time of "Halli Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and there began his great career, but the principles he learned from us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origin in the Art Clinic.
There went our staff and patrons.
I am a hero of the past century, as a culture still meant something.
In 2000 there was a survey in the press, in which it "personalities of our city," went for the award.
I won in the category "Artist of the Year", and I was at the peak.
It is not easy to work in new times by old rules, I 'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
At the present time, it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same : One can be famous without thereby making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has a distinctive style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and bring clearly the relevance and clarity of thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum clowns."
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and prepares afraid to be so.
In a clown that blurs everything and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
Let us save the world, for example, by requiring that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and is based on the exterior and not the interior of man.
But maybe you should not shake hands with a man, but should spit in his face.
The illusion disappears through the dressing.
- We recently saw you in the role of urban street organ player. - A city of culture should have such a hero.
Who, if not me?
- Can also commercial art be beautiful?
- Currently, commercial art has to be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the disintegration of cultures.
Before, people formed large groups : the bohemians loved the one and the other the common people.
Now there are micro communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred -dollar bill, which everyone likes.
Now you have to think about you, who you 'll like it.
Now everyone cult star has about 100 followers.
- To appearances by Stas Mikhailov, but more thousands!
- To him, women are abandoned, there the sexual- social sphere plays a role.
300 people are on cultural grounds and not 10 thousand, thus there is less management, money, and everything is ruined.
I have followers, and the important thing is not to cheat and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth I have painted such pictures hanging in a collector even in line with the work of Falk and Larionov.
I started with images that usually come at the end of the career.
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.
It means spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumer has no culture, that is something else entirely.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, rejected money to paint can.
This is the culture, which I support.
- Kirill thing missing Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
One said : Diener is Culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
In the real Czar it was different, because the Tsar understood perhaps not much of culture, but they understood that real experts are necessary.
In Moscow there are currently good advisers.
In St. Petersburg, we have what could be the experts, but they are the way is blocked, since it requires hochrangigerer experts who evaluate the former right and pave the way for them.
Now only one 's own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some artists therefore have to look for other museums.
- What is your idea Petersburg?
- Petersburg is the cultural capital, in Moscow, there is much more culture and a corresponding culture medium.
On our stones, art can be difficult to grow.
We need a cultural breeding ground, because for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right yet.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
For us, these are much less.
Art must be modern again, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants from the city of Saint Petersburg
Birth of the universe
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earthlings on board to make the search for a replacement planet.
To save mankind, this raises the important question of how we can reproduce ourselves in microgravity or on the spare planet?
There are not many choices in my opinion.
In fact, there are only two real planets we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"Namely, Mars and Venus," the scientific staff of the Sternberg Astronomical Institute Vladimir Surdin says.
However, while the conditions are relatively favorable for life on Mars, there on the surface of Venus, a temperature of 500 degrees.
Only life were at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, ie in space possible.
The issue of procreation in space, the researchers treated initially with regard to the flora.
Already half a century before experiments were carried out with plants.
The fourth generation of peas grown in orbit did not differ in the slightest from the terrestrial species.
It was followed by the breeding of insects, more specifically, from tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979 Quail eggs were sent into space to explore how the gravity affects the development of embryos.
It develops a normal chick.
But then the problem starts.
"The problem is that the chick needs to get a grip, it must be able to stand on his legs and begin to move," said head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without a solid foundation, the chick was racing wildly.
Ten hours later the instincts of newborns blunted completely.
The chicks did not respond to light and sounds.
Four days later, she died just then.
"Twice we had chicks hatch and then put the whole thing one because it is simply impossible to work there with them," Vladimir Sychew keeps the failed experiment with the chicks in all tight.
The last breeding cage with animals 16 years ago flew into orbit.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments continue.
However, only same-sex species are located on the Biosatelliten "Bion" position.
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized sent into space.
In principle, there nothing special was found.
"That was just the Biosatelliten, but it was again only a single experiment, and the research must be continued," says Vladimir Sychew.
After landing the space rats were young.
The problem of propagation directly in the space you previously could not solve.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are taken out of their natural habitat, simply can not follow their reproductive instinct.
Unlike animals, humans could the principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thought and can produce a similar emotional background.
Due to ethical considerations, such experiments are not carried out.
But women for 50 years already flying into space.
The biggest risk there was in Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing that has humanity, is the female organism.
Our seagull flew away, and no one on earth could answer the following question : Is it About the space flight?
If they can give birth to a child after this flight?
"After all, no one answered this question," says veteran space Vakhtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just a year after their space flight, gave birth to the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter.
The father of the child, Andriyan Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988 gave birth to the second woman in space, Svetlana Savitskaya, which was twice in orbit, and even work outside the spacecraft was doing, a son.
Nevertheless, there remains a risk.
We have extremely few cosmonauts, where after long flights all went well and they had healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even with flights into orbit," concludes cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet humanity must find new ways of biotechnology, radiation protection and the search for the generation of artificial gravity.
The hydraulic laboratory in the preparation of cosmonauts center is an obligatory station during the flight preparation.
Here in a suspended state, the cosmonauts routine win for working in open space.
The water represents the weightlessness
Even when adults perceive water as pleasant, it's a strange environment, but infants perceive water as a natural element.
It is as if the small Ichtyander witness the fact that life on the land emerged from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about nine months in the amniotic fluid in the womb, and that it can be easier to get used to water.
In principle this is logical, since from birth to first pass swimming just 2 weeks.
"That is not enough time to get something to forget," says Marina Aksenowa baby swimming instructor.
While gravity is thus a much more natural state for a newborn child, the woman can not do without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles begin to really fast and thus also decreases the ability to deliver the baby.
Well, we deal with the birth introductory resource.
The birth could take place, for example, in a special chamber to deliver the baby.
"But what happened then?" Says the not insignificant question of Valeri Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the pull of gravity, the body can not form the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child can not be placed as an adult to workout in a stress suit in orbit.
It is simply missing, which is of fundamental importance for his life.
"This experiment we make together, namely, the birth of a child in a strange environment, will mean that we will bring a disabled person, a completely maladjusted people to the world", says the head of the Bioethics Commission at the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems RAN, Igor pestov, ahead.
So far, the birth of children in the universe mere theory.
Sometime it is reality but when the earthlings set off in their ships to a distant planet, which is the home for their offspring born in space.
SAO chief: the Black control system failed due to the fault of the policy
Czech Republic has in the context of public procurement on good policing and adequate legislation, however, will fall back into their application.
In an interview for this Aktuálně.cz says the vice-president of the Supreme Control Office (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, SAO), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is not perfect, but it must be used correctly - and this is my opinion, not the case with us," Kala says the current situation.
A similar result is also apparently a common control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative example, he leads the practice setting of Prime Minister Petr Necas called for "Black System".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS, the entrepreneur would not bother with controls - so the system is now banned or allowed?
"A law must still have its validity, and if something is illegal, it can not just government chairman come and impede Control Board, whose duty is, after all, the monitoring of compliance with the law, in his work," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Audit Chamber of Deputies They talked about a joint Czech- German project, under which the laws of both countries regarding public contracts were compared.
Worum d es da konkret?
This is a parallel audit, with which we started about two years ago.
Simply put, it comes that the European legislature determines how public contracts are to handle. Then build on national legislation. And finally, there is the actual practical application.
All this we have compared, and although the test is not yet complete, we found extremely interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws are with us maybe even a little "strict and perfect", but the actual application is in Germany in some parameters better.
This confirms that it is not enough, again setting new and more precise rules. One must also deal with the actual application of the law.
How can you be of help to the project? What results from this project for you?
Just such a common control could help that we stop us constantly to seek to perfect the laws and the reduction and balancing of thresholds, if this obviously does not affect particularly positive.
Economy means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) to acquire and to exclude illicit enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the lowering of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we will reach this goal.
Maybe it is so that we thus burdening the system with excessive "paperwork", and those looking for loopholes in the system, have it much easier to use the system as if the thresholds were higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Public Procurement Act.
How does the control system in Germany?
Is there a similar authority as our SAO, or the system works differently?
As for the authorities, as is the German equivalent of the SAO, the Federal Court, which is constructed similar to us and also has a college which is formed only slightly different. Basically, however, both agencies work similarly.
Also the skills are comparable to some extent with Germany, however, is a federal state, ie that there is this SAI and in the individual federal states - in the German system differs from our.
The BRH may control only federal funds, which corresponds to our state resources.
Public funds that are managed by us at the districts and communities, there are the control of the national audit offices.
As to the German legislation, is the easier than ours?
In general, I would be reluctant to compare this with no concrete information. Nevertheless, Germany is often referred to as a role model in some respects, but determines where you can not say that Germany is better at everything.
Is perhaps the fact that there are examiners better?
The not determined, but as I said : Such comparisons I do not particularly like.
For this purpose, it should be noted that even those countries that are a model for us are also struggling with problems.
Otherwise, they would not know anything about working with our agency, right?
With regard to the Czech legislation, which had significance for the amendment of their authority to the Procurement Law, you already feel any effect?
Given that this amendment has only been in force, it affects our tests so far from not.
Since our controls are in place subsequently to be reckoned with here with a certain delay.
Effects we feel far more in the preparatory phase controls in future - so we have the new instrument of control "identification of risks of inefficiency" is introduced and tested with this nearly 14,000 public contracts and analyzed - here the changes are, of course, affect, since change the thresholds, the conditions for certain species have been modified by including calls
See the adoption of this law rather positive, or is the system charged with additional bureaucracy?
I think that by this Act is a step in the right direction and I hope that this notion.
However, the problem may arise that the rules of "strict" are and can no longer be maintained.
Already under the previous rules are the one under test persons relative to the carrier (for example, in the event of an operational program of regional policy, the Regional Council) to the effect accountable that any non- compliance with the Public Procurement Act a breach of budgetary discipline equals.
But then it is sensible to make the law more stringent?
I do not think this way.
The system must exclude those who attack and try to abuse the system, and not punish those who have committed a procedural defect that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system requires only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where is the way out here?
We say first of all, what path is not purposeful.
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS would not bother with the entrepreneur controls the so-called "Black System" - what does that mean exactly?
Black is the system now banned or allowed?
A law must still have its validity, and if something is illegal, then the government can not just come Chairman and impede Control Board, whose duty is, after all, the monitoring of compliance with the law, in its activities.
He can say, "We will change the law and allow the thing," but he can not say that we act as if nothing had happened.
The Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain operations - and this is also true for the protection of the public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic when the bidder with the best offer will be excluded solely on the basis of form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be used correctly - and that is what we lack in my opinion.
On the streets there occasionally icy roads, but mostly they are dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic is partially snow and ice.
Mostly, however, the roads are easy to drive, sometimes increased caution.
Carlsbad
Karlovy Vary Region this morning the streets were easy to drive, occasionally there was snow and ice.
The temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 ° C during the day it will be a bit warmer.
The region is not snowing now, and in the lower altitudes remains only a thin blanket of snow.
However, there are about 30 cm of snow on the ridges of the Ore Mountains.
According to the county road patrol, there was limited visibility due to fog.
The expressway R6 and the roads of the first class roads in the region are currently accessible without restriction.
Attention is, however offered, for example, on bridges, on which sometimes freezes the roadways and smooth.
All roads are passable also the second and third class road, including mountain roads.
On these roads, however, remain partially frozen or extended patches of snow.
Especially in the higher elevations increased attention is therefore necessary.
Bezirke Pardubice und Hradec Králové
On some roads in East Bohemia is a risk due to icy roads, at higher elevations in the mountains and is on the streets sometimes even an extended layer of snow, splits the road and Motorway Directorate with on their websites.
The road maintenance warn drivers of icy conditions that can occur, especially at higher altitudes in the Pardubice Region.
To icy roads may in particular the second and third class roads in the districts Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí Polička Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto come.
The roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow on the roads especially in the Giant Mountains and the mountains Orlické mountains.
An extended layer of snow lies at altitudes on the streets of the circles Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In Bohemia it is today mostly sunny and cheerful, and it remains largely rainless.
Temperatures range between -3 and +1 ° C, a weak wind is blowing.
Bezirk Pilsen
The roads in the district of Pilsen are now easy to drive, but increased attention is locally available, and those driving style to adapt to the weather.
This is frosty morning, with temperatures 3-9 degrees below the freezing point.
As it snowed earlier and the temperatures started to drop, there may be black ice on the roads.
Locally is also likely to fog, with visibility will improve in the day.
These figures come from the district road maintenance.
The D5 motorway is practically accessible without restriction, recommend increased attention to road maintenance, however, between the 80th and the 131 Kilometers.
The roads of the first class of road are mostly dry, but frozen through.
In the south of Pilsen and Tachov circles, it may come to icy sections.
The roadways of the second and third class roads are wet, and therefore applies here, the reference to possible icy sections.
Drivers should be especially careful mainly on the less frequented roads in the area Šumava.
District Olomouc
With slush today must expect drivers who are traveling in Olomouc in the direction of altitudes.
After the use of gritting vehicles slush remains as Turn on the pass Red Mountain Gap and on the road towards Videlský.
Nightly snowfall forced the road maintenance used in the district Šumperk fell, according to the Road Administration about 3 cm of fresh snow.
In other areas of the district, the roads are usually accessible without restriction.
" In Šumperk circle remain in the heights of snow still remains.
On the pass Red Mountain Gap, drivers must expect towards Jeseník with slush, " an employee of the Road Administration said today Šumperk towards the Agency CTK.
Their colleagues in the district of Jeseník had out in the night, according to submissions to the streets in the altitude after chemical treatment are free and weather.
In Olomouc county roads are accessible without restriction, but in a circle Šternberk the drivers must drive carefully in forest sections, because the roads are still wet.

Black ice is reported especially from the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, there was this ideal conditions at night - during the rain and melting snow, cloudless sky in the night and frost.
Of the main routes and on the road I/13 on the border of the districts of Ústí nL Liberec and reported poor transport conditions.
The closure of the road between Telnice and Knínice was necessary due to branches that were depressed by the snow load up to the road.
Šimon Ornest : At our concerts we want to gain positive energy
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month, end of the world to take place?
This is one of those catastrophe reports, which we like to jump people like this.
With our band, The Tap Tap we make it more funny and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop the doomsday or prevent.
In December you also implement a unique project with three concerts against the doomsday.
Can you imagine the project closer to our readers?
It is a nationwide fundraising event, we are already planning two years.
For this purpose we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, the end of the 21 December is forecasted at 11:10 clock in the morning.
The day before, that is on 20 December, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava will be held simultaneously from 21:00 clock.
The end of the concerts will be at about the time of the ending on the Pacific island of Kiribati, located in a time zone 12 hours ahead to Mayan calendar.
By whom this idea come from?
Probably originally from me, then we have the idea embodied in common with our graphic Honza Augusta.
We want to not only collect enough positive energy to prevent the apocalypse, but we also want together with the public to think about what state we even give our children the world over.
At the end of the Mayan calendar we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T- shirts, bags and key rings end of the world, with their purchase via www.e- tap.cz people can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap, together with other artists also the so-called hymn to the apocalypse titled "Doomsday fails," added.
Even today, the hymn is very popular on YouTube. If they sound on benefit concerts?
Of course, namely the very end, assuming that everything works and the apocalypse does not happen...
The anthem will be sung by all performers simultaneously on all three concerts.
In addition, the hymns are transmitted live together in a direct circuit by Czech Television.
The text of the anthem is by Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene that goes with it, that we realize many charity events and concerts...
We strive to integrate these people into our intensive projects.
It has been shown that most are interested in working with us, and have fun doing it.
What purpose will the proceeds of the concert to the end of the world benefit?
For the establishment of accessible education center Studeo where we have been working together for six years with the club Tap in Jedlička Institute.
The students of the Institute Jedlička are regularly supervised by assistants who help them in various recreational activities.
Since the students do not even have the means to visit the editors, we want to help them in this way.
In the context of the completion of the Jedlička Institute is a private building arise in which we move with this project.
At every concert several groups and performers occur.
What criteria did you choose this?
We wanted to put together a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiri Suchy occur.
Everything else you learn www.kpks.cz. on the website
Are similar "big events" also planned for the future?
In May, we meet for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we are preparing an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are then ever in the U.S. - this would also like to connect with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Their foreign plans are not exactly small, so far you have performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, the Tap Tap is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you cope with these trips logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it appears at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, ie wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage compartment. We also of course have to carry a lot of instrument cases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems, CSA and British Airways were always prepared very well for us that I have sometimes wondered partially.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your traveling abroad, you have to compare how it looks in different countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people there, etc.
As you have seen these things before?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than ours, we were just in Russia witnesses to the fact that in the East, all is in its infancy.
Compared to Moscow, Prague is absolutely not wheelchair accessible. There is still uncommon when someone is traveling alone in the city center in a wheelchair.
It is there not even a matter of course that you vorlässt a wheelchair, for example, in the elevator.
Fortunately, there also arise clubs who try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are many things in which we hang behind...
This, however, is also to be noted that an improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those involved.
In London and Madrid, it is very common that people also move independently with severe disabilities in the public domain, go to the museum can use toilets, etc.
But it is not exactly common, that there a large group of disabled people actively involved in social action, whereby we are with the band The Tap Tap a little ahead of the West!
Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only when coming from our ranks major athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things will really start to change.
So far these are only isolated cases of very strong-willed personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. But if we go back a few years : What was in 1998 motivated to start a band?
At that time, I started as a supervisor in the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were keen to engage in some intensive.
And as a musician myself, and inter alia Saxophone playing, I founded together with a colleague Music AG.
Well, with time, much like our moderator, Láďa Angelovič uses to say something out of control (laughs).
But the band was known only in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that we helped to working with famous singers in addition, we have also begun to actively recruit for us.
We realized that if one does something and this is not visible to the outside world, their own performance in a sense does not exist.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also good proofreaders, quality appliances and etc. afford.
Was it your goal to make it this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I felt the potential that you can do things differently.
In show business today often copied one another.
This is logical in its own way, as everything carefully considered new and will be accepted only after a long time.
There are few truly unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap one of them.
The first impression the audience has usually is, of course, compassion, which is only natural...
But this sympathy is absolutely unnecessary, because people are not lonely and abandoned creatures with disabilities that we would regret.
There are people who live a full life and can develop as long as they have the necessary funds.
I always say that when people with disabilities succeed in something, this is not only for itself a step forward, but for the whole society.
Was it for this success also helps that you are a strict boss, as one hears from many people?
If you want to do something good, you should not compromise on many things and must demand a certain amount of discipline.
I think this is completely normal.
Some come to us with romantic notions, and when they find that they have twice a week sample must complete preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, the enthusiasm of many expire soon.
So but it works everywhere, in every band who work seriously and want to achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many of them were from the beginning, that is since 1998?
Only one : Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. People come and go. This can not be prevented.
Who has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome.
Takes place the day before the predicted doomsday, Thursday 20.12.2012 by 21 clock
Venues are : Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda / Brno and Plynojem / Ostrava, Czech Republic 12 bands and other musicians
All three venues are connected to the circuit via live circuit together and plays a common interpretation of the hymn "doomsday falls out" of the band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is the means to furnish a multifunctional wheelchair raise educational center that will be built under the name studeo in Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost: 25 million CZK
Admission costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available in advance from Bohemia Ticket.
Poland and space.
Last week Poland was recorded on a Council of Ministers meeting of the member states of the European Space Agency as a member of this twentieth Space Agency. Poland is now the second member country of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic, the ESA member was on November 12, 2008).
Poland began in 1994 in close cooperation with ESA and participated in the following years in several ESA projects.
The way Poland into space began much earlier, however.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts busy with the space where they are not always met with understanding on it.
I recall here, for example, the lecture by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author thought "entrance to the Cosmonautics" introduced in his pioneering work.
However, the ideas of the young engineer (b. 1905) left the audience cold, and after years Šternfeld still reminded that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won in 1934 for "entrance to the Cosmonautics" donated by Robert Esnault - Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prix REP - Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a leading proponent of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis internationally recognized contribution to the development of space was include thereby acknowledged that one of the craters was named on the far side of the moon for him.
A railway bogie was built in 1925 in Poland, for a rocket engine was planned.
The author of the design and the details of this project unfortunately remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the missile should be used to start or to brake the trolley.
The information is sourced from contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket -powered projectiles.
The research, the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustav Mokrzyckiegi.
From the traditional documents, it is evident that the research had advanced to the stage of practical tests.
The research was then of course interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937 appeared in the trade press of the coming of Ing Rohozinski draft photoelectric hunting rocket on, and the following year appeared in the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" the author Leliwa - Krzywoblocky.
Both projects were concerned with the military use of rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects on the military use of the missile technology from passers Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo - Naukowy) were coordinated.
The Committee was set up in 1937, after two years of activity, however, his work was ended by the outbreak of war.
More articles on space appeared after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company is in the November 1954 issue of the journal Problemy, are dedicated to the four articles of the extensive space.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to create a space company.
At the time, there was already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was expected that the exploration of space would have a future.
Even in its early days in 1956, the Polish aerospace company sought a PTA membership of the International Federation for Aerospace, founded in 1951, and was the PTA actually decent in the fall 1956 members.
The following year, the first PTA president, Kazimierz was Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for space.
He held until his death in 1959 this office.
Since 1956 the PTA involved instrumental in developing the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM -1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on 10 Oktober, 1958.
The missile with a maximum altitude of 1800 m was about 80 inches long and weighed not quite 5kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM -1A, built, and in 1959 began in the desert Błędów - flight tests with the two-stage rocket RM -2.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another development stage should already be able to make real scientific work - the RM -34 rocket should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and come for the observation of high altitude winds are used.
In 1962, however, further development was discontinued.
Successor of the first missiles RM was developed in the years 1962-1965 Meteor -1 rocket.
The rocket was designed as a two -stage rocket, their total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Of these three types were developed rocket (Meteor -1A, -1B and 1C) that differ from each other in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The meteor -1A rocket had a transport capacity of 0.4 liters, meteor -1B about 0.34 liters and 0.62 liters over 1C Meteor.
The maximum altitude was 37 km for all three types.
In 1965 to 1968, the Meteor -2 rocket was developed in the aviation institute, began its first flight test in October 1970.
Meteor -2 had a launch mass of 380 kg, and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Then the versions Meteor Meteor -3 and 2H were built.
Also worth mentioning is the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, later followed by the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee on the two years.
Poland participated in the Intercosmos program also in space research with Soviet satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after the Czechs was cosmonaut Vladimir Remek second Inter.
The repeal of the law on non-profit work is not a solution.
In the past week, the Constitutional Court overturned the law on public works.
This decision called in public produced a lively discussion.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective times out.
The liberal -oriented economies in the EU and in the globalized world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In effect, this means that the individual national economies are in a permanent conflict.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free and unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with rampant financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of labor (wages), there is price tensions.
This term is defined as a condition in which the manufacturer is trying to pass through import cheaper goods in economic competition by "undercutting" the competition so as to tear a larger market share and to increase its profit.
On a large scale this means for most companies to move their production abroad or buy there cheap, or give up their business. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparatively high labor costs.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, necessarily increase government spending.
This situation is exacerbated by the fact that the men entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thus to replace the damage they have overall social economic and social damage.
This situation is generally known, so that specific statistics at this point are unnecessary.
The reckless practice of private capital creates in the individual economies in which the governments are forced to enter into competition with each other to reduce the social level of the population own artificially and thus attract foreign capital into the country a situation.
In other words, the governments provide their own population without regard to the social consequences of private capital.
This manifests itself particularly in changes in applicable laws.
The aim of these measures is to force their own people to accept the dictates of private capital especially in the wage sector.
This is done firstly by economic pressures in long-term unemployment, the other by the erosion of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty and increasing inequalities between rich and poor.
In Germany it has been around for several years public food distribution points for the poor, who are no longer able to sustain themselves by their own labor.
The number of those affected is already in the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there will frequently be cases where workers receive a wage so low that the state needs to increase their income up to the poverty line.
Such a scandal was uncovered in the case of assistants employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures virtually all EU Southern will undoubtedly come down to the same condition in which people are forced under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social level to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or for a pittance on margins of society to starve and to hope that sometime private investment capital will flow into the country.
Here suggests itself naturally to the question, where did this capital come from?
If it comes from another EU country, only the poverty migrates from one country to another, or all of the capital remains the same, because working in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt and in Africa in general employees for a fraction of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim ad nauseum that the state must not involved with capital to its own economy, and that planned economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital insists on his narrow-minded view that the state should not intervene in directing the economy.
Then you have to ask yourself whether or not private capital influences the policy and thus the entire state in their own selfish purposes, or even deflected.
Here is the definitive answer : Yes.
The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent, omnipresent in all states lobby.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual Before graduation, a legislation in which everything is practically reprehensible, but not criminal.
In Germany the situation is such that a State Department commissioned a lack of finances private, closely intertwined with the industry right company with the elaboration of draft laws.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
All power is then no longer derived from the people as it spread the western constitutions, but of strong financial groups who prefer their own interests.
Obviously, the liberal democracies currently fall quickly into a situation as ' Appian describes in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompey : " The state has long been understood in the decay, and the offices were occupied by force.
Against bribery, by unlawful or fraudulent acquisition of benefits with stone and sword.
Corruption is rampant unrestrained, and the people did not go with already bought votes for election "..." people with character competed for offices, so that the state as a result of this decline for eight months Consul had no "..." You began really to talk about, that is the only medicine in this difficult situation is an autocracy, and that a strong man should be elected "... Appian was thinking while at Pompey, but the strong man eventually was then Caesar, the durable democracy through the autocracy replaced.
It turns out that the present society is based, as in ancient times on the preference of the ruthless own advantage, without regard to societal interests.
Private capital is not recognizable from its nature, be able to benefit for the whole society and enforce.
The result, now as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elite who do not strive for deeper reforms in the least.
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism, we must therefore in the ruthless liberalization of economies in the 19th and 20 Search century.
Seen from the present condition, the downfall of this regime in favor of liberal democracies can be regarded as certain interval at which the next round already emerging.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that today's elites the potential future losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are witnessing today, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know from the past and recent history, in complete ignorance of standing.
The repeal of the law on non-profit work here is not a solution, at least not permanently.
Under the pressure of the global and European economic competition Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to push the social level of the population down.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase capital participation of the state in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in the Company in favor of the state.
Israel : Labor of Chaos.
"... That nothing comes from violence, or could ever arise," Sting sings in the song Fragile, which is the most important verse in the chorus : "... lest we forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons did not want wars, there would be no," said the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a myriad of reactions.
The one stand behind Israel and argue with their right to self-defense, while indicating the Palestinians as terrorists, the other in turn support the Palestinians argue with the racism of the Israeli state, which perpetrated against the Palestinian Arabs genocide and called the state of Israel as terrorist.
I would like to take this opportunity not write about who guilty and who is the victim in these recurring waves of killing, ultimately, the present inhabitants of Israel, including the self-rule areas were born into the current political situation and have not experienced the onset of the violence itself.
It is my intention to open the readers a look behind the scenes to look at who the voltage 95 years (counting from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) are particularly useful in the small patch of land in the Middle East.
My thoughts are partly based on available historical facts, others are derived from, and go forth out of my own understanding of who or what group of people influences the events of modern history major.
The history of mankind is primarily a story of the struggle for power.
In each epoch, we can have a Alexander the Great or Napoleon make.
What is less obvious is the question whether it was really getting these individuals themselves, their steps autonomously determined, or if someone was standing behind her throne, who directed their actions to a predetermined target.
We must admit that we live in a time in which the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and power arising therefrom is not created within the life span of a generation.
Under these astronomically wealthy families, one stands out in particular, which could be described as the head of the octopus (I do not know if anyone else is about them, but I do not rule this out) - the Rothschilds.
Is not much written about them.
Understandably.
The first news agency (Reuters) by the Rothschilds was already in the 90s of the 19th Bought century to prevent the connection of their name with high criminal deeds in whose background was always the consolidation of their power, the growth of their assets, or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they fight wars or upgrade to this (before the invasion of Afghanistan were there 7 countries, after the attack on the Iraq, there were five countries after the fall of Gaddafi were only four, with Russia has submitted his Central Bank of the Russian government in the meantime).
Whoever tries to oppose this family had to pay with his life for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild's Bank of America as a central bank, began during the Civil War, its own (read: government) issue banknotes and was assassinated in 1865 in a theater.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue their own notes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was assassinated in 1963, the MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936, after the Fed wanted to sue for triggering the global economic crisis in 1929.
The global appetite for power of the Rothschilds introduced in the years 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan for the unleashing of three world wars by Albert spades, a Freemason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was to eliminate the goal of the great monarchical States essence of Europe, the colonial rule of Great Britain should in particular be broken by the second war, and the third war to the world population to about 0,5 - 1 billion people reduce (such number would be for ensure their amenities and their luxury and would not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than the apron) and eventually lead to the acquisition of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families working with the Rothschilds at the top, is the triggering of a crisis and then offer a solution (order from chao - order out of chaos).
These solutions, however, are always wrong and lead to the aggravation of the situation (see the founding of the Fed, so that crises like the one of them in 1907 triggered repeat not).
After they had succeeded by the murder of the Habsburg heir Ferdinand in Sarajevo, triggering the First World War, they destroyed the Russian Empire by the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Empire, the war was no longer needed), then was the resolution of the Central European great power Austria -Hungary.
To reignite the war easier, the bankers were the policy a latent conflict create by occupied Germany with huge war reparations, thus they created the condition of impoverished masses, so that they only had to foist a sufficiently strong leader the Germans, of the culprits named and simple solutions offered, another factor was the creation of Czechoslovakia multiethnic state with a strong German minority that should occupy the function of a fifth column and also took to kindle the fire of war.
End of the 19th Century, the Rothschilds initiated the founding of the Zionist movement, in which a branch aimed at the establishment of a Jewish state, as in the historical region of Judea, with Jerusalem as its capital (Return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration set the stage for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, there was first clashes with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks there were on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether now Hitler broke away from the chain to the him, the international bankers were initially held, or if everything went according to plan, it is difficult to estimate, definitely created the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the international community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and was just as prepare the ground for the Second World War through the war reparations against Germany, the State of Israel proclaimed the establishment of the focal point for the Third World War I.
If it is successful the international bankers to unleash this war, the Jewish people is like in World War II victims in the front line of battle, this time with the Arab and Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of contention and chaos, not only within the country but also internationally (just think how sharp the people are divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israel, where injustice injustice only in an endless spiral of violence triggers, which at the beginning was the greed of individuals and their quest for global power?
One must distinguish between Israel and its leadership the residents here, but put the international bankers in Israel as well as with us, the people, only their own candidates for election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of fascism -prone, international bankers, loyally devoted politician who will do their best to ignite a war with Iran, which, given the membership of Iran in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly escalate into a global conflict, and which is run because of Iran's control over the only 2 miles wide Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of global oil supplies, the destruction the world economy could come.
Light in which the words appear as David Rockefeller in 1994 : "The only thing we need is an overarching crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In her mind, the New World Order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which serves the rest of the human population of a small group of aristocrats of finance.
A world in which every newborn at birth, a chip is implanted, to subdue this creature of total control.
" And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand or on their foreheads, that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, namely the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom! If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast.
For it is a human number, and his number is six hundred sixty six. "
The film Argo : If it is the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamist students seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release they demanded the surrender of the ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled after the revolution in the United States, which had maintained for decades the patronage of his regime.
For the U.S. government, there was no positive way out of this situation - they could not afford to throw overboard the Shah, because it would have damaged the trust of its allies in other countries massively.
At the same time she was not in a position in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, to secure the release of hostages.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent violent fiasco when the hostage rescue attempt only made things worse.
The captured diplomats were released after 444 days of negotiations with the Algerian government had been taught.
The fate of the hostages called home produced a wave of solidarity and antiiranischer moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.
The film Argo director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode in history that the United States gave a small partial victory.
Immediately prior to the occupation of the Embassy of six embassy employees managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian Ambassador.
The CIA succeeded in cooperation with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran, taking them helped an extravagant story to conceal their true identity - she traveled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film rod, allegedly in the country locations for a science fiction film attended.
Combining the Genres
From the experts, developed for "exfiltration" Tony Mendez plan also made the necessary cooperation Hollywood.
So that the camouflage was credible, published articles on this film project in journals, press conferences were held, and the fictional manufacturing company had a real office.
The details of this operation were long kept secret. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a particular combination of film genres.
On the one hand it is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time, a so-called "Caper Movie", ie the story of a successful piece of hussars, such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This change in mood levels from the movie - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and also in the film version of the same situations there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and slightly exaggerated come along.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the conference table, the office corridors, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has succeeded with this film a remarkable restart his career.
From a ridiculed actor has become a respectable director, and also as an actor, he is now no longer the goal ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film based on the thriller Gone Baby Gone (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller City without Mercy (2010).
At the same time it's Affleck's first movie is not playing in his native Boston, the director.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was like the features that stood out the previous movies of this director from the standard Hollywood.
However, Affleck proves this sense also in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the movie playing in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that actually took place - the input sequence of the storming of the embassy is very impressive in its simplicity, and yet conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability, which occurs when somewhere once moves the story.
A similar effect is achieved Affleck with his team at fictional scenes (the wrong film crew at a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with it, that the story really does not offer many exciting scenes in cinematic sense.
But with the little he has worked quite successfully, and he sometimes nachhilft reality something - which then acts not always so stylish (the scenes of the impending crisis is averted at the airport in Tehran by a phone call in America, or even the chase on the runway, seem a bit contrived).
The weakness of Argo is its excessive fragmentation, which is due to the necessity to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in their roles as Hollywood staff although very charming, but their characters have earned more space, and therefore they are not in the movie by far alone.
Affleck film loses some traction. It is a film that you follow with some interest, while the design and a thriller from the 70th Years can goutieren reminiscent retro style.
However enthusiasm he wakes difficult.
As a reminder of a still alive in some way as a piece of history and evidence of how the ideas are still covered by the omnipotent and omniscient intelligence, but it is sufficient.
Guidelines for inflating balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, who exclaims an annual survey on the most outrageous bank charges, has this year decided to hold the contest "absurd idea or regulation from the EU - Workshop".
"This gave us the idea recently put forward by the EU plan to introduce a quota of 40% in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who takes care of the organization of this survey, the newspaper Pravo.
Among the nominees absurdities, for example, is the judgment of the European Court on the Unification of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women in life insurance enjoyed an advantage because they objectively represent a lower risk for insurance companies.
" More incredible ideas from the EU - Workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote is then up to the end of February 2013, " Nacher said.
To the controversial EU regulations is inter alia the mandatory blending of bioethanol fuel that is naturally harmful in its impact, the further the prohibition of the reliable mercury thermometer, simply because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, or the Directive on the size of chicken cages, essentially because of this year eggs were more expensive.
Critical praise in the past, the de facto ban of the use of the term "butter spread" or even banning the sale of incandescent light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 inches long
The EU apparatus is often decisive, under the pressure of this or that lobby of Trade and Industry, whose claims are represented in Brussels usually of one or more Member States (as the Czech Republic is currently trying for example to enforce with veto threat demands Czech banks).
Lobbying interests were also behind that bananas the highest classification in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have any "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission defended it by arguing that it merely harmonize the disparate national standards that would hamper trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables were softened by the EU against the resistance of some countries are already pointing out that the previous policy would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU directive of last year, which must be provided in accordance with balloons on the sale by pointing out that children are not allowed to inflate the balloon without adult supervision under eight years.
The EU on the basis that an American study, the balloons are the leading cause of death by asphyxiation of the children.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years in the use of Jahrmarktströten.
Curious ideas are at home
Relatively absurd is also a policy that concerns European officials themselves - anyone who has an official function in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece and FYROM have to say instead (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the Association of laissez faire liberal economists addition to the above Absurdities of the EU Regulation on the scope of food supplies to the territory of a Member State.
The EU thus firmly put the maximum volume of food stocks, which could be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our EU accession.
Czech Republic exceeded then e.g. the fixed volume of preserved mushrooms, for which we threatened a heavy fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money that they have no sea, or to give the idea, funding for applications for funding.
These ideas came certainly not from Brussels but from Prague.
"We are handicapped by the fact that we have no sea.
We will ask the EU refund, "explained the fall of 2004, the then Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).
As an argument, he noted that the grain harvest was very high and the state warehouse due to so-called intervention purchases were overcrowded.
Since the Czech Republic have another way to seaports, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us loud Palas.
The European Commission finally came against the Czech Republic so far that they organized a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that have no access to the sea.
Funding for applications for grants offered to municipalities to the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically it should be of medium to To Set Up A funding requests money to Brussels.
EU : Bizarre regulations are the exception
Although regulations are easily earned in the member countries the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus to development effectiveness and the European Union according to some experts but rather recognition.
A more serious problem is the opinion of these experts rather the EU funding for projects that have absolutely nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but were forced in the budget negotiations of individual member countries.
Calls forth emotions in this country and the fact that the Czech Republic, like other member states in Brussels to fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and must not always win this fight.
Although the Czech Republic was able to defend the term "olomoucké tvarůžky" after a six -year battle with Germany and Austria, the Inländerrum (Tuzemský rum), with a tradition with us until the 19th Century goes back, but had to rename our manufacturers in "Tuzemák".
The name Rum may only be used for products from sugar cane distillate, not for products from sugar beets.
In the official list of registered products in the EU dive in the company of world-famous cheese feta and gorgonzola, the Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham now also on the Carlsbad rusks, carp Pohořelice and Trebon, or the Saaz hops.
With an EU trademark the Pardubice gingerbread or Hořice roles can boast since.
"People want me to save the republic, but I 'm just an amateur," says Okamura.
Senator, how do you get the idea to run for president?
It 's not intended to be senator or president.
If in our country everything would work without problems, I would run anywhere.
But I can no longer watch as the Republic is being plundered for 20 years, as thieves roam free while the people's taxes and the retirement age be increased.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But when I see something I do not like, I try to propose a solution to change this.
And since I 'm already over 40, and this independent and nonpartisan, I have no other way to influence things than to run for the office of a senator or the president.
In the Senate, you have made it and then made equal to the path to the castle.
Not return by the back of your constituents?
I told myself all the time that I will take the fight to the castle on the outcome of Senate elections.
I later clarified this and said that I would run for the office of President, if I am elected senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is a tool with which I can realize my visions.
For that I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate.
The difficulty is not only that we as a people grumble at the pub and watching television, but down to make everyone who wants to change something.
To the media who want to rob an honor to come, to lie and confuse freedom of speech with freedom.
About me was, for example, claimed that I would bribe journalists and I was adviser Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
The battle for the castle you have taken with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as retroactive declaration of assets over 20 million crowns.
You must change laws.
As president, you have no powers in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can bring legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have lobbied that the guide remains a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the small-minded politics - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good suggestion, it is deliberately rejected, and that keeps the population only.
As an independent non-party member I have a much greater potential to win support of all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take without pigeonholing and party dogmas of each party, what is best for our country.
See yourself as a human being in politics rather the right or left?
From the Czech perspective seems to me that I see people more left.
For me, this left-right thinking is totally unimportant.
For me it is important that we continue to come.
It's not about me, whether someone belongs to the left or to the right wing, I would like connect people.
I always support each public good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or of the ODS, and also I will turn myself against bad ideas.
You do not like it if someone called populists.
But you do not confirm by what you have just said?
If you set up a business plan for a company, you will have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to approach this.
This can be described as populist because of me, but all proposals, of which I have spoken to function in the world already, or they were discussed by key experts.
But without support in parliament to stay you just slogans.
And so you will not get far in politics long run.
Or do you think that it will give you, if you talk long enough with the people who manage to enforce, for example, the material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to get them on our side in order to enforce these goals.
As president, it would be no problem for me, live request to the chairman of the parliamentary parties on television to anchor the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors by law.
And if the addressee would then say why they refuse to do so.
A strong personality that points to grievances may exert pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the president, which was a credit to public pressure.
Let me be very clear that I am an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
With the policy I have just started and trying to find majority support for my program.
I always try to judge the things themselves, and if it does not work, then I go back six years in the private sector.
That sounds a little as if Okamura Czech Republic should save.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I do not reach alone, so I 've spoken with several well-known personalities whether they do not want to run for the Senate.
I have for example spoken with Radim Jančura, but declined due to the work overload.
I also have the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová support, which revealed the fraud in trade in heating oil.
My candidacy I started with the premise that people are deeply unhappy, but now I 'm not so sure.
Sixty percent of the electorate are not at all gone to the polls, and those who have gone, mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are thus only two independents.
The people have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of mayors and district captains.
Are you thinking about starting your own party?
I have not thought about it because I do not have time to review the past, every potential member of the party, and not even have the money for it.
I do not even have money for the presidential campaign; transparent on my account are only 20 000 CZK.
They have no money?
They speak of asset declarations, what would your from?
I guess my personal assets to approximately CZK 60 million.
In Prague, I have a plot of land, with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth about 10 million, and an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb is worth about a million. And then I've got a few million in the account.
The Aston Martin was the way a child's dream - James Bond has always been, as he drove in the car I liked was gallant to women and simultaneously fought against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say that you want to change the republic, but your own money, you do not want to invest in it.
This is not exactly convincing.
I do not have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I do about debt?
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my program probably will not wake too much interest.
And I am not obliged to defray the campaign from its own resources.
The cost of the campaign are basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But the senator salary alone I could not live, so I might as my son does not finance the English school, which costs 30,000 per month.
If I wanted to make money, I would stand for nothing.
So stay more active as an entrepreneur to have your livelihood?
Did not you say that you will return these activities?
But that is not related to the amount of salary.
As promised, I have cut back my activities partially.
Thus, for example my deputy managing director of the travel agencies in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the republic.
But I have to live on something but.
Monthly income to which they were accustomed as a business owner?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that's still like that.
As president, I would, however, set my things completely.
For the complete interview in the Saturday edition of Pravo.
Prove the MVRDV architects that the true adventures are not just in your head - the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built mountain books - 2 photos
"I find that funny building, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to look at," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the road.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician at a nearby large company, said: "Yes, it's beautiful, the house."
But I wonder why we even need a library today.
All have Internet, iPad, and E-Books.
No man still goes voluntarily into one of those old-style libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a little sightseeing needy bedroom community on the outskirts of Rotterdam, is strange record holder.
The 80,000 - resident community has the lowest rate of formation of the whole of the Netherlands.
To counteract this stupid situation, it was decided some years ago to contribute to general education and to recreate the seven fictional bridges that are displayed on the euro notes as pretty daub reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the education campaign was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to become Lord of Statistics : A library needed here!
Winy Maas of Rotterdam architecture firm MVRDV, master of daring producer of bar charts and witty, and often cynical buildings, took the matter with his usual composure and appeared to competition Hearing anno 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the jury is still puzzled looked around and shrugged, stacked the cheeky Maas its exquisite souvenirs of the size of a pyramid and ended his actionistically underpinned speech with the words, "Love borough"
This is it, my suggestion for the mountain of books from Spijkenisse, the so-called Bökenberg!
Nine years later, the 30- million-euro mountain is filled up.
He is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and townhouses with a total of 50 apartments belong.
In early November the mountain of books with the second award was "Best Library of NL 2012" award.
In addition, the project for the Dutch National Wood Award nomination in 2012.
Thus the faceless town retort which had not so far as to offer a post-modern pedestrian zone and a stunned ugly town hall, behind the white facades one might be inclined to suspect a dairy factory, a rich piece of contemporary architecture.
Above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The long way to book
The first impression : Books Eldorado under bell jar.
While there is an elevator that leads through the mountain range in the middle, but the real space and reading pleasures are largely self fußläufigen climbing the topography.
The fully glazed interior is bright and clear, the fired brick floor and the elegant street lanterns speak the language of an unmistakably urban public space.
The urban setting is perfect.
It already is looking park bench, dog and football gambling guys and gals.
And all books, books, books.
"Normally, the bookshelves are along the facade, and in the center is a large, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have provided the classical configuration space to the head and slipped the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain is cleverly used books : In the center are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center, and engineering office.
A special delight are the black bookcases, wall covering, the times, times parapet times are banisters.
Look, feel and smell are foreign.
Even inveterate architects and civil engineers shake unknown whether the building material the head.
"We wanted this to work with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the city council Spijkenisse, on request of the standard.
And so we have come in a friesländischen farm one day to an appropriate waste products from agriculture.
For many years we used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields on a millimeter -thin synthetic fleece pad as root.
This is cheap and time efficient.
The thin fabric keeps one or two seasons, after which it is ready for the rubbish.
For the library, the web was - for the first time in these quantities - Pressed to four inches thick plates.
Under heat and pressure the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) discolored to a dark, homogeneous, stress-resistant material which is a smell mingled with a bit of new cars and bissl by sports shoe.
After 105 steps you have reached the summit.
At the end of almost 500 meters long wanderings you will be rewarded not only in the literary café with fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees.
They provide atmosphere, but above all for the right humidity in the literature Mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You would not believe it, yes, but this house is in spite of the many glass surfaces, a flagship project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
Is heated and cooled with geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is under a glass dome, the sun shines even on sunny days only briefly inside.
The wide wooden laminated beams that are perpendicular to the glass facade, serve as shade and catch a large part of the sunlight.
The climate is very pleasant.
The rest is fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics of the IT industry, already took the road to the new library.
Lisette Verhaig also was there.
And the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde that the Bökenberg even as Spijkenisses "long overdue soul" means.
The reason : the opening few weeks ago, everyone was invited residents to donate a book from his personal portfolio.
Thus, for the time being to even the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library - filled - currently 70,000.
The concept worked.
The shelves are filled to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation to every resident now has a certain relationship to this new house.
Everyone knows that the book is part of this building.
And if it's just for decoration.
MVRDV is so successful that pinnacle, called Identity Foundation in technical jargon.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
So young and uneducated they may be.
Finally this is a starting point for identity.
Szabo, " German must play bigger role '
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine to the vote.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US- European relations, Berlin poised so on a narrow diplomatic level.
German wave : Earlier in the week had initially indicated that it would vote against the request for observer status for the Palestinians at the United Nations, Germany.
But then Berlin contained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo : Germany supports what the Israelis did in Gaza, no.
Germany now has to be careful because of its special relationship with Israel, however.
But at the same time I believe that it also does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence - but without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany has also abstained when it came to establish a no-fly zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Germany Is it difficult to take a clear position on major international issues?
Yes, that's right.
The reason is that it is precisely his foreign policy surrounded and moving away from a policy that was as it were managed by the United States towards a German foreign policy.
To make matters worse, the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
The Germans are so contradictory between the fronts.
They are expected to play an independent role, but because they are not accustomed.
I think she even comes close to their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy as France and the UK have.
What does a "normal" foreign policy as concrete from the German perspective?
It shows a willingness to relate to national interests and positions that are independent of those of the U.S. or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy, ie exports and its relations with particular regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to some degree different from that of the other great powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
These economic interests have had an impact on the attitude of the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has major markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be careful not to offend the public, but also the elites in Arab countries over the head.
Which plays a role in any case.
But I would want to attach to not put too much weight, that is not completely one-sided relationship.
But it plays an important role in German considerations in any case.
Germany has its relations with the United States damaged by abstained from voting on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe in Europe and even in the U.S. there is great sympathy for the German position.
So I do not think this was such a dramatic break, as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany is so even play some respect.
But because it signaled that it be taken seriously as an international player and his interests must be considered.
In Europe there are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative.
The U.S., however, have expressed clear support for a veto.
There are disagreements between the United States and many European nations?
Because of U.S. domestic politics these differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration has secretly probably pretty much understanding of the European position.
But due to the political situation here, the government can not represent that position publicly of course.
I believe that the actual differences are not as great as they always appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so absolutely thrilled by Netanyahu's policies.
Finding it difficult to Germany, his close relations with Israel and the U.S. on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other side to agree?
I think that's what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would of course be a bit easier for the Germans, if there was a consistent and coherent European policy, which is currently not the case.
So they can not be part of a broader line and must instead promote things from their own position.
They do precisely with the euro.
I think in the future Germany will play a leading role to push Europe into a European position.
This is of course not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I think that the Germans realized that they need to play a more independent role.
Germany looks to himself in the role as a major international player - Germany wants ever to play a major role?
Or falls Germany the lead still struggling?
Germany is still not used to it, that's still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it drops the country still struggling to play a greater role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis because every time when Germany takes on a greater role, a variety of anti - German feelings freely.
That makes it not just the Germans.
This is actually the old problem : you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Seen in Germany in a much more difficult position than the U.S..
It must be receptive to different opinions and neighbors, and that's not easy.
Now, the influence of the U.S. in European politics continuously, the EU does not fill this vacuum at the moment but who remains otherwise?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if you do not like them, it's uncomfortable and it makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Trademark" in China : When Puma and Armani are suddenly chinese
Armani is a world famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
But what's Armani polo?
Underlying this is an officially registered in China label that has nothing to do with the original company.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection as long as not sue the actual namesake.
And even then it is not clear whether they get right.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at Taylor Wessing LLP, specializing in intellectual property rights violations in the Far East.
Each week a new case lands on my desk.
Imitators already rich a few extra letters so that they can register their brands.
Thus, from simple Lu Gucci Gucci, Prada instead allowed to enter Prada Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, about the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with entries of the Trademark Office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010 was there to protect the trademark Zegna DF Puma, a name of art, who served also at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna, a Chinese company.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and intellectual property in the injured is well known.
In the big cities there are multi-storey department stores, almost exclusively sell the fakes.
Patt hole but cases are different: On behalf of his clients before he goes, however, that Chinese companies officially receive the Trademark Office the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai," a passenger mark.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
Thus, women are meant to be rich men fishing.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any wrongdoing
"This is bad for business, you have to fight it," urged Pattloch.
"The brand is diluted, the unique position disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and legal costs in the sectors concerned in the millions, especially when expensive flagship products.
According to the market research firm CLSA China with a volume of 15 billion euros in the third largest market for luxury products and the fastest growing.
However, deletions of dubious entries on the register are difficult to reach and go into the money.
Up to nine years, the process can drag on, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports of cases in which the court dismissed lawsuits because of the long duration of the offending name is the "market reality" has become.
If the plaintiff had bad luck, he would pay even money the plagiarist because he violated its brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes here, the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also relate to graphic elements.
2009 Daimler lost a legal battle with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, that company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese must therefore use today an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue and white logo that was reminiscent of BMW, the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion house Lacoste lost against counterfeiters in China, Hong Kong and Singapore, which made the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any wrongdoing.
The Trademark Office CTMO in Beijing is true that there have been there in 2010 due to insufficient personnel and equipment shortages room.
Last year it was but "emergency situation returned to normalcy in the workflow" of the.
Thus, the backlog of pending opposition has dropped by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 of these cases has been closed, 75 percent more than last year.
Nevertheless, still waiting in the office 81,500 objections to completion.
To fight it costs a lot
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, more than 1.4 million applications were received during a CTMO on brand protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
That was a record, and means that China cited by the tenth time in a row the list of registrations around the world, the authority shall.
This applies also to the existence of valid trademark, a total of 5.5 million units.
2011 were taken in fees 1.8 billion yuan.
Simplified, this means that any application in cutting costs 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
To fight it costs much like the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group struggles against a Chinese counterfeiter.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts was excavated.
But the imitators still secured the Chinese rights to the trademark Freudenberg.
They even failed this because family name could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, the CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO Trademark Office rejected the opposition because of the Munich back also.
In the next two instances Freudenberg was indeed right, but the process opponent fights to this day.
One must be extremely careful
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and praised the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The process is extremely time-consuming and cost us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be quantified, the company's archives had to look through even one hundred years old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposite side in vain to a "high six-figure euro amount" for settlement.
"This shows us how much this is worth," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East threaten even zurückzuschwappen to Europe.
Namely, when there impersonators secure unprotected brands.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather login.
This business segment, the Group has long given up, but he managed to avoid the registry.
"You have to be extremely careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark laws, rather the foreigners should "everything is somehow worth protecting, sign in China" as Wentzler says.
Else can be much more expensive than the registry.
In fact : If Freudenberg is subject in the last act of his trademark drama, then one would have the other side pay royalties on their own behalf, stated Wentzler.
Or we are pushed in the relevant segment of the market.
World AIDS Day : stomping, sing, help
In Heidelberg, the choir rehearses Imbongi - and to AIDS orphans in Swaziland pleased.
The story of a compound that overcomes more than 8733 km.
First there is the pitching : Cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies pumps and Mr Slipper search on the parquet floor of the clock to find him quickly.
One-two- three - four.
Then only the singers' voices swell slowly - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - harry, beguile and traced.
Fiete and Hopf, the 29 -year-old conductor, it raises almost out of his cloth shoes when he brings them together with its supple wild gestures.
It's Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology, Heidelberg Imbongi the choir is rehearsing a new song.
About fifty singers have come, 23-69 years old, by the human geneticist to home.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, any voice choir has a different text, and this even in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by the eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland and parts of will.
Helping people help themselves
Worldwide there are about 34 million people infected with HIV, the UNAIDS estimates, the United Nations AIDS program Bekämfung.
23.5 million people live in the south of Africa.
245000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland live.
More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village Esitjeni the club sponsors Voices for Africa has been found in Germany.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child.
It guarantees the child school fees, school uniform and a hot meal every day from the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in Zulu storytellers or worshiper.
The Bantu language but nobody can speak fluently sing in this room.
For almost ten years, the choir performs songs in this strange soft language and bring them back now and also to where they originally came from : Africa in the south.
For 8733 km distance from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village Esitjeni, which depends on the vocal power of German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live there, some even in simple mud and straw huts, most of whom are children.
More than 300 of them have lost their parents because they are the HIV virus succumbed.
In Esitjeni shows on a small scale, what suffers quite Swaziland : highest HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the male foreskin, which decrease the risk of infection proven by half, are not well accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland to carry immunodeficiency virus in them, to die with thirty middle is not uncommon.
At a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but especially the Imbongis saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but simply of everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a college degree you have certainly no chance in a poor country.
First it was the private involvement of individuals, for a few euros a year to send a child to school and allow him a hot meal a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the "Voices for Africa" , which has since almost professionally take care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the bacterial STI include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea (gonorrhea).
Common viral STI, HIV, Human Pappilomaviren, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Pubic lice and scabies are among the parasitic STI.
Who are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five of all reported syphilis cases in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In the heterosexual adult chlamydial infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and Human Pappilomaviren are frequently occurring sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country comparatively small - yet: Around 20 percent of new HIV infections attributable to this group.
Chlamydial infections occur among young people much more frequently than in other population groups.
According to European surveys cover three -quarters of all infections young people between 15 and 25 years.
In this country also Humane Pappilomaviren come in adolescents frequently.
As the number of infections has developed?
Not all STDs are reportable.
The number of syphilis infections has more than doubled, according to the Robert Koch Institute from 1697 in 2001 to 3698 diseases diseases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
2011, there were 2,700 cases.
That's about a tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms indicate an STD?
The infectious disease can cause ulcers in the genital area discomfort during urination, vaginal discharge, lower abdominal pain and sores or warts.
However, often they do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore go unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide full protection.
For some pathogens can be passed on sexually transmitted diseases and infections through grease and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular check-ups, especially with frequently changing sexual partners.
Diagnosed early, most STI cured and long-term consequences can be avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations, and last but not least the fees that the choir ersingt all over Germany, the results are impressive.
"Overall, we have around 200 000 euros sent to Esitjeni" says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village itself manages Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and assertive woman who funds from Germany.
It also takes care to ensure that the orphans well come about in one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as they call the old women in Zulu, the supports of the village are.
Some of them have received up to 14 orphans with them, give them a roof over their head and ensure that children arrive on time every day in their uniforms to school.
Who has no one, comes into the shelter to Khanyisile, a single woman who is just paid by the club as the two chefs who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children.
Also has "Voices for Africa" called into life a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized jointly with the American health organization PSI, that many in the village have an HIV test can be given.
This is not a matter of course, because so obviously the disease in the country is, they prefer dead silent
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is a taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Really strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III., Is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamie statt Demokratie.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned form of life that the HIV virus has spread so rapidly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus across the country.
Although there were free condoms at every turn, says Annette Lennartz, "but which are rarely used.
The culture is different -. Flesh to flesh "
To promote cultural exchange something that travels the Imbongi choir every two or three years jointly by the Southern Africa and sings songs full of melancholy, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-awareness, yet know that many on the southern tip of the Dark Continent from the days of apartheid.
A bus full of white man sing the songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings humor and joy, but has also been some fierce border guards wrested a few tears.
The journey always after Esitjeni where the singers visit their sponsored children.
Even if you hardly find maps to the small village in the valley of the River Ezulweni there is more to be known.
"Go Esitjeni, there is the light," say the people there.
And when you return the 8733 km distance to Heidelberg, to the pounding singers in the rehearsal room at the mountain Straße then you see it shine there, too.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice should possibly be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although he is closest to the sun, there are also frozen water, as is apparent from three published Thursday in the journal "Science" studies.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is a sheet of ice in the permanently shadowed region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters, and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that are stamped on the Mercury.
No one brings the discovery of ice but with the existence of life on the planet in relation, said the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
But the findings could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life have fallen into other areas of the solar system.
Unbeknownst to the Earthlings are probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix about to explore the depths of space.
From time to time they send images back to Earth : Small peepholes into the final frontier.
The image comes from a camera that German researchers have developed at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, orbiting the sun beyond Neptune, Ceres is after the new term defined by the International Astronomical Union from 2006, no "planet".
This image of cut- infrared image from the Spitzer Space Telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars : the oldest stars can be seen as blue dots, are more difficult to identify the pink "newborn" in the Zodiac Room.
This star- forming region - known by scientists unromantic W5 - has the Spitzer discovered in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This dazzling glow of a dying star has received the NASA Spitzer Telescope.

One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble Space Telescope : The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the colors are recordings of spiral galaxies to true works of art.
The list published by the European Southern Observatory image shows the several thousand light -years away Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name comes from the Latin word Trifid trifidus (three-piece, three split), as dark dust lanes three share the glowing heart of the birthplace - stars.
In the constellation Ophiuchus, astronomers have photographed the harbingers of a cosmic carom : 400 million light-years away from Earth rush the cores of two merging galaxies to collide with each other and are inevitable.
This star- birth recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope on the spiral galaxy M83.
Who are not technical abbreviations, they may call her by her nickname Southern Pinwheel.
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a portion of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The 1400 light- years distant nebula consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times less than ordinary house dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images of different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light- years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273, took on the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
The larger spiral galaxy UGC scientists call 1810.
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The star cradle always produces new youngster.
These stars - Cloud, connected with the Rosette Nebula, constantly bringing new baby star - 5000 light years from Earth.
In this light bright galaxy with a small black hole still exists no dust, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that he is only created shortly after the Big Bang, as was mostly to find hydrogen in the universe.
Our insights into space : The most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lippershey - even before Galileo Galilei began observing the star a year later.
Since then, the mirror of the optical telescopes were getting bigger - and the insights they provide, getting deeper.
30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope was the Palomar Observatory near San Diego, the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, pictured here, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, steht das Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows views into the same space over two levels, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in the Canary island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone is 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of approximately eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the optimized design : The telescope is lashed in his elevation angle - and therefore limited in its mobility.
Even the hobby - Eberly Telescope in Texas is fixed in elevation.
Its special feature : the high light-gathering power.
This is sufficient if - despite comparatively low diameter mirror - the mirror of the world's largest telescopes zoom.
With the help of a radio telescope at Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers hear from the All for extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) every computer owner can help by providing computing power available.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which makes its name.
With a total of four mirrors, the telescope can illuminate even the mid-infrared spectrum.
Also on the Chilean Observatory ESO European Extremely Large Telescope is planned.
Its main mirror will include a whopping 42 feet - and are made up of nearly 1,000 mirror elements together.
With pictures but is expected no earlier than 2018.
By 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors with an average of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which still looks with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF in the sky next to them.
Also on Mauna Kea to be built, a huge new telescope - with a mirror - average of thirty meters.
Here it can be admired on an illustration.
However, the main impressions from space provides the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, it already provides images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler searches for extrasolar planets - especially for those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011 it was announced by NASA that 1235 planet candidates have been identified since the mission begins.
The picture shows the final launch preparations at the Kepler space telescope are documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the earliest in 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 - shot rocket into space.
The primary mirror of the infrared space telescope having a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope : it should look from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang to light.
Scientists assume that also exists at the south pole of Mercury Ice.
But there are actually no reliable data because the Messenger orbiting far closer to the north pole of the planet.
Radar measurements have for decades hinted at the fact that there is ice on Mercury.
By the Messenger probe, launched in 2004 - the first in orbit around Mercury - the scientists now have certainty.
Daily drink butter - and 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical old age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search in the country in the 97- year-olds are still relatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical old age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search in the country in the 97- year-olds are still relatively young.
The drive through the Talysh Mountains is to call wild and romantic.
The van rumbles through the winding road, past densely forested hills, rushing rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and lush, you'd think one would be in the Black Forest.
But this here is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talysh, from not much is known except that she speaks perfect Farsi and Azeri and is very durable.
Endstation ist Lerik.
The small town shows off too bulky geratener architecture from the Soviet era, which does not quite seem to fit in the picturesque countryside.
Tourists from Europe are hardly here, too burdensome is the journey of Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For 323 km it takes eight hours because the road is only one lane.
The fabulous wealth that the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea, has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the makings of a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May with the Euro Vision Song Festival - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here the Vita by about eight dozen Talysh from the area has been documented that more than 100 Fatulayeva shows a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years, yet fathered a child
However, controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov that should have become 168 years old.
A birth certificate does not exist, however.
And, given the oldest documented man who was 122 years old, but appears Müslümovs age extremely doubtful.
"In 1805 he was born here in the region, in 1973, he died," said Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children at the age of 136 years, he should have fathered a daughter.
Şirali Müslümov has therefore charged his age a few decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, age researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, one of the oldest old in Central Asia.
"A remarkable number of advanced old age people is also available in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also live in Sardinia extremely large number of very old men."
However, due to lack of documents was no scientific proof of age to perform, especially civil registers were missing.
Every day as cup melted butter
But the fact is that the people of the region remarkably often reach a ripe old age around Lerik.
Currently, there are 20 people who are older than 100 years.
Why live in the south so many very old people?
The Azeri guide Mugimzadeh Farid explained that with the particular genes of the Talysh.
Museum Director Fatulayeva in contrast, believes that it is up to the diet.
But that of all the high-calorie diet of Talysh is to be as healthy, meat, bread and dairy products, especially love and of which many drink daily a glass of melted butter, appears from a nutritional point of view not just plausible.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With her 97 years she is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, living in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the whole Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter churn, which she tirelessly and unrolling.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are long grandparents.
Also two small children jumping around.
In the kitchen you prepare the guests tea, which is served in the typical belly Armadu - shaped glasses.
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfectly lined up, she hides under her headscarf long, dark blond braids that reveals her son proudly in front of us.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out of me and kept their color.
"I have never used shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly income enough to live
She has always eaten what came from their own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I have not bought a single time in the supermarket food.
Then she talks about her husband, who was in the army.
It was worst in the period after the Second World War.
But everything was better than the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, which is driven by the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country as a dictator, knows no boundaries in Azerbaijan.
By 2003 he was in power, and later his son Ilham the helm.
After all, there is no need to Azerbaijan elderly.
230 manats (about the same amount in euros), Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension, an amount for local conditions, from which one can live well.
And maybe Mirzayevas has long since grizzled son right: "The old enjoy respect in our culture."
You live in the midst of the extended family, to be loved, cared for and happy.
To stay if that is no reason as long as possible in the life
The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep divisions in the country.
The future constitution with Sharia as the basis is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare pathos.
We need to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds is my responsibility before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was directed at all the people, but especially well to the Christian Copts, Liberals, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
For they all, yet hopelessly divided opposition in a confused, scared.
Fear of a theocracy on the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He had said Mohammed Mursi said, almost apologetically, the powers of the Constitutional Court temporarily curtailed and extended its expertise, "to save the revolution."
But what the 61 -year-old engineer, who has a doctoral degree from the American University of Southern California, really want to save it to the Egyptians, is the world is not quite clear.
Should the judiciary be overthrown?
In fact, the 234 articles that were pushed through because of the Islamist- dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly in a night, 15-hour tour de force, some are worrying.
As in previous constitutions also says the design, the case-law founded on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what does "principles"?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that Islamists will use the vague wording and the associated legal scope for a strict interpretation of Sharia law.
This raises at least a newly owned items close : in all matters relating to the Sharia should be considered the Al Azhar University for advice, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great charisma in the entire Sunni Islam.
That does not, but it may mean that the clergy oversees the legislation, which would have the de facto disenfranchisement of the judiciary to follow.
Much of the Verfassunsgsentwurf is a matter of interpretation
Also problematic : The civil military justice should remain sustained.
These dishes served during Mubarak's rule to suppress opposition.
After the fall of the dictator sat up to 11,000 civilians in military custody.
The state should also, as it stands in the draft, "the true essence of the Egyptian family" protect "and its morality and its values ."
This is put in legal terms so blurred that state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature with the help of this article.
In plain English, this means nothing more than censorship.
No item by the way writes explicitly the equality of men and women.
This forbids another to insult the Prophet Muhammad and His messengers or slander.
What is an insult and how they should be punished, remains unclear.
Likewise seems dubious to the formulation that "insulting people" is forbidden.
Enough there already a caricature of the President or a joke at the expense of lawyers?
Matter of interpretation, like so much will be "very soon" presented in the draft, which is available for signature Mursi and in his words, the Egyptians referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition is forming for weeks against the superior power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual harmony on Friday night at Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to bring the Charter to the case before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has come back and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third place in the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei said that the draft Constitution belongs "to the rubbish heap of history."
Via short message service Twitter he accused the followers Mursi's trying to lead a "coup against democracy".
"If he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and topple him," said the opposition Yasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned for," the media quoted the Egyptian opposition politician Khaled Ali.
And several judges announced that the referendum does not want to watch, so it would be invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood blew themselves to counter-demonstration, as a precaution but not in Tahrir Square but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafists took part and shouted: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded Mursi : "Clear the land!" and protested : "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir square, where it all began, would have probably conjured up of a civil war.
The Mursi's followers did not want to risk obviously.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the proponents have expressed loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot box, in which direction the country should go.
A majority of the design of the Islamists is considered safe.
"The word is not even before human rights"
Hafez Abu Saeda is going mad about this more aggressive constitutional process, which actually would have until February and all social forces are integrated.
The 48 -year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, as they sat under Mubarak in prison or on trial.
Because he would not share their beliefs, but because human rights are indivisible for him.
But he was beaten, sentenced, imprisoned.
"And now the word is not even human rights in the new constitution," he complained in an interview with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".
Mursi power extension to all three powers of the state could give up the lawyer.
These measures are flagrant violations of the rules of democracy and Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President put them de facto suspended", complains Saeda.
But without civil society organizations can not function a democracy.
Saeda feels left alone, even by the international community, which considers the direction of ideological struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement.
This could take revenge.
One protester in Tahrir warns : "You gives birth to a monster you can not control."
Rakfisk from Norway : Is this the übelriechendste fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards - and not just in Europe but around the world.
Could the secret to the success of the country have something to do with the local appetite for pretty smelly fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheese.
They Placing beneath a pile of dirty, damp sportswear.
And just leave it there for a week.
How about you have to imagine the smell of nasenbetäubenden Rakfisk, one of the great delicacies of Norway.
I am located in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular scenery - and this persistent smell in the air that just will not go away.
Rakfisk is sprinkled with salt trout, which - depending on how smelly you would like to have his fish - is fermented for up to a year in water.
When in Norway darkness comes over the land and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes, dedicated to this, well, really very impressive specialty.
"You eat it raw and then washed it down with a glass of aquavit," says Harvard Halvarsen who actually works at the local fire station, but as a "Rakfisk - General", the festival also hosted.
All around us people eat small fish cubes and to take large amounts of alcohol.
"People like the cufflinks aquavit over the Rakfisk" says Havard.
The spirit may displace the smell.
I taste some appetizers.
If you avoid going to bring the nose Rakfisk in close, he is not bad - such as sushi, which has a fairly long bus ride behind.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era when there were no cooling facilities and fish was soaked in salt water fall in air-tight barrels.
In the dead of winter, he was then taken out after a long fermentation and - undoubtedly under damped by using alcohol senses - consumed.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians saw in search of work forced to leave their land and migrated mainly to the USA.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, lured by the burgeoning labor market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even in Sweden, the old rival, who was far richer Not too long ago as Norway, immigrants flock.
Rakfisk is seen as something important - as an essential, albeit strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.
He is one of the more expensive dishes that you can buy here.
But actually everything is so expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich proud costs 10 euros.
Norway can not make it often in the world press, and most people do not seem to mind that.
Here you can still hates to call Anders Breivik by name - those racist right-wing extremists, the 77 men, women and children shot and killed last year.
Instead, it refers only to the "incident of 22 July".
Norwegians seem to be able to accept that someone is capable in its peace-loving country to such brutal murders.
The main reason for today's wealth of Norway since the early 1970s, the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, the round trays spread with seasoned Rakfisk and with her long blonde hair and piercing blue eyes embodies the Nordic ideal.
We are a - how to say - prudent people.
Your English is just like that of most people here immaculate.
We are not very pretentious, we do not like bravado.
Norway is handled very carefully with its oil wealth - a large part of the industry income is invested for the benefit of future generations into a special fund.
Than in all the years up to the Great Depression threw money around that they do not possess, Norway kept his wallet firmly closed.
"As long as we go skiing in the winter and can go hiking in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And of course eat Rakfisk" she adds with a carefree laugh.
I stand in the snow and put myself for another dish - from Rakfisk I 've had enough.
So a moose burger is definitely something else. The juicy meat tastes good to me.
But the evening is once again the stinky fish on the menu.
The hotel in which I enjoy to, is one of several venues that organize Rakfisk a dinner at which guests for the best - fish can agree - or perhaps the sense of smell the most challenging.
There is a live TV service to an emcee dressed in bow tie, surrounded by plates of Rakfisk.
The show is similar to the Euro Vision Song Contest.
"What score you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor -Juergen?"
"Here are our points Havard".
Clapping and laughing.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by aquavit.
But maybe it's the severe haze of whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
While Mexico's future president Enrique Pena Nieto prepared for his office, Will Grant analyzed by the BBC which he challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently the traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even in better times, this is always a congested city, but a ring of steel was erected on Monday, several blocks off the major transport routes into the capital and provides for chaos on the streets.
The goal, however, it was not to interfere with commuters on their way to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the President binding and take over the leadership of the nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government Felipe Calderon, Mexico has been able to prove good economically, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has claimed in the past six years already 60,000 lives.
"My government is committed to strong to reduce the violence," Pena Nieto said earlier this week in the Oval Office of the U.S. President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy that we can achieve this goal.
Before he went on par with the U.S. President, Pena Nieto has worked as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated large part of the country surrounding the capital, the opinions about the new head of state are divided.
A direct man
In the remote town of Valle del Bravo is remembered for example like him.
Residents of the resort ascribe the development of tourism and infrastructure development.
To reach the city, you can ride on one of the highways that Pena Nieto had built and which constitute a great improvement over the brittle, bumpy roads that were once here.
Plaques with his name hanging outside a modern sports center and a spectacular interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect it to real and lasting change," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the party Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In particular, as for the safety and economy, we look forward to an interesting and real change that our country needs so badly.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that the party after 12 years, great expectations to Enrique Pena Nieto outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos.
The allegations of the opposition, the new president lacked substance, he refuses.
He was a very direct man, very committed and have big plans for the country.
He was a great statesman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the State shall not many people that view their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobblestone streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is tucked under highway overpasses and is a suburb of Mexico City itself in many ways dar.
And the problems in the community are critical of urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military has turned to combat the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
The bodies of dozens of murdered women were left alone in the last two years on a patch of wasteland near a large landfill.
During the tenure of Governor Pena Nieto than 1,000 women have been murdered in the State of Mexico - a statistic that even surpasses the town of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the killing of innocent women.
Critics Pena Nieto are of the opinion that it is at least not adequately addressed the issue of femicide during his tenure.
But in the worst case his government had closed their eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the run-down neighborhood, Irinea Buendia fights back tears as she shows me photos of their deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
The official version of events, according to Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived home with her, it seemed as if her body was washed," said Senora Buendia recalls.
There were signs that she was beaten, and rigor mortis had already set.
While her mother tells her story, viewed from the wall is a picture of Mariana down on us. It is mounted beside a cross, bearing a single word : justice.
But exactly this, the family that they had denied her until now.
The authorities have treated me like I was a chatterbox, troublemaker, nag.
You want that you simply accept their judgment and keeps the mouth.
"But that is not possible when there were so many errors and omissions in the form," she says.
If President Pena Nieto on Saturday binding receives the President, he does so also a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families were grown in the last six years of violent crimes affected, and the new president has promised, particularly to take care of this problem during his tenure.
"I hope that as President he is as he was as governor," the PRI congressman says Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But just before that, the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
The prosecution alleges Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment
The prosecution contradicts Bradley Manning's allegations that he had been mistreated in prison
The hearing focuses on Manning's time in military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense seeks to dismiss the indictment due to hard prison conditions to
The corporal of the U.S. Army is alleged to have stolen thousands of confidential documents
The prosecution has tried on Friday to determine that the Army Corporal Bradley Manning - accused of the biggest revelation of confidential information of U.S. history - several occasions failed to complain about the alleged ill-treatment he had suffered in military detention.
In cross-examination Manning during a pretrial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland said Maj. Ashden Fein, that documents relating to weekly visits, the prison officials had made during Manning's nine -month prison term in Quantico, Virginia, had no complaints about his treatment.
A day before the cross-examination, which was held following a request of the defense to dismiss the indictment - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the hard prison time - Manning had testified that he had considered suicide in prison.
The intelligence analyst for the U.S. Army, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was released by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never been confirmed as the source of the information Manning.
At the hearing on Friday went fine with Manning through the forms that were filled out by their officials meeting with Manning during his detention in Quantico military prison where he had been eating from July 2010 to April 2011 under intensified conditions of detention.
The officers found Manning and wrote his answers to questions.
As fine asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had the overall treatment judged by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the establishment as "very professional".
The forms so fine, contained no complaints about ill-treatment, although the officials were asked about the Manning 's treatment.
Manning replied that he had brought his concerns verbally expressed and the officials had discussed this with him and given to deal with this. You were not logged.
"They wrote (after meeting the concerns)" No Problems "on, and that does not necessarily mean that I did not say anything," said Manning.
The judge, Col. Denise Lind, Manning asked why he did not complain about his treatment when he arrived in January 2011 with a committee to investigate the few months before he referred to a form suicidal thoughts.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting have been to let demote his observation status to the "prevention of injury".
The military said out there have this restrictive status to him - which is one step below the suicidal - assigned to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince team members that I was fine, and the observation status of injury prevention get rid of (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life, in my view," Manning said.
Manning said Thursday in his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before he was transferred in July 2010 in the prison of the Quantico Marine Base in Virginia.
He said in Kuwait he had considered suicide and had once fainted because of the heat.
Not allowed to know what was happening with him or in the outside world, was distressing.
"My world shrank to Camp Arafjon on this cage together," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I would die in this cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
They had allowed him only a mattress, a blanket, flip- flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he had tried to keep moving, because the day it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down.
He always had to sleep with the light that penetrated into his cell from the outside.
If he had turned around at night and guards could no longer see his face, you have woken him so he turns back again.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally raised objections to the treatment of Manning.
In April 2011, Manning was moved to the Kansas military prison in Fort Leavenworth.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned about an allegation that he had raised in his statement on Thursday - so he had a night to sleep naked in his cell at Quantico and have to be naked in front of guards and other prisoners in a morning count.
Manning testified that he had during this count never had the opportunity to envelop with his blanket.
In the survey on Friday Manning stated that he had closed his command of a guard that he should leave the blanket with which he would be able to cover fall. He admitted, however, that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he was forced into the previous night to sleep naked. He had previously tried to show an officer that he does not constitute a danger to themselves.
Manning had told the officers that he could have used the waistband of his underwear or his flip- flops to hurt yourself, this is not done.
That night, as Manning testified were his pants, flip- flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will consider his prison experiences and at least drastically reduce its Haftmaß, he should be sentenced at his trial before the military court. This is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will plead guilty to minor offenses, while other charges that are considered too extreme to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend. By the prosecution to justify the detention conditions is expected.
The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning was detained in accordance with the provisions that apply to all under the highest security prisoners held in custody at Quantico.
The charges against Manning include abetting the enemy, unlawful disclosure of intelligence information on the Internet, transmitting national defense information, and theft of public property or documents.
If it is found guilty on all charges, he faces a life sentence.
My Mexican- American identity crisis.
Many people were forced by the lack of opportunities to leave Mexico
Mexicans tend to blame the immigrants - they call them hard times to mind, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at passport control, when perplexity wide made in me.
Signs refer to two queues : one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexican"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure of what I should put myself.
I grew up in Central California, and was long known as "Mexican" my whole life.
An ethnic symbol - just as my friends in Boston to call themselves "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italian".
Later I decided to "Mexican - American".
But this was Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfather, there was no need for shortcuts or hyphens.
I was just Americans.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough to assert myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and my American accent I can not help also.
So I took my American passport and stood in the queue for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment this week, as the future president of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda all those topics that one would expect if the heads of the two countries meet : immigration, drugs and trafficking.
Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason that Mexicans remain today with just as likely in Mexico, instead of emigrating to the United States.
He wants to ally with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc modeled on the European Union.
Pena Nieto and vowed to continue the war against Mexico's drug cartels, even if he called no related details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought in mind that the United States invaded in 1848 in Mexico, and the country's leadership to under gunpoint forced to leave them for more than half of its territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries, not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
Thus, once a U.S. government official also exerts only mild criticism of Mexico, one hears - in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - complaints about how the Americans beset the sovereignty of its neighboring country.
And the children of Montezuma's go on the warpath.
Yet the biggest challenge in Mexico is truth in the relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People, for the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that a person at a point in our family tree - perhaps a parent or grandparent - no chance in Mexico, was offered and emigrated to the north.
And in most cases, this corresponded to a person profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our allegiance is to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now live the American dream, good schools attended and get good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live in - not the Mexican.
Our identity is sometimes possibly blurred, but what our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that we do not like many members of the Mexican ruling class.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial to a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
When our family would not have failed in Mexico, they would not have gone.
And then we would not see us trapped behind the silk curtain - lost with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - evil and Mexican Americans take them this.
While she is U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling of belonging to neither one nor the other country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte but also Bruce Springsteen.
You can enjoy the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
How should I learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated : some Mexican leaders and parts of the educated middle class to record their links with the diaspora again.
You want to use Mexican Americans as a temporary "ambassador" for Mexico, which represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues about how great a visit to this country and put pressure on the political leadership to strengthen their ties to Mexico.
Well.
That will not happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the inequitable distribution of income, the rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure if it really is a great country.
I 'm afraid you have just by, Amigos.
That is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico and a half centuries ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans hold a grudge for that cherish as their family members were treated until not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we are "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected cornerstone for peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to stifle such hopes.
Amidst the usual recriminations countless buildings were reduced to rubble and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis killed - and for the first time are rockets from Gaza near the Israeli city of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem taken.
However, although the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be caught in their historical conflict, the Middle East changed around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation and whether they like it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally come to an end.
A war that is neither lost nor gained
At first glance, seems optimistic given the current situation is anything but appropriate.
Even when the 21 November continues cease-fire, which this week's battles have strengthened the tough guys on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will say that they have pushed back the Israelis, even though his group had recorded huge losses.
Although several Hamas leaders killed and 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza are crammed into one of the most densely populated desolatesten and corners of the planet, it is Israel up to now failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas wins added in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leader could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
So how Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to attract rich and powerful friends on their side.
Turkey, a reviving, regional power that was once known as Israel 's closest Muslim ally, has sided with Hamas - like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf States.
Cheering Hamas supporters believe that to Israel is an Islamic Crescent - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has power over Syria, where rebels an increasingly Islamist tischeren character could stand before the overthrow Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Mursi - by far the most populous and important Arab country - on the southern edge of Israel has changed the balance of the region sustainable.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot of Egypt until his overthrow in 2011 ruled for 30 years, very little time was left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood is related by Hamas and its leaders more dependent on people views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove as a player who can not be pushed out even from Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, however, can draw an opposite conclusion.
Militarily speaking, Hamas is no more danger.
The Israeli missile defense system "Iron Dome" has to prove themselves, and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
At least for a while Israel will be able to sleep soundly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States steadfastly hold to their position. Many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalation of violence.
Israel has fared well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process to a large extent.
Although rockets have killed in the Gaza Strip since 2004, about 30 Israelis, the country is relatively remained free of suicide bombers - not least because of the barriers, the inside run in the West Bank and therefore into the main part of any Palestinian state. These protect the Jewish settlements, which, although declared illegal under international law, but are always expanded.
Netanyahu is doing well. His Likud party in the run up to the elections on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman allies with an even more combative group.
Why coddle these deceitful Palestinians and leave them a state of their own?
If they were actually in control of the West Bank, they would not like their colleagues in Gaza also fire rockets?
No, it is better to keep them at bay behind the wall and punish them should dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners to enforce. But the Arab Spring could make them a spanner in the works.
Even if the Islamists who now sit in Egypt and other countries in power, have little left for Israel, they will initially focus on the problems in their own country.
The Israeli defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors together.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to repair their economies.
That the pragmatic President Mursi teamed up with Barack Obama to reach a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps towards democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli-occupied territories, as this week blew up a bus in Tel Aviv.
The suppression undermines already democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only worsen.
Bloody suppression missions to Hamas in Gaza are increasingly taking their diplomatic toll over the years.
Both sides need an external stimulus
The correct answer is the one that is represented by the rational representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and of this newspaper : Two states in which Israel cedes areas for security purposes.
The - small for the near future - hope is that the ceasefire outsiders granted more influence to implement this solution.
Egypt now has to stop the flow of weapons into the Gaza Strip together with Turkey and Qatar and is better positioned than ever to Hamas to the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by exchange of territory and a shared Jerusalem, convincing.
Outsiders Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah reached an agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state as the forthcoming application for UN observer status.
Obama must also do its part to persuade Israel to negotiate.
During his first term, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Far away in the white house, it seems like he would be as averse to a stake.
But this is an unfortunate, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a substantial interest in a stable Middle East.
And part of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian cigarette packaging laws for uniform contact force
Health Warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs, which are the same for all tobacco brands
The world's first uniform laws for cigarettes and tobacco packaging are in force in Australia. Thus, brand logos and colors are replaced by neutral, olive green cover, which are also printed with dramatic images that show the diseased body parts and sick babies and children caused by cigarette smoke.
Of the different health warnings and images aside from next Saturday is the only difference between the packages in the brand names that are printed in an identical, small font.
Thus Australia introduces the world's most stringent rules for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government wants to discourage young people from smoking by the glamorous image of smoking is eliminated.
The government of studies is based, have shown that people who have not yet started to smoke at 26, with 99% probability no longer be after start.
"You can already see in children young age that they understand the message that tobacco companies try to compete with their brand image," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She cites studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will be very little impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the law.
It was said that the laws would the black market trade favors, leading to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes lead.
"The laws will result in serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre, British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, however, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone covers to cover the unbearable packaging have risen enormously since the companies British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco two months ago supreme Court of the Australian failed with their appeal against the laws.
Zico had sold up to 6,000 units of wholesale shops and wait for new stocks.
For us this is a good deal.
According to experts, the catch lies in the popularity of social media in exactly the population, which are addressed by the plan.
A number of Australian laws has tobacco companies banned from TV advertising, forbid them to act as sports sponsors and forced most traders to interpret cigarettes in stores any longer. Now the tobacco advertising has changed the Internet.
The Australian Government has internet advertising prohibited by local businesses and pages, but has no influence on the international pages.
"Who has marketed tobacco and only a small area left to promote its products, can not get around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, a researcher in health care at the University of Sydney.
On social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook Freeman has noted an increase in reports of experience to brands that were written by "normal people".
One has to ask the question: Is this just a private person who finds so much pleasure in Marlboro cigarettes that she takes this even a video - or has a marketing agency to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry instead concentrate on marketing it to deal with the new laws.
She's even gone so far as to pay the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations - those countries complain to the World Trade Organization about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries engaged in major trade with Australia.
A WTO ruling is expected in mid 2013.
According Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country in 2001, which prescribed photographic warnings.
Meanwhile, these including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine were extended to more than 40 countries.
Tougher laws are being considered in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers show defiantly.
The pictures do not affect me.
I simply ignore them.
"You just take a dump and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a pack of cigarettes on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there is only one reason why I would stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade, "King of the Pack" in the city of Sydney, says the uniform packaging made it difficult filling its shelves.
"In the past I have used one hours in which to place a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should simply ban cigarettes completely - then we would have told us okay, that's it, we make tight," he adds clearly added angrily.
In a constantly electrified world, it is good to be bored sometimes
This Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours in the airport when our plane failed and we had to wait for another plane due to mechanical problems.
So I had enough time to give me some thoughts on boredom.
I will not lie.
To wait half a day at the airport on a flight that is quite annoying - even when books, magazines and iPhones (and tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts lead to boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it is for us - and our children - okay, occasionally to be bored.
Thus, the brain is forced to lose interest in trains of thought, which perhaps encourages creativity.
And because most of us these days almost constantly stare at one or the other screen, the benefits of boredom no longer benefit us.
Should we welcome with open arms of boredom?
And.
And no.
I will come back again.
Like many people, I always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon that has grown with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom : A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see it that way.
"In fact, the boredom has a very long history," he says.
The walls of the houses of Pompeii graffiti adorns a Latin of boredom that goes back to the first century.
And then there's the question of how we actually define boredom.
John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada, according to the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After much reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that define boredom as the experience of "wanting to pursue a satisfying activity, but this is not to" be.
Boredom is different from apathy accordingly the effect that the person is not employed, but this would be.
When apathy, however, there was no urge to do something.
The key experience of boredom, he says, there was a "disturbance of the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and the feeling that time passes slowly".
Boredom can listen to it almost as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, though these two conditions might be related, bored people see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed people see the problem in itself.
Sometimes we think that 's boring us, even if we only have difficulty concentrating.
In their study "The unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in terms of Attention" - to German as: "The Idle Mind: The definition of boredom in terms of attention," in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science," which appeared in September, have Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape on which a person was reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television in the next room, that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so it was hardly noticeable, while the third group did not heard this noise.
The people who heard the barely audible television, claimed to feel more bored than the other two groups - they had problems to concentrate, could find no reason for this and wrote their difficulties of boredom.
If you're trying to concentrate on a difficult or strenuous task, disturbance of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If you, however, exerted a monotonous activity - "as the search for defective products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help not to feel bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that fidgeting and doodling, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, they can fight even by persons remain physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to fidget around, learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
All of us will eventually get bored - my delayed flight, a booming speaker, a particularly tedious film.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed in the 1980s, a "scale for boredom susceptibility".
On the scale we find statements like "Many things I have to do repetitive and monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I did not have enough time for everything."
Using these scales, researchers have found that boys are more often dull than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - especially regarding the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a bunch of pretty haggard.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teens and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of adolescents were bored in school and while doing homework, whereas 23% reported being bored when they were not in school.
However, only 3% of parents reported that they feel bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he did not know if the percentages are increased or decreased in terms of boredom.
However, he was sure that "the youth is seen as particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers have little impact on their everyday routine.
So back to my original question : Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it will cause people to take extreme physical risks and addicted to gambling or drugs to relieve it - the studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors investigate the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Vodanovich professor who studies the subject for more than two decades.
"With the boredom, the brain will tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at New York University.
But the brain does not always know what you should just do your best.
If you are bored and you use this energy to play guitar and cook, you will be happy.
But television can indeed provide for short-term happiness, but long term it evaporate again.
Who 's bored child enough so an iPad, so it may indeed distract from the boredom. It therefore has not learned to talk or to control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds : "self-control is transferred from one situation to the other."
The child learns not only to entertain, but also gets into other areas more self-control.
I do not think we should celebrate boredom.
Also, we should not see them critically.
Instead, it should be our goal, we also feel comfortable away from the constant activity and irrigation technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we would be more boring., But boredom is excruciating, unrelenting desire to do something worthwhile," he says.
He believes that people are looking for in truth only for a way to unwind and relax.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated, it 's hard to deal, even if the noise is silenced."
In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19 -year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in the Southeast Colorado court for an offense that will be legal in this state soon : The possession of a few chunks of marijuana and a pipe, which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on a September day with the car in Lamar near the border with Kansas on the road when they were stopped.
After the police had found marijuana in the car, Orozco was summoned for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia - peccadilloes, which are each provided with a penalty of$ 100 - and was given a court date.
"We are treated like criminals," said Orozco.
But he is also a?
In the uncertain weeks following the decision of the state to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer depends less on hundreds of smaller drug offenses with the law, as the location.
Hundreds of offenses that revolve around marijuana, here and in Washington State, which approved similar measures already dropped.
The police authorities pursue adults over 21 years no longer in possession of a small scale. This is legally allowed once the new laws come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the conservative Colorado counties have announced to continue existing marijuana offenses, citing people still in court.
At the same time agree to several cities, the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains from above to prevent new, state licensed marijuana businesses in the opening in their communities.
"This situation is developing so fast to say that I do not know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, located east of Denver.
And regulators in Washington state scratching their head helplessly.
They are waiting for a guide to set up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and earned a deadline of 1 December 2013 eyes.
In Washington, it is believed that in every case Colorado is ahead of most states, which relates to the regulation of marijuana. There, the drug was legalized for medical purposes and then for personal consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. Therefore, the state is good for orientation," said Brian E. Smith, Chairman of the supervisory authority for spirits in Washington State.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve the purposes of a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent for us to follow," he adds.
The Washington law, called I- 502, take effect on 6 December is legalized in force and thus forms the endpoint of a gray area in which the state license system not yet exist, but the possession.
And unpleasant practical issues to be addressed at this time - such as the state's requirement of a "reasonable access" to be agreed to licensed marijuana with the prohibition of cannabis shops within 300 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities.
"Nowhere, it will be difficult to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the "Center for Legal Cannabis", a research group recently formed.
On 21 Chief Oates November sent his employees in Aurora an e- mail in which he declared that the prosecutor would pursue minor marijuana offenses in persons over 21 years no longer, and that the police "immediately" no criminal charges will strive for this offense.
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to enforce municipal regulations to regulate growers of medical marijuana and drug dealers would continue to occur.
In Weld County in northern Colorado District Attorney Ken Buck takes a stricter view.
After the vote, he said that his agency would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to move consumers to withdrawal.
Currently, 119 people for possession of 50 grams or less of marijuana must stand trial, though many were prosecuted for other offenses.
"Our agency has a duty to pursue violations, which are criminal offenses concerned at the material time," Buck had said in a statement.
The reactions are even in places such as rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalent.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the county, shows adults for possession of small quantities is not longer.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all outstanding ownership process.
"I do not think that I am wasting my time to enforce the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of voters supported the measure in Colorado, from the beginning it was clear that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal use of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state promoted among local officials a profound dichotomy in terms of the large green experiment days.
In district prosecutors if it were a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents standing for marijuana offenses in court accused and acts as spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws site.
"They have such a large part of their life spent for this to prosecute persons that they still can not accept the legalization," he believes.
The first states that treat smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington traded as a national model cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for a legal age of sale, at the same time they are waiting nervously to instructions of the federal government, which wants to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level as a criminal offense.
Advocate the legalization movement hope that the Justice Department will give way.
Despite a number of sensational arrests of consumers and sellers medical marijuana, the federal government announced the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states allow for the most part.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration believes that detectives are indeed likely to occur no doors to confiscate small amounts of the drug, however, it will probably balk, under the new legislation, legal, state-regulated marijuana to tolerate businesses.
Several cities in Colorado did not even wait that the federal act.
Even before the election day some local municipalities approved moratoriums on new marijuana businesses, although this could only open in about a year.
Last week decided Montrose, a town in the west, a six-month ban, which is probably adopted next week.
"We do not want to get into a position where we license someone and then at the federal level are facing a big problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community has voted against this amendment.
We act on this, for what the community has chosen and not feel for what the state has decided.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt : I was bullied from Oxford, because I 'm Tory
Not only university students of today are being attacked for their views
It has always been my biggest dream was to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended university that I once held the largest knowledge temple in the world for a modern Greek symposium, that the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance - promoted.
But within two weeks after I moved in Worscester college in the late eighties - where I had intended to study history - again I had packed my bags and so brought about the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard, they said I would have gone, because I had a problem with the fact that students in the neighboring room had sex.
The author AN Wilson said archly, I would leave the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, ran, because I suffered systematic harassment and threats.
About not because of my rather unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
They had harassed me for only one reason - a reason that seemed so narrow-minded and cruel in this alleged cradle of enlightenment: My now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt had been a key adviser Margaret Thatcher and I advocate the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this now?
Well, according to recent reports, a new generation of students of the moderate right under similar tracking suffers.
The organized and growing hatred of Tory students at Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week called on the same equal rights protection, the gay, the disabled and ethnic minorities will benefit.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College say they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable" because of their political views.
They demand a place in the equality of their college committee to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
"Wonderland : Young, Bright and on the Right" worsened their situation by a recent documentary on political broadcast on BBC Two students, was the Tories represented as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
Was shown therein including graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative student association at the University of Oxford, who was driving in a Rolls -Royce and sported silver suit and silver studded cane.
Students at other universities say conservative, they are considered as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees."
The 20 -year-old Luke Black, Vice- President of the Conservative Student Federation of the University of Nottingham, made the following statement in a Sunday newspaper : " There is a growing tendency to link universities.
People think we are like the Bullingdon club to have met without us at all. "
Samuel Roberts, 21, and a student of history in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, is of the opinion that such a climate is "uncomfortable". The 19 -year-old Stephanie Cherill, president-elect of the Conservative student association of Oxford says that she has a growing rejection of students observed in the moderate right JCR members.
"This represents a threat to the intellectual discourse and for the welfare of the members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford I was in such a minority.
An incredibly shy 18 -year-old I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was at its peak.
Last year, the university had voted for Margaret Thatcher - a former student - to give no honorary title because of cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have startled even Stalinists.
In the first days of freshman week, with the new students get to know themselves and the tutors, I got a taste of the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors not only tolerate the mockery of Tory students, but even participated with pleasure in mind.
Political issues such as the miners' strike, the privatization and the rejection of sanctions against the government of South Africa's apartheid regime found their way into the wood-paneled rooms of the tutorial.
On my first such event I should French texts from the 18th Century translation into English. In what should come then, I had not expected.
"Please translate the first paragraph," "Miss Wyatt," said the Philosopher Harry Pitt (now deceased).
I stumbled.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake, and rather spitefully.
"Refuse to Thatcher followers to learn French, or are they just stupid?" He asked me.
The other students snickered.
In my eyes welled in tears.
"I suggest that they take a few French lessons in your spare time - so if you are not too busy with your social activities," I growled at Pitt.
I returned with hanging head back to my room.
That night I sat alone at dinner in college, when someone tapped me on the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James who introduced himself as a member of the Conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said gently.
Unfortunately, it is what it is.
Anyone who is suspected of being Tory, is harassed.
For me, it is bad enough, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you.
Most Tory freshmen pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub I later tried to adjust myself.
I insisted that I was not in all respects to Mrs Thatcher an opinion.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A freshman in philosophy, politics and economics, who had visited the ironically regarded as conservative Eton College, said to me : "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You are dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was a pervert and dirty.
"How Tories have sex?" Asked me one.
The beat each other, right?
I felt so, how homosexuals had felt before the liberal laws of the United States.
Would it ever be possible for me to lead a normal life at Oxford University?
If I can meet like-minded after nightfall?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and have to suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that lay before me, stretched before my mind's eye to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor who was to clearly identify themselves as a Tory, was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history, which had its seat in my college.
He was not only hated for being a conservative, but because he had Thatcher advise in matters of foreign policy and speeches written for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, it was provincial and narrow-minded, and rejected it for its Marxist- deterministic historical perspective.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at the Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You will not be happy here," he told me.
I started to commute between Oxford and my parents' house and found refuge with open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the forties all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.
Something they would never do that, not in my city of dreaming spiers.
Even my Communist friends always put proper manners of the day.
His moist eyes clouded over.
Give the whole thing a chance.
I'm sure you just teasing you.
It would break my heart when you left.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London my emotional resistance was weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had yielded to the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a tutorial in the next week, in which a further history tutor was seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly grown tired of shame, I admitted that I had with my parents moved to a "brainwashing", and called them "old fool".
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father who suggested the final nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two weekly columns in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes gave my bailiffs on.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
Feel free to call me a whiny wimp.
But no 18 year old should ever have to suffer such intimidation and spite in an educational institution.
And is even more tragic that it was Oxford - a university that not only spawned 14 Tory Prime Minister, but hiding behind a still undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino pulls elegance of the celebrity before"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - master of couture," which opened in London this week, ABC talks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and the other famous Italian fashion designer clients.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital, which is the accommodation of an exhibition of Valentino Garavani worthy.
This was at the opening of the designer - recognized "master of Valentino couture", a magnificent retrospective, compiled for more than 130 haute couture dresses, which were created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with an unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose sole protagonist of "il signore" Garavani is, but without its sophisticated clientele could not have been written.
Valentino always felt a fascination for the stuffy and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition, the 3rd until Will be seen in March, there are a number of private letters and photos with the signature of the finest aristocracy, from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, the Princess Marie -Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from humble fashion designers in the city in northern Italy Voghera the idol of the international jet set.
To be in love with the needle need not be a disadvantage.
"At least they kick their butts not on your beautiful carpet, as do some beautiful celebrities from pop music," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen- Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, the couple lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, spacious and elegant accommodation.
"We all were delighted when we were invited to his home in Gstaad," says the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, a close friend of forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli and Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And yet he 's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
Even the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of fashion designer.
Many years ago we went to a fashion show at the Piazza di Spagna in Rome to his home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
At each detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music and realized you could feel its influence.
"All Invited feel important and loved", the "top model", which began their career in the week of Haute Couture in Paris in 1995 recalls.
"He never goes out of style because its designs are works of art," she concludes..
Fashion Show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession, rather of mutual liaisons.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries at Somerset House was transformed into a glorious, 60 meter long catwalk, which suggests a role reversal : the user takes the place of the model and goes along the catwalk to admire a fantastic "audience", the masterpieces by Valentino bears such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costumes, the Vitti Monica wore in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather, which belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
In this crowd of fashion dolls shine like the name of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette- Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and fashion designers, 2006
Many of these customers say the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can still perfectly remember.
It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn / winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," said Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.
"I prefer it to all others because of his great love for the women and because it highlights our beauty, before," added the ex - Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses, very, they have plenty of light and emphasize the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and opinion leaders in the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d' Arenberg can not remember when she wore a Valentino for the first time.
When I lived in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
End of the 90 years it finally came to.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party at the castle of my cousin, the Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying skirt and a draped top with a neckline that honors its name.
"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d' Arenberg.
"Does not depend on the Valentino fashion from his obsession is timeless," says this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess D' Arenberg preserved their evening dresses fashion designer "with absolute care" on, "because a dress is not just a dress, but also the associated memories."
The "King" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie -Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashion designer named his seamstresses) were necessary to customize this ivory silk dress with beads, embroidery and twelve different four and a half meter long tail.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the trade press, this dress was a milestone in haute couture end of the 20th Century, "the return to customers the highest society."
For years tarnished with the "savoir -être" of the elite, Valentino is now her best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (die höchste Auszeichnung Italians), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, ausgezeichnet mit der Ehrenlegion, kumuliert Garavani so viele Ehren, wie jeder der seiner Ehemänner Kundinnen.
"I always have to be refined, its tranquility, noticed his neat appearance and perfect," admits D' Arenberg.
I saw him the last time a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was spotless, and the time leaves no trace of him."
And this says a princess...
The hardest job in the world : the human workhorses of Kawah Ijen
For four euros put the support of the Indonesian volcano their lives and health at risk if they carry 70 kilos of sulfur on the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others are working literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners, who earn their living by bringing sulfur from Kawah Ijen volcano in East Java, Indonesia.
This he must descend to the bottom of its crater, where the effluent from the earth solidified sulfur- containing gas in contact with the air every day.
Having broken out large stones sulfur, which can weigh up to 70 kilos, he transported them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders on the steep paths of stone.
Although there are just 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the depleted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the rise in turtle pace as they keep the balance and have to put their steps carefully, so they do not slip and fall.
You know that each step can cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every pound of sulfur, which they break down.
Once at the top, they are making their way between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and run with the tiresome heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale that has a mining company a little further up at the bottom at an altitude of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi that the deposits in the volcano and (never better said) exploits its workers since 1960, where she (5 euro cents) pay 662 rupees per kilo Indonesian sulfur.
They then sold each for 10,000 rupees (83 Euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks accessories, cosmetics, and even dynamite to bleach sugar.
"We usually carry 70 kg, we obtain for each path about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros)," Anto, which makes three routes a day normally explained to us.
For each route it takes three hours, after which it is completely done, but at the end of the day, he then 138,000 rupees (€ 11.5) together.
What looks like a miserable wage for such a seemingly inhuman effort, but is three times of what he would earn working in the field.
"The daily wage of miners here, where at the coffee harvest 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) will be paid on the day and the average monthly income of two million rupees (167 euros) is very high," said the carrier on previously as a bricklayer the tourist island of Bali worked.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto with his family to Banyuwangi, a village in the vicinity, returned, and for a reason that is so important in Indonesia as the sulfur is : "I have married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindu, and I have brought them to Java, to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing frequently and his eyes are irritated because of toxic gases.
The 27- year-old Anto three years puts his life on the line at Kawah Ijen, the sulfur has already left the first traces in him, though he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing frequently and his eyes are irritated because of toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he must pay to achieve his dream.
"I will work here for two years, because I open a shop or would like to learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This charming and intelligent, but punished by life young man could work as tourist guides, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of carrying donkey.
He shares a filthy wooden hut with other carriers and is available each morning for two clock because the sulfur is also flowing at night, where its characteristic yellow color of bluish shining in the darkness.
The shadows challenging, it rises in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he bought with his own money into the crater.
Approximately 400 load carrier at the bottom of the crater with sulfur baskets on their shoulders.
Despite their large profits the mining company has not mechanized mining sulfur in order to save costs, and delivers the bodies that work on their own account and will be paid by weight, no equipment.
You also get no share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) per camera fee, collected from the guardian of this nature parks together with the entry fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) of the tourists who and for photographing the volcano human carrying donkey come.
"This work is not for the animals and for the people" protested Madrusin, a burly, 42 -year-old carrier since leaving school operates three decades at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assured that he will continue "as long as it is", because he needs the money for the education of his three children aged 10 to 18 years of age.
I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the eyes and throat itch when the wind suddenly turns and the miners trapped in the thick pillars that rise from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains of serious diseases... except of course the usual breathing problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and blowing on the shoulders, which have deformed the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back Unainik is to carry 50 kg, 53- years nurmehr able.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which are transported by trucks over a three goat path between the bushes to camp in Tamansari in 18 miles away.
"I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, where he opens his mouth wide, in which some teeth missing.
Of his five children, the eldest is working with his 30 years as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but the poverty keeps generation after generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: those who Ijen working as human beasts of burden at Kawah.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame that they have no children, the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and the education of children.
"The population of Singapore has to grow."
I 'm a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic Wife: Are we fulfilling our civic duty and we create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for mints, but nevertheless - or perhaps because - they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viral video on YouTube.
"Is pushing a" The sentences are part of a rap song, the local sayings such as bao " (loaf) in the oven in order to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising firm BBH, who shot the video, maintain hope that the commercial reaches a fun way to draw attention to the problem.
Your creative leader Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to fulfill their "national duty".
This is just something for the internet, so we had to make it funny and witty.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
During propagation, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that this is a topic to which we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organization of speed dating evenings (fast flirting).
Possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they do not necessarily lead to success.
Therefore, we thought : Why not make something as creative as possible to address this problem, such as to compose a rap?
1.2 children
Who takes this issue is not easy, is the Government of Singapore.
Every year it is 1,300 U.S. dollars for policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A package of government grants for married couples and parents up to$ 15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits.
But everything so far had little success.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, which is also known for his conservative government and its strict social controls.
Authority in accordance with its national population, the birth rate currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time was about 2 when this rate - which is also known as replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why not get the Singaporeans more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy of the national population authority says that this is a "better education" and was due "greater career opportunities".
"This has allows people except to marry and form a family a lot more options in terms of having to life goals and priorities," she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of single people and the postponement of marriage and births, the result of which is to reduce the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, led an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration to counteract the reduction of the population, resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where barely -clad xenophobia against immigrants, many new flowers, especially against the Chinese, who are criticized because they keep wages low and not be integrated.
The increase in immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore last year achieved their worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt was made to correct the problem with higher contributions and deductions for foreign workers.
unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate, the known effects on economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, health care costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve, that not so many small homes are built.
It also has an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments, which are known as "shoe boxes" and could be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living space of 46 square meters, and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they may promote the lifestyle of living alone, and that they discourage builders from building large apartment for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Managing Director of real estate company EL Developers, says that getting his "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger units.
They are so popular, and the units are days and even weeks to sold out faster than the larger units.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards provide clearer guidance to developers, which previously were obstacles placed in the way if they wanted to build too many small units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, refer to the discussions with the Singaporeans who work in the financial district, that they will not have a big impact.
"The people are very stressed out, the apartments and the education is expensive, so it is pushed by many" says a young manager.
Children can get.
"For me it is important to have my own money and time," says another, about twenty years old man
Men and women carry on their career, the stress and the cost of the property and education as reasons why they can not have children.
Therefore, Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children - because the government can still do so much.

Privacy
According to the dictionary, these are the property privately or "that area of private life, where one is entitled to protection from any kind of interference."
What is private to someone under 16?
As applied to his everyday life and the social networks that definition?
He understands the dangers to which he exposes himself when he makes the Internet situations known that he would not share in real life?

In four of the cases they associated the term with "something very private" on a personal level and "on the password and the user" if they used it on the social networks.
"My deepest secrets I would not be known in a post type" says the 10 year old Jorge when trying to "private" to explain the meaning of to websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail, and Windows Live Messenger, where he accounts for two years features.
"These are very confidential secrets, they may know my mother, but not the whole world," he confirmed.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or images of games.
I sell me my time with friends.
"I would not share a photo that is not of me, or of someone who makes the fool," he says.
The boy is aware that it is false, obscene photos of naked, to publish crime, violent or abusive or post comments.
Jorge assured to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
Including the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up for Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I do not know if someone answers me, I only upload" he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly speak with relatives or friends in the distance," he states.
Asked he replied that he would never accept an invitation from a stranger.
Even if someone empfähle a stranger to him, he would ignore it.
The case of 14 -year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he admits not to know the 20 people that he has his friends list added.
"That scares me, not because we have something in common, such as music," he states.
After specifying the boys to him, no one has hinted or asked him for his address or telephone number.
"If someone is hassling me or asked of me, I simply remove it from my account," he admits.
Jose reported to Ask, after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy experiences are not unknown that we know today as cyberbullying.
The friend of a friend was blackmailed in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never found out who it was," he says.
According to José the victim has not closed the account.
"He did it only in private."
Then he explained a number of steps to configure a user account safe.
In contrast to this boy Jorge would upload photos of friends in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I 'd do if he is unappealing to me or I will wipe him one.
"But I know that this is cyberbullying" he explains.
key Questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher with a degree in education and learning, says that to orient the children and young people, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks, to be informed.
"The Internet was created as a means to search for information, with the appearance of these pages, the rules have changed but," she says.
Porras explained that the academics Marc Prensky, and a Master title in Education at Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" these concepts formed to explain the phenomenon.
The Digital Natives are they, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants, they are to teach, but even where we learn more," he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, "because we ask of them that they have a defined criterion about what common, may be published or told, and this. Reached an age where it is not mature enough"
"They should also be choosy when it is most important to them to be popular, to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people, what is privacy, ask them questions that it brings to think.
"To tell you they are not doing is not working," he says.
Porras then mentions some options: There are things that you would not tell a stranger. Then why are you doing it on the internet?
Or: Would you like it if you posted a photo of you, like the one you released from a friend?
Do you know what the other post about you?
Have you previously asked the others for permission if you have tagged photos of celebrations?
And one more question : Do all know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they need to act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
"Someone is outside the Internet with respect, morality and other principles, and the same should apply for social networks," he explains.
monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, a primary school teacher and educational consultant, commented that it is essential that parents read the guidelines carefully the social networks.
If they understand all the sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of reopening one user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you may share or disclose" he explains.
According to the Guardia children need the lesson "Do not talk to strangers" to be reminded.
Conclusion of the Summit of UNASUR without publication of the Declaration of Lima
The 6th Summit of Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was announced previously and should theoretically be signed by the seven present rulers.
Efe tried repeatedly to access the signed document for the VI. Ordinary Session of the Heads of State and Heads of Government of UNASUR to obtain. Sources in the State and President of the Republic told initially that they would pass it to the exam, but afterwards, declared that it would be published some time on the website of the Peruvian government.
For questions about the text, they indicated that the content of the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, has been presented with a short statement to the press.
The access of journalists to provide information on the Summit was restricted at any time.
During the day was in the press room just the image of the President meeting with no sound with the message transfer "private session, limited audio".
The little information that is circulated among journalists, were obtained from the spokespersons of some of the governments of the Unasur present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press secretary.
The only document that was distributed during the day, was the list of participating presidents what caused discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from different national and international media, which called for more information.
Then the president of Peru sent the media an e -mail with the "Final Declaration" of the summit, but said it involved the explanation of Humala and not the official document at the end of the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the III. Summit South America - Arab Countries (ASPA), and on this occasion, despite insistent demand by the press, the so-called Declaration of Lima, which had been previously announced, nor published.
On the official website of the ASPA you can convince them that the document was released last Tuesday.
On both international meeting stressed the Peruvian authorities that the information systems for the journalists were present, but they were limited to a high degree of access to information.
The summit ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court of The Hague, which attaches a border dispute between the two countries.
The President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Pinera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the ICJ, which begins at The Hague on Monday, in the process, the Lima initiated against Santiago, the to hear arguments on both sides.
"We will comply with and execute judgment upon the differences that we currently put forward this international court," Humala said with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and continues to be a country that adheres to the international laws, peaceful solutions to disputes examined concludes agreements and the international courts subjects," Pinera added and greeted Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both President that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia after a decision on the maritime border with Nicaragua, which considered it a grave error brought an action against the agreement of Bogotá, in which it agreed to the judge to make such international tribunal.
Present at the summit were the President of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which is excluded since 2011 after the overthrow of its president Fernando Lugo of Unasur, did not attend the meeting.
The host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The head of state leaving the final document in which it announced that 16 decisions made and the action lines for 31 projects between the South American countries with a total investment of$ 17 billion have been set.
Among the decisions taken, he said that the countries of Unasur "will make significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, which we expand the decisions on residence rights."
He said that measures would be promoted to "cooperation in the fight against insecurity in the cities and organized to enhance transnational crime, as well as measures to increase access to medicines and to the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America to improve and to act jointly and effectively in the event of natural disasters."
With the crisis in Europe must "accept the economic consolidation triumphant trains (in Latin America), but should serve to expand our production capacity and our people demonstrate a better future," Humala said.
"We have decided to give a series of 31 emblematic projects priority, which should improve the spatial connections in South America and especially in rural and frontier areas... and thus unite our countries and new forms of economic prospects," the president said in a Peruvian picked explanation.
Among these projects were also five Peruvian, which would lie on the transverse axis of its territory from the coast of Brazil, and two of which are designed to ensure a better connection with Ecuador, although he gave no further details.
Similarly, the final document made reference to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country is used for its resumption in the Union of South American Nations," of which it is currently excluded.
The need that Latin America continues to be an integrated region of prosperity and peace and good neighborly relations, was another aspect that was emphasized at the summit.
In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos said before the start of their participation in the regional meetings that he on Saturday in Mexico held a meeting with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, expected to maritime conflict after one of Bogotá treat question asked the ICJ judgment with respect.
"Maybe I 'll meet me at the next day (Saturday) with the President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will check all of these ways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua Nicaragua necessary to make conversation with," he underlined.
"I hope the President Ortega to say that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectful as possible," Santos added.
Santos Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they have the intention to be present at the inauguration of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.

"America needs to learn in the integration of citizens," said Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a target, "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who on 6 Summit of Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) participated, was held in Lima, told the state television in Peru that the Europeans "killed in the Second World War and other conflicts" and "now virtually a country are."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South African citizenship that drive the members countries of the UNASUR.
"Must be achieved, the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community, there are still reactionary sectors, seeking a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also advocated the restructuring of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the requirement to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and to take into account those who have signed the Convention on Human Rights, San José.
Those who teach will never commit to something, and in return all we ever sign the South American.
"It is incomprehensible that, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights based in Washington and is funded by the United States," he explained as an allusion to the political asylum that Ecuador has the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange granted.
Correa pledged that he did not regret this decision because he did not reveal that his principles, but his "deep democratic values and views on human rights" had complied.
He added that it "had been educated guesses that Assange extradited to a third State and his method would not be met." At the time
He also criticized the Swedish judicial system, have required him to undergo it in its territory an interrogation of an alleged sexual offense, while "the jurisprudence Swedish permitted by means of a video conference, the Embassy of Ecuador in London could have been executed."
Correa explained that there was a danger that the health and mental state would be affected by Assange.
"Since it is in our message, I have not spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not serious," said the head of state of Ecuador.
However, there was a risk that he took physical and psychological harm because he was trapped in a narrow space, and could not perform physical exercises outdoors.
"That would affect the health of everyone," he added.
Correa said that the solution to the asylum, which Assange has been granted since the month of June at the Embassy of Ecuador in London, the granting of a free letter was what he could travel to Ecuador, and that this and in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden the legal authorities of Europe would be. He pointed out that there had been talks with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not deal with human rights, we use this word not in this case, however, there have been constant calls.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe, because of Assange 's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, a series of procedures on various European agencies leads," he said.
And "if the UK this morning granted carte blanche, this is done in my opinion."
And if Sweden Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or via Skype questioned, as it was permitted by the law and Swedish made in other cases, the issue was settled.
Correa took the opportunity to become certified as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that what he will not tolerate, "the mediocrity, the evil intent and the lie are that undermine freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who strive for profit and blackmail," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself that Ecuador "is dominated and not by the bankers or hegemonic and narrow-minded countries" no longer of such journalists, and took anticipate that he will "deepen the revolution at a re-election to the way in this continue right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to uphold the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until his next election, where he argued that the organism "stand firm needs and may not accept any opportunism and not as legal disguised coup" because it "legitimacy democracy was destroyed in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also holds the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and, with Nicaragua to negotiate the law of the sea borders between the two countries, in the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, the privileged, the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, absolutely entitled to "."
Currently, this ruling will not be implemented.
It is a problem between a southern and a Central American country.
Conflicts are unavoidable, but they have to be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
You need to be addressed comprehensively, so that you can overcome it and look forward.
He also confided to a good conclusion to the dispute over the maritime border between Peru and Chile before the same Court and said that "it is right for America to call international instances when commits both countries to accept the verdict, even if it turns very hard."
With regard to the possibility that he will be a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to reach his third consecutive term in office, he stated that he was "with great optimism and joy sees this possibility, although it is sometimes very difficult falls."
Correa pledged that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would retire from political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but under such circumstances as unjust in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty only be corrected by the political power.
"My political movement had faith that I was the one who guaranteed these probable victory, so I have to meet this responsibility," he said.
If I should win, it would be my last term as president, then I 'll retire from public life.
This is true even if we lose.
"It is decided," he said.
Correa also took to address the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, Cuba reference.
I have just spoken with the Vice President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. He told me that he had traveled there for a planned, routine treatment, and would be expected that he could travel to Cuba after the re- election campaign.
"It is in any case a relapse in the health of President Chavez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian President took today in Lima on 6 Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations part (UNASUR), which ended with a call for increased regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of death due to AIDS today is a belated recognition
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the result of the investigation : HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says of the moment when he got the diagnosis, "tried to mitigate" for no apparent success of the physician.
He hid it from his family.
He decided alone to care for his illness and began to inform themselves about, and this with such use that he just his 43rd Birthday celebrated.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), which he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was the beginning of the 90s hard to imagine, as there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
Then avoided even the director of a clinic in the IMSS, to say goodbye, "because it led to a dead end."
Damals war Tod für synonym AIDS.
Today it is possible to survive with this syndrome quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic, who know nothing of their illness and where the virus has already caused damage and their immune system has been exhausted, and the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, that after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of patients receiving the treatment time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the Head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that this information was based, in April of this year, by a reputable scientific publication.
The specialist in infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists concluded since 2008 that although AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life on the degree of impairment of the immune system of people at the beginning of the depended on treatment, and those that would have greater chances that are not addicted to drugs : up to 30 years with a CD4 count of 200 and 50 years with a CD4 count of 500.
Simply put, the above observations imply that anyone who receives the diagnosis of HIV-positive at the age of 25 years, in this sense, "can easily be 75 years of age, as long as it is under control," said the expert.
In order to assess this progress really need to be reminded that the life expectancy of the average Mexican is 76 years today.
Even if the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people who die from AIDS, from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (Annual Report of the UNAIDS) decreases), it is nevertheless true that since the advent of AIDS, 60 percent recorded in the national database of patients have died.
In Jalisco alone died in 2011 255 people, and until the month of May this year, there have been 187 deaths, but be assured that there is since 2005, universal access to antiretroviral drugs.
- Why people are still dying of it?
- In my opinion the problem is not the access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we had no supply problems with the drugs. The problem is that people come into a very advanced state, because they do not know their infection status, ie. In very late stages of disease
He makes a striking statement. "Nine out of ten patients come to us when they already have a concomitant infection in order to influence the global mortality, earlier diagnoses are required, which is why all persons for whom this is necessary massively detection tests are offered have to."
This proposal, agree the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (National Committee for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and the patient as Fabrizio to that made his test to perform at a private lab, and this made the only reason that it had made a friend of his, who was already in the AIDS stage despite his young age and even had Kaposi's sarcoma (a cancerous tumor), which is one of the common complications.
Everything is different when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they are going to die, and would not hear anything.
"If I must die, rather then burst three times," they say in my case.
The change was to improve back, I eat well, do sports and take the medication.
Today his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life like everyone else.
"I work in an entrepreneurial lot, had an active, yet responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," Fabrizio enumerates who agreed to share their intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animate with his testimony that, now in the context of the global AIDS Day are afraid.
You should take the test if they are at risk. The sooner they know whether they are HIV -positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly as all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are large gaps between the health plans and the ordinary citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has assumed the responsibility of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
To specific locations on the "condom distribution was actually increased; previously they were sold individually, now they give us packages with hundred of what is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom", he said.
To persons at risk for new infections among young people.
"What do you need that?" is a common question mockery of social workers, guidance personnel in schools, employees in pharmacies and the health care system, the young people do not want to expose themselves, assured the correspondent.
He suggested to orient these new inefficient distribution, the condoms should be located not only behind the counter, but in the output devices in public toilets of facilities that are frequented by young people.
It should not be promoted promiscuity.
It should not be paid for them the beer and motel, as the Governor Emilio Gonzalez said when asked whether his administration would be distributed condoms.
"Sexuality does not look so, it is best to bring the condoms closer to those who already exercise a sexual activity," he brought it to the point.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is seen nationally on 4 Location of new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13 Place in relation to HIV.
92% of cases of infection via sexual intercourse, blood and 6% higher than the 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that 50,000 people are living with HIV, because there are 4 or 5 people for each registered case, who do not know.
After the Court of Appeals of the United States has confirmed a ruling that does not recognize the restructuring of liabilities of the Group vitro, which was achieved through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, an ominous precedent for each national company with offices created in a neighboring country that has payment problems.
So you could say that the process of survival of the companies allow the Mexican law, in the land of Stars and Stripes contrary to international agreements are not valid.
In practice, leads the 15 June recognition of the judgment handed down by Judge Harlin Hale on Bancarrotas Court for the Northern District of Texas to the Mexican companies seizure of their property beyond the Bravo river are helplessly exposed.
However, the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico, the decision opens the door to call the Supreme Court of the United States for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case indicates that the creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy laws of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says, first, that it is the main method is treated in Mexico commercial bankruptcy.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in proceedings for insolvency of companies with transnational profile is not known.
In fact, the Model Law of the United Nations was created for the unification of international trade law for this purpose, the American Law Institute was used as a mediator.
Second, the Court determined that without the votes of the companies for recognition, not the required majority had been reached for the restructuring of the liabilities of the liabilities of the bankruptcy estate, which had the branches of Vitro and its parent company.
However, this possibility is recognized by the Mexican laws.
Vitro is actually not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities were confirmed member of the group by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for Trade bankruptcies).
It is true also that, after deduction of the votes of the creditors of branches vitro, the creditors who sued in the courts of the United States against vitro, ie, the vulture funds such as Capital Aurelio, Aurelio Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had not reached majority.
The vote would have gone 45 percent from 37 percent.
This is not considered by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, there Vitro blame for its difficult position from 2008 as part of the big economic crisis in the United States, which granted land punches.
For this reason the family González Sada specifies a contradiction before the same Court of Appeals for the plenary vote takes place, ie of all the judges, because only three of them were voting.
Which is not upheld, the Cerciorare - opposition is filed, which calls for the review of the process by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The Serious about this case is that the court allowed a document aside, this was sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court) in which the study conducted by vitro method is described in the framework of the law on commercial bankruptcies, and where it is pointed out that it had kept strictly to the agreement signed by the two countries to comply with the Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy Code of the United States.
It is pointed out that the country has subjected the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, ie the rules set for the cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-band Carambola : a blow vitro and for the country.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball war mein Leben"
The globetrotter basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes was the basket sports connected for more than 60 years and has traveled all over the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large collection of spiritual history of basketball in the country as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was bound by a stroke in 2008 to a wheelchair, Rexes spent 6 years part of this sport, either as a player lower classes, players of the first national league representative and head of the BSN with Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of the Basketball Association.
"All my life I have placed my many hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was President of the BSN, chief executive of the national team and president of the Association in the 90s," said Reyes recalled on a visit of Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón where he met Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years, lives.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating with that statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with pictures and memories of his long career, and they testify.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that remember his time with the Vaqueros of the mid-50s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-managing director or manager of the club.
" Those were my best years, I have enjoyed the most because I was part of the Vaqueros eight championships since 1967 it could be as a director, joint managing director or coach.
There were many fulfilling years, including five championships in succession from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to a championship in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy at BSN.
From then took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good administrator, "says Reyes.
I remember that I Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and at the University of Alabama (Birmingham) was employed, said: " I have a very strong player and 2 m wide.
Do you want him? "
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow recommended after the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse who was naturalized and was one of our best pitcher.
I remember when he said that if Mincy had enabled a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would ensure further.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted, but even from a distance out, because he was already at the top of the Association in 1988.
At the time, he preferred his executions and to enjoy Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won for the first time at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the United States.
After the World Cup came in 1990 when we finished fourth, which bronze was supposed to be, if not this would have been Canadian referee who let us repeat the last move for the second time, Reyes said.
This group was the 1990 World Cup the best national team that you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as those who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is the team 's Pan American Games in 1991 in Cuba, where we won the team gold and the U.S. offered a fight, as they were when they won against us in the World Cup bronze.
On that team not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "PICULIN" (Ortiz) were there again, but the young players (Javier) ' Toñito "Colon and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario" Quijote " Morales in 1990 due to a knee injury could not be there.
A team that was perhaps in terms of personalities not the best, but we won a gold medal and gave us great joy was that of the pre-Olympic tournament in 1995 in Neuquen, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the suspended player because of the occurrences on the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against each forecast.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
This was without doubt PICULIN Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico at this level so dominated as PICULIN.
And this is without taking into account his career in the various leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Arman Ditto Torres.

What do you think is the best of what you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era, the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN early 90s, up to 17 teams in a season.
What's left for you to do yet?
There are things that I would have introduced, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the guys, for example, play in Ponce only in their area and meet only in the national playoffs to teams from other parts of the island.
Today, the kids make a lot of unnecessary travel and games.
At least I see the results of the required training and courses for coaches, table officials and referees.
I'm proud of.
What are you doing today?
I enjoy listening to music, see music videos from my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and now and then I go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.

Beginning of the course, which studied the "end of the world"
Each week, students investigate topics such as the apocalyptic nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
Every semester when the professor of religion decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible hook : the end of the "long count down" of the Mayan calendar on 21 December, from which many people believed that it meant the end of the world.
Charmé but had no idea what was waiting for him in the next two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, as some have called the "Deudarmaggedon", as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place from which the Christian theorists believe that the Apocalypse begins.
"I did not realize that this will be the apocalyptic semester that there ever was," said Charmé this week the students at the University of Rutgers - Camden (New Jersey).
If anyone analyzed what happened today in the world, as if we had thirty days from that, this would be a really good season.
And he remembered that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he's not the only professor who, courses about the "end of the world" offers this semester, which really should be the last in history.
Temple of assessors Professor Barry Vacker is the course "Media, Culture and the end of the world."
Each week, students investigate topics such as the apocalyptic nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread out over time," he said, and the way how hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a specific human behavior.
If nuclear material falling into the hands of terrorists, a war could break out, for example.
This month analyzed the student films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could be compared in comparison with real life.
"I tried to inform the students about what is possible, probable and credible is impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and Amara Solari his colleague, an assistant examiners professor of art history and anthropology have formed a team to offer "The End of the World" a course with the simple name.
"We do not 2012, so that we always have the option to hold the new course, for the case that the world does not go down," Restall said.
Despite the "impending doom", students must study, create projects, and participate in audits.
Penn State in the final examination is conducted on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why the students have no choice but "to continue working until the night when the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours, there were no more places" Restall said about his course for students with a high average, which was filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the semester begins, we received emails from students who asked if there are free places.
The students in turn assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23 - year-old student at Rutgers - Camden on Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sects or religious mentality is really just a question of comfort or lack thereof.
The 25- year-old student Will Wekesa declared psychology and nursing, having seen all apocalyptic movies.
"I have never heard of a class, this is where taught," he stated.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students surveyed - and less still a professor - explained, the last date of the 21 December to believe.
"Our first project dealt with the prophecy of the Mayans, and some way we discredit them," said Julie Żegleń, student last year in Temple, 21 years old from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world ahead, it is just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
However, he notes that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that leads back several centuries, as did the people react to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"In other places, people do not think so," he says.
This is mainly used in the English-speaking world the case.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, responds quickly to the question whether he would know there a course on the "end of the world".
"The Philippines is not involved at the end of the world," he wrote as a hint of an exception to a higher court.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that was spoken over the years many days of the last judgment, and said that if 21 December nothing happened, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophized about that 21 December, the start of a seven-year period is, after the end of the world would come.
Students and professors by that date easily.
Several said that they would like to go to parties about the "end of the world".
"Maybe I 'll call a few friends so we can laugh together," Ford said Samira, a 20- year-old student for communications.
