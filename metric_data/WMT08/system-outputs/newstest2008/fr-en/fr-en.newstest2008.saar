Inflation in Europe, slipped into the food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro zone, is due mainly to the rapid increase in food.
In November, the rise in prices, 13 in the eurozone, has been compared to the forecasts, after a rate of inflation of 2.6% in October, an annual inflation of 3.1% has been recorded, indicated the Statistics Office of the European Community located in Luxembourg.
An official indicated that 3%, announced Bloomberg.
The American, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lower the rate of guiding saying that the intérets, with the growth of the premieres prices and falling unemployment, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would wish to maintain the rate of inflation below but close to 2%.
According to one analyst, it is wrestling 22 for the ECB: "to dissuade" inflation will have more has to intervene on this subject later.
In Germany, the rate of inflation of 3.3% is a record during these twelve years and in Spain, it went up at 4.1.
Inflation in the euro zone has off because of the rapid rise in the price of food and energy.
The dimensions of the cereals market has increased by 88% and the soya also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also considerably in 2007.
This year, the world price of oil has risen 52% and, last month, a barrel of oil coutait almost 100 dollars.
According to the ECB, in 2008, the rate of inflation will, from this year, 2.5% but it will go down in 2009, 1.9.
According to the analysts, inflation over 12 months remains around 3%, however, 3 4 next month, the annual average rate will be 2.1 percent.
All at once, they expect that the ECB has reduces the director twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of the Democratic Alliance (Fidesz) has increased significantly, so since the beginning of December 2002, it currently has the greatest number of people, whereas Gallup poll Institute () has never seen before such a weak Socialist support, namely 13%.
For the voters, the difference is, because of the greatest determination of support, more than two thirds (71%) against the support of a cinquieme (20%) for mszp (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to opinion poll, MDF (forum of Hungarian Democrats) and szdsz (Alliance free democrats) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two percent in the whole population.
On some voters to vote, the number of supporters of both parties by 1%.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate compared to the previous point, the proportion of those who judged that the economic situation of the country was serious has never been so high, it amounts to a 41% and 46% supplementary situation is serious enough.
After the most optimistic of spring and summer, are again more pessimistic about their situation.
For next year, the majority of the population is a worsening and only a dixieme envisages an improvement of the situation.
Last December, 71% of the people polled, namely an ever seen during the previous of Gallup polls, judged that the Prime Minister made his work rather than well.
13% polling trust or much trust Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38% support Viktor orbán.
54% do not trust at all with the Prime Minister and 27% of the Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the change in the political situation is the proportion of the thinking that with respect to the Prime Minister can be addressed without change.
Whereas after riots of last October, 35% polling hoped that the government and Prime Minister remain in office, this represents only 20%, simple majority (33%) estimates that the behaviour of new elections would be the solution to this situation.
The question regarding the vote, 60 percent polling reply that they would certainly vote and complementary 20% say that they would probably vote.
In comparison, for "organize legislative elections next Sunday, only 55 percent polling would probably and 15% supplementary would probably., following the result of the referendum will no doubt.
74% of people would say no to the registration fees in higher education, 79% would say not at the expense of consultation and 84% would say not subsistence expenses hospital.
Only when we look at the numbers of people who have expressed their intention to vote, respectively, 81 to 84 and 89% of the voters would reject the introduction of registration fees, expenses of consultation and subsistence expenses hospital.
Auchan is expensive, Tesco increased its price of almost twenty percent
Supermarkets established in the commercial of budaörs maintained the average increase in 16% last year the difference this year that the rate of VAT has not increased.
Article of napi gazdaság (daily economy)
This year, in the commercial of budaörs conducted, the usual daily Christmas also increased 16% on average, a higher value a thousand is displayed in all supermarkets.
The prices, which were flown away "in the department stores food of last December, have increased more brutally compared to the high standard.
However, consumers are obviously shocked to see that Articles bought clearly under nine thousand year now more than ten thousand.
The daily basket in supermarkets probes exceeded of 91, at least the psychological ten thousand.
And the highest value basket came on 10 573.
(2003, that was 800 on 6).
The price of unicum and living fish remained practically the last year, but the price of Turkey net, nut and poppy strongly increased.
In stores, the price of bread flour and followed the data of ksh (Institute central statistics) but, at auchan bread, found a kilo has 139 on.
Competition is not lower the price of the product 200 Forints.
It is amazing to see, also in the supermarket, that the price of the bottle recorded two litres of Coca-Cola was 200 Forints, it 257, including on the bottle recorded.
It empeche that this year, in terms of daily basket, auchan was more expensive and less expensive.
According to our calculations, cora has increased the price of his daily basket of 15 percent while Tesco and auchan increased respectively approximately 18% and 18%.
Comparing the most expensive basket of last year and the less expensive basket of this year, we note a gap of 12% while the difference between cheaper year and expensive this year is 21%.
The increased 1 480 on average.
Last year, the increased 1 206 on average, while knowing that the impact of the increase in the rate of VAT was noticed in the Christmas prices of last year.
This process has made perplexed trade supermarkets could not determine obviously margin which apply to products as they were unable to foresee at the impact on consumer prices.
(a calculates the rotation of a product, it will lose a large profit margins are on the intensity of trade).
Because of the change in the rate of VAT, in the daily basket evolved so that the excessive basket expensive 720 was higher than the value of the 2006 while the difference between the least expensive baskets was 844 on that.
This year, the difference was not so excessive since the value of basket expensive was higher than 630 has that of last year and less expensive increased 1 284.
The two seasons approaching Christmas, we noted a calamitous increase prices, in less than 20 months the articles of daily consumption increased by more than 30% in supermarkets.
(this does not confirm the necessity of ksh: for certain of necessity, statistics Institute noted a price increase of 30% in 12 months.
Such is the case with flour and egg).
According to the daily basket of the latter, this seems almost absurd because the price level of this product, for many years, increased hardly more than 10% compared to the base.
According to indications, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers because they succeeded in winning the sharp rise in prices by the multinationals.
In the triangle of gold, supermarkets complain, they always record good years.
According to our experiences, most customers looks more prices in the three visited supermarkets.
They buy quantity, while they take dominant pallets in food.
Wednesday morning important tails formed in the cases of three supermarkets because the number of customers increased shortly.
However, according to our information, the turnover is less important province, numerous multinationals complain aupres companies survey to handle the turnover envisaged, not only for food but also for consumer goods.
Many hospitals do economy on disinfecting
This year, more than a thousand infections, caused by the incorrect use of antibiotics, have been recorded in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, overwork medical personnel do not help a block infections, the chief doctor of the national centre of epidemiology.
Many hospitals are also economy on disinfecting
It is no longer an infection mrsa been diagnosed in the service of the hospital.
The bacteria resistant to antibiotics was detected on a hospital following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred at the same place.
The injured a serious car accident left hospital but shortly after it has to return to an infection and, for mrsa doctors have not been able to make an important operation because of the bacterium which is in its organization.
Until 10 December of this year, 1 094 infections generated by an agent were declared in national system of monitoring, pointed out to böröcz, chief doctor of the national centre of epidemiology.
Namely, the number of infections caused by an agent that actually recorded in the hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
Approximately two thirds of infections) (683 infections were caused by mrsa, in other words by the resistant to the méthicilline-oxacilline.
A third people carrying the bacteria of aureus staphylococcus (a) in their noses it without a disease.
Infections caused by his (such as throat infections, cutaneous infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily curable.
However, antibiotics are used excessive or inappropriate, bacteria, which is well to antibiotics, develop a bacterium pretty resistant to antibiotics which will proliferate fast in poor conditions.
In the event of poor provisional or prolonged immune system, this bacteria can cause serious infections, such as traumatic infection or septicemia, on the elderly patients, small weight or having a weakened body.
According to the hospital doctor, there is nothing in mrsa infections, these infections are part of the daily hospitals.
It should not confuse especially infection with the epidemic, there is no mrsa only or they sought, has said.
Her resist antibiotics.
"these patients are isolated, nurses puts on rubber and masks and antibiotics adapted to care,".
A priori, in-patients are examined whether they are carrying mrsa, though infection cannot always be avoided.
The sample is not the method
The great majority of infections caused by mrsa could be told but the present circumstances and conditions are favourable, the Hungarian hospitals, to prevent proliferation and pathogenes agents, to böröcz.
As this infection appears in the hospitals and homes for the elderly, hospitals should control in-patients and isolate the ill holders of mrsa immediately.
Though the microbiological is not the method in Hungarian.
It is the case that national social security does not finance these examinations.
The majority of cases are day if infection mrsa is only on the sick, the chief doctor of the epidemiological centre.
The European Union has relating strict recommendations adapted the use of antibiotics in human and there are also Hungarian directives for the recovery of certain infections and syndromes.
It must be made so that the antibiotic therapy is targeted, microbiological examinations should be carried out in order to empecher drugs but the still do not take into account.
The microbiological is rarer in care and care, böröcz communicated.
Many hospitals do economy on disinfecting
The evidence shows that the proliferent a patient another generally through the medical staff.
It is therefore essential to wash its hands, putting on and masks. However important gaps are detected in hospitals in this field.
The proliferent by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and contact. However, because of the conditions in Hungarian, contaminated patient cannot always be isolated.
Furthermore, rooms are often full, beds are often too close the another while in terms of epidemic, the patients should be removed another of metres.
Unfortunately, we also note that, in a difficult situation, save money on disinfectants, they are, the many patients and the risk of contamination is greater, indicated to böröcz.
According to böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is weaker demonstrable or even the proliferation of agent can be blocked.
Governmental plan against mrsa
The treatment of infection mrsa represents exorbitant expenditure for cases of social security, this is why the fight against this infection everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a plan to prevent or reduce the incidence of mrsa.
According to data published, so is effective and infections mrsa show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) revealed among its priorities the prevention of the impact of multiresistant agents (as mrsa also) as prevention of infections caused by these agents.

Political capital: the Hungarian guard increased risk country
According to the division risk analysis of political capital risk (division), the activity of the Hungarian guard, made up, with the support of jobbik magyarországért mozgalom (movement for better Hungary increases in several aspects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its "warning risk", the company announces that, in relation to the activity of the Hungarian guard, the greatest risk is déja "short term aggressive ethnic confrontations can occur following the worsening of the tension between the existing déja gypsy and not gypsy Hungary.
The research institute added that the political strategy of the Hungarian guard that is likely to cause this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is one of the main political actors gaps: "the Hungarian Government passed the public debate on the matter of the Roma representatives of radical political groupings and that a political strategy based on the disagreement between the Hungarian gypsies and".
The problem is some worsened, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists have reinforced and the aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
However, according to research institute, under the influence of the increased attention the Hungarian and international media the activity of the Hungarian guard "deteriorated significantly Hungary abroad, in particular concerning confidence in the stability of the country and democratic maturity.
They say that, following a greater publicity given the reorganization of radical groups and Hungarian upright since the autumn 2006, numerous associations have been constituted in Hungary for summer 2007 giving the name of "national association of self-defence.
"The common feature of this gathering is that they are defined as a civil organization that publicly declare the preparation of their members has missions of Defense (disasters, national defence, defence of armed force, if necessary, moreover, recalling the disability of the police, the army, the", added.
They announced that happened in accordance with the method which, relying on the resentment of society and political parties, seeks to disguise a different political ambitions in one aspect.
The focus on the civil and the statute of association is therefore only because the legal the recording of these associations to court but they are also a political strategy.
The analysis signals that the activity of the Hungarian guard is also increases the risk factor compared with the relations of neighbourhood.
"in recent months, many quote the Hungarian guard as a potential source of risk and the political actors of some bordering countries wish to justify their political anti-Hungarian referring to the Constitution of the Hungarian guard.
This influences the political stability of the region, added.
According to the research institute, the Constitution of the Hungarian guard is not a unique in Central Europe, the political risks increased throughout the region.
As they say, the Hungarian guard looks, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian national whose constitution has been declared by the Bulgarian National Union (bnu) in 2007.
Many Roma disorders which burst in an area of Sofia (kraszna poljana) are at the origin of the Constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
Taking advantage of these events, bnu decided to constitute a guard saying that the organization is national self-defence ".
According to them, these 17 years, Romany "terrorized" Bulgaria but state remained inactive and neutral, recalls the political capital.
It added that initiative had aroused lively debate in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the declaration of certain organizations Roma Bulgarian concerning their own guard a resistance announces the risk of ethnic clashes.
The operation of the Hungarian guard showing similarities with the Bulgarian national excluded that Roma the Hungarian react in the same way by their own self-defence, can read in the risk warning of political capital.
At the request of news agency, Attila juhász telegraph to search for political capital, said: the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, risk analysis is published every year and events occurred which could have an impact on the risk they inform public opinion, as in this case, publishing a warning.
The is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the days of, and of the current, it became reorganize working days which will reduce the next year.

It is true that we pay the price of the weekend prolonged working or leaving school on Saturday at the weekend preceding extended.
For years, the Minister for Labour rules in a regulation on the days of the preceding days or following the.
The law extends to every all employers and employees, the workers and the people working in the public service.
It is not however to service companies, turning the institutions without interruption and operation, by their vocation, and also for the rest days.
This year, working days will be modified only around of the end of year: from 24 December, life is much in practically every country because the experiences that the majority of people made rather overtime or take holidays they saved in these aims to spend days between Christmas and the new year's day.
Next year many fetes fall in the medium or at the weekend, so there will be fewer changes in working days compared with this year.

However, next year, the end of year announced under the sign of the bus from 24 December, everyone will have a break nonstop if the same day of the grave on Wednesday.
Six futile things which can embeter terrifically
E-mails that we forget, send messages that we receive, innocent lies that we almost more: these are things "embellish" it a place of work.
The question is whether it has used these troubles or one raises the challenge and it avoids the ambiguous situations consciously, causing problems.
Examples.
"I, I forgot to say to you that you called service marketing, you said a colleague.
You missed a date?
At best it is sorry and tries to help calling for their marketing service that he forgot the (this is the least common resolution).
In the majority of cases, the thing is arranged with excuses.
Before having painful explanations, it is useful to think how you will be able to talk about the unpleasant moments with your colleagues and to make efforts to prevent.

Do not make troubles with your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you will not work or as something which would oblige you can do is to stay at home, do not forget to tell your leader and your colleagues to prevent their being surprised at your lack the following.
Humming, sniggering, telephone
You in your work but snigger you in your extracts brutally?
You became, without wanting to see a discussion, by telephone is that you would not listen?
Do not disturb your colleagues with humming, humming, discussions have high (voice that you above their Tete, beatings, big words or expressed a high.
They can disturb same if your colleagues are not plunged into a project (drafting, design, organization.

If you want to respond to the expectations, you are not more interesting
They advance slowly in the usual Cork morning.
Suddenly, a special melody heard the radio: the voice of a violin has that electronic effects.
I take up his.
Music changes rhythm and the low manages to accompany the tone by all now, then a female comes to join as a true jewel.
Mr2 diffuse the song wings of zagar.
The Hungarian musical not spoil us for a long time with electronic pop.
However, now it appears that the Cork alters if you listen to the new album of zagar.
It yonderboi, some interesting new productions born numerical Hungarian start has little by little to change the overall picture and, in spite of the new method of rock garage tearing the Hungarian, proves that there is again under the sun.
Balázszságer arrived from pécs and played itself in the Group of yonderboi before it launches in its own way, perhaps because there is no place for two feet in the same shoe ".
Its project (zagar) and music, one of alloy jazz, electronic and pop music, has started to be known when one has entrusted the composition of filmed (for example
The török Ferenc season.
The working initially in small clubs began known by public when the magazine wan2 quoted their first album of 2002 among the most important market disks and Hungarian proclaimed zagar, with yonderboi, almost the only creators of the Hungarian competitive so that the West.
Zagar and his group became unquestionably "trendy" but nobody asked whether they wanted to carry this label.
The group has reacted properly, it out a new and better disc.
The entitled cannot walk out, instead, can open new ways for them, although title wishes to represent a continuity with the years has pécs.
It is that it was a line of the Group of pécs of balázszságer.
We are well with the reference to the flight but next air music appears, according to the spirit and the time, stronger, impact of rock and roll.
Ligeti György singer in England, working with the group the jigsaw, showed his talent in these songs during the first of the millennium to park.
On the, a true tube for radio broadcasting, mr2 petõfi, recently popular music from morning till night, has started to introduce the wings of recorded with six Hungarian singers "(divas").
Good therefore (?).
Hvg.hu raised questions has balázszságer.
Hvg.hu: this new tube leads me to ask a question: your music remain a music for certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: the music for certain layer is not great.
For me there are two classes in music; not or underground, alternate or pop music but and music.
The alternative was saying, underground can also poor and made only to sell and thus become commercial.
However, a pop song can also.
The attitude of reception works in this spirit also independently of the language or the borders.
Hvg.hu: do you see a difference between the Hungarian public and foreign, some are more open in your music?
Zs.b.: abroad, especially the West music has older traditions.
People go to the concerts and not only young people or ten years but also the oldest.
They follow with much more changes in music, because they think that it also forms part of the contemporary culture.
Hvg.hu: what is the role of the public in your work?
You are interested to know which, and how many people listen to your music?
Zs.b.: I am of course glad to see that people are increasingly has our concerts.
However we never made to music.
For us the music is not made to achieve a goal but for a reason.
The role of the public is more important in concerts or mutual influence works déja but it is perceived as changes in the elusive.
However, I noticed that you wanted to respond to the expectations of the public, you will not be more interesting.
Hvg.hu: do you intend to follow the example of yonderboi?
It only works and made career rather the West.
Zs.b.: we really do not follow the path if sometimes try to find some traces in our music.
We are rather team players that have confidence in the presence of musical and let it themselves.
Initially, it was inevitable that on our music is compared with that of yonderboi because we have several down and taking another way.
Hvg.hu: on the palmares of mr2, petõfi wings occupy the place.
Many people have heard the zagar for the first time by means of this song.
With this more popular style you opened consciously towards a broader layer?
Zs.b.: we did not foresee the Tube to sell disc.
This means more song.
We wanted to the final to soften the sound orgy and more difficult themes in the whole disc.
Hvg.hu: how did you choose six singers?
Why they - which was the hot line?
Zs.b.: the idea was to have a kind of.
We have had a good deal of this society soloists of the Hungarian musical.
Thus society was composed the six Members, namely sena, edina kutzora, bori péterfy, enikõ hodosi neo '], németh, that they then underground divas.
Hvg.hu: you wanted this song like this or girls changed little?
Zs.b.: this piece déja was instrumental in a long and then when we made up the, we thought it still missed something this song.
Following agreements attracted song voice.
I have sung the night the tone that girls learned later.
I had almost immediately and everything was spontaneous.
I remember that I galvanized at the time but quite sure we needed divas.
With my voice it would not have been the same.
Hvg.hu: on the disk together and it also seemed to me that the girls were in.
There is no solo (except a solo short of jay), they have not only role, they sing together and they do not sing stronger than music, therefore music does that accompany the song.
They were derriere on the scene.
It is required?
Zs.b.: they were in plan is only a technical.
On the other hand, which was voluntary is that we did not want to distribute's roles.
The song says that we must forget our ego a bit, forget that comes from, or will be, or just leave that these wings, love wings, we take.
I wanted the others also feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song is born.
Hvg.hu songs: why did you work more?
Zs.b.: in actual fact, according to the process of musical creation, we had more difficult pieces during mixture.
For example, with dorian Gray's dilemma, or I play a grand together, or with the girls, or to the groove did not want to work for a long time, and then, gradually, set itself up as a puzzle.
What is your hvg.hu: one on the new album?
Zs.b. changes: this time with the concerts and because I déja "released this disc."
At present, they are taught, escape from the earth and never the same.
The perfidious risked billion because of its inferiority complex
A smuggler secretive.
Thus refers to its former used the French giant, the owner of the Czech bank banka.
The Bank has lost because of nearly five billion euros.
Now it seems rather than kerviel is a big player who wanted equal colleagues and which, moreover, would not be considered as incompetent.
Contrary to all the big houses of bank, it recognized time today mortgages.
"It is fragile," implied superiors, who denounced the police.
However, if we stick to the deposition of kerviel brought by the media, which the French, the transactions of this man produced at the end of last year a profit rising to 1.6 billion euros.
The crisis is the United States
"what I wanted, to earn money for my bank, asserts in deposition.
Last summer, it succeeded in using American crisis to gain a half billion euros.
In fact, it felt the time from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that mortgages sub-premium said "," given to customers with low income or those who had met the difficulties of reimbursement, would have problems.
But this should not influence the whole economy.
Kerviel did not believe and it well.
So, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to 1.6 billion euros.
"I gained from my first half billion, I did not know how to announce, entrusts it and adds nothing, of course, kept for itself.
In all the interrogation, it had to have distorted the reports to be identified.
It succeeded fooling superiors, although the started to its transactions.
That risks nothing has anything
Did it to be found?
Rather not.
"I considered that the mere fact of having obtained 1.6 billion for the Bank would satisfy them.
That is a risk if large?
It reached as that.
It had started working with the general in 2000 after finished at the University of Lyon.
Its annual salary revolved around 51 thousand dollars.
Two years later, it was already assistant of trador and, in 2005, it became independent with annual salary 90 thousand dollars.
However, he knew that he would never as others.
"from my first discussion in 2005, I knew that I was considered much less than the others.
With regard to my university programme and of course my personal and professional, specified the investigators.
However, after its coming into office, it gains its first great success.
Thanks to the Allianz actions, it won a half billion euros betting on down this way during the attacks in London.
And the mechanism was released - it wanted.
As you, they leave you in peace
It was as "snowball", he says the officers.
But above all knew, or rather, they suspected it.
", as I made pretence close their eyes.
However, while the beginning of the year.
It loses a billion euros.
In mid-January, after the weekend, it decides to conceal the sum.
On Monday, when it comes to employment, it is used more bank.

The Court has confirmed the death of 20 years in prison for the former President of Nicaragua
The Court of Appeal of confirmed Thursday to 20 years in prison for the former President of the country Arnold Alemán, which was sentenced in 2003 for a fraud 100 million dollars (almost 1.8 billion Crowns).
However, later he was released and lived assigned to residence in his Hacienda near the capital of.
If the former head of state, this office between 1997 and 2002, or will not again encarcéré is, after the AP, clear.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal ileana Pérez, will now depend agents, or they will leave aleman finish his home, or go again in prison.
There are four years, the Court has proved that Alemán regularly moved towards government money by foreign companies in Panama.
It is a matter of companies and the accounts were actually members of his family and his supporters.
Some of this money goes to the funds which Alemán was created to finance the election campaign in 2001.
The budget was adopted
It is thus.
The State budget has been adopted.
What this exceptional?
It is the first budget designed by the government and accepted by the government majority and the opposition supports.
For one year has passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - since the Minister who had prepared and could not afford to.
Unlike agitated debate before the vote of the declaration of mistrust, at this time, nothing dramatic.
Parliament has adopted without any problem this law which, although more influential, is usually neglected.
This is a paradox.
They want, each chapter and every item is the beginning and the end of any government.
The budget is constituent part of the policy, though concealed behind the strength competition between government and opposition.
It is more attractive media and it is for that that gives more attention in the media.
The arguments politicians interest much more opinion the abrupt.
The national budgets of the last three Socialist governments are wrong that the present budget is not ready to regulate at once.
The first part is the mandate granted to the costs imposed by law, consisted not only by retirement, but also the social contributions, adopted last year by the coalition "by" gathering and parties.
The second is a poor, the first consequence.
The third obstacle, is constituted by the deficit of public finances, i.e. by the deficit towns and villages.
However, it is not the deficit of the state budget that represents the greatest risk.
This is public and relatively under control.
The true time bomb, the deficit of cities and towns.
Many mayors, often issued stunned, involving in debt, their municipalities, in order to save money coming taxes, tax laws and credit bank, new sources of investment.
In past years, they succeeded in these debts off by the sale of mass distribution systems, in particular those of energy, obtained within the framework of a state.
Today, they have more this souce.
If we stick to the only official and verifiable facts, that:
Our economy already crosses for several years, like the rest of the world, a phase of growth and is not just some.
It was a unique opportunity for successive regularize this part of public finances.
Now, instead, they state.
Other countries put aside some exceptions as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, managed their business in a much more reasonable than our Republic.
It is a shame that falls primarily monstrous governments.
We are part of the country which, in total, are threatened by poverty.
We have no need of massive social plans which, precisely in recent years, unfortunately unnecessarily.
Although they succeed in eliminating some absurd populist expenditure, approved last year before the elections, if a shift of the age limit for retirement, as a reform of the pension system will not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in that country and whoever is in power, it will manage that.
While, one can say that the politicians will become bureaucrats in distributing the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
This is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism which makes the ordinary expenses are rejected by the expenses.
The deficit of 70 billion scheduled for 2008 will be useless if the previous governments had not dispelled all the money that they could.
If we really do not want that policies in power become simple bureaucrats, we must be patient and to grant this fragile governmental coalition, aware that the state cannot spend the equivalent of what happens to take in taxes and tax laws, peace and the new laws of reform.
It is that which will make it possible to reach a balanced state budget progressively.

Banks want to regulate crisis
The American Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks English, Switzerland and Canadian decided to fight at the heart of the financial markets.

The joint action of the central banks has reduced the probability of the US from 65% to 50%, adds baumohl in his report.
The banks have already lost 60 billion dollars because loans reimbursed, especially the United States.
The analysts await further losses billion.
"if the banks have chosen this step is that they must really understand what can still be" said the chief economist of ABN AMRO Davies.
'It appears that the situation is bad, it adds.
The central banks fear that, if the banks will have a difficult access to loans, they will be more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge us in a recession that can influence the economic growth.
The banks have made this choice after they failed to lower the rate of London, called libor, used to take on the market.
This meant that the banks always feared the mutual loans, although the banks American, Canadian and English decreased on several occasions during the autumn, interest rates.
"it will have the same effect as a lower interest rates, to the Agency Reuters Greg salvaggio Tempus consulting company.
Certain analysts do not believe that the Central Bank will not contribute to avert the crisis, since it does not regulate the main problem is that the US market.

Klaus said that it is not a, it nevertheless, in his opinion, enough provisions to write a book.
It is indeed a Academician able to follow and appreciate scientific treaties, the practice of statistics and it is also an economist.
The major conclusions of the book, according to him, the following theses: the climate is changing, constantly changing this are therefore normal, there is a view shared by all research on the effects of global warming, the current changes are not too high or too serious, they do not represent any danger whatsoever and, finally, the efforts to influence climate change are useless, inefficient and expensive.
More especially as having a totalitarian system, as unacceptable to impose opinions on the other, what it feels like a dangerous attack on freedom.
In answer to the questions of those present, he explained on several occasions that it was not against a reasonable protection of the environment, but against a fundamentalist which does not take into account the relationship between the costs and benefits that they bring.
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken about this subject two months ago, Hayek Institute.

The test Peugeot 207 sw 1.6 vti prejudice.
To tell the truth, I have never been a great fan of Peugeot 206.
His qualities of bearing were nothing extraordinary, the quality of the gears, control and also that of manufacture could, in many ways, be described.
However, it is in its successor Peugeot 207, which is clearly better.
Especially since the named sw still goes a step further, it only remains to me to reflect.
When I tested the traditional of Peugeot 207 I for example space for the head on the seats.
While there finished complaints because the body means that even the great fellows will, in this respect, comfortably.
Let us see quickly made
I recall very quickly within the not too much.
It is an almost successful design, my only remark concerning the central which seems to me.
Here, I would have liked a little more inventive design, given that the car if elegant.
The seats are comfortable and when they could complain seats or too short files is completed.
The guidance also clearly improved compared to 206 model.
As for space, the dimensions of the body is sensitive there too.
The end is the lack of above the already mentioned.
A trunk in it
The most important on the vehicle is therefore hissoutte to luggage.
I must evaluate this as well - also accessible via the ice back) and a rather easy.
The blind areas are provided with bands of which constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not cumbersome and can be spread all being able to hold asez heavy objects.
But let us to.
This fact, 428 pictures, in the shape, which is in relation to competition rather a figure.
From the škoda combi, vehicle more sold this category in Czech.
If one compares the 207 sw with the new generation of mlada Boleslav product, that Peugeot remains very significantly behind, the difference being 52 litres.
When it comes to leave abroad or in charge poussette, this figure is almost critical.
But if I were to emphasize the advantages, I would mention the case of remaining after the inversion of the files of perfectly right back, or a very low.
120 horses divided into four cylinders
We have tested the car that was equipped with a Otto engine of four cylinders China 1.6 and the power of 88 KW.
In actual fact, and it is to that that should look a 1.6 which go a family.
It is silent, consume little and, especially, it grows.
If I compare with the equivalent produced by? which often gives the impression of having a pot blocked by a serpillère, then I can be as enthusiastic.
Let the tariffs
The price of vehicle is accessible to all.
However, we must be aware that they drive out rather well equipped, interior and a very good.
The price of a motor vehicle with Otto 1.4 litres coming to 329 900 is still acceptable.
We have tested the vehicle costs from 410 900, which is already enough.
The equipment, also tested, increase the price of 80 000.
However, we have laid out in more airbags, an automatic air-conditioning, automatic, an automatic control of the rear windows...
In reality, the vehicle is eventually 531 900.
This is a lot, but try to add the additional equipment and you will obtain a very similar figure.
It is therefore only to choose the mark.
The integration of the Slovak pupils in schools goes badly
The number of children originating from the countries of Eastern Europe in schools is growing, which causes with the concerns about the evolution of education.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans itself, for the moment, with a series of obstacles.
Schools note even if conflicts between immigrants and descendants of origin are transformed into violence.
The case of Kent, where start increasing conflicts and immigrants opponents of Slovak illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Europe.
The arguments, baffle and fights between students are transposed in the relations between the parents.
The situation has gone so far as police arrested in chatham a Slovak woman who struck with an iron bar a student ten years.
The culprit maintaining defends the boy was insulted it by rasistes.
The police must also intervene following the attack on the Slovak immigrant led by two adolescents.
The girls were addressed to this man racist remarks and had raised.
"when they returned home, a young climbed cessation of bus and spit began.
When I told him to stop, he answered by apples and pears and then it discovered the backside ", represented another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are formulated by both parties.
The remaining even qualify conflicts with the immigrants fight for survival.
The cases mentioned above testify that the atmosphere in schools between the inhabitants of the immigrants and starts to be tightened.
Seven thousand Slovak come to find work are recorded in Great Britain.
And approximately 30 thousand students attend the Slovak schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island Caribbean
For visitors, it really is an island of freedom.
You await your leave can be carried out if you make a choice.
Beaches and white as snow, high waves or calm sea as a pond.
The and the inclusive all with in giving you on the beach a pizza, ice or cocktails.
The kitesurfing, Golf and roulette.
On the islands of the sea of caraîbes, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
However, there is only one island on which you will find even more and Cuba, the greatest and most beautiful island of greater Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been bastion of invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus described as the most beautiful place that human eye never seen.
Havana became store to transfer the treasures the Spaniards had stolen and transported in Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Nacional was established at the very beginning of 20 years.
It is Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the mafia, who has been built, since all that was a crime - especially in the USA prohibition was accepted and supported in Cuba: drug, games of chance, prostitution.
Among its customers, there was, among others.
Winston Churchill, ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, buildings and grew up in cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 'last century, were the boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco of Paula, close to Havana, and, in cojímar, its yacht.
The stars of the showbusiness and politicians of the entire left their signatures on the walls of bodeguita del Medio.
And today?
You can leave yourself your autograph on the walls of bodeguita Havana.
In the bar of the hotel Nacional, a luxury, you the cocktail of your choice.
And these cars worship always circulates in Havana, since jigoulis and past imported Fiats already long, so a wet and salt.
Although the Havana, especially the oldest, roughly, decrepit nullepart elsewhere in the vicinity there as much monuments colonial splendid there is precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, Trinidad.
Given that tourism brings money if necessary, its development in the green light.
During the last fifteen years, again, did not only in Havana, but especially in varader, on the coast of the province, and also on the small islands such as cayo Coco, cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba is a fancy which is unique in the world and that especially appreciated by amateurs small trains.
The cane had returned from the vast plantations in sweets on a narrow way by small trains and steam engine.
Their travelling material was not renewed for decades and thus one can see on small engines which contemporaries are only in museums elsewhere.
To direct its?
The majority of visitors is not the most well-known places.
There is therefore no need for writing about varadero or in Havana.
If you say that the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and as someone who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The valley of the island is one of the most gauged.
A vegetation grows on a calcium ground.
Mogotes, experimentation and rocks zoom in the valley, and the fertile ground in their being taken, even its rocks are covered a very dense vegetable carpet.
The valley is the place where they probably cultivate tobacco Cuban of better quality.
You will be able to meet the final shape of this product if you visit some of the factories of cigars in Havana.
Perhaps someone will find that it is also interesting that there was turned the episode of major Zeman.
How
Old City based shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It is the trade slaves and that sugar which brought fame and wealth.
The wealth embodied in the beauty and the character of this city of reduced size.
Will koloniální? pan ovlivnná architektura, výrazn? ovlivn? ná.
How, situated between the sea and solid mass escambray is to point out of the way in which the Fifties' last century, there was no way that link this area with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed to stay.
Nothing was built, and this is why they do nothing either, are satisfied to have a roof over the head.
If they have, how, more than one afternoon, it makes sense to see also places in the vicinity, such as the beach playa ancón or the valley of sweets.
Then, the night, custom going to música which itself down after the sun and where music is only in early morning.
Baracoa
Some refer this town situated extremely Cuba is more beautiful island.
This opinion is probably already influenced by the way that leads.
Both roads which lead for Guantánamo must overcome high and mountains and cross marks a landscape almost without human activity.
UNESCO registered the shelf of Cuba, with its landscape intact, on the world heritage list.
It produces the best chocolate, the Church, the Cross of Christopher Columbus - indeed, it was almost a hundred years after the journey of Columbus) and since the hill where is the former and current castle-extremely hotel El Castillo, several counts mountains, the most famous is El yunque.
On the subject of coffee, rum, cigars, solid mass Sierra, picture of sows and island Isla de pinos, cabaret Tropicana, from the Saint of Cuba caridad del cobre, santeria, African religions practised by the descendants of slaves, about all that they could fill quantity of pages.
Only, as they say, precisely to see.
In Afghanistan, the friends are the Americans say,
The lack of soldiers and equipment necessary influences, according to us, on the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.

NATO countries have approximately 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, which nearly a quarter in the South.
However, the United States, have reached their absolute limit and the organization and the equipment of troops.
Concretely, they ask other helicopters, soldiers and experts to drive of the troops.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete objectives for the coming period, as on ways how achieving", said gates.
The Secretary-General of NATO de Hoop held today similar.
"I am not happy with what we have on the ground and in Afghanistan.
We almost Ninety percent soldiers and equipment that we would need, and that is not enough, "said Hoop Reuters agency in the talks with the Japanese Government in Tokyo which lasted three days.
That is passive
These last months also reign between countries involved in conflicts concerning the question whether the really make every effort in Afghanistan.
For example Germany has been criticized for passivity.
"the Germans have a relatively numerous representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, the requirements of which they are subjects are not as strict as those in the south and east of the country where we operate, "said gates.
The tabloid britanique sun this week the German soldiers lazy.
"The Afghan discovered: German play, while ours fight", sun in a written document supplemented by photographs of German soldiers playing the table.
The German newspaper Bild passed the counter-attack publishing the photograph of troops during a game of rugby in the southern part of Afghanistan.

It now compared to court in Khartoum to have named a becomes bear
British teaching judged in Sudan to insult to Thursday evening was condemned by a court of Khartoum to 15 days of prison and expulsion, indicated his lawyer.
The British was accused of having let students from 6 to 7 years give the name of Mohammed to bear becomes while any representation of the prophet of Islam is illicit.
It was a punishable by death whippings.
This British teacher 54 years according to the high school Khartoum in Sudan, was arrested on Sunday and place it on Islam and insurrection, under the terms of Article 125 of the Sudanese penal code, following several complaints from parents of pupils of the Ministry of Education Sudan.
The actually goes back in September, when this teaching asks its students, 6 and 7 years, to choose a name for becomes bear class.
"eight names out of his mouth children, whose Hassan, Abdullah, Mohammed and tell the Robert boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class children have 20, 23 chooses Mohamed as preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the prophet Muslim, but especially to name a very common in Sudan.
Children have carried out a book for a photo with bear followed; "my name is Mohamed".
The bear any label - with this name, but the problem is simply that the presentation of the prophet considered as an insult to Islam.
The Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, teaching in the same school in Sudan, said that he knew well and that it would never done anything that can be insulting to a religious faith, I regret that she asks the right of children to a name, it is claimed that a "innocent error.
Opinion shared by many students from the teacher who described as "very attentive to its students" and "who speaks religion in class.
Let us recall that the name Mohamed is also the second name more given in Great Britain, he wrote English 14 different ways.
This often chooses to name the Muslim families is a way of honouring the prophet (often given the first child of a family.
But what are the rules concerning the use of this name?
That can give a toy?
It is of course a matter of interpretation.
They are not Wednesday reach an agreement on the future status of the province, during the last session of negotiations in Vienna.

A risky exit which accumulated records because of its duration, remoteness of modules, the speed with which it has been imagined tools "," fixed by the astronauts to perform repair.
The problem was Tuesday while astronauts had offloaded the shuttle the unit, a big part with soon receiving the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see supervised).
This unit is a sort of for the quay.
But it must be able to be.
The task of the crew was therefore move a unit of production of electricity by panels 17.5 weighing tons, already present on simple percentages, to put to post on its final position.
After moving, crew started the redeployment of solar panels of unit with a scale of 76 meters.
And this is where the signs, which are as accordions, has been damaged on nearly a metre by cable which has jammed.
The deployment has been stopped not damage the panel.

The former Prime Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the President of the government and the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be at the top of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party in Toledo for the next general election and be President of Congress if the Socialists will win the general elections.
The Secretary of the Spanish Socialist Party, Blanco and Bono himself announced for a press conference after the meeting which took place at midday on federal it with Zapatero.
The chief executive justified the offer made to the former Prime Minister because 'it is important in the best "in political life and Bono is among the best.
Furthermore, it stressed that "yes" it seems that politician channel the candidate of the Socialist Group who will chair the conference if the Socialists will win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of the conference, which he made public on 15 November last its decision not to come in prochainess general elections and to abandon his political career to devote itself to the fight against climate change in the university framework.
The former prime minister admitted that the President of the government has not stopped insisting that it comes back in the vanguard policy since he left it two years ago.
Furthermore, it pointed out that, even if the citizens already know that the economic Vice-President if the Spanish Socialist Party wins elections, his party wanted to announce that who will chair the conference, a "transparency act.
If it affects the Bono, hopes to transform the room in a House respect and insult or cry "and that" it is increasingly citizens ".

A climatic propaganda
Since the movement against climate change subjects to persecution without both predictions of the sceptics who gives priority to other political and social battles, it must show an iron coherence.
This is particularly the case for a movement leader who is President Zapatero government and believes that it is more important than that of Islamic terrorism and even proposes to sign a new contract "the world".
This makes it explain why action or inaction, its government contributed in a decisive manner that Spain is the head of the European Union in the Kyoto protocols.
The representatives of the sectors, in which it occurred and his government, that of the contract with the planet, not avoided.
Moreover, it must be clear to the Spanish what measures it will take to slow down climate change.
Which businesses will be affected, practices which citizens will have to be changed, which individual and collective energy savings will be obliged us to do, what economic consequences that will cause.
In other words, who sacrifice and pay to save the planet.
But there was, and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it is being sacrificed and pay.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening the accounts for companies and individuals.
So the remarkable suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party has seemed so dangerous to Zapatero it hastened to deny.
It is that it is a question of saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With sentences which impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, Mr so useful to election campaigns which do not reports, and which does not demand, the meetings and inspires kindness.
Provided that it is limited only to be purely virtual contracting parties and which does not claim that we move in the bicycle or we with the range.

What assurance is it appropriate to me?
The car insurance, which covers the driver in view of possible accidents, which will mean an important various factors such as age, sex, seniority of driving licence, marital status, to ensure the vehicle type or the use they make, among others.
A car is the principal.
There are, escoger El Seguro automóvil adecuado are incluso Más difícil that elegir El modelo of vehículo.
And it is a car insurance, is even more difficult than in the vehicle.
The car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise materializes by an insurance policy, which establishes that the company receives the premium value and it is granted to the obligation to pay compensation in the event of disaster.
The premium is the cost of insurance, which is established by taking account of various factors such as age, sex, seniority of driving licence, marital status, to ensure the vehicle type or the usageque one fact, among others.
The insurance companies establish their prices according to the statistics, so that the probability of an accident is the dimension to pay is high.
It is for this reason that the 25 years and women must pay lower premiums, since the statistics show that these have a persones disasters of their caution.
Similarly, using inventories, companies have concluded that the married people tend to have fewer accidents that single drivers.
The use they make of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thus the probability of an accident.
Increasing frequency likelihood increase.
They are many variables that insurers take into account at the premium price.
It is this that the driver must study the situation to choose the car insurance which adapts better to its profile.
We shall display the most significant variables here at choose one or other type of insurance, so that, by adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, it offers a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 must deal with various drawbacks at passing a contract with an assurance at an accessible price, as can be weak in behaviour and seniority of driving licences.
Although the ideal to be assured of a health risk to other more economic options exist.
The most far-sighted drivers can opt for a comprehensive insurance with frankness, so that they obtain the covers an assurance to any risk but a more accessible price.
This Convention that the customer pay part of the amount of the disaster.
"the amount of the disaster that the customer towards will be established according to the value of the premium, which will be higher than the amount will be weak, specifies Luis Noguera, responsible in Spain of first mediator Europa, insurance online.
Another option is enlarged to third insurance, so that the customer ensures protection to face damage caused to third, but for those caused by its own car.
Furthermore, it would be covered on the flight, fires and vehicle loss.
A Council.
If you are minor 25 years to be careful and to avoid accidents as much as possible, since that will affect the improvement, being able to reduce the cost of insurance.
An improvement is a reduction of the standard rate that the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase of the standard rate.
"premiums and sanctions will depend on the company and profit.
If the company had a good year can be allowed to increase premiums, clarifies Noguera.
Beyond 25 years it becomes easier to drivers at passing a contract with an assurance, since the rate of accidents is the accumulated experience.
It is for this reason that it is preferable to a comprehensive insurance with frankness.
"normally young cannot benefit from the previous experience acquired after an accident, ensures the European company in Spain and add that most accidents occur during the second year, once last 'fear of novice'.
However, if the customer is married but has not yet children it is preferable that it negotiates at any risk insurance, momento that its economic situation allows.
The child marriages are considered by the insurers as those with the lowest rate of disasters, increases will be weaker.
In this case the best assurance would be an assurance at all with frankness - could be 300 Euros), or an assurance to third widened from the third year of the vehicle assured has a high level of improvement.
"they have a more relaxed and a greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of accepting a larger quantity of frankness, judge Luis Noguera.
For retired insurance at all with frankness is preferable (being this euro 150), or to third asurance widened when the insurer has a high level of improvement.
It must be said that the car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver to possible disasters, but also because it represents an important expenditure, that is why it is fundamental to study properly the assurance that suits us more our personal situation.

The Russian gas supply is a quarter of the European Union.

The climate of Venus could be the future of the earth.
Scientists have said yesterday that Venus was indeed a pleasant planet to live.
The data coming from the European vessel into orbit showed that the planet is twice the small, contrary to what we thought beforehand.
Venus close the planet Earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits Venus, well that is closer to the sun.
Scientists now believe that billion years Venus, could have had similar conditions on the ground, and could even have been living.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion in solar expulsions at a slower rotation Venus led to a different kind of development.
Today the planet is deprived of water, devastated by hurricanes and storms of lightning and has a surface temperature warm enough to melt lead.
The findings of the express come, the European Space Agency, which has studied the planet for one year, offers a sad vision of the future potential of the disastrous changes due to the climate.
At the department of physics of Fred Oxford University, moreover, one of the leaders of the mission of come express, said: "we begin to understand why the Venus climate is so different from that of the earth, although they are practically planets in very similar.
"our new data enable us to establish a scenario in which the billions Venus, originally would have been the same as can be even with a living space.
Enriched uranium confined by the police.

Still open to all
Mitt romney said not to be as candidate for the Presidency, to answer the questions of a fellow of snow.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidates for the Presidency finally accepted the debate you tube, during which many ordinary voters registered with their questions, subject to the candidates.
Wednesday 28 November evening, no questions asked not as ridiculous that one after another debate you tube, when a fellow of snow asked the Democrats their position in relation to global warming.
But this time, questions and answers reflected the Republican Party candidate for the next elections.
One does not know on what criteria, the producers of CNN, which sponsored debate, chose the Tube videos of you to show the candidates candidates.
The first half hour of debate, the longest approaching a theme, focused on immigration.
The subject is a subject close to the Republicans.
CNN asked some voters telephone when they would hear pleasant things: control raised increases approval when the candidates expressed a crude.
The hardest exchange and the evening was between rudy Giuliani, leader of the National Front, and Mr contrite which is important in elections to iowa and new Hampshire.
Mr Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that it was accommodating about illegal immigration at the office of mayor of New York.
It has attacked Mr contrite, showing the former governor of Massachusetts, using immigrants with him.
Both fighters became particularly fierce when they asked them if they are ready to promote amnésia "(secret giving a statute and the possibility of becoming citizen.
Minor candidates as Duncan hunter, Californian delegate, Tom tancredo, of Colorado, succeeded in depth.
Neither has the possibility of being elected, but both of them in the race, thanks to the fact that they have begun to fight immigration before and a more incisive than others.
Generally speaking, the candidates, concerning immigration, the same opinions: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for immigrants.
This, combined with anxiety caused in particular by the business of toxic toys produced in China, or other fears to the external world, to support the Republicans, or to the divisions of the Catholic libertarians and conservatives.
But the debate has become particularly embarrassing when other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why it had previously supported the campaign for the control of weapons.
John McCain and Mr contrite discussed whether to put water in the nose should be considered as a torture.
One of the speakers asked whether the candidates believed in its entirety, the contents of the Bible.
That led Mr Giuliani dare to declare that the Bible is his book, even if it is not in the history of Jonas and whale.
Another speaker asked Jesus would have been in favour of the death penalty.
We expect to see ", huckabee - in pole position in iowa during a recent election, thanks to its Christian conservatism long - to declare that the death penalty is painful but necessary.
When you insisted whether Jesus would have been in favour, it is laughing and stated that Jesus is too smart to appear.
The human race is open to all.
The rise of Mr huckabee in iowa coincides with the recent extraordinary subsidy research carried out by the libertarian Ron Paul, whistling during the debates on Wednesday.
These two there are nothing, thanks to the fact that both protected Party are not able to agree to decide who is known for more and more traditionalist.
In 1980 and 2000, a unified the party and convincing manner with a message of success on the size and comparing the American leaders.
This time, it is divided and the result is clear.
The labour pains
Gordon Brown has discovered a hole in which to sink; even if he resigned, the situation will change.
The tendency of the British scandals, this is not particularly profitable.
Not sold decorations, nor of Parisian hotel bills of politicians, not sucked up marital extra.
But this is a revelation that makes a rich businessman would have hidden for four years under false names, its contributions to the current labour, equivalent to more than £$(1.3m), that it would not declared: new battle which Gordon Brown would well.
Two months ago, Prime Minister has backtracked in his election project, insulting the British intelligence stupidly proclaiming that public opinion does not influence the decision, it is hoped, offer a dense and efficient government.
On the contrary, such vince brilliant LEADER, the Liberal Democrat, declared that terrible Mr Brown is to Mr bean.
The purchase of northern rock, a bank in difficulty by the crack, showed a fault directives and a poor judgement in case of emergency.
The inadequate proposals in favour of shifting the tax code caused a coalition against industrial groups.
The loss of 25 million data on the tax authorities, revealed an administrative blunder.
A trio of generals in retirement launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against the reductions military expenditure: they proclaimed that defence minister, is a part-time employment.
At present, the suspicion squint from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the General Secretary of the Labour Party (and its former head of vigilance) that they had to resign.
That means that nothing brown inevitably moves towards the exit.
However governments can reach a point where it would be impossible.
People are politicians, and trust them, but in general leave their doubts quotation at a new government is in power.
It seems obvious that a Prime Minister can improve things, or even to control, the risks suspension public administration: no more; the offices of the Ministers; the report seeks bad news stories; and the government is on the defensive and without any more.
In a sense, the position of Mr Brown is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, it cannot be initial pride.
Although it would wish Tony Blair, it was really his superior lieutenant.
Problems relating to northern rock and tax data for example, are linked to decisions of Mr Brown when it was Chancellor British Treasury.
And even if it is not directly involved in the misfortunes of Blair, such long investigation into the funds of "cash for the Members of the House of Lords, people may think otherwise.
But the difficult situation that Mr. Brown is not so tragic that it seems.
The blunders are not so monstrous as Members of the Tories do.
As Mr bean, there is no victim and fraud.
And the remedy, although it may be to make the Stalinist tendencies of Mr Brown, always in favour of a reliable and brutal lightly.
The new political settlements on the scandal is a good example.
Mr Abrahams, a very particular character, which sees its donations to charity, said he wished no public recognition of its benevolence.
It can have its opinion, but is not to decide.
Laws against the anonymity of wholesale trades of the politicians are clear, and they exist for good reason: the public know that contributes to the success of those who govern the country.
Mr Watt, who declared to current plans to Mr Abrahams, without knowing that it was illegal, by consequence will be questioned, moreover, that jon mendlesohn some collections of subsidies which had talked about the dubious settlements in October.
But so far Brown is not involved: nothing suggests that it knows about these moves, most performed payments are made following on government in June.
So far the Prime Minister made half.
It is the fault of legislative, but it did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power rests on a knack that it well, recourse to a committee of inquiry on this subject from a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, the lesson to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law were scorned, it falls within the police force.
Moreover, there are other things that Mr Brown, must be such as to find a permanent President of the Committee of Independent standards of public life, LEADER for six months, and to prepare a good reform on financially political parties.
It would make the Labour Party, in a moment, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead to abandon its particular financial relationship with confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a partisan such Brown.
But it should face certain facts in favour.
The Conservatives now has an advantage for the elections; it is two years to recover the voters, and the only way to obtain a victory is demonstrating an irreproachable integrity and solid.
Swindles cards.
The crisis of mortgages contaminate the American market of credit cards?
When there is blood in water, it is normal that fins, whirl around.
Now that the US housing market in a critical phase, the predatory market aim of credit cards.
The analysts from goldman Sachs, losses linked to credit cards could reach $99 billion if the contagion extends to other forms of mortgage credit to the consumer.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in the expenses and insolvency, what measures the parts of the assessment, or which are more than 30 days.
Hsbc announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in appropriations to the consumer, partly because of the weakness of the card holders.
It is still too early to panic.
The expenses and are still moderate.
According to moody Agency, a tax, insolvency of 3,89% of troixième term is inferior almost a point in relation to its historical average.
The rate deterioration is partly explainable by technical factors.
A change in 2005 to the law, concerning personal bankruptcy caused an abrupt fall of files of bankruptcy, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of files (and therefore of insolvency) could increase if the conditions of loans to worsen.
The industry announced on fixed rates of payment, which highlight the sum of monthly debt that consumers must regulate.
And confidence in sureté of the capital of credit cards is strong enough for one other aspect of structured finance.
Dennis moroney of towergroup, a society of research, predicted that the volume of emission for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct links between the infection of crisis and market mortgage credit cards exist: consumers could certainly prefer to increase their debts that equitable real loans disappeared.
But the card transmitters pay more attention to the flow of species and the value of inheritance, and thus falling prices has inevitably led to a change in the credibility of the borrowers.
They might bring the advantages of transmitters credit.
The consumers for the payment of mortgages fall if ownership costs less than the value of the loan, by consequence, by credit card would become a priority to pay the whole again.
The transmitters card can respond much more rapidly than the ones and with more flexibility such crisis conditions, because they can change interest rates or alter the limits of rédit.
It should in theory to reduce the risk of having a quick return actions.
"We are not going to wake up one morning and re-examine all loans has declared Gary perlin, the one capital.
If a disaster of financial market credit cards is unlikely, there are strong risk having a consequent decrease.
If the lower prices and housing shrinkage in the credit market take us towards recession, industry will face a macabre.
Pay attention to the fins well.
The British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were going to manifest their roles in relation to fraud committed by the previous financial director, Mr Andrew fastow, changed their declaration, pleading guilty Wednesday.
Bermingham David, Giles darby and Gary mulgrew had initially declared innocent of seven charges for fraud supposed collusive in 2000, made by fastow in a secret financial fraud to become rich in spite of their employees.
They should appear in court in January.
But for an audience chaired by the American judge Ewing werlein jr, they all found guilty of having made a fraud.
The three former frameworks Greenwich natwest plc group, a subsidiary of the Royal bank of Scotland, became famous in Great Britain because of the extradition procedures which lasted two years.
The United States, their case is an outstanding question for this inquiry following the collapse of Enron in 2001.
Charges that were brought in 2002, made clear to fastow that it was the subject of the investigation of the collapse of Enron.
The charges against the bankers, called "three natwest 'have come to declare Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with fastow and his former right-hand man, Michael kopper.
Natwest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of a partner of Enron controlled by fastow, who was the director many fraudulent, who has helped it procedures of bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank was considered subsidiary interest for any, but as the three British men already its value.
A controlled by kopper bought the interest of the Bank of the subsidiary to £1 million.
The bankers paid $250,000 to kopper as interest in this society.
That shows, fastow would have announced to Enron energy society was willing to pay $20 million in natwest Greenwich for its actions in the subsidiary.
But in reality this $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, fastow and others.
According to the accusations, the bankers had obtained $7.3 while fastow, kopper and others would have gained $12.3 million.
In January 2004, fastow pleaded guilty for its active role in two conspiracies in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio was stopped after three months.
Fastow endures a six years imprisonment in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is imprisoned for three years and months in prison intexarkana.
The three British were released after the payment of a guarantee of $each, which oblige us to live in the process.

Skilling was sentenced to 24 years in prison.
The charges against lay for conspiracy, fraud and other offences were useless because of its death due to a heart attack.

But that is only a small change for certain Russians.

Not surgeon accepts suspected homicide in New Jersey
It was the day before thanksgiving when Ronald livingston looked at by the Bay of just restaurant has observed and an ambulance that had just stopped near the white Cape cod on the West avenue Scott.
Then the patrol police.
And then another.
"then I saw the medical vehicle stopping" Mr livingston, a restaurant, Wednesday.
This is where I realized that someone had died.
The authorities would learn then that person was a woman died 41 years old, Olga stream, assistant chief of police Newark department.
Researchers now try to determine whether the cause of death is carried out with a gesture by a cosmetic surgeon not approved, that the police have not yet identified, 212 resident in the West avenue Scott.
The authorities have not determine the causes of death on stream, but they are confident, the results of tests toxicological alas, that will take time, but which should help solve this mysterious death which saddened within the police Newark.
On stream was attending to police, Garry F Mc Carthy, since September 2006, and its voice was well-known in various departments.
It was honest, the worker and tough, Mr McCarthy said about on stream in a telephone interview, Wednesday.
"it was like a bull worse"
"it would have done everything to protect me"
Mr McCarthy said on stream was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Commission control of alcoholic beverages, and leaves two sons 11 and 14 years, as a daughter-in-law.
Eileen walsj, has the floor to speak of the Union, I romankow county Theodore declared that detectives tried to determine whether on stream died because of unauthorized surgical operation.
It is a possibility to consider.
The investigation continues.

It was embarrassing "
Everyone hopes that it will reduce the turmoil in the world market prices.
Actions are blown up on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that it would have tried to ease the conditions of credit, and later the interest rate promoted by soothing statements Vice President of the Central Bank.
The stock markets explode in London, New York and everywhere in Europe after Donald kohn, n ° 2 after well bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, declared that those who decide, must be flexible "and" pragmatic in their actions in the financial markets uneasy.
In an obvious effort to reassure those considering these new tensions linked to credit, Mr kohn declared that recent turbulence partly "reversed some improvements in the functioning of the market at the end of September and October.
If this hard turbulence should persist, that would increase the probability of a later rigidity of the financial conditions for the owners and firms, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that it is ready to inject new capital in the American markets and later reductions in the rate of interest can stabilize credit terms.
These remarks also allowed calm Wall Street with new even worse in the American economy, such as the biggest decrease of real sales for October.
Reflected this financial commotion has been accentuated following the declaration of bear stearns, investment bank, announcing that it will lay 650 people, i.e., 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs to compensate the heavy losses to the Paris losing loans.
Only 20 posts are envisaged in London where the bank uses 1500 people.
In New York, the average of industrial Dow Jones increased 331, or 2,55% deciding to 13.289,40 while the greatest, s P & 500, took 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index took 165,5 points is 2.7% deciding to 6306,2 adding more £39 of the value of the British companies.

Previously, the reappearance of difficulties in the financial markets was highlighted following the request for an auction sort monthly funds from the European Central Bank, which cut these loans in European commercial banks in heavy% rate, the highest since April 2001.
The pressures on the Bank of England to follow the EDF and the ECB and inject funds later in the stock markets causing credit tensions, have the sort of loans monthly "libor" the British banks, caused their higher growth since last September, at 6.59% after a strong increase from 12 November.
Britain faces a call to the sentence in relation to the criticisms of owais Shah and who bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one that also difficult.
That will be the beater N ° 6 for kandy England to this end, owais Shah or who?
And even more important in a broad context as the first test on Sri Lanka, which will make the decision?
The second question is important because graveney David, President of the selectors which was exceptionally to help moores leader, Peter Michael Vaughan trainer, and the captain, to take its decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, Director-General of England, starts to fill the application forms for becoming a national, at least part time.
That will not happen with the N ° 6 will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport is also.
It is never easy to overcome which allows a person to arrive at the top of his profession for another will never happen the lower level, sometimes luck by more than a lack of skill.
It is not only the cricket that selection, because in the end, the sentence is subjective.
Is the right moment to emerge?
It is just as Shah?
The same thing could be proposed in another context, to choose between John edwards tubby tubby? "or"; both new frameworks, having obtained good professional diplomas, should be promoted, but there is room for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketor unless at least gives a chance?
The figures are important in the decisions, but also opportunities.
In a team, a cricketor must catch the eye of the captain, it must take the door and a beater must be lucky to touch the day.
But the capture of sélecteurs more complicated.
Much better did last season, James Anderson that seemed to be the first test, Stephen harmison broke out in full, has continued to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-rate doors on 33 turns to win.
Chris tremlett took that 29 to the same, but both of them already glory moment to the level and to offer hope.
If that will be Shah or bopara will at that stage, that is a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build the career of a man, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth played in each test and successful in the first, with five and 40 turns, but it was collingwood Paul, which also fought to emerge, which could become the essential of test, and that, despite the fact that its marked a copy with Australia, can be considered as yet.
The likelihood is that, graveney Vaughan, and moores, after another debate after today's session stadium, will follow their Conservatives and will support the greatest experience of Shah against the exuberance of the young person.
Both have good arguments.
For Shah, its bright and considerable beginning in innings test of 88 cents in Bombay, 32 first-rate against six bopara for 22 years, which is seven years younger, and with its excellent classification.
But Shah fact that ten turns during his in May on the Caribbean during the Lord test, the city of middlesex player, and that the immediate rejection by the selectors when Vaughan again, claimed its place for the next game, seems to have upset his so evident in Bombay.
Contrary to the player of Essex is full of exuberance.
Nothing frightens in any cricket and exaggerated when he recently collapsed on a 4x4 during a presentation of Volkswagen, sponsor of England.
It is reported that light injuries, was shocked, but the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor on) and call Alastair Cook Member, which looked to ask him, "he 's view that?"
Bopara is by far the best beater running appearance, allow him to make services that will, and with the confidence and professionnality.
A fair man is, to choose the right moment is another.
Is this can be the art of selection?
I would be favourable to give a chance to bopara, that does not mean that Shah should not apply if such tea leaves it to suggest that this will end.
Buses bring back people at work, and to fight against Al Qaeda.
The first full bus refugees coming from Syria arrived at yesterday, pouring these exiles without money or renewals visa, or others still hope that the city found normality.
Some returned to fight against the activists who moved away from them.
The station of bus, even before the arrival of 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of buses of official government, the final was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
"I decided to go to Syria after they kill many doctors in baghdas has declared al-qubaisi Sabah, a doctor.
"I returned today because I have seen on the television and read in the newspapers which occurred to baghdâd and considering the city is sure now.
They say "the army to commit crimes!" he said, referring to the militia of the ecclesiastical militant who forced his move away for the moment.
Qassim Al atwani, teaching 38 years of the amariyah dominated by Sunni, returned with two children, because it could not to renew its aim and for the Iraqi regime prevents work.
Its neighbours with amariyah called to inform the militia helped us, driving away Al Qaeda from the west of the capital, and invited to return.
The newcomers Jordan is the leader of a tribe Sunni, Shia who had to leave their homes in the north of baghdâd by the grenade attack after it encourages people to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to return to fight.
Two days ago, some of my friends have called me and said to have a anti militia in sleikh, and they need me and my boys.
This is why I return "today" sabaah obeidi, 62.
Many say have attracted by the growing capital from the American troops have happened, and in view of the continuous training of groups of citizens involved "well armed and working with the American soldiers in their vicinity.
Others say but still be obliged to return because of the problem of visa and the decline of capital, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have escapes the years.
Salaam al-samarrai, 51 years, father of three children, expressed distrust felt by all about visas for nouri al-Maliki exiled that Prime Minister, who asked the government to limit to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people had escapes country because of the sectarian companies of death.
"We had no problem until al-Maliki comes to Syria and encourages the government does not give visas to Iraqi, to force them to return to Iraq" the Sunni pensioner.
"I cannot trust a government which supports the criminals who burned when I left my home.
The violence in part can be explained by the fact that have been driven out of the Shia and vice versa, places where tensions are less.
They fear that a sudden flow of refugees increases again sectarian tensions and bring back the fighting.
Small Saarland, good training.
The smallest federated state takes on training, and even shines through the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in a deficit on the, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I exliqué yesterday for the 50th at a time, not - that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federated state, posts, for his birthday.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a large part in the training of Saarland, that is placed in the fifth monitor the training of the European economy of Cologne.
Thus, by tradition, schools would cooperate closely with the neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in sarrebruck by French.
So far, the students have the possibility of ending their studies by a double and triple diploma.
The well high 15.6 percent of foreign students.
The Saar led but also children up to the upper schools in number higher than the average - many of them without a certificate of gymnasium.
"in Saarland, they use the system of vocational training, known as plünnecke, expert in training at iw.
More than one in five young obtains a study in training, thus Saar is more than seven points above the national average.
So the combination of academic and vocational training are relatively well developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the panel of double programme is the second best of Germany.
Despite a practical training and a growing, the number of diplomés engineering however fell by a third in recent years.
This is why the education of the forced schools higher than a marketing campaign in matters of the engineer.
"after the Pisa study, we celebrated many reforms in the general schools, known as a spokesman of the Ministry of Education.
The government has introduced in the federal state of tests.
So that the children begin to learn, last year crêche free is right - a model that meanwhile other federated States copy.
Only future comparative will show whether the performances improve a lasting.
The PISA study in 2003, at the risk of students is reduced from 29 to 20%.
However, the Saarland has not improved and other federated States.
The ones put through better.
And in spite of the great of knowledge, in foreign languages is not measured by the Pisa study - one could otherwise gain points in this field.
Because the language of neighbour is obligatory in colleges, if not of the French.
Rule watches.
In Venezuela, watches will soon make than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez will rise the half an hour in the country.
Meanwhile Chavez becomes a caricature in Spain.
As the Official Journal of Venezuela communicated, owing to a new law, watches will be regulated at least four and a half hours universal time.
In this way, it obtains a schedule that does not exist in any other.
Anti-American Chávez justified its inter alia by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world separation time zones in full hours.

The nationalist left announced that the Conservative Alvaro Uribe remained President of Colombia, we maintain relations or with the head of state, or with the Colombian Government.
"I cannot, only because of my dignity Chávez", said that a constitutional reform on which the citizens of oil will vote through referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly its power in the country.
The element of this argument was the decision to withdraw the Uribe Chávez brief about the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe "would face" spat in Venezuela with this decision had been Chávez Sunday.
Spain also Chávez is on everyone's lips.
A ring of mobile phone makes rage in the country: "por no callas you" why you do not) is the sentence that more than one million people on the Internet.
It has been pronounced by the King of Spain Juan Carlos who, at the most recent summit ibéro-américain, was by the constant questioning the populists of left and who said to shut up.
Real wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the situation, a prediction, a true threatens the German employees of this year.
Experts have quoted different reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
A calculation of the Foundation, the employees should be a real reduction in 2007 on their card pay compared to the previous year.
"The mistake is to low wage development, increasing the value added tax and price rises food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for macroeconomics and research on the situation, to the newspaper 'Bild ".
New expenses can also intervene on for the employee.
The Finance Minister peer Steinbrück said to the newspaper 'Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung' that the fall of the 3.3% for the new year was indeed correct and reasonable in the present situation.
However the Agency does not have the right to be in trouble to ask the Federation appropriations or financial assistance, the SPD politician of words.
Tuesday was known as the prices of foodstuffs and hydrocarbons had led inflation at its highest level since 13 years.
In total, prices have risen 3.0% a year.
The infernal Venus earth.
Despite its atmosphere hostile to life, Venus resembles the earth more than what was until now: the European space "come express" discovered flashes in the atmosphere and of the wind which, similar to those which appear in winter.
For almost three decades, the scientists assume that flashes on Venus.
The European "come express" today provided proof - it detected electromagnetic waves to limit the atmosphere: flashes on Venus burst at a height about 56 kilometres of all in all, brings back Christopher de the California in Los Angeles in the scientific journal 'natural'.
According to the famous cyprine, lightning had shown life on earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans which led to the formation of amino acids, stone by way of life.
This is not the case: "Venus life if there were, it must have been a very old date of history, explains Solomon" Carnegie institution ".
There should be no today living things to the surface Venus: the atmosphere is a hundred times denser on earth, it is sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus is perhaps the infernal earth, but it remains a twin", said russel.
That is why Venus, so the earth and mass dimensions, was hit by a different, as is the fundamental question of the mission.
The "come express" in November 2005 was a milestone in the research, since no probe was bound to the exploration of this planet for ninety years.
The opinion of scientists, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several articles "nature" not only underline the oddity of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the common ground with our neighbouring are more than initially expected.
Thus the found, in addition to the wind known to the North Pole, a pole of clouds the South, which is even more quickly.
The phenomenon of the drafts in the land hemispheres in winter, wrote a team of researchers around piccioni Istituto by Giuseppe Di spaziale e Italian.
The second of the solar almost the same mass that land and is, with a diameter of 12,100 measure the mileage, almost as great.
The qualified star of the evening or morning revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
It is however much more slowly on itself: a hard day 243 days land.
Although Venus, with temperatures in surface 460 degrees Celsius and 92 to bar, recalls the scientists assume that both were formed in similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated and remained on the ground in the form of oceans, but was lost in space on Venus.
And while the carbon dioxide settled on earth as carbonate, it constitutes Venus on most of the atmosphere.

Schäuble warns against riots as those of France.
Street battles with police raid, burning cars, Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots as those of France.
Everything must be implemented so that social dissatisfaction in Germany has burst in the streets, demanded by the German Interior Minister.
Barricades that burn, demonstrators who draw on the police with hunting guns: after the serious riots in France, the German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU fears a similar trend in Germany.
We must take care that an explosive social contitue not also to us and is defused by violence.
We must take this seriously, the Neue said "and" appeared in Hanover.
All young people do not manage to cope with its rapid social reality.
Russia, the federated states and villages already worked firmly to reduce Schäuble, said.
That would not only the integration of immigrants.
"summits of integration at conferences on Islam, it already has its first successes.
But it is still too early to an end of alarm.
Schäuble pointed out at the same time as the German suburbs, there are no problems or sociological of planning as in France.
In Paris of the North, young people were delivered to serious street battles with the police during the last nights.
Also in Toulouse, transport and public buildings burned.
Greater efforts of integration from the German Government, this is what the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan kolat.
Considering the riots in France, kolat warned against the effects of imitation. "
The situation in Germany would certainly not so explosive in France.
But there were still a need to act.
Kolat stresses the fact that the quota of young unemployed at below 25 years of immigration is higher than the average.
It is above all to ensure more training places.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective.
The President of the Turkish communities added but a social control in families more took place in Germany and France.
Many young people from immigration do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat urged: "We must really be careful.

In times of Angela Merkel.
The utopian entrance Chancellor shows that the alliance with the finished - and there is nothing more to expect from it.
In what country does this Chancellor exactly?
After a distressing in the general debate of the German Parliament, which was poor and content, is not here - in the country which should ultimately be governed by it.
The reproach to concentrate too much on policy was rejected by Angela Merkel a hard and presumptuous sentence.
It is provincial, she said and only shown, it is not what we want.
In Parliament, it has made visible of to what extent this criticism was correct.
There was no concrete interest or hardly feelings for the country to be felt.
Instead, Angela came as a cloud: a politician in weightlessness away, in foreign policy and even there remains in approximation.
For example: the climate protection in this matter, it congratulates again and again on the heiligendam, but does not say how the climate objectives will be achieved in our country.
Even the praise of himself, have as little modesty, leader of the CDU would still refused it two years ago.
Now she herself to all made formulas, that growth touch people.
It destroyed, its image as a pragmatist, resolves problems instead of embellishing.
But in the cloud of Angela, the problems of domestic policy are a marginal.
Poverty among children and the concerns of workers with low wages?
He has some additional sentences for that.
In this matter is revealing how it lapses when it comes to family benefits.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to pronounce half a sentence.
It staggers in ground, when this becomes concrete.

The candidates climb the attack: as the Republican basis has moreover have official, eight presidential candidates to use the debate on CNN above all to discredit.
Films amateurs 30 seconds that Internet users sent via youtube are scarcely more than souffleurs.
"It is with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power", John McCain its candidate Ron Paul that is in the round to ask an immediate withdrawal of Iraq.
Contrite also makes the lesson vigorously by the veterans of Vietnam, when it refuses to condemn torture as what they call "waterboarding, a method of interrogation where the drowning.
However the fact that important themes of the country meanwhile go beyond the war in Iraq and of torture sees in the reactions of the town of St Petersburg in Florida.
The conservative values are rented or the future increases taxes are refused, applause breaks in the studio.
It is there that reveal once again where resident weaknesses of both favourites.

The fact that the group has again made some stir among the krautrock amateurs.
They have the right to reveal it here: targeted surveys reveal that, indeed, the reasons in the collective memory of the POP, but in any case so lasting way so that this group is also painfully for 32 years.
But why German not have the right to celebrate its living legends seventy years?
And what is called "misleadingly krautrock" more pleased in America and England in the country of origin.
Lorque music industry awarded price in 2003 echo the survivors of the Cologne for their work, can be seen in the room German pop faces.
When red hot Chile also thanked groups Düsseldorf and neu! in praise, had more important.
Later, during the concerts, Michael rother jumped on the scene of red hot Chile as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transformation into the unknown and is unique.
The memory of déja taken by harmonized, because the trio existed only two years and during this period, the impact of which felt was much weaker than what it was allocated to the other.
Moebius Joachim and had already played with the artist Conrad schnitzler under the name of splendid cluster.
They played in the cellars of Berlin.
Then in Düsseldorf, a label subsidized by the Church, for financial reasons.
Rother had fixed in kraftwerk and was finally made a name as guitarist with neu! ', which was perhaps the most radical German group.
In 1973, however rother followed the musicians of cluster in exile in fôrets of weserbergland.
There, in a previous farm of weser, a decline of the 16th century, they lived as members of communities from the city.
Less ideological in the Community 'kommune Joachim ", where I had the right to torment as.
The art rather like spitzweg.
So-called found in the dustbin a flag of harmonia ottenstein society and also a name for art.
A lot further harmonized.
The first album was called "musik von harmonized" and that "with".
As for serene and moderate that sounded music, suffered from material misery.
The harvest did not serve alone to itself.
CD "live 1974" which has appeared recorded in concert with griessem in public record nearly 50 heads, as somebody believes remember.
Emitted at this time to force harmonized to train.
It was for a moebius Joachim and immoral.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother atterit in the spheres of and assured its existence with albums as "flammende Herzen" (blazing hearts.
Cluster is in the eighties and for more success that has never been harmonized.
We must live with the griessem of Herbert grönemeyer.
Its label set the goal of keeping krautrock as German contribution to contemporary music.
Neu! had unearthed on this occasion as work Joachim staff.
The physical's takes place at home cultures of Berlin.
Subsidized publicly, within the framework of the festival.
Julian cope is there, the British, and who paperback "krautrock sampler".
There is also the inventor of loveparade, Dr..
Where all margin of fluctuation influence of krautrock be surrounded regarding future pop music.
The vacuum left by the group will be filled by harmonized.
The sentence of Brian eno planes in the middle of the unique sounds: "the only true music, you listen to the future.
There are photos are harmonized with the producers in the farm piece.
The other photographs in black and white in bazaar wired tools to use the legend.
In the three veterans are again occupied improvise.
But the microphones to organ and the battery, to draw the instruments sounds as instruments to built effects himself.
Today, the electronic music like electronic music.
In the three great meticulous of technology.
It even the society of the House for it.
Under morgenstern Barbara, coughs and whisper under all the sound and sing a pretty time "aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It is not a question of rock.
Roots were less than in the blues music conservatories (can) technologies (kraftwerk) or the escape of artistic or social conventions (cluster.
Whoever shouts' 68 "is not completely wrong, and also harmonized is now more let Russia that by now.
But what is more itself be covered thoroughly on the scene.
Where does the music and where it finishes?
It can get on the nerves of someone (?) or grant of great moments of joy.
Richard gere is not simply rather cynical.
With "the party" and "fatal peace" films, two of the war in the Balkans.
But the two do not convince.
The rest is too much on action and exchanges of insane shooting instead they are too crying.
Here, Richard gere "in the party" cannot help.
The good news first: of course the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still lie in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is precisely here in the hinterland of the Bosnian war, Richard gere player is met.
We finally lost sight of the nicest man eighties, because too many roles and futils in films to feelings for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism robbed the desire to be.
Today gere Richard suddenly is more important to look as "the party" - when the hunter becomes hunt (why films today must be as long as confused and collective agreements of drivers of engines?)
It delivers a splendid presentation of full winks: basically, its character to defer war Simon hunt is what gere could have become, if destiny and film industry were not so benevolent: a man with his best moments for long behind it, but that, even as a monument to ruin, however kept visible its former charm.
But despite this, "the party" continues together with the German production "fatal peace", which leaves as this week, the interminable films failed on the war in the Balkans.
"fatal peace" can be quickly the process: the talks about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian topol, Max riemelt), which often Serb one of the Kosovars, in which one of the two grave still promptly.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are here for once presented as the only cause of all the evils, such as a flat film is lost too quickly in action and exchanges of senseless shooting.
This is a kind of warning "for" Cobra 11 motorway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, they can examine in the good example of the party, why basically there has never been a good film on the war in the Balkans.
The history of the three American war reporters that condition to track down the war criminal "The Fox, could have become, with another director and another scriptwriter (both at the same time, Richard shepard) another new" Apocalypse Now.
Because the stories resemble a striking: two males go in small team in the forest, to achieve something that the soldiers cannot in both males, it becomes a journey in madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of the party is that they simply do not let the cynical Simon hunt be deserted endowed with a heart, as it is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script credit must moreover a romantic adventure with Bosnian assassinated.
The party "and" is utterly wrong, while the reporter, in the last five minutes, for an accelerated procedure, guaranteeing that NATO, the CIA and the premiums hunters of world did not succeed in five years: catching the war criminal and allow for a fair revenge in Bosnia.
It is so poor that they should refer to the International Court of crime against the cinematographic logic.
In this case, the film has a human too deep preoccupation.
It wants to report that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects and French (they must agree exceptionally) not lead hunting in a rather intensive because of secret political agreements.
But the well-meaning and it are this time so that a similar Brecht's famous poême comes to.
That speaks of a wooden mask a demon yet on the table poête: "compassionate, I see the veins of the inflated, clearly: it is like it to be.
Films such as "the party" have exactly such insinuate that heads, but how is it to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films on the war in the Balkans.
Recently, it was reported in the newspaper that all films on Iraq were large failures.
They can add: there has ever been good films on South Africa.
What is worth every time: when a star leads to a home of crisis or a minefield, it then leaves something to be arquette Patricia Rangoon "," jenseits to go grenzen pretty "or" blutdiamanten "with Leonardo dicaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
Anyhow, always past decades before Hollywood can make a good film on the holocaust "with the list of Schindler".
Certain films must still mature - those who are today classical works on Vietnam "the hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "metal jackett" in any case been unanimously at the time as leaders.
But maybe we know today as simply too on the world conflicts, where each massacre, live on two screens in the House.
And that delighted to lack of scruples need to tell beautiful stories.
"to be or not to be" or "dictator" indeed become as good as because lubtisch Chaplin and do not yet know how the Nazi system dominated.
Perhaps he does not want to be good when one wants to do good.
Perhaps it is necessary to have regard sarcastic artistic and left behind of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When they questioned on the parallel between its historical novel "dictionary of lemprière" and the Balkans, he replied: "that holds that the fact that certain things change.
"the cities will always dangerous horribly murdered men, will always be a terrifying and the war in Yugoslavia.
Von beust collects criticism for the Olympics.
The decline of the Mayor of with the candidature of Hamburg for Summer Olympic Games collided in politics and the economy to virulent criticisms.
Many people want to continue to fight for the games by water.
But beust calls von need at every opportunity.
The main manager of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans schmidt-trenz abandoning Wednesday, described as being "bad for the local economy.
Recently, no other project had deployed as many police motivation in the city that idea.
"without this objective, the momentum would not have been able to be maintained in the same measures.
Schmidt-trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new starting point to the "which takes as starting point another agenda.
The Mayor Ole von beust remained on Wednesday in his previous statements that the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic at least until the year 2028.
"is not a Hamburg which decides the Olympics, but the German Federation of Olympic sports said to beust von Welt online.
It renvoit discounted decision at the beginning of December, sports federation about the application of Munich for the winter games of 2018.
This priority is for us, that, in the period of time that we had expected until 2028 even there, we will have no chance.
However the dream does not belong to the past, von beust.
The Sport Federation of Hamburg) (hsb regretted the declarations of beust.
The impression is given that Hamburg does put his candidature for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity, burying the projects already now Wednesday said," the President of hsb Günter ploss.
Abandoning the application would be in contradiction with the declarations of the Senate at reception in pleinière Assembly of the Federation of German higher Schools sports.
There would beust von, called on universiades Hamburg in 2015 as being "a substitute" to the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The higher schools Sports Federation had initially in the past weeks nominee Hamburg as candidate city.
The SPD fraction of mayor accused the Senate used this invaluable time in housing in Hamburg.
"the development of small grasbrook was refused by the Senate for years because it played the map of the Olympics and excluded housing, the delegates of the SPD Carola veit and Jan quast.
While the SPD always asked for a small grasbrook integrated into the Olympics and the use of the CDU, would bet exclusively on "factor.
For the Summer Olympic Games in 2012 for its part would have raised in Hamburg a great enthusiasm.
Hamburg was though against Leipzig.
It is not the cases of warhols.
That which links Sweden concepts and wooden case, Ikea, but not Andy warhol.
Or if?
At present, cases wood produced in Sweden throw shadow on the list of works of warhol.
A large part of brillo-boxs ninety "Stockholm type" there are listed.
After the Swedish newspaper "expressen" questioned some months ago the authenticity of the 1968 Andy warhol, internal investigations of moderna Stockholm will lead to a result: six "brillo-boxings", whose former director museum Hulten gave in 1995 to the will, are copies - as well as many other hundreds of "type of Stockholm, which circulate on the international market of art.
History is a tangled disconcerting sequence of artistic and curatoric productions.
In 1964, warhol created in New York its first "," brillo-boxes wooden cases, which are based on the design boxes soap powder brillo ".
An exhibition of its work to the will presented in 1968 - with the agreement of warhol - hundreds of cases brillo done box: these did not come to financial reasons) warhol, but had been directly factory of cardboard.
It is not about works of art, but their models, samples of exposure.
At the same time, warhol had given the approval in 1968 do produce some cases wood brillo in Sweden, besides which were exposed to the will.
The witnesses to speak today about fifteen wooden cases which at the time would have entered in the history of art and auction, as original of Andy wahrol allowed, with the appelation "standard Stockholm.
Some of them have reached the auctions in more than 100 000 dollars.
The problem now is that the director of the legendary museum hultén wrongly claimed later than hundred cases drink had been produced and displayed in Sweden in 1968, which warhol would then have given up.
In truth, 105 cases of hultén were produced in Malmö in 1990, only for an exhibition in St Petersburg.
At this time, warhol was already died for three years.
Byström, Lars Conservative leader in the moderna will, in the next six brillo-boxings museum of three other private collections suedoises, two of which were in Stockholm in 1968: their plates were initially printed and sanded, then they applied a brush paint white.
The copy going year 1990 reveals that the was directly applied without layer of the panels, using a paint roll - for it is not a matter of paint, but a acrylic.
"these cases were not allowed by the artist and should be removed from the list of official brillo-boxings Andy warhol", implies the director will moderna, Lars nittve: 'if' Andy warhol art board 'in New York will come from another decision, will moderna classify the six cases in its collection as copies / material of exposure.
Already in July the board of course, announced that it would investigate "heavy charges" which will be raised in the cases of soap powder.
But since we ring over there.
