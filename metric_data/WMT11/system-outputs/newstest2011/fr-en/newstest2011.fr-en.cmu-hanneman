What is it going to happen? CSSD known or Voldemort or pastry in Prague.
The new elected CSSD the mayoralty of the capital will apparently overcome a real language barrier to understanding the council with their new and old colleagues of ODS.
The newspaper Actualne. cz has "tested" new members of the council from á CSSD, whether they know argôt born in recent years to the town hall, where were the current coalition partners who led Prague.
The coded vocabulary that the cream of the Prague initiated during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem described some of the personalities, the situations, and the causes of the metropolis.
It was surprised that it was discovered that the newly elected officials do not understand very well known terms.
At least they say.
"Who is Valdemort ."
"I really do not know."
"I am a jeunôt in politics pragoise reacted Lukas Kaucky, elected culture test vocabulary of "sponsor ."
And as regards the political veteran, elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the "hole of golf ."
"This is the only expression among those that you are proposing that I use"
Otherwise, I do not argôt.
From vocabulary, whose daily Aktualne. cz published expressions in June this year before Congress pré-éĺectoral ODS, drafting has chosen six examples of priority those linked with the City of Prague.
The Socialists should explain the meaning of "Voldemort ," "the greatest golf hole Prague, go to the patisserie ," "nerve ," "treason against the capital" and "entôler ."
Three elected were in agreement on the quiz, the quatrieme- Antonin Weinert, must lead the education Prague in the future - has promised to begin an interview but then not dropped the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek has refused the test.
"I am not at all these things lá and how to enjoy the representatives of citizens ' democracy: I am not going to give my opinion."
"I am in the process of how we are going to include in our programs," he responded.
As has already heard, elected Lukas Kaucky did not recognize apparently legend above, it is the influential Janousek on entrepreneurs and friends former Roman Bem.
"Voldemort "says nothing á'Kaucky and the only phrase he guessed that the test is "the biggest hole of golf Prague ."
"The tunnel Blanka" said Kaucky and immediately added: "But I know newspapers ."
"I am going to have to pay me a language course," jokes he.
Not only matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, elected for the environment, know that the hole in golf is the tunnel Blanko.
The two Social Democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the figure would "go to the pastry ."
"This is, I think, to go to a company," Plachy is ready to guess that it is the headquarters of companies Janousek.
On the same tone Brezina recalls that it derives its knowledge rather than newspapers and not any language use.
According to the candidates tests there is no lexicon of argôt in social democracy.
"I have taken on board with colleagues and it appears that we have not really something."
" It is quite some time for the use of abbreviations of names and symbols," said Peter Hlinsky, Chairman of the Social Democratic Party, that Party members call Hulda.
"I called Briza school but I don't know if my colleagues call me like this, says Mr Brezina about nicknames.
The newspaper Actuel. cz tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for members of the Party or the least friendly old Petit, representative of Miroslav Pocket, which drew attention to him before the election by cheating during the sponsorship, is nicknamed "the little plaything."
nicknames are also only admit the use within the party, the Social Democrats.
It seems that Hulinsky didn't like to hear Hulda, but the daily Akutel. cz has been another nickname for the president when the.
"Doctor of law with truncheons" recalls it seems that Petr Hulinsky received his doctorate in law JUDr. to the police academy bratislava.
The government wants to reduce torture "witches ," has published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, the women reported witches have common features.
They are part of the old generation, can not work for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The "witch" is isolated in order not to threaten the rest of the village.

The insulation "witches" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a contractor 42 years of Burkina Faso: "The human minds eaters have always represented a danger," he said.
While Burkina Faso strives to reduce the witch hunt, Gambia not later than last year has even seen the President himself to participate.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, has launched a broad witch hunt, seems, were involved in his death and are to be tried by the black magic to kill the President."

The tenant Bakal: The poèles heat, he signed a high rent.
A man aged imposing went out the door of the center customer society GPR Byty "Baron of coal" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner rented apartments in the Czech Republic.
covered under a dossier with three new contracts for three apartments: his own, her daughter and her son, who is now serving a sentence.
The deregulation has increased the rent to the three individuals.
Instead pay 3500 son will address from next year for a second category 2 +1 apartment 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and heating works on solid fuel," singled out on her son's new contract rights signing authority.
"But I signed when "explains to motié angry and half resigned.
The civic association apartments BytyOKD. cz who described the nouelles rental conditions as "immoral and indecent," advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when to be issued a notice to explain the methodology for the claim.
But man responds to this by a gesture of the hand.
"One said this, another said something else ."
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory deregulation.
After the New Year, it expects most of the apartment in the Czech Republic where rents are not market prices.
Aktualne. cz has for that reason decided to personally visit the "laboratory ."
The waiting room GPR streets Havirovska is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full Tuesday at 9 a.m. in the morning.
Right next door is a guard of a security company with a device to draw customers.
A special button," rent 2011 ," is displayed on the touch screen.
A single pressure and a paper with a number fate.
You do not have the time to read your number 157 your number is already beginning to illuminate on the big screen in the topit the waiting room.
In a split second it is your turn.
After a short time, an old couple comes to rent, but new rents do not appear to involve people in the waiting room.
Most people come to resolve current problems everywhere, repairs, insurance events and others.
In Ostrava, people over 44000 apartments Portfolio GPR receive letters with new lease agreements in their letter box for mid-November.
GPR Byty proposed rent increases of 15 to 38 percent.
Special window for new rent is open to the public since 18 November.
"it works for nearly a week, it is still on trial ," after a moment of hesitation, employee behind the counter when the client as a journalist.
The déragulation and former apartments minors Bakal are a very sensitive area.
The Vice-President of Parliament and from Ostrava region Lubomir Zaoralek Social Democrat reported fairly sustained before the elections and this is now the local newspapers.
"20 years after, I want a new floor ."
"They do I have not changed a put ... n in the wc, relieve the rights mentioned in the introduction.
However, according to employees, retirees who come to be sure that they will receive a discount on the price of rent if they sign now as the RPG has promised in a special offer.
It is a rebate half the amount of rent that other loctaires which have signed a new contract before 15 December.
But the window "deregulation" street Havirovaska really is not burdened by the questions.
"Among the 360 clients who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came to rent," said an employee at the window.
Yet GPR proposed on its website and in the windows of individual interviews on rents when it is necessary.
If the two sides do not agree on the rent is an independent court which will take the decision.
` is not the threats but only to inform on the unique way and legitimate act legally," said GPR on its Web site.
"Here nobody will go to court "think a female GPR Byty and the man in the street outside the center clientele.
"I have 13,000 kroner retirement and I still SEK 5000 to eat, I do not have enough to go to court," he said.
The employee feels suddenly uncomfortable.
"We will see."
"Mr. Zaoralek media request that the person signing and therefore the people expect," said she.
rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with early 2011 and increases, according to GPR Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And the current rent still do not reach the level required for the maintenance of the funds for housing," said Pavel Klimes, director of residential portfolio company RPG Byty, that it is precisely the neglect of funds for housing makes tenant anger is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However 5 years between 2005 and 2010 the RPG was able to rent to invest in apartments 4 billion in four years from 2011 to 2014 this should be 5.2 billion.
The big screen hung from the ceiling in the waiting room upholstered chairs face street Havirosvka, repeat some information incorporated in red.
'L'augmentation rent in 2011 is 15 per cent and no fewer than 31200 apartments or more than 90 percent of the apartments of the GPR."
"And this will always be more 7.50 to CZK ² per month," said screen.
The increase of 38 percent on 400 apartments of the GPR portfolio.
"In these cases, it is a truly very low 19.66 of CZK ²," adds the RPG.
The next year the rent will remain the same for 2,600 apartments.
GPR Byty promised that the deregulation will not cause a radical but gradual increase of 4 to 8 years.
She adds other commitments: all the money for rent increases (see graph) went to the apartment in the form of savings in heating, new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on increasing the rent have priority.
Kindergarten is a part, too, including architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint Brno is the new seat of society. Design.
Nobody would have expected that it also has a mini kindergarten with everything -- walls of colors, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature games on the terrace.
Since October last year, can make children employees. design.
company projets-architectonique. Design. workshops have produced a large number of buildings in Brno, imagined its mini nursery school since the first drafts of the building Avriopoint.
It employs about 90 people, mostly the age of the children and it was important that women architects and project leaders can quickly return to work.
At the same time as labor contracts at the time declined, nursery school is a proposed bonuses to its employees by society. Design. in its social agenda.

Thanks to funding allocations (2.8 mil. CZK). They were able to buy equipment and appliances and after two years to ensure qualified personnel as well as the road map.
After use endowment funds (two years) company. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini nursery school on its own funds.

The house fascinates even after 100 years. Take a look in the Inland Gaudi.
The roof is back from a saurien prehistoric, stairs, a backbone of the dinosaur and balconies to open fish gules.
This house Casa Battlo Barcelona architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic forms, the house has received from the local nickname of the House.
organic forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile fragments and mosaîque, facade recalling scales everywhere present curves, is everything ypique for Art Nouveau Antoni Gaudi.
The front facade of the house being its dream, its colors and textures pleasant reminiscent of nature and animals.
During a more detailed view of the geometry, the pace and order thought with precision.
On the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and ignited so that the impression of the brightness of the colors is strengthened.
The winding and twisting forms also appears in the interior to the same extent.
The timber copy waves frameworks windows, balustrades, decorative elements, eye and slats.
The house Battlo stands in the neighborhood Eixample street market Passeig de Gracia. 43, is born of the construction of a house in 1877 architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction is made for two years and ended in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, has insisted on the demolition of the vieile construction and the construction of another new but quickly accept the idea of a reconstruction of Gaudi and better market.
But Casa Battlo as the house units was not thought by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on its draft an apartment decorations are born of the representation of the owner of the building and use mosaîque window-dressing.
For the facade have also worked with other artists and creators.
The joint work plans house Casa Battlo began cooperation a success between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house Gaudi Casa Mila and Guell in which there are other works by Gaudi.
The premises have dubbed the hot house just after finishing because its organic forms House bone ."
Others, in light of the specific mechanism for opening the windows called "house decaying ."
It said that construction there is a sword similar to Saint Georges pattern of Catalonia.
Other elements of the sculpture construction contain hidden religious grounds.
Gaudi thought for a single system in its central heating, with air vents and chimneys typical.
Their 45 degrees inclination seems bizarre.
During the establishment Gaudi has absolutely not respected construction guidelines and is not allowed to interfere.
At the beginning construction it obtained from the town building permits, knowing of course that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years after finishing the municipal council was horrified and amendments.
It does not suit, for example, members of the council that the pillars of the construction empiettent on the public sidewalk.
There was never change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after city Josep Battlo asked (and obtained satisfaction) permission to rent the top two floors.
The owner moved to lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor had a common and third chamber and a private apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewellery.
The full house of six floors is shared by a staircase which takes up an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were canceled by the basic elements of reconstruction and their replacement by walls.
Gaudi worked also the modern concept of liaison spaces.
The party may be linked completely opening the doors of the fairs and high society can communicate comfortably or limit the private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi has also received new facades a toîture non-traditional and two floors and more.
The Gaudi with light is also impressive, blue and white with glazed tiles decorated the inner courtyard and wells with the lights.
The game two colors give the maximum light in all floors of the house.
It simply bet on the principle that the white interpretations by more than the dark instead absorbs the sun's rays.
The house Casa Battlo registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the more spacious apartment and most splendid accessible to the public.
The owners are determined to take this step in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued visits because they have seen that this is a lucrative business and they have broadened the scope of common spaces and the attic visits including roof terraces.
The ticket in the monument is not really expensive, costing 16.50 euros; students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist maps have 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the entry price in other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you quickly find a friend among the residents of the house and completely home.
How to choose a mattress and a mattress: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatious framework, but rather the quality of surface reserved at bedtime, mattresses and sleeping provide a real basis for a proper bed.
They must of course be harmoniously complement each other to please a specific user.
During the several things are crucial: the weight, size, age, state of health and gender.
The type of procedure in which we will place the mattress and a mattress support is also important.
A typical example?
For example in the cottage where sleeping not continually latex mattresses are not appropriate because they are "warm ."
They also have a higher weight mattresses in the polyurethane standards.
It is necessary to return frequently.
If they do not have enough ventilation channels in the heart and if they are, on a solid, they retain moisture. In the mold can also form.
The habit is also crucial in the choice.
Anyone who is clear time abroad where it frequently uses a very thick mattress with a layer rammollissante, feel hard on a low and hard surface.
"This is as well as all hokeyistes returning of NHL complain that they can not sleep there."
"For their shoulders tired feet and coasts, they needed a mattress with a layer rammollisante foam lazy ."
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes, a disorder of the nervous system, therefore, assume the evil "information" joints and skin," says Sylva Adamczikova who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That is why a few years ago with foam mattress lazy conquered the hokeyistes and other clients.
"Today is working well, Tempur, Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Coca Growers, for example appropriate mattresses.
You do not need to be a guy from the NHL for a lazy foam.
The "miracle" works.
It is optimizing its rigidity and form as the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
There is no pressure on you and you will not in the night after a difficult match.
You sleep simply better.
The foam lazy also functions as a protection against esquarres.
For the mattress in your size, add the length of the feet, or about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman from a 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each bed two places should be 90 cm is 180 cm.
For the beds to a single place, singles, for example, are recommended at least 120 to 140 cm.
It is convenient for the visit.
'Cependant is a simple rule for the width of the bed when you are lying on your back, you should ask the hands so comfortable with slightly bent elbows Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Bourreliers-matelassiers and decorators who has worked for several years as a healthy sleep problems and ergonomic furniture and taught in special schools.
For a bed and two seats each needs its own mattress and the mattress, so attention however during achât choose the height of mattresses.
Otherwise you will not get the mattress at different heights and this is not achievable in all settings.
foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, mattress springs at least 15 cm, that intend to form and ventilation layer of at least three centimetres.
"A or seated on the mattress you must not feel ," warns the Héléna Prokopova.
Each mattress request a specific type of mattress.
The lit-sommier, when mattresses and mattress are united as sisters Siamese, has nothing to do in the bedroom.
mattresses ventilated very evil; it must not washing, commonly auhourd'hui.
And since during the night sweats normally 0.2 0.75 l sweat it is clear that after 5 to 7 years, the mattress is beginning to remind a large (and blocked) screens.
For this specialists refuse to make calls over a period of 25 years for a mattress or a guarantee of life.
But its but.
And a board experience on the part of vendors: for a mattress 120 140cm, renouncing, for the mattress, hygiene or washing but rather add a mattress of protection that you can easily withdraw and washing.
And even if our days often produce coatings with zipper for all, that is to say that after the opening has two parts (for washing and the size of a washing machine is very important!) or manipulation for large models (and for a single person) when cut off a struggle between a lightweight and a lorry on a ring.
You have in your bed a rigid board instead of a mattress?
Never!
Up for a bed for the visitors for a single night.
However provide (if not) holes and use the mattress springs with a minimum height of 15 cm with spring bags (Germany Taschenfederken) and a layer of ventilation.
A mattress in polyurethane should not be part of such a bed.
For box slats in the unique position with 14/18 slats, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut) are ideal but it will always be best for you to have a mattress with slats, 28 and above, where the slats are doubled in the bottom part of the kidneys and that it is possible to regulate rigidity.
For mattress positions should not take the mattress springs because it does not change the position.
A side of the rigidity of the slats may also so-called cradle shoulder.
It is a special liaison slats to pressure or accept the slide to the shoulder of the Dungeness "fits" well.
For men who have "broad shoulders that back ," it is really important.
This is already envisaged by the mattress manufacturers for "male" began to use a zone rammollissante at shoulder level.
But they also believe women, they offer a soft surface at the hips.
For the client more difficult there box wings or pad with a so-called suspension multiforce.
The pressure to call in more points and diinue tension.
But of course, as soon as you use a bad pillow (and inflated) on good mattresses and sleeping, the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: pillow must support the head and head must achieve only shoulders, to shoulder muscles can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavians by exmple prefer.
When lying on its side, the pillow must level (with the cradle of the shoulder of mattress or rammollie in mattresses) shoulder height.
The modern mattresses have something in common with the first straw and grass.
The manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also organic mattresses.
The raw materials base oils, from which the manufacture of polyurethane, are replaced by natural oils, such as soya oil.
Almost all the known manufacturers use precisely soybeans.
"The Bio qualifier for mattresses means that the heart is made of natural products," said Petr vasicek society Coca Growers Plus.
natural materials are used also for coatings mattresses; one of the first was to cultivate aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules develop forest perfumes or lavender.
There are differences between men and women.
While extract birch plants for the surface mattress absorbs heat and cool the body, "cooled" rights, "heat" women.
extract red pepper accelerates blood circulation and is therefore the warmest for the weaker sex.
The current favorite?
mattresses made of foam cold (it is more the pores with disrupted cellular structure therefore breathable that standard polyurethane and more elasticity.
rigidities combination of cool mosses provides mattresses polyzones who know exactly where the head, lower back and feet.
You pay a mattress quality from 7,000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters are less VAT and as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, it is Gumotex has reached the first place.
savings for the mattress and the mattress is not easy.
It may from time to time in the context of special actions on the part of manufacturers or producers two mattresses for the price of one.
For example the company Magniflex proposes mattresses Duofreeze with memory foam Memory sewn for 11990 crowns.
It may, of course, take the second free of charge.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic mosses with open cell structure and a great thickness was begun with the Tempur at a pace "cosmic ."
It started as for NASA parceque astronauts were to start load factors.
The Tempur is rammollit heat and hardens, on the contrary, cold.
It responds fully to the warm human body and distributes an optimum pressure.
It is for this ideal against evil slept and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
viscoelastic foams used not only for the mattress, but also for products for health, such as cushions for the feet that relieve the legs and the venous system.
The Czech manufacturers use, for example, the foam EucathermC or Twinsaver or of the same type.
devices to monitor people are increasingly requested by parents who wish to keep their children.
The fear for their child brings more and more people think monitor through a GPS.
The system, established at the beginning of the search for cars can also be used to trace the movement of persons and help in some cases as exmple little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big a box of matches but will soon be a shows.
The case of small Anicka has moved a large number of people and they have begun to seek ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We are trying to say that it is not a spy but only a means to reduce the probability of another tragedy," said Petr Pilin society MAcro Weil is one of the suppliers of the tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I confess that there may be a case of misuse of such devices, such as in the bag of a person who is not aware of, but I have not yet met with such cases ."
"The majority of people are customers who buy real product for security reasons, said Pilin.
In his children should always know what is used "box" and how to use in case of emergency.
The child psychologist, Dana Bockova drew attention if the child does not want to be on this type of thing, débarassera.
'Et even the smallest can show a great creativity when it comes to getting rid of the express something when they do not want to be under control."
"Mobile phones, which can cut as these devices tracing, have already led parents to long waits," says Bockova.
According to it, the fact that this type of device could help in case of aggression is very questionable.
"If it is a kidnapping, the author will do everything to ensure that the child has no electronic device which can locate ."
"At present, the telephone ."
"When will develop devices tracing, they (criminals) are going to find them because the sale will be supported by a publicity campaign ."
"In such cases, criminals will always be ahead of the police," said the psychologist.
She admits that such devices can help during an assault not prepared by a paedophile.
According to Robert Cech society RC Monitoring, which offers tracing for cars and for the people, says that this type of device can help, even if it was destroyed in the attack.
"The system can be fine-tuned so that it is in regular program after a specified period ."
"In cases where the system is destroyed, it remains the last position of the person concerned ."
` more expensive devices also have an inclinometer immediately indicates the position of the person who has slipped and is extended without moving," said Cech.
According to the mobile phones of so-called intelligent that are equipped with a navigation system, may offer a comparable service after formatted with a prologiciel.
The current tracing systems is that it is either a system similar to those that the pendant of a box of matches of the size or smaller aircraft.
It can always lose.
According to Pilina company Macro Weil, that is why the tests are ongoing to make devices that resemble common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that any aggressor can not recognize the tracing system ."
"Either he will after a period of time, which would have given the police a little more time," he said.
Whether the tracing system is developed in the form of a bracelet and a pendant, it utilisiera always the same technology that for cars.
It is a combination of systems acquisition position using GPS (which is commonly used in autonavigation) and a mobile phone service which alerts the current position of the vehicle.
The army as a detonating cords, it could make the Czech Republic with. But it can take two years.
The army has purchased for 445 km fuses used for explosives.
Already last year, the Ministry of Defense had purchased 224 km.
The army has reservations for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the fuses is two to four years.
The army has purchased detonating cord to company STV Group for 40 million kroons.
The General Staff has given as a reason for the achât a huge quantity of detonating cord at MF DNES that soldiers used 60 km per year.
According to the calculations of the reserve to detain made by pyrotechnicians army, that MF DNES contacted, it appears that even the generals, officers with a command, secretaries or personal household should have an annual exercise of explosives.
Alexander Vondra, the Minister of Defense and Vlastimil Picek, army commander are no exception.
Only argue for annual consumption army 60 km of detonating cord.
A this represents 25 000 explosions.
And even if it were true, the army could provide for 10 years.
If it is true that for each new professionals basic training is more than 2 m detonating cord, experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase assured, with consumption of special units and engineering, reserves for 225 years mentioned.
Yet rapid intervention brigade soldiers recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and that meetings of the fire are limited needs money.
With regard to the lack of underwear do not talk.
"And I am not the head if they buy a large amount of detonating cord."
"That's their decision and they really know what they are doing ."
"for us is a good customer that we are as traders to please," says the commercial director of STV Group Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, argued the achât hundreds of km of detonating cord by army will "ammunition" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky STV Group reported, however, only four years of life of detonating cord and pyrotechnicians police and army only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in deposits, it may even go up to four years," said one who does not want his name published in light of criticism of the army.
The time life past each munition should be tested to see if it remains integrates and does not pose a threat to the life of a soldier.
These tests are not free and cost money.
The Department is a discount due to the quantity of 445 km cordeux detonating.
"They have killed 60 per cent less than last year's supply of 245 km," said the spokesman Pejsek which the interpreter of the buyers of the Ministry of Defense.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of detonating cord pyrotechnicians police neutralize World War II ammunition or after the Soviet army does not exceed 1500 metres.

In the Land Fund in Plzen, the police made arrests during a public competition
In building the Land Fund in Plzen, the anti-corruption police carried out the arrests in recent days.
Detective handcuffed to the local contractor and trader in housing Lubos. G.
which had tried to manipulate a public tender for a restitution claim settlement so that the ground is achieved by a candidate.
It should pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For the moment I can only confirm that police continued a person for insider dealing in a tender and a public competition." said the newspaper Pravo Chief Prosecutor Plzen Antonie Zelena, knowing that it is prohibited to provide further explanations because the investigation is ongoing.
The police have released after 24 hours this contractor 46 years in freedom.
For how it could influence a public competition, we can only speculate in light so little official information.
A question Pravo, spokesman of the Land Fund Lubomira Cerna said police officers had really made an arrest in Plzen on a workplace separated and, during the open competition.
"It was a customer and an employee of any case, she said.
public assistance under her true name "Appeal to propose for the transfer of land rights under the Act on land" and is put in place as several candidates are the beneficiaries of the right.
"These people, in the appeal, a higher value of their rights to resitutions which must be resolved before the announcement of the value of the land."
"According to those proposed classification of the buyers is established and the Land Fund then transfers the ground to the person who proposed the most senior," said the spokesman of the Fund.
Lubos G had, it is clear, information concerning persons who were registered, and as he himself is also a beneficiary because having purchased a large number of rights to the refunds, it was proposed to field candidates not to participate in the competition.
And he cashed probably withdraw.
This explaining why it had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G had wide contacts over standards FdT Fund (Land).
It was included in the case of former FdT Vaclav Sankot which was criminally prosecuted for publishing the land which had already edited the decision to establish a construction.
precisely Lubos G had obtained by the example of land for the construction of public communications, specifically in place which should be built on the artery access to the industrial zone Borske Pole.
Later he exchanged with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city, whose value is far higher.
The mayor was forced to accept because it might put the construction risk by blocking the land.

Households will from January pay a supplement not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and some places the rent increase also.
Families will from January to take their wallets until 100 kroner monthly more than now.
Electricity increases 4.6 per cent, almost 2 per cent more expensive in some places you will have to pay up to a tenth of the water supply and in many parts of central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase of electricity should reach for households in the apartment the 100 kroner annually more than at present.
However all suppliers have reduced electricity prices given the significant development to encourage the production of renewable energy, including batteries photovoltaÏques.
The gas increases moderately but of course when people most need to heat and therefore have more.
It may therefore also a NOK 100 more.
Despite the increase of electricity and gas in the Czech republic, central heating prices change differs from city to city.
It is mainly the greatest common planning price increases.
For example households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce pay from January central heating almost 50 kronor a month, families Libérec pay more than 1,000 kroner annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague prepares an increase of 9 per cent for water and sanitation in case the city increases the rent infrastructure.
If rents do not change the Prague will pay a supplement of 6.8 per cent.
The price of Prague will be amongst the lowest in comparison with the country as a whole.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already higher water and sanitation increased 7.4 percent.
The rent prices will increase by example in 450 thousand rental apartments from January to the end of regulation.
For example ICC Byty has in Usti nad Labem almost 2500 apartments, decided to increase to 100 per cent.
Those who will not be in agreement with the new increase in rents will be brought before the courts by society.
The regulated rent paid people in nearly 300 000 apartments could increase 10 per cent next year.
The Czech saoûlent rum and fernet. The beer is no longer and is gently.
The fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best mark of whisky are stolen from parents.
These are alcoholic who most often those who saoûlent, which have not yet 15 years, in the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated at hospital for recidivism are not the exception.
This stems from the experience of doctors who faced similar cases admissions departments children hospitals.
" beers and wines are no longer mode because it takes time to be saoûl ."
` The trend really is in high spirits," said Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head, Department of Children's Hospital Horovice in central Bohemia.
"When they manage to poach a bottle of candy in the wardrobe, he is sometimes wisky but it is fernet and vodka which prévalent'.
"The vodka has the advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus not feel," said Head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, hospital spokesman Motol, also the reason.
"In general, rum or fernet ."
"Today is the way alcohol in elementary schools ."
"In some cases, slivovice they have returned home," added Jurinova.
According to the Chief of the Department Pélikan, see drunk children aged 13 to 14 years of hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before joining Horovice since last year, it was Motol where he held ten years precisely paediatric where ambulances were schoolchildren wide around completely drunk.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times
"It acommencé his career 12 years when she was involved with 3.5 per thousand alcohol as the blood with a mixture with ecstasy," described the doctor this case particularly important.
"She was at the Parc des Expositions of Holesovice a party ."
"What is interesting is that it was not strange to the mother that her daughter is absent in 48 hours," said surprised the Director of the Department.
It is precisely the disinterest of the parents or their tolerance from that their offspring are drinking are the main cause of the development of alcohol to children.
According to specialists, not dependence, in the strict sense, for children.
"Under the word alcoholic is a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all its attendant phenomena but not found among children ."
"For those who use alcohol, it is rather a back-ground family significantly adverse ," explained the Head of the Department Pélikan.
According to the spokesman Jurinova, approximately 40 drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the clinic in Motol.
Do are integrated into information that cases with a grâve intoxication requiring hospitalization.
drunk children who are after emergency treatment brought home by the parents or by the police, are not counted.
In addition children sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, he exsite according Pélikan three seasonal waves with which we can count: the day witches, the Saint Sylvester and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink despite after poor results in fact they are celebrating the holidays."
"Of course I have lived the day drunk witches admission of 7 children in one fell swoop," said Pélikan.
The drunk child who spent the night in hospital in désintoxciation under medical supervision, paradoxically, in a better position than returned home and the aftermath of the "hangover ."
The headaches in the morning caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients the body needs.
"They are better off because they are a great evening and a mild revival and nothing hurts ."
"They are only surprised where they are," said Pélikan knowing that from time to time that the striker the good mood at least note to pay for their care.
The transport by ambulance and hospital on intensive care bed can go up to tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time I used it as a means of education to these children how their drunken cost and that they could spend the entire summer in seasonal work to repay one evening," added Pélikan.
However, according to him, the health insurance companies in their management in the regression, which should recover parents expenses related to care, do not treat children drunk.

Two aircraft L-159 five in all, against the Ministry of Defense has exchanged transport aircraft Casa C-295M, took off Tuesday for Seville in Spain, where the headquarters of the aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS.
This is the first time that this type of apparatus shall become the property of the Army of the Czech Republic.
They have been abroad in exercises or demonstration flights.
It is early versions of L-159T1 which were until now in service in the Army of the Czech Republic and were flying.

` aircraft L-159 single-seater planned for the exchange have been taken had stored for a long time without charges or additional investments for the Ministry of Defense ."
"The early L-159 T1 have been exchanged in the state," said the Pravo Pejsek.
He added that the army will not remain without two-seat because the Department had signed in May 2009 with Aéro pace an agreement worth 200 million kroner for the conversion of four single L-159 unused two F-5s.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, the second scheduled for delivery by the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS is committed to introducing aircraft equipment in some countries.
"In the contract clearly indicated that provides aircraft L-159 is EADS and that they will be used for training pilots NATO member countries ."
"It is therefore the case that takes into account how to achieve this," said Pejsek.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago, that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 aircraft Casa and three other planes for 3.5 billion kroner was endorsed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defense has not launched the tender and has directly contacted the EADS.
the defense argued then that exchange provides the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army has purchased Aéro pace 72 aircraft used in 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The Casa aircraft purchase will likely judicial implications.
European Commission, however, filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defense to the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected in a tender at European level and in any case directly contacting the manufacturer.
The army has already taken delivery of three aircraft Casa, the last expected to arrive on the Prague airport Kbely in two weeks.
A long index that ring is a sign of the low risk of the cancer
Men who have long index that ring are exposed to a lower risk for prostate cancer.
That is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.

The finger could help to identify the men should undergo prostate cancer test, inter alia by combining the genetic risk or other factors aggrâvants as antécedents family health, added Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009 it followed with his colleagues in Britain more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the right hand index shorter than the ring.
For them and for 19 per cent of those who were of the same length, it was found the same probability of prostate cancer.
In the case of those who had long index that ring the risk is, however, dropped to 33 percent for men age 60 decrease risk has risen to 87 per cent.
The length of two fingers - trained during the prenatal period, including the different levels of sex hormones faced the child in the womb.
A less testosterone is an index.
previous research had shown that it was precisely the testosterone to help in the development of prostate cancer.
The pprofesseur Vacla Paces, Czech renowned geneticist and former president of the Academy of Science, said CTK that he is aware of this study but that it does not seem to believe that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer is "completely ."

And the Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is probably in Britain, according to information published by the newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded server Amazon."
"Freedom of expression to the country of freedom," said on Wednesday (local time) cyber-activistes original revelations via the social network Twitter.
Shortly before, e-business, Amazon, had deleted the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After publication of secret diplomatic notes, cyber-activistes have resorted to Amazon Web Service (AWS) in order to reach the greatest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Formidable, our dollars are now being spent to care for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem to the Amazon, "they should stop selling books ."
The television channel CNN, citing Mr. Liebermann, reported that Amazon has prohibited the Wikileaks use its servers after investigation by the staff of Senator Joe Lieberman.
The chairman of the Senate committee for the protection of the territory had threatened the Amazon.com site to orchestrate a boycott against him, reported the British newspaper "The Guardian ."
"I would have liked the Amazon to take this measure as soon as possible in the light of the previous publications by Wikileaks classified information," said the senator.
At the same time, Mr. Liebermann called upon other countries to refuse to use the servers of the platform.
"Wikileaks is illegal, monstrous and unscrupulous. In doing so, it puts our national security at risk and threat to life throughout the world," according to a statement of the independent senators.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, be it American or foreign, should assist the Wikileaks to disseminate the contents of the stolen documents."
Wikileaks founder, Mr. Assange, who is wanted by the authorities because he was suspected of rape, is on the list of persons wanted by Interpol.
According to the information disseminated by the London newspaper "The Independent ," Australian 39 years living in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activiste has consistently qualified intrigues orchestrated by its detractors prosecutions against Sweden.
The Wikileaks spokesman, Kristinn Hrafnsson, said in London that the threats were made against the site.
"appeals have been launched for Julian Assange murder."
That is why the Assange particularly feared for his safety," said Hrafnsson.
That is also why the Wikileaks founder still in hiding.
Hrafnsson respond clearly to the statements made in North America.
In America, the Republican former governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, has demanded that the revelations made by Wikileaks officials be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, adviser to the Head of Government, Mr. J. Stephen Harper declared on television, obviously ironic, that Mr. Assange should be "killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a Unmanned aerial vehicle ."
Meanwhile, a controversy broke out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, a spokesman for the US president, Barack Obama, has described as "ridiculous and absurd" that Mr. assange has demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if it was given to diplomats, and disclosed recently, to engage in espionage activities.
"I don't know exactly why we must take the opinion of an individual owner of a Web site," said Mr Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and interests are more important than a website claims."
The US government is now fully on the test bench at the protection of databases.
According to a press release issued by the White House, Mr. Russell Travers, deputy director of the Centre of counter-terrorism, has been appointed to combat leaks.
Mr. Travers is responsible for "structural reforms" made necessary after disclosures of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also will check the means by which the exchange administration and protects the information.
In addition, the US government announced that it wanted to deal with the security of the dissidents and activists if ever they were threatened by the Wikileaks revelations.
"We have made every effort to enter into contact with them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if it is necessary."
The University of Ice
At the University Gelato Bologna, confectioners ice best seasons of the year.
The initiation of three days held for future glaciers has been a great success and attracted visitors from across the world.
In fact, where the ice?
From Glacier and the ice machine.
The glacier, i.e. German candy maker somewhat old-fashioned ice makes the cream all the rules of Italian art manufacturing ice.
The turbine ice removes the showcase ice cream chilled using a spatula, provides the waffle and then began to sell.
For, we do not need to go to Anzola dell ' Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wished to know more about the ice, can not avoid "Gelato-University" the Italian firm Carpigiani.
manufacturer sorbetières founded the university in 2003 so that the ice creams exits its machines meet throughout the Italian high ideals.
The initiation of the three days of future glaciers has been a great success and attracted visitors from around the world.
It also offered special courses on the chocolate ice and extending over several days. Similarly, practical sessions are held in the glacerie closed.
In the midst of a midlife crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others may simply to achieve their ardent desire on the ice.
This time, 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, Brazil to Saudi Arabia via Hungary.
Jacky, Professor artistic education come to California buff of the Slow Food movement. He wants to propose a European product quality at the Ice.
Anke Berlin is a management consultant company and, after a few years, learn something singular occupation for the nerves.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening a glacerie in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars, and wife of Canadian household come because children love Italian ice creams.
The glacier Luciano Ferrari first explained to participants characteristics ideal of perfect ice.
East crucial not only good flavor, but also the silky flexibility and good consistency.
However, Luciano not forgotten during the formation of the superstructure icing on the cake and, in general, the south: "The Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romance."
The first step in the manufacture of seems quite simple.
Luciano provides basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a blender that heating to 85 degrees through an electronic program, and then immediately cooled to four degrees.
It then opened a valve installed on the machine: the fate of a white cream base pasteurized basis for all kinds of ice milk.
The trainer was immediately besieged the question: Is it possible to manufacture ice using only natural substances without stabilizing?
How can we give free rein to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano warned be misled by the spirit of the time.
Anyone who speaks only ice" made from natural ingredients," perhaps even used the stabilisers: often a natural product, for example flour guar seeds obtained from guar bean.
It is obviously possible to manufacture ice without stabilizing, only need to sell within 24 hours if it collapses and client croquera nothing other than ice pellets.
Some mass modifications are permitted.
This becomes more exciting with the flavors.
The owner Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that acquires the radius of fruit or confectionery supermarket.
In addition, there are the powder and pasta.
"suppliers will all pass flavored dozens of ingredients."
"However, you should simply try."
Either in income fruit sorbet with sugar and fresh fruit.
In the ice cream made from the mass white, adding eggs becomes a yellow cream and, when combined with cocoa powder, the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now, all participants to use the machines to the ice.
Luciano invites from time to time to produce four kinds of ice: vanilla, chocolate, Chai and nutty, with or without the eggs in the estate, with more or less the aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of ice in the fruit are also subject to the same experience.
Over fragrances, more fruit purees: in terms of taste, it is not absolutely best.
The hazelnut ice is not necessarily the taste, when it is composed largely of hazelnuts.
The ice kiwi, very popular, is made from the group using more fruits, less water and less stabilizing.
"Only a balanced mixture is properly the taste of a lens," says Luciano.
The manufacture of ice is an exercise in the calculation: if we used the puree with a lot of sugar, it must be reduced by the amount of sugar in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is necessary for lemon ice.
Luciano presents a device with which it determines the sugar content of different types of fruit growers use to measure the degree of Oechsle in grape musts).
Fortunately, the tables to facilitate calculations.
The manufacture of ice does not require, as in the past, as much physical intervention.
It is not only the machine manufacturing automatic mass basic assistance.
There is also a system in which it is simultaneously available ice mixture to make buttery and brought negative temperatures.
Despite all automatisations, small failures are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo turning fruit purée from head to feet and, thus, splashing his fellow students when control of huge bowl blender escapes.
Luciano master is of the view that an "incident may occur in every way: it is only a matter of time."
The controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry experimenting the cultivation of genetically modified plants is essentially the European food safety.
This accusation is now formulated by the group of experts Testbiotech is regarded as an independent institute for the assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well-informed," said Wednesday in Munich Mr. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech.
There are reports that the Chairman of the Group of Experts Efsa for genetically modified plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, as well as other experts Efsa are under contract with the pressure group Ilsi.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper collaborated in a meaningful way in the development of test requirements of the Efsa for genetically modified plants and is, therefore, clearly in a situation of conflict of interest, according to the criticisms made by Mr. Then.
requirements developed text in subparagraphs, of the pressure group Ilsi and are thus mark the industry which, basically, is controlled by the authorities based in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech denounced a conflict of interest.
A senior Efsa recently joined without condition or without a transitional period, the Swiss food group Syngenta, It has changed the camp.
There is little time, even Germany Radio Central Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) had revealed the existence of a personal relationship between the authority of the European Union responsible for monitoring and the industrial lobby, which has aroused the suspicions of the German Federal Agency for Environment that Members of the European Parliament.
However, Efsa admits the existence of any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that operates all reliable data, including those of the industry as they are good quality work.
It does not prohibit the experts working for the Efsa to establish contact with the industry.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he worked for the International Institute for life sciences (International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi) based in the United States.
The agency sees itself as a neutral forum comprising experts, among others, are in science, industry and policy in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr Then resent the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any test of feeding the animals and not tested the impact of these plants on the environment.
"We want to know what are, for example, the impact of genetically modified maize cause in the field," says Mr Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not any genetically modified plant, which does not produce reliable results.
"If not risks, how can we then discover?" asks Mr Then on an accusatory tone.
That is also the view of Mrs Angelika Hilbeck.
This scientific research since 1994 in the field of genetics and is Polytechnic in Zurich.
In this region, as the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry sector is increasing influence or discredit scientific criticism.
That is why there is still struggling researchers are not related to the companies.
In the view of the business, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck asserts that "the industry control security research ."
The stone trace
Uli Gsell obtained a total of 400 kg.
Monday afternoon, she was at the station in Stuttgart with his back.
There were picketing.
It was snowing.
History is known: In September, the excavators came and began demolishing a large part of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: Several thousand people demonstrated against the draft S21, the transformation of the central station in Stuttgart in an underground station that will cost several billion.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the event led to the halt of the construction work.
Broken in 6000 to 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (limestone harvesting) Crailsheim, a paved and rude poorly constructed between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a sculptor 43 years residing Ostfildern.
It provided few fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He said with enthusiasm: "a small rock and cheap, simple and land."
It claiming that cutting saw, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
It is not yet known what he will do this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell also.
traces of stones in Stuttgart are a former ammunition depot of the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen has built its empire stones.
This man 44 years trading in old stones.
He purchased all the stones from demolition occurred in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or if they disappear in the landfill," said in his office in a hut, which was formerly a guard post.
says that he was subjected to insults and threats when in September newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the north wing of the demolition company.
But he negotiated for days with opponents of the draft S21.
And he explained that he could not do to oppose the demolition.
And if it is, then the most sensible thing would be to continue to use the stone.
Around 200 opponents of the draft S21 subsequently won a parallelepiped stone weighing 80 kilos valued between 6.50 and 14 euros.
Some custody as a souvenir in hoping also make during reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads a truck.
About half is still tightly packed in the forest, and the rest are long since sold.
Owners of the gardens, landscape gardeners, Individuals.
They came across and took away everything that could come in the boot and trailers.
These stones scandal Stuttgart into long" Mäuerle" or the limitations of the beds.
"In fact, this stone is nothing particular" said Mr. Rongen.
"in the absence of this policy."
It is in his car, around its vast empire of 20 hectares.
He studies right abandoned later, it undertook a study biology before turning the computer and eventually become a carrier.
And amateur stones.
It holds 40,000 tons.
It raises is the treasures across Germany.
IT says that it is the largest ancient stone merchant.
It is to suppress.
sand carved stones with art on the snow.
"In the past, they were part of the bridge Marienbrücke Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, he said with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
It takes the path that climbs through the forest.
It shows a lot of finger: Pierre red sand, previously part of the station in Karlsruhe.
And so on.
"Joli travertine."
The rather boxy formerly part of the gallery Neckarstadion Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of the stones and the stories, the travertine Cannstatt from the prefecture of police, the red granite from the cathedral Good Blasien, tuff from hospital in Heilbronn.
What work, What efforts, the sweat!
When Mr. Rongen believe that once the stones were carved by hand and displaced using simple hoists and carts pulled by a horse, it is environmentally friendly.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage was in the room."
It is not become rich, still less wealthy.
But the carrier now employs 14 people. In addition, tailors, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a gardener are installed in the forest.
"We are working hard, but it is gratifying," says the waste recycler.
soon, it must travel to Cologne.
Here, too, there are stones to save.
Control of talent to win senior potential
The Times is a great rush.
16 students rushing to buy buns salmon, tomato sauce and blancs-mangers.
The Braunschweig Technical University and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited students design and mechanical engineering at a workshop.
In a kind of competition of ideas, they must speak with trade on the car of the future with the developers of the VW, and, by the way, the firm Volkswagen.
Nowadays, many companies will not hesitate to go into the competition to find the best brains and engage, as Volkswagen, in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: To recruit the most talented graduates as much as possible in theaters before they arrive on the employment market and they are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements concerning the performance of their students, trying to identify exceptional talents in practical projects and loyalty.
During the second day of the workshop at the Technical University of Brauschweig the automotive group amadoue talents.
A young lady service staff share pens, candies and cards bearing the logo of Volkswagen.
It spoke of the schedule of professional internships and jobs for young talent students; it shows the railways for access to the group.
It is the Technical University of Braunschweig Selle Nico is responsible for the project started with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both parties: "The students are in contact with the industrial sector and earn experience."
" of the Volkswagen group, it may hear students, a closer look at the candidates seriously and appreciate those who fall in the line as a collaborator."
According to Mr. saddle, such cooperation is unusual.
What is new, it is offensive with which seeks to attract students.
"In the past, the focus was on the project," says Mr Selle.
The fight for the conquest of new graduates will become even more bitter.
In the property sector, companies can no longer recruit their collaborators experience-oriented on a host of candidates.
But they boast about their reliability and especially enthusiasts highly skilled work force.
It is mainly graduates from engineering sectors which are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the German association of engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineers posts remained vacant in October.
And according to estimates the VDI vacuum on engineer to expand again.
Roman Dykta goes hunting talents for KPMG, the audit firm, accounting and consulting.
It organizes costly events aimed at the recruitment of talents, such as arms cruise KPMG-Race, rallye-papier where competitors must find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel the United States.
Participants can happen to visit the subsidiaries of KPMG and the company.
Anyone who must participate to decide in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the crème de la crème of many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used for the pursuit of high potential in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the batch through arms cruise."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little"
For the talent hunter Mr Dykta, seems to be.
"Until now, we have been in contact with all the persons who took part in a similar action last year."
"Some of them are about to complete their studies and wish to soon send their requests to our company." he said.
Outside amadouement direct in campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are quite classic participating in trade fairs where they engaged in hunting brains.
"We are trying to achieve graduates participating in trade fairs."
"For example, solar technologies," said Ms. Sitha Stübe, director of human resources in Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
The company installed in Bonn employs about 1,500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe aware of problems related to the notes.
Currently, 35 posts are advertised on the site.
"At this moment, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
"It is expensive and time-consuming, "?
Another way to establish contact is through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various institutions of higher education, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"teachers indicate that the student has the possibility of making professional courses or write his end of study among us."
expensive advertising campaigns are announced in solar specialists.
That is why the company is trying to make its advertising highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, hierarchy flat and easy communication.
"Often, a large group can not do that," said Ms. Stübe, chief of staff.
long ago that money is the main role in the job search.
The working hours flexible, childcare or good promotion opportunities are key factors.
According to a study conducted by the Institute of Great Place to Work, Solarworld ranked 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute is an annual honor of German employers.
To this end, it asked the staff on their level of satisfaction with their work and its context and look at the conditions of employees.
The Chief of Staff of Ms. Stübe hope that this investment will enhance the image of the society to job seekers.
"I think candidates rely mainly to external evaluations in relation to a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler academy German DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies wishing to build a good reputation as an employer in applying a long-term strategy.
It advises its clients show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, this means first and foremost take internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to make attractive is through its own staff," he says.
This is called, after the jargon used in the sector, the domestic image strategy, i.e. the creation of the image of the employer within his own strength.
"staff met to form the best messengers."
When its employees and that they identify with the company, they are only advertising their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
"It is as if playing in an orchestra," said Mr. Kriegler.
Obama puts a brake on new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the Florida coast, the southeastern United States over the coming years.
The Government Washington delivered a ban equivalent ban and thus definitively canceled its original plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remain for the time being banned.
The Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar announced Wednesday.
It is the explosion in April, drilling rig Deepwater Horizon," which is the origin of this strict ban should remain in force at least for the next five years.
In the accident which claimed the lives of 11 employees and led to the greatest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had indicated that it was prepared to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
Proponents want to reduce the dependence of the United States vis-à-vis foreign countries for oil supply.
The issue of who bears responsibility for the oil spill devastating in golf is not, so far, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing claims of billions, is at the center of the accusations.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama must submit its conclusions in December.
In October, the Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the freeze drilling imposed after the explosion of the platform.
Following this decision, the various oil groups immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With more stringent control measures and more stringent security requirements, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which has discredited many accusations of corruption, is currently the subject of in-depth reforms.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced to remove the lucrative niches tax groups gas and oil.
actors industry are now publicly cautioned that the flow of food in the Gulf would be much lower than is the case so far.
"The government's aim is to curb the rapid growth of the sector of gas and oil," according to the result of a survey carried out in the sector by audit firm BDO, before the drilling ban imposed on Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Energy Alliance regrets the uncertainty this sector: "Nobody knows what will exactly with the regulation."
investment made in new support projects were postponed until further notice, at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni is dry
The water flowing in the rivers is oiled brown; it gives off a smell similar to that which exists in the petrol station: As a result of the leakage, billions of litres of crude oil have destroyed the country Ogoni in Nigeria.
The men live theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Do you exhaust not," the environmental activist to journalists for calm: "You now enough mud oil before the lens."
Nigerian 37 years attempted to photograph a young stuck in the muddy water up to the chest, and drag the fat that surrounds: This seems almost beautiful in the glow of water the color of the rainbow.
We can not see that underground water brown crude oil.
On the River Bodo-Jetty, Esther Badom said that once it was collecting the shrimp by entire buckets here.
But, in the meantime, calm waters have completely dried up.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil poured out of a pipeline exploded in the vast swamp.
fishermen living in the small town near Bodo must now swim for six hours to reach fish: The Ogoni country located at the heart of the Niger Delta is regarded as one of the most polluted regions in the world.
All the extent of the devastation is glaringly obvious when runs mangrove swamps crossings by the waters.
Instead of clear water, the motorboat with big brown water cradingue. Anyone who has his hand cut off any covered with oil.
roots small mangrove emerging like licorice sticks. The palm isolated are sadly hang their fins.
sought in vain to swarms of birds, as it usually present in the wetlands: when the outboard motor stops, a ghostly silence descends on this paradise of yesteryear like a gas station by the smell of it emerged.
"What is happening here is the war against the environment," said Mr. Celestine Akpobari air sad: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger for health."
The comparison of the wars.
The region inhabited by the Ogoni is a battlefield besieged for decades: More than 60 years ago, the first European explorers have entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa was executed later. In 1993, Shell has had to suspend its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Today, countries Ogoni is forbidden to society: While over 2 million barrel of the black gold daily pumped through more than 5,000 wells and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines across the Delta region, three times as big as Switzerland, the country's oilfields Ogoni are untapped, because the situation is too unstable for the oil group.
All the few hundred metres stand in water off the steel as bizarre sculptures: It means very affectionately "Christmas trees" warheads boreholes.
They have up to 50 years, most are consumed by corrosion to the benchmark.
Akpobari believes that a drilling such breaks from time to time in the piece, as a constant flow of crude oil spilled into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion gallons spilled on the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to last into the sea during the accident of the supertanker Exxon Valdez 21 years in Alaska, one of the biggest environmental disaster in the history of humanity.
Who must bear responsibility for the persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the player.
For Shell, sabotage and the siphoning of oil are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution. The environmentalists, for their part, see drilling warheads and perforated pipeline explosions as the main causes.
In 2008, American researcher Richard Steiner criticized Shell Group to implement security standards in Nigeria mainly less strict than anywhere else in the world: Only the failure rate of pipelines is "still much higher than alleures ."
Some forms of emerging mangroves to a location in the distance, like a workshop, full of gunk and installed air: They are completely naked and covered in gunk until the neck.
A twinkle under many barrels which sometimes connected with pipes, sometimes scattered the ground on the site should be found: a small refinery.
The heat of crude oil in a barrel for several hours, says Michael, the team leader.
Initially, gasoline into a container through pipes, then, at the end of the conduct drops kerosene fall and finally diesel.
For example, Michael and his four colleagues daily four 300 litres drums of diesel: "This reported 34 000 Naira, about 22 dollars.
Delta inhabitants to take advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil producer in Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal refiners can sell at a cheaper price than ridiculously low barely 40 euro cents per litre of diesel: Because they acquire their raw material.
offered by "protectors" which put huge pipeline network throughout the country of the Ogoni. According to experts, the country loses in this way at least 16 million gallons of crude oil in the Niger Delta.
Only a small part of the insignificant first temporarily stored illegally purified: The organized crime networks are also among its members of politicians and senior military, provide the lion's share of the tankers and dump it on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers that the debate on the question of whether the environmental disaster or rather subversive activities to the population or lax production mode is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not seen as intruders and if the foundations of the life of the fishermen were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries."
But, in the meantime, the Ogoni relations especially towards Shell are so deteriorated that it was no longer a question of the withdrawal of the group." Perhaps operators of other nationalities, such as Chinese, will prove best."
So, Michael became nervous.
"It is high time that you déguerpissiez" announced the robust oil worker.
"The soldiers can arise at any time."
If illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not arrested, but they offer bribes.
Even soldiers mainly from the north of the country will benefit all Nigerians.
"At any point of view, do the trick brought down our country," said Akpori.
The investigators discover defects in the construction of the reactors in the A380
The A380 is clearly a major security problem.
In considering an aircraft has made an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible defect that can lead to "a catastrophic failure of the reactor."
The airline Qantas now wants to lodge a complaint against the manufacturer of the reactor.
early November, Airbus passengers belonging to the airline Quantas had obviously been far more likely: During its investigation, the authority Australian air safety found that some A380 aircraft reactors were a serious security problem, and warned against a possible failure of the construction.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: It can cause fatigue cracks and leaks in the connection of the oil, said in a position paper issued Thursday by the ATSB.
It could lead to a "catastrophic failure of the reactors."
are concerned the reactors manufactured Rolls-Royce and equipping 20 aircraft A380 series.
The Airbus company Quantas, who had the landing emergency 4 November in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now started legal proceedings against the manufacturer of the reactors.
She filed a complaint with a federal court Australian headquartered in Sydney. This approach provides the opportunity to take legal actions against the company.
The Quantas director Alan Joyce, said that his company would seek damages in relation to the incident in early November.
Parts are parts and bearing surface was damaged during a fire in the engine.
According to Rolls-Royce is inflammation of the oil that is the origin of the damage.
After the incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators announced that tests on security will be realized superjumbos are also equipped with reactors.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said the spokesman ASTB, Mr. Martin Dolan.
The security problem is deemed important enough to inform all the parties concerned.
After the emergency landing his plane, the airline Quantas had grounded its entire fleet of the A380 for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily halted three of its 11 A380.
The company Lufthansa has replaced, as a precautionary measure, the A380's reactor.
The double-deck is the largest airliner in the world.
The snowfall throughout causes chaos in the transport
Germany any covered in white: In a night, snow has fallen on almost all over the country.
The chaos on roads, trains and planes are grounded.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
The winter cold Germany: The frigid temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered with snow Thursday night, which led to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, snow cover 15 centimetres in places.
The movement is severely restricted on several motorways and on many roads.
On National A7 in Flensburg, the staff has worked, but they could not overcome the snow continued to accumulate.
In addition, violent gusts swept through the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DHS) expected to flood the place on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
The piles of snow on motorways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That is why the bad weather warning Meteomedia announced purple warning level has been announced in the Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
In places, it dropped 30 centimeters of fresh snow that strong winds and the costs have dispersed.
Several trucks and cars remained stuck at night.
Even in saxe-Anhalt, police authorities announced severe disruption on the roads.
At the A2 highway, snow and wind led to an interruption of traffic and caused traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the snow had affected the A4 motorway and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, serious disruption of rail traffic took place in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The key issues are: the snow on the railways, fallen trees on railways, property or needles destroyed.
In Saxony, interrupt the interregional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg.
At Sallfeld, Thuringia, ICE to Munich has had to suspend his trip.
The firefighters and paramedics had to supply 165 passengers on the train in blankets, food and beverages.
Winds of snow swept roads.
The Falls snow led to numerous flight cancellations in major airports in Germany.

Thousands of people mourning minors who perished.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people have thought buried miners who had been declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
It had not yet been traced because the security situation of the affected wells continues to be precarious.
just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth submerged in water.
29 minors aged between 17 and 62 years of age had been buried underground.
A probe was introduced in the disaster area, but had found no trace of the survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gas and other explosions that followed, no relief team has been down in the mine for security reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities considered that minors had no chance to survive.
So far the body could not be increased.
Today, parents and friends organized a celebration in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered in the bright sun to Greymouth submerged in water in the south of the island of New Zealand.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 miners buried, 29 round that could see the names, helmets and lamps.
photos and personal effects, including clothes and surf boards, also had their place.

In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
Minors origin of South Africa and the United Kingdom also buried at the first explosion of 19 November.
The rescuers have begun to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine of the South Island of New Zealand.
The police commissioner Gary Knowles told reporters that when the masses of explosive gases are moved, burning temperatures inside the mine to begin to decline.
Go to hell, the warrior!
The film Splatter is an artificial film?
director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the former kind through his film, "Valhalla over Rising," the epic warrior.
At what public Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn Has think turning "Valhalla over Rising "?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) having one eye is captured; he releases his executioner and, with almost supernatural force, removes his opponents one after the other. This seems ideal for young male viewers to search a bloody, precisely because our hero used brutal methods of murder when he is in a bad mood, it severs the guts of its enemies without waiting for them to be dead.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the one-eyed said no word on his true name. Even the other characters are, at most, one or two sentences some ghastly screams of agony.
Otherwise, silent and feasting in the incredibly beautiful mountainous landscape in Scotland is the scene of the universe of the Vikings, there are about a thousand years.
This would be ideal more mature filmmakers have an interest to existentialism and for travellings excellent.
When a film is several groups, it is a pity that they are mutually exclusive.
The Winding director Refn is considered, since "Pusher" trilogy on the fierce drug trafficker and full of style, as a sort of Quentin Tarantinon Danish, but he refused to provide a little more mood mainstream or introduce a little less brutality in cinema.
Most supporters of film art must face the horror in the brain which spreads around the and intestines.
fans action films die of boredom, when one-eyed sailed for reasons that can freely interpreted, with a group of Christian missionaries violent in a ship to Jerusalem; they are drowned during an eternity by calm and fog before the crew arrives in America and continues to remain silent.
It is not surprising that "Valhalla over Rising" found no distributor of films in Germany and that it exists only in the DVD format.
It is mainly because of the beautiful images of poverty which deserved attention, but also because the image of an exciting film, from time to time, behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not the dialogues in the film, or coherent action, is the atmosphere, a fever dream turned into a film.
The viewer can not escape.
Refn him barely a moment of relaxation and cuts slowly throat with frigid images and sound gloomy, but especially with the elusive hatred from the heart of the characters.
Only a boy blonde, faithfully alongside the one-eyed, preserves a certain innocence, all others are motivated by anger.
More than anything, the one-eyed hero whose mobile are never known, but who is hell at any time to combat enemies and temporary allies becoming warrior, is perhaps sent the devil himself.
It represents decay, but perhaps also to those who are in any case, rotten.
"Valhalla over Rising" is an enigmatic film that can hate or admire, to the irritation, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatic experience.
Puzzling excavation work
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) provides further guidance on a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But countries refused to take a position on this subject, still less to submit to inspections.
In the night of 5 to 6 September 2007 around midnight, at least four F-15 fighter aircraft I Israeli attacked a mysterious building cube-shaped on Syrian territory.
It is situated on the bank of euphrate; the largest city located near 30 kilometres: it is the Dair as-Sur.
His name is contained in IAEA document, because it is the question of the reactor built by Syria appears with the aid of North Korea in rather boxy, hidden in a valley marked by lack of electric power.
According to a briefing of the intelligence services, the CIA, dating back to the end of April 2008, the current reactor, known as the nearby town, el-Kibar, would be able to produce plutonium, which could produce atomic weapons.
On the other hand, this technique is valid since the 1950s.
The CIA has shown a video presentation with satellite images blurred.
Through animation, it indicated the likely location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the Central is a miniature copy of the model nord-Coréen of the Yongbyon nuclear facility.
In addition, presented photos showing the building located near or even within it.
It seems that the reactor was on the verge of being put into service, but it was not yet equipped with the fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, has barely more information at that time, and with time the mystery deepens increasingly.
The former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a reactor el-Kibar, but had peu'indices showing countries developed "an active program of nuclear weapons ."
Some intelligence officials in Europe to be more cautious about this and speak only "the alleged reactor," even if they consider the submission by the CIA as "plausible ."
There is a lack of evidence, as well as to the IAEA.
Asked how it ensures that it has a nuclear reactor, a senior diplomat of the United Nations gave a terse response was saying that the IAEA had "sufficient documents to ask questions."
The Syrian certainly removed with haste on the rubble "unused military building" and a systematic levelling ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by the former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen, discovered el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by the men.
In addition, the IAEA has received through a Member State commercial providers satellite images showing the time that followed directly attack. it seems that they are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the sponsor, perhaps Israel has acquired exclusive.
It is impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity in an objective manner.
Syria has always ensured that it had never made a secret nuclear program and that it had not built reactor.
Damascus supports uranium found on the site from weapons used by Israel.
But IAEA has challenged that argument after analyzing particles as implausible.
Since that time, damas refuses any discussion on this issue, as on the satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to make a second inspection of the site el-Kibar and denial of access to the rubble of a building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel remains a stubborn silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, the Prime Minister at the time of the attack, said recently: "We will never comments on this subject."
Thus investigation on this case has dragged on since June 2008 without a result and that it "is increasingly becoming a serious problem for the credibility of the Agency ," as acknowledged by a Western diplomat senior service at IAEA headquarters in Vienna, ultimately it is a serious violation of the treaty banning nuclear weapons.
IAEA considers that to make progress, we must clarify the existence of three other facilities which must be "substantive" with the alleged reactor.
So far, the inspectors have not specified what facilities, or what their function or suspected to contain.
According to information published by the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung ," they are known within the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan quarter, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also name neighbouring towns.
The Institute of the independent Institute for Science and International Security (International Institute for Science and International Security in Washington identified these localities and discovered on satellite images on a complex near Masyaf which would most probably a suspicious objects.
It is possible that he is in a military base or directly to the side; it is exactly why Syria refuses access to IAEA inspectors from three sites.
In Vienna, claims that the Syrians fear that the inspection group is spies were sent on behalf of the United States by IAEA to spy on military installations.
Frankly, it is an intelligence provided by the American secret agents who attracted the attention of inspectors.
The IAEA has the information, including satellite photos indicating that the vehicles were made shuttle between the three sites and rather boxy stone to transport substances.
A Western diplomat senior said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "serve to fuel production."
It would have "no indications of sensitive activities," such as enrichment and reprocessing of uranium; processes that are indispensable to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor is certainly thanks to the enriched uranium.
However, there are strict plausible assumptions on the following basic questions: where should have come to uranium and we separated later plutonium needed to manufacture the bomb.
It is not known whether the rubble, which could hide traces of great value, were stored in three sites.
When hundreds of truckloads of land will disappear, the person will have information on the location of the rubble.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria has examined in 1998 mine salt al-Tibni, located just a few kilometres el-Kibar, across the Euphrates, to see if we can agree to the storage of radioactive waste.
In analyzing recent photos taken by a satellite for the account of the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, a former IAEA inspector, Mr. Robert Kelley has established a link between them and the reactor in question.
photos taken by a satellite, however, show that Syria has undertaken excavation work in the three sites of suspects and moved huge containers where the IAEA started to demand access to these places.
It is possible that this is a coincidence, but it has not helped to remove suspicion.
In it in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months to develop a plan for the inspections do. This plan should enable Syria to preserve any military secrets. Only time invested shows what great interest inspectors have in this case.
Meanwhile, Damascus has also ignored this proposal.
a year ago, while Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not be reported to this case," says, for example, Glyn Davies, US ambassador that evokes the past few months which is known as the special inspections, one of the most powerful means of the Atomic Agency has to implement its controls.
IAEA director, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already talked about "an option that I am open to the future ," but it is still reluctant.
This includes a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority of the Board of Governors of the IAEA and many of the 35 countries represented have no desire to see the situation escalate.
on the other hand, as the diplomat is to reflect: "At this point, if at the end of which they find nothing"
The love in the time of war
It goes wrong since Angelina Jolie has made its debut in the summer as the director.
She wrote the screenplay for itself: it is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and the rights of Serbian origin.
We know nothing about this story, but enough to cause unease.
A persistent rumor said that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with the executioner of Serbia during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women federations have immediately protested. In response, some film sequences in Sarajevo have been displaced in the last minute in Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary, but in post-production, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a newspaper, Bakira Hasecic organization of women victims of war sent correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and demanded to meet the actress Jolie herself is a goodwill ambassador for UNHCR.
It is not a diplomat. A few weeks ago it was proposed to these women hold a meeting with Hungary, but they have declined the offer.
"The meeting to be held in Bosnia," said Hasecic.
There has been no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie said long enough on its attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reported that the organization of Hasecic has subsequently recommended that the High Commissioner of the United Nations to withdraw as goodwill ambassador Angelina Jolie.
But, what kind of scenario Jolie Has written?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of his scenario, after some hesitation filming permission to Sarajevo, but it is not known why not then come despite this authorization.
The young author maintains itself, it does not pursue political goals with his film, that it is making great efforts that it is aware of the Yugoslav conflict. It maintains that it wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give the opportunity to all parties involved to express.
It remains vague about the content.
A second film synopsis circulating on the Internet. It is quite different: The lovers knew well before the beginning of the war. It meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim woman, was deported in the Serb concentration camp where the man worked as a guard.
This is a big difference with "a victim of rape amourache executioner."
The film Jolie has begun well before the war, of course.
The pressure on it, and expresses the Jolie is "unjust and based on erroneous information ."
Now only fanatics Hollywood can provide peace: In illegally putting this scenario in the Net, as many other previously.
Let us!

They provide a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This is a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these forecasts are, this will be a flow of emigration comparable to that which Ireland has suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which Irish enjoys great ease, grief is now taking place.
The economic crisis is, however, especially young Irish, well-trained, which have so far experienced only moments of happiness.
The loss of employment and social deprivation seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.

"The situation is a little crazy," he says on the threshold of his home for the first time after a long time.
"I won the silver in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I live almost."
It breaks of embarrassed laughter through the cold rooms.
The small house is in a residential area with gardens to care, expensive cars leading brands are stationed on access roads.
Four years, O'Donovan has purchased the house together with his sister for an amount of 380 000 Euros, 100 percent of the credit.
"It were the moments of madness, without doubt, the money was easy," he says.
Has fear that any collapse because of credit?
O'Donovan is a time, getting hot tea and said: "I have no children and I am young; all goes through, I can start afresh."
The building engineer does not like lamentations that it is often in recent times.

The routine democratic
The support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as private enterprise.
The crime has become a serious concern that unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the US in much of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarómetro poll taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey was conducted on a regular basis since 1995, following the changes in attitudes in the region.
Two elements are survey results this year, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the sunny mood in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its institutions.
The support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the Pacific South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6 per cent per year since 2002, the support for democracy from a minimum of 40 per cent in 2005 to 61% this year.
It has also increased in Mexico, where the economy rebounded after a sharp drop in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region are convinced democrats, thereby lowering the regional average (see table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with how their democracy works in practice; it is the same figure as last year but with a strong increase of 25 per cent in 2001 (Chart 3)
Some 34 per cent said they had confidence in their country, Parliament and 45 per cent in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but the strong increase compared to 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent).
A decade ago, economic problems in Latin America have undermined support for democracy.
If it was good for the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries had suffered a brief recession and benefited from strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America was reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty had increased slightly in 2009 and fell again this year, 32 per cent).
But the mood varies considerably from one country to another (see chart 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected by a widely shared sense of progress
What is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and violent crimes have increased.
This is only the second time since the poll started that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited the crime rather than the unemployment as the most important issue for their country (see table 5).
Approximately 31 per cent say that they or their family have been the victim of a criminal act during the past year; however, the figure is down from 38 per cent last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance reflects the increase in support for private enterprise and market economy: approximately 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, as against 56 per cent in 2007 (see chart 6).
Some 58% think that the market economy is the only system that would make their developed country, against 47 per cent last year.
Interestingly, 62 per cent of respondents in Venezuela are of this view (and 80% support private enterprise); even if the left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, expropriating many private companies.
Brazil is the greatest leader in the region, mentioned by 19 per cent of respondents (compared with 18% last year), followed by the United States (9 per cent, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9 per cent, down 11% from last year)
But the United States is considered to be the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A vote soiled
No one expected to be perfect in Haiti's general elections on 28 November.
But it was much worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the affected countries and plunged in fear.
presented ballot boxes and a new ballot, ballots scattered in goutières, ransacked offices of vote and intimidation
The polling stations opened late in the evening.
Many Hatïens, including many who have been displaced by the January earthquake, roamed in the neighborhood to find out where to vote.
Some of them have abandoned.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favorites, have denounced the fraud and called for the annulment of the election.
protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the top official in Haiti, the United Nations, sees the event as "a fairly good election in many respects ."
observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community have said cautiously that they did "not believe that these serious irregularities, had necessarily invalidated the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and its candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce preliminary results on 7 December.
The second round expected is scheduled for January.
Any hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, are removed from their initial appeal for the vote to be declared invalid.
But there may be problems if Mr. Célestin, little or no visible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second toura reached the second round.
With a cholera epidemic raging, and more than 1 million quake survivors still living in tents, it was feared that the participation would be.
Accordingly, many Haitïens wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disruption.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards necessary to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors are popular and legitimate government of the election as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, it is clear, Haitians are themselves.
The feet toward the center
weeks after becoming suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, received a wave of public sympathy that has improved its approval rate of 20 points, to over 50 per cent; it is its highest level since it was elected in 2007.
Yet, transforming it into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on the choice of Ms Fernández, visibly in mourning, according to which it would or not the intransigence of her late husband, the predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain unclear.
Mr Kirchner, who has continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, used to prepare budgets underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This has enabled the first couple to spend additional income.
Ms. Fernández government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has fallen into disarray following the death of Mr Kirchner of a heart attack on 27 October.
Some members of dissident movement Peron power joined Ms Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (where a Member has struck in the face by one of his peers and others have accused the government of corruption), Congress did not approve the budget for 2011.
"I am not going to argue," said the president.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be applied next year, leaving the president still greater leeway to spend at will.
The economy overheating widely: it is likely to grow by nearly 9 per cent this year.
The official rate of inflation now stands at 11.1 per cent but many private estimates and salary demands of the unions, this figure close to 30 per cent.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, has made it a priority to growth and poverty reduction, rather than to control inflation.
It has refused to deal with the IMF, it has harassed the private sector and served the INDEC, the statistical office, official falsifications of statistics on inflation.
Ms Fernández may now moderating these policies?
It called for talks between private companies and union leaders.
And officials say they want to limit pay increases next year to 6 per cent.
The economy was stimulated by high world prices for agricultural exports to Argentina.
But inflation has eroded the boost to growth following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
This is perhaps the reason for which Ms Fernández shows signs of wanting to re-establish financial relations of Argentina to the rest of the world.
This year, the government has concluded an agreement with bondholders who had rejected a previous restructuring forced debt, Argentina had not paid its deadlines in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some 6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could involve a surveillance by IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Economy Minister, announced that the Fund to provide "technical assistance" to design a new national index of consumer prices; this is a prelude to sanitation INDEC.
It is not clear whether Ms Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of his term, now that her husband is no longer at his side.
If it does, it needs to win the support of the middle class, including the kirchnerisme is very advocated.
When Argentines returned from their vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her has left.
If win another election will decide to renounce or not, without the noise, many policies of her husband.
A demi-hourra for China
Taiwanese voters are oriented towards being a closer union with the mainland.
What is Taiwan think his big brother located on the other side of the Strait?
Over 7.5 million voters on 27 November, 70% of those eligible to elect mayors and municipal councillors in five urban districts, in what is seen as a general assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma became a substitute for feelings to the continent, have developed innovative business links, including a free trade pact partial, in the largest reorganization of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but just.
Although his party the Kuomintang (KMT) has won three of the five municipalities, it has failed to win a majority of votes.
Instead, the Party démocrate-progressiste (DPP), which looked towards full independence of Taiwan, won nearly 50 percent of all votes for the KMT 45 per cent.
If this had been a presidential ballot, Mr. My problem.
Since it was elected two years ago, his party's vote share has fallen about 8% .
For the first time, the DPP has attracted voters, even with the KMT in the municipal councils.
The event unveiled the most Taiwanese elections key subjects, including campaign trucks hoopla and flags of the mass rally with girls dancing in the minimum.
A mysterious assassination attempt has also been perpetrated.
Sean Link, the son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, conducted a tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man in the crowd shot the young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, injuring and killing a passer-by.
Strangely, it has not been determined if the shooter wanted to harm Mr. Link or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any way, said Tsai Ing-wen, leader of the PDP, murder has had an impact on the election of leader suspicion on the DPP and turning voters to the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner in the elections was China.
It was striking how the mainland issue itself was absent.
Instead, candidates have added with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan is usually its independence and hates China military threat.
Thus, the KMT has the tendency to avoid the parade of its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from fanning the anti-China sentiment.
That is the answer to a new awareness that the Chinese enterprises are essential to the economic survival of Taiwan.
Mr. Ma, for its part, has claimed the confirmation as to whether its policy on China was acceptable to the majority of Taiwan.
It is expected that the Beijing government continues to provide trade facilities, in accordance with its strategy to deceive Taiwan, return home.
China has lost no time to send a negotiator in Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and cooperation.
While she, too, would like to see a political integration, but first things first.
Better to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP was reinvented itself.
It two years ago, it went wrong: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison following accusations of corruption.
President from 2000 to 2008, was a provocative for independence explicit.
But a new generation of moderate has emerged under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and PDP makes every effort to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been hailed as the DPP candidate to the presidency, as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that it can engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai has announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a contact point between the DPP and China, provided that their discussions can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that his party has a "credible alternative" to Mr. Ma hasty approach about China.
Mr. Chen seemed exasperated by this change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said that the candidate of the PDP would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to seek the presidency.
Even without the intervention of Mr. Chen, the DPP will be hard to choose between its potential candidates.
The KMT is introspection of oneself.
Mr. Ma assessments were low; despite a dizzying economic growth, the KMT candidate did not want to campaign with him.
His unpopularity appears to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between the rich and the poor.
A KMT spokesperson said that his firm and its local branches will be restructured.
The good results of the PDP suggest that support Taiwan rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "the point of no return has already happened."
Appointments to the Grammy Awards: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selection in the category "best new artist"
Perform at the request of the Chairman, and people are required.
Esperanza Spalding, the jazz bassist and singer 26 years picked by President Obama to occur during the ceremony of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, was one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a nomination in the category of "Best New Artist ."

His ambitious album of 2010," the Chamber Music Society, was certainly a step forward and, given his vocal style slightly engaging its skilful hands pop and funk and Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least a dotted line in Spalding compared to Norah Jones meteoric success in 2003, the closest equivalent to voters in the Grammy Awards, taking into account the jazz productions in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, voters in the Grammy Awards have rightly honored "Historicity" Vijay Iyer Trio in category "instrumental album," a transferred a shivering invigorating registration was a critical favorites last year.
Among these Iyer," Moody 4B" veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" keyboardist John Beasley will compete.
Trombone Shorty, favorite voice hoarse in New Orleans and invited frequent "Treme "HBO, was honored in the category of contemporary jazz; that also strongly towards a certain merger with albums Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with the steampunk won some earned recognition in the large category; compete with rich chamber-jazz Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland, whose album "Pathways" octet's live was a good example of the democratic control of the bassist as head of the group.

The Mosque of measles outbreaks won approval of the planning committee.
A draft mosque measles outbreaks has received the unanimous support of the local planning committee after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics in the draft that promoting both the terrorism that traffic congestion.
But the Commissioners have ruled Wednesday night that the new religious center respect local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many people have come to support Christians, Jews, Baha'is, you say," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Centre of measles outbreaks in the Valley, speaking Thursday morning.
"I am proud, as a US citizen."
"This shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They were just a very strong voice."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting started at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people speaking for or against the center, speaking time almost equally distributed, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's Web site.
"There is more to America," wrote one.
"This is another planet monkeys with Miss Liberty died in the sand."
"America has fallen."
Islamic centres planned also prompted protests in other parts of the country, including at Ground Zero, the site of the attacks of September 11, 2001, attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in measles outbreaks in the Valley.
His congregation of 135 families co-existe without incident in the Riverside County for years, but it wanted a greater and better space warehouse leased on a shared ownership with a water filtration systems manufacturer.
The new mosque 24.943 square feet to the Mediterranean style architecture would be composed of two minarets and would amount to 43 feet high.
It would a 4.32 hectares on the road site Nicolas about two miles east of High Chaparral.
Opponents can still appeal against this draft council.
A microbe tolerant arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which may use arsenic as one of its nutrients, broadens the scope for new forms of life on Earth, and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacterium here on Earth, they say that this shows that the life opportunities beyond the major elements that were considered essential.
"This body has a dual capacity."
"It can be developed or phosphorus, with arsenic."
"That is why it is very special, even though it is far from being a form of life really "foreign," said Paul Davies, C. W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report in the online edition Thursday in the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur.
But researchers have found that the bacteria discovered in the Mono Lake in California, is able to continue to develop after replaced phosphorus by arsenic.
"One wonders what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, know what life is, said Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, announced a press conference to discuss, which did not disclose the details of the discovery, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This was not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other global environments, the agencies might be able to use other elements to actuate the biochemistry and "standard ," that we are absolutely necessary for life, could not be established," said Charles Cockell, Professor, Institute of Scientific Research and spatial, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows a substitution to another basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," added Cockell.
This was not a fortuitous discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon Institute Astrology NASA, which conducted the study, has chosen the Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, it has been speculated that a microbe briefing two substances might be able to replace one another.
"Arsenic is mainly because his behavior is really similar."
"Accordingly, difficult to distinguish these elements separately."
"But arsenic is sufficiently different to function not just as phosphorus; cuts inside and, to some extent, the gum implementation of our biological machine," said Anbar.
researchers have collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed to increasing concentrations of arsenic has been able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form using arsenic may occur naturally or elsewhere on the Earth or on a planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that the arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus, was not new; but nothing has ever shown that it could walk.
Arsenic was more frequent in early Earth, she said, and researchers have hypothesized that the first life forms could have used.
This suggests that there may be other ways to form life, not just how life on Earth was formed at the beginning," said Foster, who was not part of the research team Wolfe-Simon.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two dogs exhibit stolen have been recovered in Compton
The other two dogs exposure on four stolen outside a motel in Bellflower have been recovered, the Los Angeles County sheriffs have announced Thursday.

Peek and Rickard, who lived in Redding, are in town this weekend in the championat National AKC/Eukanuba" in Long Beach, where they intended to submit the Trace.
other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions with other tests prescribed in the days before the exhibition "AKC/Eukanuba," said Peek in the Times on Wednesday.
The Southern California is one of the stops on the tour exhibition canine almost a couple months.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard had checked into the motel.
They often remain in motels and park their truck outside, just to the side of their bedroom window.
They have taken three other dogs, a puppy Boxer, a Parson Russell terrier and a épagneul Breton, who are still with them in the motel room.
But they left Akitas and corgis, thick fur, in the truck where it would be more cost.
They have a little open windows so that the dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard have reported the theft of the truck at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.

It is not clear whether the reward has been granted Thursday.
The lion is ready to be the restructuring of MGM is awaiting the final green light for the Court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM has finally given the green light to start from scratch.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York has officially welcomed Thursday the pre-packaged plan by creditors, according to which approximately $5 billion of debt would be wiped; paving the way for the entertainment business, with 86 years of existence, to concentrate its efforts on the production and distribution of films and TV programs.
With Thursday's decision, that the plan meets the requirements of the bankruptcy code in the United States, there was no legal obstacle remaining before MGM to refloat the founding Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the Directors-General of what will be a studio eased.
The staff will be reduced to approximately 320 400 at the outset.
MGM will not emerge really Chapter 11 as JPMorgan Chase will not concluded a credit facility of $500 million, to finance the new operations and the MGM productions.
It is being distributed under license by the investment bank, which faced itself to $75 million, and should be funded to mid-December.
The studio restructuring process began in May 2009 when the investment bank Moelis& Co. has been hired to advise management on how to put its finances because it did not pay interest amounting to $300 million a year.
In August, Director General, Harry Sloan, was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and an expert in reorganization known for his work with Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Attempts to Moelis and Cooper to resolve the financial difficulties of the MGM and over 140 creditors studio have taken much more time than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, the company up for sale.
However, the auction has attracted few bidders among which none of them was willing to pay the sum of 2 billion more creditors were research.
In the spring of this year, it was again while MGM's team had started working on a restructuring plan which, after months of internal disagreements and debates, has finally been approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM fate officially bankruptcy in the coming weeks, the companies Moelis and Cooper receive bonuses of several million dollars for their work.
Moelis& Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper enterprises, which raised $375,000 per month for their services company, will receive a "success" $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum to revitalize the production of MGM, which released only one movie this year, and an annual list of seven or eight films would, starting in 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "Hobbit," with Warner Bros.
The studio must conclude a separate loan of $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of these two films, which must be done by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, which holds about 18% of MGM's debt, has tried to achieve a merger with Lions Gate Entertainment studio, where he is the main shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies have not reached an agreement.
Tech Toys to keep your budget in balance gifts
Although the main candidate for the most wonderful toy this year the IPAD, followed perhaps by the Microsoft video game system, Kinect, both can make a significant gap in your budget gifts.
Consider, for the price of one iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes to $99 and a game Kinect cost the same price that 10 skipping ropes classic pearls, or approximately 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently I visited three national toy sellers, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - to see electronic toys that I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that Moore's Law has evolved, the technological toy this year is likely to have more force; and cost the same price or a little less compared to last year.
In addition, while there is generally less new toys associated websites, two of the best-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, more tender.
And toys button cell batteries are increasing, as well as toys rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from the Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and older) are stuffed toys from the size of a guinea pig who sing a note when you press on the belly.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second is to compose a song.
If you buy more, they are singing out about harmony.
Caution: once you start to support, you can no longer stop you.
To combine the song to dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and more) is the best choice.
Guided by Elmo Live technology last year, 14 inches animatronic doll plays games turn as the Simon Says and can make the lunar dance through its innovative articulated feet with wheel lock-up.
Children who have essyaé toy uses Mickey as the dance instructor while their parents complain of a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you will recall of Alphie first computerized educational toys.
He returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40 for three years and more), with a backpack filled with playing cards questionnaire designed to transform a ride in the car in a session with a auto-correction and a valve.
If you're suspicious when your child is your smartphone, three alternative Territories.
The Mobigo of VTech ($ 60 for 3 to 8 years) is cheaper and easier to use, with a QWERTY keyboard, although the games do not educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($ 70, for 3 to 12 years), is the first major revision of the range Leapster, with a more recent and more luminous screen.
No version compatible with old cartridges.
The iXL of Fisher-Price ($ 90 for 3 to 7 years) uses a system iTunes to provide electronic games and books and has an entry for the SD card to show photos of the family.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($ 30, Hasbro for 8 years and over) is a set of five blocks barely bigger than a match box, each with its own LED screen.
The objective is to train the words placing blocks in line before that time elapses, is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
Increasingly, the toys have a connection online.
In on the basis of their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet in Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2 "Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5 for 6 to 12 years), which includes a room marked a hidden code.
When you buy the code online, your child receives sufficient appropriations to store the Club Penguin for two articles to the choice.
It may be a roller skates or a pet toy Puffle.
Slightly larger than the hair after your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($ 10 for 5 years and above) is the last microrobot cell button.
The false he is moving quickly on 12 pulp silicone vibrant in random directions.
It is fun to do a labyrinth of blocks to see if it can find its way through.
It is also strong.
ours has resisted a drop of kitchen table and even a temporary passage in the mouth of the dog.
Providing more soft law enforcement in China
Tang Shenbin survey of a place in the city as a sergeant in the Urban Training severely inspecting its nerve burdens, low voice with a military authority orders.
It wanted the female members of chengguan, responsible for large public order in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and their penchant for violence -- to pass a certain impression to a whole spectators.
"Keep right!"
"Be piercing!"
Show them, he said, "What are the beautiful girls!"
Four girls just past adolescence in white gloves, dressed in jackets and trousers identical olive color, stiffened up nicely.
Four pairs of shoes black heel, aligned to the rule.
Four hats treated perfectly perched at the top of the hair tied in a knot striped blue and white.
"Personally, I think they have a seemingly average," said Mr. Tang, with disdain.
"The models are nice."
More government tried to refresh the image China urban inspectors.
A town has required that all new recruits have a diploma of higher education.
The Guangdong Province exchanged the greyish green uniforms against a blue supposedly more engaging.
Wuhan, in central China, has replaced baisser-les-yeux strong: in 2009, a report indicated that 50 officers had surrounded a snack trolley uncontrollable launching black eyes, strongly for half an hour, until the peddler up its business and parte.
Xindu, an urban district 680,000 people in Chengdu, has chosen to make a big operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its police on the streets of urban areas of 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, the curve and their young age.
The idea is to give the police roughed side softer, more feminine.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson could have difficulties to attract eyes on this brigade urban underground in China
And, critics say.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized to enforce municipal orders imposing administrative fines or other sanctions.
But Chinese media portrayed new a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the Hubei province have beaten to death a observer after he used his mobile phone to film the process to disperse a protest against a landfill waste.
last year, a training manual for the inspectors in Beijing, stole and online, described how effectively overcome offenders without bloodshed.
This year in Shanghai, a peddler of watermelons was abandoned with a brain injury after a scuffle with five officers.
A video game steeped in violence, available via download online, shows Chinese inspectors trained in assault of street vendors.
"Chengguan marked the government," said last year China Daily, a national publication, after yet another controversial tactics.
The newspaper called "a real complete cleaning."
Skeptics say that approach.
After the district has spent an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News, was asked whether women had real tasks or whether they were a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The announcement district required women candidates, aged between 18 to 22 years, beautiful silhouette and the five facial features in good order."
They must have a larger than average, 1.6 metres or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
officers have said that the work was physically too painful for women over 25 years.
"It is their image is important," said an officer of the district in Rednet. com, a website quasi-governmental.
"First, qualities of external candidates to determine if they agree; it is size, weight, facial features, etc."
Next in temperament and "internal qualities."
Women Chengguan as flower vases, he said, adding: "In addition to being the vases, they have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the management office of the district of the city, do not agree with this description.
But he noted that for the height requirements were the standard in many Chinese offers of employment for both sexes.
This is the case of the requirement on the order of facial features.
What does this mean beautiful is a matter of debate among Chinese.
While persons with disabilities or disfigured should not apply.
"We can not allow a person who box or a hunchbacked come to be here," said Mr. Zheng.
"It would not be a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrol the place Baoguang near a monastery, is aged 22 and cheeks pommelées with a finely curved mouth.
It does not consider the value of its appearance as the gender-based, at said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked a disillusioned.
Xu Yang, his colleague in the pits aged 21, said: "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They do not oppose their mandate is limited, they said, because they have greater career ambitions that simply drive sellers in the streets where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a dozen hawkers moving quickly on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell more possible buns or bowls of tofu before fleeing.
"Master Wang, you have to leave."
"We have already said several times!" said Ms. Xu while a seller fled on foot, leaving temporarily vélo-charrette to noodles.
agents describe their functions more as monotonous as difficult.
"It is almost the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, aged 20 years, who is studying marketing after work.
"routine."
One reason is that female officers do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate property sellers.
They can not threaten to report violators to their male superiors.
This tends to protect the sudden public exhibitions of animosity against bureaucracy are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, revolted after false rumors spread that the agents of chengguan had killed a seller.
In one night, more than a dozen police officers and agents of chengguan were injured, 14 government vehicles have been reversed or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But the calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the placid Baoguang, where female officers patrolling this morning, more than 50 people gathered on the street corner.
agents confiscated a motorbike which was being repaired on the pavement, rather than in a store, as required by the regulations.
The owner of motorcycle shouted to the scandal.
A showdown 15 minutes followed before the police, in the face of the disaster, a pianist to elbow blows to their vehicle and are parties with the bike and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, committed to the male team coordinator, remained behind, his white badge returned to hide its name.
As officers female coordinators -- men aged 40 years or more, are purely a supporting role.
Contrary to them, they are not trained to maintain an image of oil.
"Sometimes we have verbally."
"Sometimes we stand physically," said Mr. Li said a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it is the public begins."
The prosecutors will charge citizens if they not Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors have lifted the criminal charges on Senator John Ensign, resulting in a case linked to a former campaign aide and its efforts to obtain the lobbying work for the husband of the woman, announced Wednesday, the senator's lawyers.
The decision puts an end to the serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, Republican of Nevada, which was seen as a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential until the scandal around its case to make headlines national last year and his career.
Mr. Ensign's office said he was "very pleased" by the decision, the result of an investigation a year.
Senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Lawyers for Mr. Ensign said that the Justice Department had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer under investigation and that he had no intention to maintain accusation against him in this case."
The Department of Justice declined to comment on that.
The announcement came as a surprise to many external ethics lawyers at the Department of Justice, according to which there would be significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign allegedly conspired to violate federal criminal prohibition on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first reported in October 2009 in the New York Times, showed that Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain a lucrative lobbying work for Mr. Hampton silence and his wife, Cynthia, concerning the case of Senator with it.
Ms. Hampton once served as treasurer for Ensign's campaign.
Mr. Ensign has contacted a number of donor policies to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobbying for them; according to documents and interviews.
Given that Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was banned for a year by law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
The ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems inconsistent with the prohibition of so-called revolving door lobbying.
According to the evidence has been made public, "there appears to be a prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to violate and substantial violation of the law of the revolving door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients of an investigation by the government.
Although judge department refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the case of Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers have said that the department appeared wary of political prosecutions after a number of setbacks received high-level public integrity section, including last year's decision to drop charges against former Senator Ted Stevens accused of misconduct.
federal prosecutors have clearly fear to take up arms," said Melanie Sloan, director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group that has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's main lawyer, said in an interview that he had received on Monday a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor and monitoring the next day, saying that the department did not seek charges against his client.
The team of lawyers for Mr. Ensign had cooperated with prosecutors to try to persuade Senator, as his office has reaffirmed on Wednesday in a statement, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to specify the legal arguments it had made to the prosecutor.
"I am not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice, except to say that we believe that they have made the right decision ," at said.
The last month, the Federal Elections Commission has decided an independent investigation following a complaint by the ethics group, contending that the $96,000 payment by parents of Mr. Hampton Ensign violated the electoral law.
The electoral commission said that it had insufficient evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a company of Nevada that has long supported Senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, the Chief of Staff, Mr. Ensign, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he "was "Ministry of the Interior on an issue.
Mr. Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another client of Nevada, Allegiant Air, and requested the Secretary of Transportation to fix a meeting on behalf of the airline after Mr. Hampton to lobbying.
When new case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his post of leader fourth Republican in the Senate.
After kept a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago that he intends to run for a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator had hoped that the ethics committee quickly follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and put an end to its investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue its hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
The Cheshire discussed to Twitter
A half dozen of them were typing away in the rows of the courtroom.
They sent every minute, reports of horrific testimony via Twitter.
At the end, the defense said that there were more than 140,000 messages on the trial of the case of rape and children tied to their beds in a house which was set on fire.
Thursday trial widely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, should lead to a formal end where the judge to impose the death penalty, approved by the board.
But Mr. Hayes's lawyers have already filed to the court describing arguments appeal, likely to be in the courts for years.
What is provocative is that intense coverage of the trial, as well as widespread use and extended by journalists of Twitter -- have created an "atmosphere of the circus," a saturation if widespread and instantaneous with incendiary details that the board has been badly affected by the passions of the public.
The request could push the appeal judges to discuss whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
"I have experience at this trial and I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the courtrooms infringes a person's rights to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, the lawyer for Mr. Hayes, chief lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. Blue of the Superior Court of the State, tersely dismissed the claims in the judgement last week, saying that the media were "carefully monitored" and that there was no evidence that the board had been driven by passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the issue.
The appeal courts recognize for decades that media coverage of high-profile cases may raise questions about the fairness of the trial.
In a judgement of 1966, the United States Supreme Court has quashed the conviction of an osteopath in Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, supporting its decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere at the trial because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television and film "The fugitive."
Some lawyers have said that the appeal courts seized review for half a century later, the conviction of Mr. Hayes may be curious given the argument that new rules could be required to manage communication courtrooms, imagined at the time of the case of Dr Sheppard.
"There is a general concern about the impact of new media" in the trial, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that she had been arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue asserts that some judges of appeal could be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of instantaneous communication from courtrooms could allow a fair trial.
Twitter's case is only one among many others described by lawyers for Mr. Hayes, likely to be discussed for years; delayed implementation.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes suffered an injury when the Blue judge refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them pictures of macabre crime scenes during jury selection.
Some jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers say they will also contest the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unfairly deported one juror, who had been critical to prosecutors, and that he improperly put pressure for a verdict in taking the unusual decision to bring the jury deliberations in a weekend.
The jurors had not been kidnapped.
But their arguments on the intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that case dominated the media in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for the post of governor and the Senate of the United States.
They maintained that the computer media continued to stoke the flames of emotion in the case.
"The scramble daily tweets media, cameras and journalists to the courthouse," wrote lawyers, "resembled nothing that had been previously seen here in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national level."
Their focus on coverage of Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists have said that the claim that the new instant were more incendiary statements released more slowly, was a luddiste which would lead to the policy governing media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers have said that the appeal were often attracted arguments according to which social and technological changes required adaptation by the courts.
Lawyers for Mr. Hayes insist on this claim.
In their case, they refer to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, which had overturned the conviction of Dr. Sheppard due to media coverage of the trial and they indicated that they would use the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," wrote ``, represent the Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
The civility can bridge the divisions?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, civility broke out in Washington this week.
Is it a harbinger of a genuine bipartisan cooperation forward or an illusory time before the rapid return to partisan fight in the capital?
The meeting Tuesday between President Obama and the leaders of Congress has produced no breakthrough on major issues that need to be addressed during the session "a lame duck ."
But obviously, there was at least a polite discussion on the differences of the two sides as well as the recognition of their shared responsibility to govern rather than another episode where each side wanted. rating point gap.
Wednesday's public meeting of the Committee on the president's deficit was equally civilized, despite political differences remain between members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created a mutual respect across the ideological divide; but which, however, still divides members.
It is barely sufficient to declare a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a trial period and mutual test in order to obtain the signs of cooperation and compromise, while assessing the limits of public opinion and patience of voters for a partisan war renewed.
That is why the Tuesday meeting and subsequent comments participants unveiled a minimum requirements or accusations.
philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change which has existed over the past two years.
Regardless of whether taxation, spending, health care or rights, the two sides are miles away.
However, the November election had moderate Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed the tone," said Pete Wehner, a staff member of the Bush administration, now at the Centre of Policy ethics and public.
"It is inevitable after the election.
The elections are partisan passions and then they estomptent.
This is good."
On some issues, including those on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats had no choice but to find a solution.
The Bush's tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of that.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve a part or whole, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment benefits, not least because the Republicans can not afford to give the impression that they are in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy, while refusing to unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After meeting Tuesday at the White House, more optimism over a possible agreement on issues raised during the session on "lame duck ," with the ratification of the pact "New START ."
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution, warns that fruitful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the session "blade duck" does ménera not necessarily better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress convened in January.
Instead, he said, the disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
"Once the things that need to be made to be the psychology in the short term will be a confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed its scepticism was widely shared that the civility would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what happens between now and 2012 as a pré-spectacle or a shadow-boxing compared to the main event in 2012, at said.
The reasons are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters present tea which contributed to its establishment.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers they go too far, they know they must try to live up to their promises to reduce public spending and to repeal the new law on health care.
These partisan positions are already clear in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the Committee of the deficit which include reforming the tax code and to increase certain taxes, raising the retirement age and cutting costs.
co-chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, according to themselves, imposed the deficit issue on the public agenda in a way that can not be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in committee, composed of 18 members, for the purposes of their plan as a formal recommendation, and they have found it difficult to reach this number.
The greatest resistance remains among the elected group; this suggests that there is on tax matters, at least today, few grounds or willingness to compromise.
Galston foresees two phases in the fighting between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first will next year in the form of partisan battles, as Republicans challenged the Obama budget, taxes and health care; and then to be followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What is the cause of change?
The public opinion.
There is ample evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still wants to see the two parties to work together.
If the confrontation leads to a deadlock, as in 1995, then both parties to observe carefully the reaction of the public.
Anyone who will be judged loss should change course and find compromises.
But this would be an optimistic view.
spirit and partisan polarization are higher today than they were in the mid 1990s and there seems to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans in Congress that there were between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more consistent election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on the part of both parties to find common ground on the issues that divide them yet.
American documents disclosed described Moscow as a haven for corruption
The city is in the hands of a "Kleptocratie" and pass a party until the Kremlin bribes and the protection that it collects money, reported the United States Embassy in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service are enormous racketeering that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only legitimate businesses but also organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical of power" - takes its share of the money will go to the top level.
The note, which was sent to Washington as Ambassador John Beyrle was posted Wednesday on its Web site Wikileaks.
The note is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still the mayor of Moscow; and it is largely responsible for corruption.
It was dismissed in October by President Dmitry Medvedev but there has since been little trace.
Luzhkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a construction company, have always denied the accusations of corruption over the years and has won several defamation trial on those charges.
In September, he stated that a Russian television station, where he was questioned about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "It is crazy, it is throwing is anything."
The Russians believe an overwhelming majority, their society is corrupt; according to the polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in a report of the Embassy; and it is outrageous that this would be of a foreign country diplomats to do so.
The direct link established between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people to appoint "dysfunctional" and said that the government was more like a kleptocracy that a government "Embassy.
"criminal elements enjoy "krysha" (the term used in the criminal world/mafia, which literally means "roof" or protection) which passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through the bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"The analysts to identify a three-tiered structure in the criminal world, Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, MVD and militias are second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fills a gap in some areas where the city does not provide services."
The report indicates that the FSB breaststroke money more large companies and that police targeted small.
A source, he said, "was that business owners in Moscow included that it was preferable to obtain protection of the MVD and the FSB (rather than organized crime groups, because not only have more weapons, more money and more power than the criminal groups, but they are also protected by law."
"That is why the request for protection by criminal gangs is not so high."
The note said that, although the collection of money should be extended, protection itself can be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subjected to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their business to close under a pretext or another.
Medvedev referred several times to the fight against corruption, but he admitted that little progress.
The Embassy note transmits reports alleging the men who make the bags, probably filled the money until the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrats," said in a recent interview Gueorgui Satarov, director of think tank Director of Indem" in Moscow.
"But it is part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of a political class because they do not exist in Russia."
Without the political opposition, without the separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to Director of Indem, corruption costs would amount to Russia as a whole, more than $300 billion a year.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are classified at least corrupt).
note disclosure of the American Embassy, which was completed yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, going with the certainty of discontent within the Russian government; although Luzhkov can be blamed, to a certain extent, the failures of Moscow, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is in the process of resolving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN's Larry King, Putin has suggested that the WikiLeaks documents could be a manufacturing and reacted with anger at what US diplomats had disclosed calling Batman and bringing Robin Medvedev.
"The problem is that it is our interaction, the important factor of internal policy in the country, he said.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this be done with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to the ethics."
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge forced to confront the past
In a poorly lit class room with concrete walls decrepit, director of secondary school in Anlong Veng referred to the man who had constructed, the last Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here like Ta Mok."
"It was a good leader; and he cared for his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, aged 42.
Known as "butcher" for his brutality, when he was head of the Khmer Rouge, commander remains popular in this isolated stronghold of the Khmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia, where it has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge went to government, loyalty is finally called into question in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum has enabled victims to deal publicly with the people who participated in the scheme.
In June, the government has distributed a manual high school, for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly conducted with the United Nations, delivered its first sentence on a former member of the Khmer Rouge, condemning, 35 years in prison, the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch ."
Faced with this situation, the anxiety has increased to veterans of the Khmer Rouge in Anlong Veng; complicating the reconciliation efforts and their wills to reintegrate in Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent body which conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"The situation creates divisions within the families."
During the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease and overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government of Pol Pot-Unis in 1979, the regime and its army have fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
Here, they launched an insurgency that has lasted until the last movements of a visit in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla base located in the western mountains of Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a response to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of combatants of the Khmer Rouge have begun the defection to the government, culminating with the capitulations Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had head, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without their benefactors, most veterans of the Khmer Rouge have sunk in abject poverty, common to rural areas of Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic movement.
Although some officers of the elite of the Khmer Rouge have kept their posts in local leader in exchange to be disarmed, it is the farmers unskilled low rank and file.
"These people have received very little follow-up after capitulation," said Sok Leang Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are soaked the agrarian utopian ideology."
"They have been raised in a framework to do business is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, aged 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as poor rice farmer.
"The life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok has everyone."
But now, life is difficult because we need to meet our own needs."
The Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also caused concerns here.
The court should, at the beginning of next year, to begin the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Khmer Rouge.
The mandate of the court is to try senior leaders and those most responsible for crimes but it has not said if it continued beyond these four cases.
We need more to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation are forward-looking Im Chaem, aged 64 years, the former head of a district in Banteay Meanchey province under Khmer Rouge rule in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told the researchers of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia that it had supervised the construction of the dam Trapeang Thma, a project where thousands forced workers have died.
recently during a torrid evening, Im Chaem work in field near his house on stilts, on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
While the sun cast long shadows on the grass parched, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past in the Khmer Rouge.
If the court convened, she said she would refuse to go there.
"Cambodia is peaceful and stable," at the she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court had several suspects; experts and historians dispute this.
"Cambodia has to dig a hole and bury the past, at said.
But confront the past is all that Cambodia must do in order to move forward, said Youk Chhang, documentation center.
"The reconciliation in terms of Khmer is to reconnect the broken pieces, he said.
"We must put the pieces together so that we can understand."
The center has produced the first manual approved by the Government on the Khmer Rouge, "A History of Democratic Kampuchea, 75 pages."
It has distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history books of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained at least four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know few details of the Khmer Rouge, despite links in the city.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at the high school in Anlong Veng, stated that the new book was helping students understand a significant part of their history.
But his parents have reacted with skepticism when he returned with the book at home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he said.
"They are wary because they do not know exactly how many people the court will continue."
Such resistance has rendered a complex and difficult process of reconciliation," said Sok Leang.
But public forums, and the court is beginning to have an impact, at said.
However, Khmer Rouge retain a respect strong here.
In the heights of mountains Dangrek, a path, overgrown with weeds and strewn with plastic bags, led to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a tin roof crayfish.
The body of Pol Pot was burned by a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, aged 31 years, sales of mobile phone roadside, said she knew nothing about the man who was cremated.
"But it has a great spirit; and many people go there to pray," she said.
It was the anniversary of Nuom Sothea and, later that day, she planned to walk to the last resting place of Pol Pot where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in the hope to bring luck.
Belarus is prepared to give up its stock of weapons-grade uranium
The Government of Belarus has announced on Wednesday that it would abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a key ingredient for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials around the world
The agreement was disclosed in a joint communiqué issued after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met by Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov of Belarus, on the sidelines of a security summit.
The US government had tried for years to convince the Belarus to renounce the highly enriched uranium and seemed to have emerged on the horizon last spring.
But American officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations have been conducted with Belarus over the past two months to eliminate 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a research center in Belarus.
This opened the way to an agreement Wednesday to eliminate the remaining approximately £ 500, according to an official who spoke condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of the nuclear security summit of 47 nations, organized on the initiative of Obama; when Belarus was excluded.
Apparently it was good to get an invitation to the former Soviet republic following the summit in 2012.
"I am really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit in 2012 the nuclear security summit."
"This proves that this process works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for global security, a group promoting nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant step," conducted by Belarus.
Obama is committed to Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the US government has assisted six countries rid themselves of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have made under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Summit on Nuclear Safety of Obama, the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, declared that the nation would never turn away from its uranium.
"We have kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially a weapons-grade uranium and low-enriched uranium," said Mr Lukashenko.
"This is our product. .. We are not going to make dirty bombs, and we will sell it to anyone."
"We are going to use for research purposes, that is all."
Belarus is closer to the United States a few months ago; however, expressing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implemented to eliminate uranium in Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the equipment had been slightly irradiated, indicated officials.
It was loaded on a train that has come over 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and eliminated, said the officials.
The second operation was completed Monday and was carried out by air, according to officials.
The US government has spent $13 million in its efforts, in large part to replace research facilities Belarus with low enriched uranium unsuitable for weapons.
"A careful coordination and organization have been implemented with a view to strengthening confidence "; leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an official of the energy department specializing in the Global Threat Reduction.
According to estimates by the Center for the Study of Nonprolifération James Martin, Belarus this year at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus seeks to eliminate its stockpiles by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of the harsh repression by Lukashenko on Human Rights.
But the statement Wednesday suggested a potential revival.
"While welcoming the progress on these issues of global security, the United States and Belarus have recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus were essential to improve bilateral relations; and essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The government has not issued any objection to the CIA flights
The government has not issued any objection to the CIA flights with prisoners of the Taliban and Al Qaeda in the direction the Guantanamo through Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the Ambassador of the United States in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks daily El País, adding that the first Vice-President of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish Executive informed for "pouvoir'démontrer were adequate vigilance on foreign aircraft across Spain."
In June 2006, according to a report of the Council of Europe accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, a meeting was held between former US ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernandez de la Vega.
Vice-President acknowledged that the Council had surprised the Zapatero Government offside" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
De la Vega emphasized that Spain has no objection to the intelligence flights over the Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "taken by surprise," said Aguirre in a cable.
The Ministry of External of that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, reported to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this matter the profile of the lowest possible, even if, as it was in the hands of judges, the Government had a limited capacity to influence ."
turn, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente Gonzalez sent to the Embassy that it would not block the judge to ask the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any element of the offence, any sensitive information," explained the Embassy after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States showed when their concern for the "apparent coordination between Spanish and German prosecutors" the CNI o declassified information of the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators to complicate our efforts to move the case quietly between Governments ," regretted the Aguirre.
In March 2007 during a lunch between the ambassador of the United States and the Internal Minister, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, commented that "even if the Spanish judges are madly jealous of its independence and make what they consider appropriate ," he had instructed his staff "to avoid the comments of overheated rhetoric, trying declined the temperature ."
The ambassador expresses also its concern for the PP action in this case.
"Despite its overall orientation pro-American, our experience suggests that the fact that the PP certainly will benefit from any indication that the Zapatero Government has tolerated or deliberately ignored the United States actions that could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if the revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," said.

Members of the People's Party would 4 seats in Congress and the CHP to lose 9
With the results of 18-N, PP could be decisive in the municipes Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After votes and the Members registered significant increase in autonomous elections, PP Catalan has already covered the general because, although there is progress or not, the outlook is more positive, because the number of votes obtained by the training in those concerned double normally receives in Catalan.
Thus, popular Catalan obtained 610.473 votes in the 2008 general during that autonomous in 2006, they had obtained 316.222.
The last Sunday, the CPP won 384.091 votes.
If maintains this upward trend, desired a diversion from the votes of the CHP and the retention of the electorate, this training analysts have calculated that, if there would be a general election, the CPP could the past 8 to 12 Members of Congress, while CiU from four (now 10) and CCS would be neither more nor less 9 (25).
These calculations would see that Catalan is fundamental for the PP and the PSOE.
Analysis of popular, ERC would lose a Member - he has three now, while the COLI keep a Member or from one.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the more the next appointment in May 2011 for concerned municipal, where popular may also be decisive for the end of the hegemony of the Socialist in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, administrations handling the budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists as popular are agreed that CCS could lose the mayor of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Girona, where the Socialists would the majority the possibility to use their traditional partners, the ERC and the COLI.
Taking into account the Republican debacle, it would not be fanciful this training to lose its representation in the municipality of Barcelona, it is necessary to obtain 5 per cent votes-.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, the Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can be protagonists fall in the capital city of Tarragona, where they have ruled with the PP before the current Socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
At Lérida, the PP has recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to MCS, including the mayor, Mr. Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy, during the last campaign, they have found several times.
The popular recorded progress in other municipes important Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.

Geriatric claims that the deaths have not been due to "lack of action"
owners center Olot does not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed 11 older persons
The geriatric The Caritat of Olot (Girona) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the harm caused to the institution of criminal behavior by Joan Vila Dilmé, nurse killed at least 11 older persons for which he was responsible in the meantime that it worked.
The residence, Joan Sala, accompanied by lawyer center, Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of The Caritat would be able to exercise the indictment against the responsible" for the deaths, but "the rule of law and the responsibility require us to assume the continuation of civil officials."
And by discrediting the social entity can suffer for not detected at the time the night nurse criminal activities, the major threat to The Caritat now takes the form of a significant compensation already calculated by the legal representatives of the parents of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime date of August 2009 and from that day he has not ceased to kill.
The judge said in the award ordered the exhumation of eight bodies, former Geriatric patients - care it suspected that in many cases no Dr. exploring personally died but, given the age and health of the patients, the formality was conducted by telephone.
The Caritat, through its Director, categorically denied yesterday that situation and said that "the measures may have been the cause of what happened ."
Counsel The Caritat added that "in this case only a carelessness on the part of any other person is accused ."
The person already known as the "Angel of Death" confessed yesterday 11 murders and detailed that he committed the crime on August 29, 2009 and one and a half months later killed a second grandmother.
In this case it has caused death by injecting a sobre-dose insulin, unlike the first crime committed with a mix of sedative tablets.
The director of The Caritat referred to the fact that it is difficult to control center staff access to medicines.
insulin injections and the cocktail of sedatives had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes, in its desire to relieve suffering internal, used to kill.
But laboratory analysis to clarify whether the Vila not lying by saying that it has sought for its first victims of a cruel death or otherwise he burned inside the providing laundry as he has already admitted that he has done with the three women killed in the meantime 12 - 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe statements nurse at night, the number of murders confessed, they do not eliminate the possibility that the number is larger and justify their attitude by different versions that Vila in visits to the Tribunal of First Instance and the lack of consistency in the way to kill after committing eight murders.
That is why they say they remain available to justice to clarify the facts.
ECB threat
Investors reacted sharply yesterday the threat yesterday, Trichet warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
The differential peripheral closed the force and European banks have suffered more than 5 per cent.
Nevertheless, we must not underestimate the ability of the ECB to deceive and the euro has only recorded an increment, which is a signal concerned
This yesterday is typical of a liquid market in the same way that it falls, it recovered, but motivated by fences short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor would lose the fear.
A month ago, the ECB gave us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and those that remain.
Bundesbank called the finalization of the procurement plan public debt due to its inefficiency and eliminating all the extraordinary liquidity measures to end and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis hope that extends the current liquidity measures" until at least March" and maintain the auction quarterly unlimited access to the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We hope that it will continue with the program purchase obligations and give the same signal to intensify.
If they do not carry the expectations generated, they will overturn the excellent market reaction yesterday and they still blinded to withdraw liquidity measures, God help us!
Just as during their meeting in May in which they claimed that they had not even considered purchase obligations and they would have collapsed markets, history could repeat tomorrow.
ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced a bazooka Monday and Wednesday, he said that he had already bought much, causing a collapse in the market.
Yesterday auction drafts a year in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury has issued only 500 million 5.28 per cent compared to 750 million to 4.81 per cent the previous auction.
Even so, Portugal types have fallen 30 basis points in the curve, and reflecting a clear change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
In Ireland was published figures hole Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million short-term and 15,000 potential and they have until February to secure private capital or to be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not having detected the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumables Plan assistance and help to reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval for its new budget and it has not yet sufficient support, therefore Ireland remains in a home.
Angela Merkel has the moderate tone of his speech to ease tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise which demonstrates that we are a union and that we interpret the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret the Wagner and the rest of the joy of Beethoven anthem.
In Spain, the President took the opportunity to present yesterday the action plan approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Reform Pension, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate the employment ring to the gills of investors as Vivaldi's four seasons.
The dual effect Trichet and the ZP explains why the Spanish Bourse suffered 4.5 per cent, double the rest European Awards.
At the difference in February, the response of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been swift and radical and we have the surprise.
Today there is a enchère-clé an obligation to three years will be benefitted by Trichet, so we hope that it can be resolved with a strong demand and help to dispel the doubts about our ability to refinancing.
For Spain to request a plan of assistance would be a self-immolation.
They provide a line of liquidity which we do not need, the Treasury has over 40,000 million in available liquidity, triple compared to March, types of very expensive and they cut access to markets.
However, the strategy must continue to be of Caesar's wife," to be issued ."
Courage, we can get!

Red Bull F1 triumph with a secret weapon of the Siemens
A software creates real improvements on the cars at the time.
As soon as Red Bull are entered in the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this sélecte universe of speed was marked by surprise and success.
In a first time, nobody has taken into account the options of a new stable just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of recent seasons past November, in the last phase of the championship they have bet on the triumph of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without lower skill as pilot champion German Sebastien Vette, the capacity of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 with the legend "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens was placed in the hands of the Red Bull to turn in a winning team.
It is in fact a powerful software simulation process launched by the German company on the market in 2007 with very distant goals high competition automobilistique.
Appointed PLM, this powerful instrument was used to create the chains mounting world manufacturing factories, power stations, the instruments.
The objective is to reproduce faithfully simulating the product or process before building a real way, thereby avoiding the defects and avoidable costs.
PLM facilitated the development of cameras, Canon, the Sukhoi aircraft or the most famous commercial vehicles, Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible industrial division of Siemens, said that the use of this instrument of the computer in his factory Formula 1 Red Bull to create and implement "in a few hours, almost in real time," changes, changes and improvements detected during races and testing.
Russwurm said that the stables 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their teams was able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
In the Red Bull team are now working 180 young professionals high qualification, equipped with powerful computer equipment to analyze and propose any kind of changes on the cars.
Siemens leader explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all aspects of the Red Bull cars except for the engine, which is the exclusive responsibility of the Renault.
modified materials, fuel, aerodynamic and security.
The changes can take virtual reality simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced systems of production by laser and autoclaves.
As unique as the limitation of this madness of technological upgrading is the amount of 40 million dollars each Formula 1 team can spend limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has installed high-tech factory to create and produce their cars in a town 50 km in London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that is happening there is considered "top secret ."
The staff for this duty account 580 people attached two pilots, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of the Red Bull Formula 1, without doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Between huge technological resources that energy drinks brand is at the service of its participation in the circuit, there are other hidden actors, whose work is invaluable and zero visibility.
plant technology director, Steve Nevey says five years it could be argued that the progress of R&D in the case of the racing cars provide 50% of the victories and the pilot were responsible.
Today these percentages have changed and technology represents 85 per cent of success, while the pilot make the 15 per cent value added.
Nevey admit that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer, because "they are unpredictable gladiators ."

Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened in Barcelona the first exclusive store in collaboration with his partner Bridge Reyes.
This will be the first network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 square metres that multinational plans to install in Spain during the next two years.
The company attributed this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
Vice-President HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the redesigned store located on the Gran Via Barcelona, Bridge Reyes, with which it is 30 years work.
The American group has prepared a plan to build 200 outlets brand in Europe in 2013, the strategy which includes 20 Spanish institutions.

Sabadell bet on 'voler' a million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, managing director of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believe that 2011 will be a hard year for the banking sector, but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the war.
Despite this, it provides a breakdown of interest margins, that will attempt to partially offset with increments of commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell await capture a million individual clients in three years, its task.
Sabadell has found a way to operate during the next three years and be able to survive as well in a very difficult economic environment.
The bank will march in 2011 a new master plan that will hold a will lability three years.
The objective, survive without the need to resort to government subsidies FROB, is to make a market in a million new clients - 700,000 if removing those who can break the bank, its major task, because so far the bank had spoiled more SMEs and companies that particular client.
This year it has captured 250 clients individuals and 50,000 companies.
The market is 3.5 per cent, while companies exceeds 10 per cent.
A basis for 2011-2013 plan is a gamble on productivity, or is the same thing, austerity, with the reduction in costs as the objective, the provocations are explained by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks dare now to set targets and make public, because the financial crisis has affected all aspects of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, to finalize this year master plan Optima, establishes there four years ago, even if the original plan was for three years, but the market has determined its extension for one further year.
Clients are the savings to be its main objective.
During a breakfast organized by the FIPA, Guardiola has insisted that 2011 will be a year of "difficult and transcendental ."
The executive, in fact, believe that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow ."
Moreover, in two or three years will be "very difficult to create jobs, which is fundamental for the survival of the banking case, stressed.
And even if he thinks the war liabilities, which penalises the margins, reduced the price of risk premiums that banks and funds to pay for its emissions to get liquidity moving already in credit to compensate for falling margins.
"The liquidity and funding is and will be a factor of pressure on credit."
"We did not close the tap, but the differentials are," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to reduce the long-term credit and increase the price differentials, see CincoDías 22 and 27 November -.
He also confessed that the trend in the banking sector now "is to increase the commissions, but there is a competitive framework ."
The Master Plan Sabadell based on organic growth, even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of corporate operations.
It is not in vain that it ensures that Spain "to seek larger dimensions."
"Any move next year," assured.
It argues that capital requirements" to increase enormously" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he mentioned that the FROB can replace the market uptake of funds for new recapitalization.
After assured that Sabadell can survive the temporal closure, reduced the importance of the fact that some bank already predicted a new liquidity crisis.
said that it can not issue, but rather what happened in June, we can obtain short-term financing through the rest, which mitigates crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among funds
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a new wave of merger savings funds and stressed the speed with which is the restructuring of the sector.
When the trial of the concentration of Spanish savings banks began, there have been several entities that have assured that they would not participate in the first phase and they reserved for the second phase.
However, general director of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Funds (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of this new wave of production operations.
"I think that most mergers, one can not say that the incorporation Cajasol group Banca Cívica or a second phase are adjustments."
"Most was done completely; it was possible that 17 to go with 13 or 14, but all major processes have been already made under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, who worked a great deal in this operation," said the leader.
In statements during a breakfast Association leaders and executives of Aragón (ADEA) - Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process to happen "at the highest possible speed and we must be very pleased with the way that it is within the deadlines set in the past, not now, in the plans with the Bank of Spain," emphatisé.
"The crossing 45 28,500 million boxes with an average volume of assets to 17 with 75.500 million is a trial without equal in history, reducing the number of entities by 62 per cent to be much larger to be consistent with Basel," said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a variety of opinions quite happy on the slow process of "demonstrating "a lack of fluid-filled and" because "what the Bank of Spain is to point out that we must respect the time before the end of the year."
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the more rigorous financial system all Europe and "probably" in the world and he has given the people who cast doubt on a "lack of knowledge ."
leader noted that given the current economic conditions, "we can remain very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and savings, a system that has begun a process of concentration" very important" and "goes with the greatest possible speed ."
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector has fired the stress tests conducted by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and German red line
Berlin has opted to remain in the euro, but it establishes conditions for the whole of the Union.
Tensions have caused a doble response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new adjustment methods, ranging from tax cuts for SMEs, the regulation of private agencies or removal of 426 euros in aid to unemployed persons without professional contribution to privatization of 49% AENA, Barajas and El Prat airport and 30 per cent of the State Lotteries.
On the other, the Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of the former President Felipe González, criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel in its responsibility to provide the current crisis.
How should interpret these movements?
It should be mentioned that Merkel's position is not a mistake in its policy of communicative.
On the contrary, it is a further restriction of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And Germany has a radically new vision of what should be its future, upset with maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
Faced with resistance in Europe, Germany began to speculate on the possible three out of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among others, and south to abandon the monetary zone.
The second, Mark recovery, although now it seems the science fiction, with a current favourable opinion, nearly 50 per cent of the population.
The third, a new approach to the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater control of macroeconomic, fiscal austerity, fines on countries that violate, possible suspension of payments to them and the expansion of the private sector in the costs of adjustments.
The German position is clear and long as it defines, therefore there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government has invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
It was the first sign of divergence between what Germany thought it (the plans of fiscal discipline and stability of public finances) and its European partners, ci-inclut France, practiced.
The second blow the Central was when Merkel has not extended to save Greece.
From the time she has been the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and published were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expresses a clear position, calling for reform of the European treaties to make possible the country and force the same time private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This has been interpreted as anti-European because it has precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But its proposal, although a little weakened, was approved and, the following month, we should assist in the process of the reform of the Union which is possible as these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that she did not think cross.
And it tells us that, although now it must take the measures with which it may not be too much agreement, from that date the euro former operation would finish.
2013 will be the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that violate the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to declared cessation of payments and, in this case, the private sector must also bear a cost advantage.
Germany tells us that we must follow a severe growth with high levels of savings and investment, the moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, which chaired the Spanish growth in the years of the boom, will simply not be tolerated.
The development is clear.
And it would be hard not to hear.
It is not only to extend the public deficit to 3 per cent in 2013.
What we demand is much harder.
And what it absolutely must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence are coming to us tranquillity.
And state to seize the opportunity that has been given until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also heard this form and its double statement (reforms promised after the meeting of the past Saturday with large companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite the criticism, Merkel has opened the way to the thesis that must be put to the house.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is, and they do not seem to move.
And opportunities, we can not exclude the country to abandon a monetary area too packed little seriously.
And in this case, Germany would always say that we had warned.
Sport and fraud law
similar tricks to Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not the desire to escape punishment.
The expulsion woven in principle by the two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos during the 23 November match against Ajax in the Champions League has caused rivers of ink on the nature anti-sportif such behavior and if both players should be punished by UEFA.
As is well known, a few minutes before closing the game that their team already was clear), the two players have deliberately lost time when they have committed misconduct arbitrator to determine their show a second yellow card.
Thus, and Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of his group, the two players to serve the regulatory sanction during the match next match dam against Auxerre and can pass without the boxes to the next phase.
Finally, the disciplinary committee of UEFA punished with two games the team's coach, José Mourinho and are economic players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as these or similar is not a new practice, or rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is the ethos, the rules non-écrites, but followed the sport.
Part of the debate in the case described to the fact that this has been the player a team Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem has the nobility and honor and in past occasions has fined its players for similar acts) and dramatization orchestrated, seems Mourinho, which adds one more episode his histrionic technician dilated history and provocative.
In any event, the debate asked whether this type of behavior is not specifically prohibited by the rules contradicted the principles of sport, i.e., if these actions are committed a fraud legislation; because, in effect, they are friendly with the rules of the sport, but seem to evade its meaning.
The issue is to examine the type of damage they cause to the spirit of sportsmanship.
A property includes sportsmanship is the physical integrity of the opposing players, with these actions had not been put at risk, i.e. there were no violent game.
Another property to which we referred to it with the correct game to avoid team players offenders benefiting unfairly team otherwise, which is not the case either.
However, paradoxical action of Real Madrid players is that it can not normally characterised as cheating o fraud law, because its violation of the rules had not been conducted in secret to try to avoid punishment, but has tried to be as clear as possible for the criminalization of the arbitrator.
They looked and they have willingly accepted the punishment.
Another issue is the type of benefit that offenders get misconduct well-intentioned examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that it is not in a situation of disadvantage to rival and obtained a benefit in the same match, because obviously the result of leaving their own team with fewer players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club could not count on these players.
Obviously advantage is that the players begin the next phase of the Champions League without boxes which can threaten their participation at a future match.
but this is a long-term benefit, with a degree of uncertainty, because the team could be eliminated, and from that, with the players perform a match penalty and move to the second round, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of the boxes with a less than in the first round.
Thus, climb, it is not clear that this is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the spirit of sport, which is also a part of strategic decisions that promote maximum benefit that rules allow.
In our case, the players have not switched to avoid the application of the penalty (this would be a clear case of fraud law), m if they have chosen a time in which they are submitted.
They took a strategic decision to thwart without penalty or flee.
Even if the border between genius and fraud law is, in this opportunity I think there has been a clear case of engineering.
The controversy, it seems to me, is due to two factors: because there were two auto-expulsions and transmit the Director for the cause.
harm caused by these actions to the principles of sport is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offered to capture the Christmas dinners for groups in the NCBs
timetable dictatorship focuses this year an avalanche of bookings for 16 and 17 days.
There is a proliferation of self-supporting celebrations by employees who wish to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
As nougat and lottery, when December is also returning dinner groups before Christmas which continue to be the lifeline for restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but the cause of the crisis have lead in an offensive you adjusted prices to capture client: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, businessmen and sector associations interviewed.

Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated the collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees are paying their own pockets.
Any is the environment, all price battle, confirms the president Gremi of Restauració Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employer, now does not dare to predict how the festivities this month.
"People think much before."
"They want to get out but they pay much attention to the price," said.
The case will be fine" for those who provide quality at a good price and a good service," he said, and recalled that the customers have the tendency to go level with the crisis, so that the instalment of around EUR 25 became the majority in the request.
In a survey in the various institutions of the center is the collapse of the requests for the night of 17.
The group Soteras indicates that there is a genuine boom requests for Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded in adapting their menus to the environment, with comprehensive approaches 25 to 35 euros.
In case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, 16 schools in the city (Hostal of Rita, Market, Fonda and other), the particularity of the calendar has assumed more advance bookings, even at the beginning of November.
"We have done the impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes, 19.95 30 euros ," detailing.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 local maintains optimistic after detected an increase in billing for the second half and, although concentrated, prospects for Christmas.
group sources indicate that the 18 will also be a day hyper-actif in groups of friends celebrating ahead of the holidays.
In their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with EUR 30 or more as the famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10 per cent more than last year, instead of requiring more details, as the Catalan wine produced according to the'm éthode champenoise ' appears, 'cava'.
They are also the first signs of improvement in some companies again called upon their employees and the sensation that the volume of groups has increased a bit.
From employers Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment Barcelona), Vice-President, Enric Gomà, leaves the opportunity to begin to see the final tunnel and supports overall bookings are "moving ," even if the clients "negotiate ."
This is true, hope for festivities has not fallen, regardless of who pays," he said.
The Pakistani nuclear program generates a great concern to the United States
Islamabad produced atomic weapons at a faster rate than any other country."
The filtration Wikileaks confirms the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The contents of correspondence between the US Embassy in Pakistan and the United States State Department filtered by the portal Wikileaks confirms huge concerns caused by Washington, Pakistan's nuclear program.
In addition to flare and tasty details available on the content of the conversations and the thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of security, instead of increasing," decreases" and unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a more rapid pace than any other country in the world ."
feature of Pakistan's nuclear program, weapons are not, but they are emmagasinnées by components to make difficult their mass attack, is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
It as well as ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists a report prior to the visit of the former National Security Adviser, James Jones: "The near some nuclear facilities in the territory under Taliban attack, the spread of nuclear materials which the rumor and the vulnerability of transport of nuclear materials ."
The large number of persons involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is envisaged, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to maintain custody of the child.
"Pakistan of hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programs," said Yuri expert Korolev, the Russian Ministry of External during a meeting with its American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered through the portal of Julian Assange is cooperation more reduced between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high degree of Pakistani nuclear armas production.
A dispatch Embassy in May, which describes as "frustrating" communication with Pakistan, argues: "Transparency is frequently non-existent; offers of assistance remain unanswered or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence Officer for South Asia, said that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world ."
Ambassador Patterson also calls in Washington for a visit by the head of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to understand "very clearly" that "Pakistan Army must end with tacit support to groups of terrorists ."
At the Wikileaks head hunting
Obama nombrera a high responsible for counter-terrorism in order to avoid new infiltration.
Interpol issued a red alert to monitor the movements and locate the Assange.
All aspects of Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated maze where it is difficult to be sure.
Yesterday Interpol has issued a "red alert" to "locate and track the movements" of Assange.
However, it is not a traditional order of arrest.
In addition, it is not new, or the dates of 20 November.
And nothing to even with the latest filtration by more than a quarter million United States diplomatic documents but with accusations of sexual abuse that Australian faces Sweden.
In addition, creator of the Wikileaks lawyer, Mark Stephens, provides that "the police know where and how to contact Mr Assange ."
20 police in international headquarters in Lyon (France) dictated the order at the request of Sweden, but it has not made public until yesterday, after having received permission from the authorities of that country.
Thus, 188 countries Interpol received indication to identify or locate Assange" for his provisional arrest and extradition ."
Although Interpol can not order the arrest of a person affected by a red alert, many member countries, according to the organization, see the red notice a free way to arrest --que the National Police must realize, especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case in Sweden and England, where it is believed that Assange is.
The movement has outraged lawyers to Assange, who yesterday issued a letter dénonceant that the founder of Wikileaks, 39, showed a willingness to respond by video-conference issues of the Swedish authorities.
They also remind that Assange has requested and obtained permits to exit the Sweden prosecutor, that compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, security chief of Stalin.
"This seems to be a fighter, not a legal persecution ," denounces the missive.
During the world seeks -- and Australia his mother defends his son's innocence -- Assange remains in an unknown location, but it was not.
On Monday, he gave at an undetermined location a Time magazine interview to the Director through Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If you can show that it has been responsible for giving orders to American graduates they succeeded to the United Nations in violation of international treaties signed by the United States, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who described as "ridiculous and absurd" the resignation request.
"I am not sure why the opinion of a type with a web page should look," said to CNN.
Obama himself has appointed a senior official of counter-terrorism, Rusell Travers, prevent further leakage.
The test of President Barack Obama's spokesman to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the Congressman who in January will chair the Committee on National Security in the Lower House has asked the Department of State that it is considering the possibility to include in the list of terrorist organizations Wikileaks to confiscate funds and continue to anyone who provided contributions or assistance ."
Once went to Tom Flanagan, an adviser to the Canadian chairman Stephen Harper, who has his statements after said that Assange will be "murdered ."
"Obama should turn in goal and the use of an aircraft without the crew or something similar."
A person who has not requested an apology was Mike Huckabee, the Baptist minister, the poor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Anyone found in Government filtered information is guilty of treason and is not a performance would be a punishment too kind," said for Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace with images in the ERC to Carod
The Republican leader will party a secret voting on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for resolving the umpteenth internal revolt within the ERC, without the north due to the loss of 11 and half of the votes.
The President of the party is aware that its threat of resignation is not sufficient for the followers of the former leader Josep Lluis Carod-Rovira, but at the same time knows that the influence of this sector is now also diluted his liar and absolutely can not give him a headache that he had with other current extinguished.
That is why leader Esquerra will gain new criticism with images that allow it to be shielded to municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national advisers of the ERC will decide on its continuity in secret.
On the ballots, not raising their hands.
If carodistes want to convey a certain vote penalising the president, they can do so without any fear of reprisals.
In fact, head of the ranks to avoid the image of division and submission to the person.
In several interviews he said that he would not consider itself ratified with more than half the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, a result that "the Bulgarian" would be good.
people close to Carod require President that position the militancy, a gesture that did not apply when Puigcercós control body maxim between congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to approve a roadmap with the executive until May.
For that, they hope to participate in the preparation of the document strategic reorientation that management will submit to the voting of the National Council on 18.
The intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for the promise of the scheduling of the congress for the fall of 2011, leaders consider safe.
The ERC leader has admitted that "many" affects the stability and its objective is that once and for all, the organization is able to wash his clothes in the family room.
In this line, the article signed by current Adviser Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered ideologue Puigcercós, Innovació thought that the leader will be ratified "various objectives" it is as if was done.
And it has listed five, stressing both.
The first, "reconstituting" the executive to at least 90 per cent of militancy, i.e., include new figures from follower Carod.
The second may be great news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC liquid once and for all the assembly as operating mechanism.
Thus, it supports a reform of the constitution that allows the realization of the congress through delegates elected by vote.
Complete the model assembly, an exception in the Spanish system of parties, has been an obsession with the team Puigcercós, already has struggled in the last two congresses.
In fact, convulsing the conclave of 2008 for the leadership to revise the model assembly in a special congress of the reform of the statute.
This meeting remains unfinished, because the national tide of recent years did not address this issue.
Now, without critical sectors, the time could be good for the resume and close it forever.

His short message maintains open a cyber relationship with a more extensive document which seeks public immediately contact senators, as legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that we hope soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," said.
The message was released after 42 Republican senators have threatened to block any legislation vote if the extension of the Bush era tax cuts and protracted.
Such blockage, announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked the Republican lock on the Dream Act Act and other projects, the presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs has said that he is confident that once the tax issue is solved we can set a agende for the rest.

Even if the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act more major obstacles in the Senate.
With the literature it puts its finger on the wound
The second stage of the Fun language has been a walk in which participants display narration
"The sex in the language, I can understand that, but ... the finger on the wound? it is hoped to me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second phase of the Fun language, a cycle that famous literature in Spanish and this time has used the subtitle of his question (for another show the panel was devoted to the Sex in the language," said Will).
The finger on the wound" ... putting," gently writer Argentine public, most young people who had gathered at the International Book Fair, Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this panel moderated by Marisol Shultz and attended Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.

The protagonist soupirât relieved and concludes: "on the wound, I have only been able to know that it is open and that it does not exist," but believes that the pleasures and pitfalls of language should be interlinked.
Valenzuela, writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez has also exposed a beautiful story entitled Praise invention, where the finger on the wound was not nombré but at a given moment is discovered.
With the keys of magic realism, he spoke of a famous ensorceleuse affecting clouds, was returning people who had gone or repaired the virtues that a damsel had lost, a story that turns to talk about America, the great new has been from the beginning of its own columnists and cited Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticises the excesses of the narratives of capitans conquerors.
"Cervantes who invented all (the writers) sidelined false witnesses who appeared in stories presented as real, but a aitre way would never Township American history with an imagination that lacked even of modesty ."
Nevertheless, stressed it, "crazy and liars have better imagination" and here the reality converged with lies, we no longer know what part of the narrative is a band or another, where fiction literature reached its peak.

The evening has ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero also stressed "this is on the head writer committed ."
It considered that, in a world which lives in high-speed also relate to intellectual habits and the control of consciences, which benefits of dogmatism and "behind every claim there is a small and behind every denial there is a small, yes."

"I want to be a champion, I do not want to break no statistics, this is a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but that I mentioned before is more important," said helmsman when asked how its weak points in the finals.
He remembers many of the final, which he said he learned a lot," the single lesson we can learn is that until the referee hissing the final, we can not celebrate, we are prepared in line with the players, because the last time, with two penalties to draw we were already prepared to run and I think this is a lesson before the end of the match we can not celebrate."
knows that this series could be defined by penalties, not concerned, because it gives his players: "There is never to arrive at a series of penalties, trying to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we have to prepare, the previous tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately the destiny we made a bad round, sometimes it is the emotions or the anguish to take the title in our hands, in the hands of us escaped, it served as a lesson for this final and we hope that happens in this situation ."
Romano now has an opportunity to no longer be a technician sous-champion and enjoy the glory for the first time under the titles.

The list of expectations that new integral Congress government own management and with society and different sectors that need legislative work in a responsible and that the same spirit of party or paternalism models are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CEC, suggested that the Members to bear a great responsibility to be an example for the better the Sinaloa to various provocations is facing.
"We hope that Members actually exercise their right, free of the agreements between the parties because the custom is that they are compact to ensure their own interests and become the masquerade carnival of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions ."

With regard to tourism, he asked lawmakers to give him the importance in the state budget to consolidate the Government Tourism Secretariat.
"I understand that this is the second State Secretariat with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as important economic activity and generate foreign exchange and investment and competes directly with agro-industry ."
In addition to the need to classify resources tourist projects detonators that help to provide security to the State and to update the Alcohol Act that previous legislatures have not been able to resolve.

The illegal migration will continue without problem
The bill to the Tories, who, according to the Government, should address the problem of ships laden with clandestine migrants, will obviously be beaten, while three opposition parties said Wednesday they could not support it.
"I strongly supports Charter."
"I am standing with a party that has created the granite under your feet," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, while he was surrounded by deputies after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
liberals argue that the bill as proposed, which would hold up a year any person from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Bloc Quebecois leader Gilles Duceppe also indicated that it could not support the bill, because it takes the wrong target.
"We are against, and it seems that all opposition parties are against, then we will see what the government does," said Mr. Duceppe.
Criticism of NDP immigration, Olivia Chow, rejected out of hand the criticism that his party is not quite firm on illegal immigrants.
"NDP agreed to take measures against the smuggling of illegal immigrants and that is what we are doing through another bill, the market," said Ms. Chow.
"We do not support the bill of the Conservatives because it takes to refugees and imprisoning children for at least a year," said Ms. Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney, accused opposition parties to play politics and ignore the will of Canadians.
"Canadians are massively Members that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country as a doormat."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," responded the Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a confidence vote on his bill, which could have lead the country to elections in the event of rejection.
A Conservative however said the QMI Agency that the government would seek a vote for every Member who will then explained to the electorate.
The new unit does not unanimously
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public inquiry on the subject.
Public Safety Minister, Robert Dutil, argues that the idea is not new: Quebec consulting with the Department of Investigation in New York since last January.
The metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, Tuesday's announcement has come as a surprise to many.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on police services of Quebec, 29 October, this had never been discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
do not more critical PQ public security, Stéphane Bergeron, called the announcement "rabbit out of a hat" and "the solution bricolée on the corner of a table.
The Minister Dutil has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You will see the result when we will announce, merely said."
"It is aware of this problem."
For President DMCs, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
"More than Mr Charest insists not to create this committee of inquiry, more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he says.
"The only way to have a committee of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To break the deadlock, it suggests to Quebec to give a mandate to the auditor general to investigate collusion and corruption.
"It must be able to expand the mandate of the Auditor General, the instalment.
He also believes that Quebec could provide auditor the same powers as a Commissioner, enabling it to force people to testify.
The establishment of a permanent squad is not the only project in the boxes of government Charest.
Quebec would also in Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to be best suited to this type of crime.
This request from prosecutor Operation Hammer, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier jurisprudence is not explicit in such investigations.
The Federal Minister of Public Safety, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently studying certain amendments relating to this matter.
During the Spring 2001, affecting the biker groups, although the Criminal Code was not suitable, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently adopted Act gangsterism.

Dupont partially blamé
The radio broadcaster of the Quebec Stéphane Dupont suffered a setback partial to the Council the Canadian Broadcast Standards (CCNR) for controversial remarks on social assistance to Haitians as well as its coarse language in the waves.
The CCNR judge that Mr. CHOI 98.1 FM Dupont and his team had the right to express their views, but that some were "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative performances of Haitians and coarse language which is not broadcast during the day."
The Council also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the names of two persons who had committed suicide, did not breach the codes on broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints about the comments made during the broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Front common social assisted people in Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts listed in the program were inaccurate.
Facilitators should submit information solid rather than misleading.
With regard to suicide, Stéphane Dupont had estimated that suicide is a cowardly act.
The majority of members of the Committee concluded that the message was that the suicide should not be seen as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority in the Committee considers that the episodes set "Dupont lunch" addressed a sensitive subject in a fair manner and appropriate."
No blame has been retained.
The dispute focused on statements following the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort then delivered a face-to-face media had generated a lot of reactions.
The moderator CHOI stated that it had not made any donation to help the Haitians because we could not know with certainty that the needy people would really money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but their cumulative effect is unduly negative representation of Haitians.

"My file is empty for a year and a half," said moderator.
In all the decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of coarse language.
In each case, the television broadcaster has collaborated" beyond its obligation ."
The consequences are minimal for the station, which should, inter alia, to announce the decisions once during peak hours within three days.

The Montrealer of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has a very particular route.
The athlete who excelled in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact "), kickboxing and Thai boxing rises on tatami mats and rings in the world in search of new challenges.
"I started to practice martial arts such as kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years, Algeria, explained Zemmal, located in the metropolitan area since 2008 to move among professionals."
"In my case, I am fighting everywhere, as for those who do not like the ground game now mixed martial arts competitions are rare in North America."

450 million in contracts without competitive bidding
Hydro-Quebec has granted to $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
At the heart of this avalanche of over 100 contracts, is a consortium of firms OPI, Dessau, Group and the Axor most important stewardship of the project, for a sum of $295 million without competitive bidding.
This consortium called Energy Stewardship was established in 2004 at the same choice Hydro-Québec entrusted to the private sector on its responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Stewardship consortium won the lucrative contract without there has been public tender.
For the Parti Quebecois, consortia of enterprises is a serious ethical problem which may eliminate competition and drive up prices.
"This is the new way of collusion and competition."
"This people, this is secret, now are openly," said yesterday the PQ Member Sylvain Simard in press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said see hard public interest can be used this way.
The Natural Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, strongly denied that there has been collusion for this contract.
"I began to have my trip" where after complaining that the PQ had been "dishonest" and "lack of rigor ."
She said that "this would be "the PQ apologizes.
The consortia formula is common practice in the world.
It is usually limited in time alliance which allows two or more enterprises to combine their respective expertise to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain has a high level of complexity in the light of the magnitude of the work.
The project is expected to take until 2012.
, however, has been awarded the contract without competition act; there have been negotiations.
The consortia formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week Le Devoir, consortia in the engineering sector is the subject of a government investigation.
A rapid overview of the business register in Quebec allows count over 200 consortia, some of which are permanent.
Thus, Dessau works in partnership with most of its major competitors, CIMA + short duration, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and total.
Each combination, and there are dozens, back to a single legal person, or the Dessau.
Regarding the consortium Energy Stewardship Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of James Bay meets specific labor dynamic and Hydro-Québec responds particularly since the 1970s ."
Eastmain draft great boss, Mr Laporte, Energy Corporation of James Bay (location), provided an explanation which frowned on the fact that the management contract of the project has been granted.
"If you go in bidding and that there was little the bidders, the price will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you have people who are in the market and you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that this is not the price that is important is the competence of the people," said Mr. Laporte.
The contract awarded to a consortium Energy Stewardship is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Party.
The contracts were awarded by the Hydro-Québec or the location for the project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
After verification, Le Devoir were 109 engineering contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010, companies or their subsidiaries, including laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has won 22 contracts, Carry won 16 total 14 and Dessau 10, not to mention its participation in the Energy Stewardship.
All contracts were negotiated.
They total 449 $783 344, including contract Energy Stewardship 295 131 $564.
Sylvain Simard hinted that the four firms that make up the consortium (OPI, Dessau, Group and the Axor) are "well-known Liberal Party of Quebec."
The Minister Normandeau dropped the PQ is also linked to these firms "finance ," before stating that it is rather its leaders.
Barometer responsible consumption - the label "green" does not inspire confidence
More than green, but frankly sceptical.
The consumer Quebec very little trust in sustainable development actors, but also fair marks and certifications écologisantes to guide its choice.
Worse, is a media environment where messages in favor of a more responsible consumption are, it regrets the lack of credible information, as even brake its commitment, said the responsible consumption barometer, the first reading of which was delivered yesterday.
Even if they increase consumption so-called socially responsible in 2010, Quebecers, however, appear to give little credit to those who are trying to sell.
Two thirds of them are not believe environmental commitment of enterprises as the green advertising companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of the University of Sherbrooke responsible consumption.
In half the consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications on so-called products fair, but also the credibility of the products and the brands posting as being environmentally responsible way," said Barometer.
In the same vein, the speeches by politicians on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6 percent of Quebecers.
The Information responsible consumption, however, seems paramount to stimulate consumption part currently hosted by almost one third of the consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and the dubious nature of information calmeraient enthusiasm of 46 per cent of consumers.
This is the second obstacle identified by Barometer, after higher prices for these products.
Moreover, a third of Quebecers say also wary of alleged performance green products or services that seeks to hands.
On another note, consumers have been almost half in 2010 have changed their habit and especially changed the brand one or more products to meet their belief.
At 61% , they also favored purchases from their neighborhood merchants and privileged food grown in their region, said Barometer.
More green and accountable, responsible consumption index has reached 64 out of a maximum 100 this year - Homo consumus Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling which seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by concern for animal welfare.
But its social and ecological conscience seems to remain outside of his car, said the barometer: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers reported having used public transportation or called the car to defend their interests.
The walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1 per cent of participants in this broad behavioural survey, just to take his first shot.
A loan of State for repurchase eXcentris
The Government of Québec, who requested financial commitments in the redemption of the cinema complex eXcentris by Angus Society and Parallel, agrees to cooperate, but a loan only.
The Development Corporation Angus and Parallel, hoping a $7 million gift from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois complex film eXcentris on Boulevard St. Lawrence in reinstating its full role cinéphilique, do not get what they wanted.
The Government agrees to get involved in the case, but on its own terms.
Rather than the donation, the Government of Québec offers a loan would be lower than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution to advantageous conditions, sources from the State agencies view.
A first action plan and a 12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, but applications have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and a plan of action were sent to the Minister St-Pierre, President of the Society for the Development of cultural enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, which the pilot file eXcentris.
It sent a final report about 10 days ago.
But the counterproposal cabinet came to SODEC Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until 31 December to respond.
It appears, however, that the gift of State should really be dismissed.
Recall Association owners cinemas and cinéparcs Quebec opposed direct investment by the State to support the repurchase eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance housing projects, it has not done for other cinemas.
But several community calling for a substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, unlikely, for ten years brought up the film copyright in the premises of the complex after funded its own construction, that could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is shouting in Montreal, and eXcentris was able to retain its clientele.
Society Angus and Parallel, head of the Christian Yaccarini, piloting, campaign financing private, hoping to collect $700,000 to push the wheel of the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of the three screens, The Parallel, continues to disseminate the films to eXcentris.
The aim of future buyers is to reopen three rooms on 27 February by projecting a very beautiful film Xavier Beauvois Men and the gods.
But Christian Yaccarini not recalled Le Devoir and unknown to him and his group think proposals to decrease.
The veil lifted a complexed Canada ...
The new American diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks lift a veil on what the United States regarded as an inferiority complex toward the Americans, but they betray the superiority of the latter to Canada.
For example, American diplomats were surprised that each elector Canadian did not Canada-US relations in mind from vote and believe that the visit of President Obama has helped the Conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington over the place yesterday, offer more titbits that substantial content to eat.
A cable dated 22 September 2008, full federal election campaign, recounted how the United States are not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
In surprise US ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanation to this situation.
"A Canadian inferiority complex almost inherent is perhaps Canadian political leaders to speak daily domestic issues rather than bring this election on the United States (as in the 1988 campaign on free trade)," he wrote.
The United States, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant in this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening."
Ambassador includes all this "deafening silence" that the two countries have close political and economic relationship.
"Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and a party leader to manage this critical relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind by going to vote."
The expression of this sense of importance in the cable sent by Terry Services on 22 January 2009, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, preparing for President Barack Obama's first visit to Ottawa.
"Your visit will help ensure the survival of the government during a vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, which posted its first deficit in more than a decade due to a recovery plan of 30 billion to $40 billion," wrote Mr. Services.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government has had to extend the Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the recovery plan proposed.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington increasingly negative image that drama series broadcast on CBC refer to the United States.
Ambassador is concerned about emissions, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are subtle references to Maher Arar, No-Fly-List" or abduction for interrogation by the CIA.
A cable recounts that, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton has asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to accept some of the prisoners in Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner has said yes, but on the basis of "case by case ."
At the end of the meeting, he wrote, "it has submitted a paper to the Secretary of State for about 15 years, Omar Khadr, a Muslim."
"The secretary has agreed to review the case."
Lastly, the emotions on the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, a former close adviser, Stephen Harper, said on CBC that is responsible for this massive flight should be "murdered ."
It echoed the Mike Huckabee to the United States.
A global plan to renovate the lighting
The United Nations has proposed yesterday in Cancún a plan for renovation of the domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries in order to obtain a reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG) which is almost one third of the additional reduction required to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the wake of major concrete projects that the United Nations hope to adopt at Cancún to compensate for the absence of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to plan yesterday, if incandescent light bulbs that monopolize still 50 to 70 per cent of the market were replaced with compact fluorescents, or better, bulbs light emitting diode (LED "LED "), the bulk of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) GHG emissions on the planet to illuminate the humans would be avoided.
The lighting accounts for 8% of global emissions.
This is equivalent to 70 per cent of global emissions of the vehicle fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, are engaged in voluntary reduction plans which should increase aggregate GHG emissions of 53 Gt 49.
But from this assessment yet 5 Gt in order to stabilize by 2020 climate increase to 2 degrees centigrade in order to avoid becoming out of control.
In incandescent light bulbs, 95 per cent of energy dissipates as heat and the remaining 5% , the product.
With compact fluorescents, energy expenditure is reduced by 75 per cent and with new LED bulbs, reduced the need for energy twice again.
The compact fluorescents lasted an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched manufacturing Philips this week, the company has also participated in the United Nations -- have a life expectancy of 25 hours and consume 80% less energy than incandescent bulb, which gives an idea of the economy with an alternative plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These new bulbs can also operate rheostats more to emit very little heat.
And they do not contain mercury.
Several specialists showed reservations against compact fluorescents since they contain mercury and eliminate as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers are in place.
But, says the report, the main source of mercury on the planet is not CFL bulb, but rather of coal-fired power plants, which emit mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that would each country through this program.
For example, Indonesia, sparing a billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tonnes of CO2 equivalent 3.5 thermal power plants construction would cost 2.5 billion.
The Côte d'Ivoire expected in the nervousness on the announcement of the election results
The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, called the publication "without delay" the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire after the deadline.
"The secretary-general emphasizes the need for independent electoral commission to complete its work and to announce provisional results without further delay, said a spokesman of the UN chief."
"It calls on all the Ivorian parties and institutions to demonstrate responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the announcement of the provisional results."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has missed the deadline Wednesday midnight without publishing the results, three days after the ballot on Sunday.
About 40 minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the chairman of the CIS had said on television that the Committee continued to work "to announce the results.
The appeals have multiplied Wednesday in the world for the CIS finally announce the name of the winner of the second round between the incumbent Laurent Gbagbo and Alassane Ouattara opponent.
But the Gbagbo camp on the annulment by the Constitutional Council votes "fraudulent" in the north, held by the former rebels of the Forces nouvelles (FN) since the failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N ` Guessan, campaign manager of the President of Côte d'Ivoire, said that intimidation of voters by the FN in the north of the country had deterred supporters of outgoing president vote.
All election could be canceled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo retained by the Constitutional Council.
However Gbagbo's opponents believe that the highest court in the country is not neutral because it is directed by Paul Yao N ` Dré as the new, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, the man the North denies any link with the rebels, considered as "unacceptable" the delay in announcing the results and called on Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go so far as to claim victory.
Its allies argue that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that a complaint to the Constitutional Council, after having prevented the electoral commission to disseminate the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday, was expected to complete the process of reunification and reconciliation in a country still divided into two for years.
The United Nations warned Wednesday the Ivorian political class that could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished top of the first round, on 31 October, with 38 per cent of the vote compared with 32 per cent to Alassane Ouattara, who has received public support former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).

Case Clotilde Reiss of the Élysée Palace has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
During the more than 10 months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage ," held in breath in France, diplomacy, and led to the deterioration of relations between Paris and Teheran.
The under the watchful eyes of US diplomats.
American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde show some below this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to provide guidance for the treatment of their own crises "hostages" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials have sought to convince Washington that the release of young French had not been in return for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by the United States for trafficking in materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they place under a harsh light on how the French Presidency has sought to manipulate the media to give credence to the idea that the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, there was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram drafted on 12 August 2009 in Paris entitled "Iran: French comments on how to handle cases of hostage-taking ."
The Elysée adviser for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay in North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, met with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the same for the return of their own nationals forcibly held in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "martelez ever" in the media the words "human rights ," "innocence ," "immediate release ."
It is to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do all the more that the Iranians are asking you not to do so ."
For past attempts by discreet channels discussions, "silence is not ``, the Iranians are "masters in delaying tactics."
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest is a "tactical Iranian familiar: the taking of hostages for political blackmail ."
He announced that the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss, 16 August, took refuge at the French Embassy) will require the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230 million euros).
And it indicated that the Elysée anticipates other crises of the hostages, a phenomenon which will worsen."
The Iranians could "in the near future to stop another few 1 800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is leaving prison for 12 days, but remains blocked in Iran.
Information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, United States demanded extradition for trafficking illegal sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris, on the decision of a judge.
The US Embassy, as many observers, this unsettling coincidence.
For Washington, which tracks the clandestine networks Iranian acquisition of equipment for nuclear program, enlargement Majid Khakavand is bad news.
France has agreed a bargain?
The release of the Iranians against the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone, 4 September, François Richier ensures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he said, has not only been completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision," but sought to oppose it.
"There have been heated exchanges between the French Presidency and Keeper of the Seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie, and the French Government can not reverse the decision "judicial observed.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under "close supervision" of the French intelligence services.
The Elysée adviser composed a telephone number, clings, then informed the American that the Iranian diplomat is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian Embassy ."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Élysée Palace has spared no efforts, through announcements and "leakage" organized in the media, to suggest that Syrian President Bashar Assad is "important" and "influential" "ombudsman ."
Americans watching this activity without irony, and recognize that bears fruit since several press articles reflected the official version of the French.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 refers to the 'blitz' media official French."
What is based "gratitude expressed to Mr. Assad, asked the embassy in Paris.
"Despite their full statements of praise, the official French recognize in private that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians really."
The document then examines the reasons that led the Elysée to make this film.
The intense outreach effort" is intended to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria," analysis.
A policy launched in 2008, was seen by many critics in France and abroad, such as premature and undeservedly criminalised ."
In "exaggerating the Syrian role ," Paris is seeking to "demonstrate Syria what praise it can draw in playing a constructive role in the region ."
The objective is to "sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran."
The US Embassy knows good source.
On 11 August, François Richier entrusted: "Of course, we do not know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we have thanked anyway."
"This should at least sow confusion among the Iranians ."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy to the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria, for their "active role for the liberation of our compatriot, ."
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a so-called "Cinderella" which prohibit teenagers play online games after midnight in blocking their access, said government officials.
A draft law will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask companies to online games to block access to the games after midnight, young people under the age of 16 years, said representatives of the ministries of culture and family.
"Many children play games all night and then learning difficulties in school and have a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, ministerial official in charge of the draft law.
The online games will again accessible at 6 a.m..
The companies will have a year to prepare for the implementation of the law, he said.
The government also plans to ask companies to limit the time daily access to these games for young people whose parents request, responsible.
It will also be available to people who are calling for free software to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the more "connected" and the newspapers are regularly various facts related to the intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also undisputed champion of world competition online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, about 58 other nations.
Global 2018-2022: signed countries organizers
In turmoil due to suspicions of corruption, the executive committee signed means Thursday the countries organizing World Cups 2018 and 2022, a highly political tug-of-war and lobbying may take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is certain, 2018 competition the Queen signed will be held in Europe, the traditional stronghold of discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia Defense, Spain-Portugal, Pays-Bas-Belgique).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, hoping to conquer new territory (Qatar, Australia, after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its settlement in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of leading delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, Belgian and Dutch government heads, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) economic and political issues of the World Cup.
behind-the-scenes negotiations may last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the evaluation report signed, English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) have the best arguments that their competitors.
But such considerations will not very heavy for the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, the origin of the revelations that led to the suspension of two EC members for corruption (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) could have ruined his chances, the cradle of football which hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC has released a layer, Monday, making a documentary which identifies three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What is upsetting signed and embarrass the English managers, who are engaged in intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron.
The Government hopes to repeat the coup succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained in 2005 for London organization JO-2012.
This intense activity will improve the image of England with the EC?
Nothing is less secure since the duo Espagne-Portugal does not lack the assets with its stages ready, his expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 Portugal) and its football culture.
But the bleak economic and financial prospects of the two countries could shower their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal increase the Federation, become an outsider of the weight despite gaps (stages, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided not to travel to Zurich and denounced the "unfair competition in preparation for the vote," in a thinly veiled reference to the English press charges against members of the EC.
"It covers the mud, trying to undermine them," Mr Putin.
In 2022, the United States, in 1994, emerged as favorites.
First world economic power, the headquarters of the main sponsors signed, the country seems to have a length ahead of Japan and South Korea, separately have built a beautiful project.
But these new applications appear premature for the two countries to have co-hosted the test in 2002.
Other threat: the granting of Mondial-2026 China, fervently desired by the controls, which would lapse of Asian Opportunities for 2022.
With Qatar, which released the game proposing futuristic stages, and Australia, signed to continue its expansion into new areas, but these two countries are more likely than certainties.
Australia, such as Japan and Korea, could also suffer from weak TV rights fulfilled (because of jet lag) by European countries, the sinews of war for the controls.
Second mandate.
De Gaulle had hesitated.
Mitterrand had been led to believe that it was.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less.
A mandate to the Elysée Palace drew another.
So the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But obviously does not with the mystery attached to the presidential office.
So it must be doubt still existed.
In a sense.
In 2006, even without believing, friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy was that it would take its decision "somewhere in the autumn of the year 2011 ."
What it refers to the UMP parliamentarians, Tuesday evening in the Elysee Palace, the prospect of "two mandates" has caused a bit of volatility.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
It was below.
The President was to recall that the 2008 constitutional revision was limited to two the number of quinquennia.
It was a fact, not an announcement.
This is not the first time that he mentioned the presidential tone of humor at such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you again for seven and a half years with me," was launched in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Do not think that I am not considering this stage."
The day before yesterday do not make it more candidate on the eve of; they do not make it less.
If they are, it is for two reasons.
The acceleration of the candidate for PS, a share.
But it is not in the Ségolène Royal leads Nicolas Sarkozy to disclose.
It is because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many PS require battle earlier than planned.
The bad polls.
For the first time the right-wing voters would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% to 44% , according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion of the UMP this," immediately and cautiously reacted to the Prime Minister's entourage.
"If he believes the possible defeat, it will not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"It will always believe the power to win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned.
Euro: ECB forced to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the Governing Board of the European Central Bank (ECB) should be an opportunity to clarify the modalities of the exit of the crisis, or at least announce the arrest of a number of operations of unconventional monetary policy which must achèver at the end of the year.
European sovereign debt crisis, issuing institute Frankfurt may not be conclusive as only worsen a situation more tense today on European bond markets.
The political cost would be higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, has welcomed the active role played by the ECB in favor of the resolution of the debt crisis of the States in Europe.
She did not want to say whether it believed that the central bank should do more, such as increasing its program to purchase sovereign obligations.
"I reserve my reflection in my European partners (...) ."
eve, in Brussels, during his hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, has not shown more information about its intentions, saying only that the program of buying government securities in the secondary market "continues" and that "we will see what we will decide at the meeting on Thursday.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main interest rate unchanged at 1 per cent, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of Treasury bonds by the ECB to have doubled last week, nearly 1.35 billion euros.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have made new securities purchases Irish and Portuguese yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem purchased 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among market operators, expectations of further purchases are no doubt (see page 29).
Economists do not expect a significant change of course.
If lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB, the latter is still unlimited cash allowances according to the conditions and for periods from one week to three months.
The economists are now expecting that this device is extended a few months.
"I can not imagine that it amend its program."
"Otherwise this would risk causing new tensions in the short term," said Michael Schubert, an economist of Commerzbank.
"A gradual exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," anticipates its side Norbert Bräms, economist in Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions on public debt market," the ECB should maintain a volume purchase obligations to conduct a sluggish market," said Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of the exposure of European banks to the euro zone sovereign debt markets, issuing institute has no other choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"It must at all costs to replace the lack of investors on the market and act to prevent a runaway yields paid by fragile states ," was an important bond manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates soaring, States will be all the more uncomfortable to reduce their debt, if not stabilize.
Safeguarding the euro is at stake.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi backs round
After beginning the week worrying for Italy, the situation is a little bit relaxed, yesterday, with the bond rate surge to 10 years.
A return to the uneasy calm.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister of the Economy, the Presidents of the region said they heard Giulio Tremonti called the situation "Unbreakable" and a weekend "unpredictable ," which he then denied.
Tuesday, in any case, the gap with long German rate had reached a record 210 basis points, and the price of the contracts cover against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had soared to 263 points, causing a panic in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, with the German rate gap was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, expressed "great concern" by "turbulence" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third-largest economy in the euro zone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In clear, his problem is the lack of growth and weaker tax revenues that go with it, putting the state may not be able to cover its funding needs.
The latest forecasts Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
The Italian growth is now expected to 1.1 per cent in 2011 and to 1.4% in 2012. . while the current budget before the Senate panel on respectively 1.3 per cent and 2 per cent.
In these conditions, calculated by the European Commission, the public deficit would still 4.3 per cent of GDP next year (against 3.9 per cent provided by the Government) and 3.5% in 2012 (2.7 per cent).
Hence the rumor of a new collective budget could be put in place after the holidays, for an amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will be taken," said Commissioner for economic affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The fundamentals of the economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been saying for a long time," Arrigo Sadun, Italian director at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate or short-term or long-term, because despite its debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, will), stabilization efforts required to Italy are lower than those in other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OECD.
There remains the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi faces a no-confidence motion in the Chamber of Deputies, after which early elections could be held in late March.
With open a period not conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans consider strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms
Christine Lagarde has hammered yesterday in a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I think we demonstrated Sunday in the day and night, are clearly interlinked, determined, committed to defend their currencies and monetary zone."
Although relative detente recorded yesterday on the European State obligations provided grist to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But still can not talk about the beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard& Poor's announced that it might downgrade of Portugal's debt note, target covered today by speculation.
"In May, there was a real lack of political visibility and clarity, in particular banking systems ," economists Exane BNP Paribas.
that "time is much slower than the time ."
Aware of the gap and the dangers it conceals, European countries intensify discussions to strengthen already existing anti-crisis devices.
The informal consultations between the Finance Ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their peers of the G20.
And this view also of the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings early next week.
The ECB meets today.

Metro Grand Paris: first sketches financial
Since the time that the debate around the modernization of transport in the Ile-de-France in full swing, billion fell.
In the discussion.
It refers in particular to 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro Society must build Grand Paris.
To start the GSP, the State has announced an investment of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical framework, it is this sum will then enable the GSP to borrow on the markets from funding.
Today, is finally first additions.
The Amending Finance Act of 2010, considered in the finance committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains mechanisms to find this money.
They are two: the creation of a special tax plan and tax offices in the Ile-de-France.
The first, in the text of the draft law on article 15, is "for the benefit of the Society of Grand Paris ."
It was: "The proceeds of this tax is 117 million euros per year ."
The second is a redevelopment tax offices are already "in order to modernize, increasing product and the increase of the Grand Paris ."
This would how?
Mystery.
This is not costed in the text.
The 4 billion.
"It is said that the fiscal resources in addition to the € 4 billion of capital that will be mobilized by the State and provided to the Grand Paris as project," can be read in the explanatory statement.
At the GSP is not the offensive system.
"A when it created the revenue (fees, Ed) can cover studies on three years and in the 4 billion after, says it."
"It will be included in the budget and over time ."
The GSP estimated that 4 billion will be enrolled in 2013 for the budget by 2014.
This device, in which 4 billion promised are still unavailable, may cause a parliamentary discussion a little rough.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Hackers revenge and diligence spies
The WikiLeaks has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal which appears as the scandal to the hypocrisy which governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other, she said changes at the international level, and suggests a future dominated by regression.
But are in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, is confirmation that each case constituted by a secret service (nation) is composed exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American on the sexual habits of Berlusconi's revelations do this which for months could be read in any newspaper (except those which Berlusconi owns), and eerily caricature of Gaddafi was long the cabaret artists on the sketch.
The rule that secret files should be compounds that new already known is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore esoteric publications, you will see that each book (on the Holy Grail, the mystery Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or Rose-Croix) exactly what was written in the books.
And not only because the author of secret texts do not like to make new research (or does not know where to seek new on non-existent), but because those who lead to occultism believe that what they know already, and reconfirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
Ditto for secret files.
The informant is lazy, lazy (or limited spirit) the head of the secret service (otherwise it might be, I do not know, editor at Liberation), which is as true that recognizes.
The top-secret on Berlusconi that the US Embassy in Rome sent to the Department of State were the same as those that Newsweek published the week before.
So why the revelations on these issues have made so much noise?
On the one hand, they say that any person cultivated already know, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since heads of State can call or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic service and, with the exception of a few small exercises representation, into espionage.
Any viewer survey films knows this, and this is the hypocrisy that pretending to ignore it.
However, repeat publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and is in a bad light American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a blow to the prestige of the State Department.
The scandal does it not as crisis victims "executioners ."
But the profound nature of what happened.
In time the Orwell, could develop as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwellian prophecy was proved completely since can monitor each movement through telephone, each transaction, the hotel visited Highway borrowed and the citizen became the victim of the eye of power.
But when, as happens now that even the crypt of the secrets of power can not escape the control of a hacker, the report ceases to be one-way and becomes circular.
The power to control every citizen, but each citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as vengeful citizen, can know all the secrets of power.
How can no longer maintain its own secrets can it take?
It is true, George Simmel said that a real secret is a secret (and secret vacuum can never be unveiled); it is true that know everything on Berlusconi or Merkel is actually a secret secret vacuum, because public; but disclosing the WikiLeaks has done, that the secret of Hillary Clinton were secret empty means to remove any power.
WikiLeaks has not done any harm to Sarkozy and Merkel, but made a too large for Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury inflicted a very powerful power?
It is clear that in the future, states can no longer put online information reserved - it would publish it on a poster on the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that with current technology, it is vain hope to maintain confidential reports by telephone.
Nothing more easy to discover if and when a head of state traveled by plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can be maintained in future reports of private and reserved?
I know that, for the moment, my prediction is science fiction and is therefore, but I am obliged to imagine government agents who move quietly in court to uncontrollable routes, to carry that messages learned by heart or, at most, concealing the scarce information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be stored in a single copy in the drawers locked, the Watergate espionage attempt has been less successful than the WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology advance now crab, i.e. backwards.
A century after the wireless revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-established a telegraph on son (the telephone).
videos (analog) had allowed researchers to film to explore a film, going back and forward and discovering all the secrets of the installation, whereas now the CD (digital) that jump section in chapter, i.e. macroportions.
With high-speed trains, from Rome to Milan in three hours, while in the air, and travel to include it, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not special policy and technical communications back to the cars.
One last comment.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what went on in secret embassies.
Now embassies seeking confidential information to the press.
Climate: how France bidouille funding promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to consider the fulfilment of pledges of funding quickly released (funding fast start and early) made by developed countries.
And large cobble French are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union pledged EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France 1.26 billion euros (420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU has lifted the game to persuade its partners its commitment regarding funding fast start: report detailing the action of its member states, the press conference, the side event, the distribution of brochures ...
The operation transparency is important and appreciated: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU have reached 2010 2.2 billion euros, which is on the right path to respect its commitment to 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when we look at in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be agreed upon in Copenhagen, "new and additional ," in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being to the detriment of official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what it means to "new and additional ."
While the European Commission had proposed a harmonization, some member states including France blocked the proceedings.
Today, everyone chooses the reference should be better.
The European Commission has, for example, regarded as the reference year 2009: international funding are maintained, and add 150 million over three years for the fast start.
Other countries have chosen similar references in the year terms or in terms of the level of official development assistance.
In contrast, France believes that the funding of all new projects of 2010 are "new and additional ."
In other words, there is no reference to previous years or the overall level of official development assistance.
Specifically, the total amount of France's support to developing countries can remain stable or even declining), claims to respect its commitment to the funding of "new and additional" ...
Another crucial element, the distribution of grants and loans.
Again, there is no rule and each chooses its calculation.
Some, such as France, consider 1 € paid is equivalent to 1 €.
Of course, it is hard to justify: effort is not comparable.
While loans may be justified for certain investments profitable (often projects related to the mitigation of emissions based on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to present a euro that will be recouped as equivalent to a euro that ... It should be counted under its commitments that the cost of the loan to the lender (equivalent to an interest rate).
But France do such reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million making 91.5 per cent of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5 per cent of donations (36.1 million euros), see the document the EU to check yourself.
It is the only EU country to use if massive loan.
Germany requires to 46 per cent, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (other) meet their commitments with 100 percent of the donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union is 1 € to meet its commitment, France is only 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Joli trick!
In summary, in its financing fast start, France operates a double scam: on the one hand, the evolution in time and on the other hand, the reality of the financial effort.
In spending that 36.1 million euros it believe that it spends $420 million of "new and additional" consistent with its promises.
The manipulation of the Department of Finance (because it appears that it is the Bercy arbitration has done) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why other Member States would continue to give it enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since developing countries are not completely fooled. ..
Chapter early funding is only a small issue, on the short term, by all the discussions on climate change.
But it could be a grain of sand in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
However, it is essential to learn the lessons of this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its accounting treatment for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and equity with other countries of the European Union.
Above all, France could move forward the discussions on the issues of long-term funding (other crucial chapter currently being discussed: will not escape the "additionality" or policy loans.
France could change its position to become a progressive on these issues is on others.
The hope is the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, which arrives in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on the fast start of France and its vision of "additionality" and use the loans would increase international confidence necessary for progress in the discussions.
Alert pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests a day of 81 different chemical substances, according to a study published on Wednesday the association Future Generations (ex - Movement for Rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warned that its results "do not have significant statistical value in view of the low number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem ," purchased between July and September usually consumed foods in four meals and proposes a day by a child of 10 years, supermarkets in the Oise and Paris.
These meals types, including formal recommendations, five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day, as well as sweets, were examined by the research laboratories of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The assessment base is damning: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are classified as carcinogenic possible or probable and five substances classified as carcinogenic some and 37 substances that act as endocrine disrupters (PE), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Centre for Research on Cancer.
"Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, it is clear in our investigation that consumer exposure to contaminants possibly carcinogenic and/or PE is worrying," notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea contains more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proven as carcinogenic some, as well as nearly 20 residues that can disrupt the hormonal system.
apple, imported from Brazil, as proposes to study, shows signs of six chemicals a fungicide banned in France.
Even for green beans from Kenya, included in the lunch, on which the study detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, chopped steak, canned tuna, and even the bread sticks and chewing gum were littered with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, the salmon steak was more "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and the review of the base in the plastic used to warm meals in the microwave was not free.
The final risk for consumers "cocktails of contaminants" is probably underestimated," according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie - the Greens (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "urgency" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides, to stop "the increase in diseases of civilisation ."
In July, a study by the European Agency for Food Security (EFSA) was the presence of 365 different pesticides residues in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 in cereals.
