At the end of the trade, the Prague stock exchange bascula negative 
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague stock exchange réctifia its losses. 
Transactions with the actions čez reached almost half the daily interaction. 
Tuesday, in the early exchanges, the Prague stock exchange renoua with his chute of the day before, when she lost almost six percent. 
This time, the decline is due to the drop in shares on Wall Street. 
The market reaction to the outcome of the US House of Representatives, who refused to adopt the plan of stabilisation of the US financial sector, it is seen at home as well. 
Falling shares in Asia 
The Asian bourses lived Tuesday a dramatic fall, even if the indices succeeded, during the day, to erase some of the losses. 
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong stock exchange lost four percent during the exchanges, but later, he effaça part of losses and reduced the decline in nearly 2.5 percent. 
The Hang Seng index China enterprises following the movement of Chinese actions of the Hong Kong stock exchange lost 3.8 per cent, the markets are closed in Shanghai. 
The actions of the Sydney lost more than five percent, but finally we managed to reduce losses to 4.3 per cent. 
According to its index, the Taiwan stock exchange lost 3.6 percent. 
"The reluctance about the action to rescue the USA will have an impact on financial markets around the world," observed Joseph yam, the head of the Hong Kong monetary agency. 
Although Hong Kong is part of China, he made his monetary policy itself, regardless of the Chinese central bank. 
Interest rates have in Hong Kong the same level as the United States. 
According to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin rudd, us legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal of the financial system. 
Otherwise, on risk that other countries have the impact. 
The bloodshed of U.S. actions 
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the draft supports the financial system, in which she would have had to spend up to $700 billion (nearly 12 bilions kč). 
Legislators renièrent and the appeal in support of the project of President George Bush. 
According to Bush, the project should resolve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the economy as a whole. 
American actions lived, Monday, a bloodbath and the main indices of shares ended the largest drop over the last 20 years. 
The Dow Jones lost nearly seven percent, with a fall of such magnitude for the last time in 1987. 
The index lost already during the vote, but when it became apparent that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall. 
The Congress gave: the government of the USA can inject $700 billion in banks 
The leaders of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of the agreement of financial assistance to the US financial system. 
It will be submitted to the vote in early next week. 
US legislators occurred a turning point in the talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance from an amount of $700 billion (about 12 trillion kroner), awarded to the U.S. financial system. 
The success is not so sure. 
Indeed, prior to publish the final version of the law and submit it to the vote, the congressmans must complete a number of details of the agreement. 
The plan to support the financial system will be examined Monday in the House of Representatives. 
Said Sunday at the Reuters agency barney Frank, the chairman of the Committee on banking and financial regulation of the House. 
According to sources, Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should be put to a vote in the Senate. 
According to economists, the announcement of the fact that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a first major psychological factor to revive the financial markets. 
Or, given the complexity of the mechanisms by which the aide to markets can be effective, will follow a "disappointment". 
Paulson: the plan must be effective 
"We have made significant progress. 
We set our views regarding the form that should have the package of measures for stability in the market," telling the agency Bloomberg the Democrat Nancy pelosi. 
In it, the final vote could be made as early as Sunday. 
In the Saturday night to Sunday, representatives of American lawmakers met with the Minister of Finance Henry Paulson, in order to give the government a final form. 
It should buy, with financial companies, the real estate assets sold that lead to financial firms in losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole. 
"We are on the verge of agreeing on a plan that will work and who should be, also, effective on the market. 
He still needs to continue the markets recovery plan, but I think that we have," said Paulson. 
A signal for Asian exchanges 
The global financial crisis has implications for the actions that fall. 
According to Senator Democrat does évadiez Harry Reid, legislators are so that the Congress can lead to a final agreement on Sunday. 
They want and calm investors before the early exchanges on the Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the decision of Congress could affect trade on Monday. 
Or, for the moment, it is impossible to say with certainty when both houses of the US Congress will hold their vote, or if negotiations are not likely to remain blocked, at the last moment, by a particular problem. 
Lawmakers hope that it will be adopted in the days to come. 
However, the law will many changes. 
The total amount for the system should be divided into two parts. 
The first $350 billion, as the wished to President George Bush, should be available as soon as possible. 
But, if the Congress will have the impression that the program does not comply with its function, it has the power to block the granting of the remaining amount, in two steps: first 100 billion, and, finally, $350 billion. 
Mr. Bush hmcs progress in the negotiations 
While the President can put its veto to this decision, the Congress, has the opportunity to put the minority. 
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain finance for the redemption of bad real estate titles, including the value fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to pay their mortgages, was maintained. 
"all the work is done. 
The House of Representatives should be able to carry out Sunday to vote on the legislation, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd gregg. 
US President George Bush is content of progress in the negotiations. 
His spokesman Tony fratto said that Mr. Bush was pleased the progress made Saturday and appreciated "the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy". 
Limitation of golden parachutes 
The Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher dodd, chief negotiator, said that legislators have agreed on the financial program, the protection of contributing against losses, the agreement of relief, the plan on the axis of the time. 
The new law also plans to limit those golden parachutes for the directors of companies involved in the program and establish a committee, who will monitor the money. 
It should be managed by the Ministry of Finance. 
"We worked very hard on the issue and have made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson. 
The plan also provides assistance to property owners, who have problems with pay. 
The government should negotiate new installments in the case of mortgages that it will redeem, while reducing the monthly payment accounts receivable and by allowing them to keep their homes. 
Marek: a psychological help 
According to the chief economist of Patria finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult. 
"And this is due to the fact that you don ’ t know what will be the mechanism and the price of purchase to problems. 
This point is key to decide on the sharing of losses in the financial sector and the government," said Marek, this week, the server ihned.cz. 
If the plan is adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, is, Marek, not so important that it. 
"It is much more important than the congressmans agree, this week, they support this plan and that they devote as soon as possible. 
This psychological significance of the agreement providing for the adoption of the plan, is most important in this moment," said Marek. 
A battle thrust to the extreme: MP3 players against the mobiles. 
You will, choosing 
While virtually all mobile read the MP3 files, no MP3 player knows call. 
It seems to be clear that it is better to buy only a phone. 
However that there are sufficient grounds to get an independent player. 
The choice depends entirely on the use and the requirements of the future owner. 
It would be absurd to buy for the house a gramophone cher, to put the new album of maxim turbulenc. 
On the one hand, such music products do not go out on vinyl record, and, from the point of view of the quality, there is no reason objective, for that to happen. 
Or, if there is in your shelves of vinyl records huddled together with the art rock, jazz or blues, you want at least likely of such a gramophone. 
It is music for travel, namely the compressed music, to put it simplified - of music in the MP3. 
Here, too, there are categories based on price and quality. 
For one, it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, in the same way as a fan of pink floyd would have difficulty supporter of headphones purchased for 20 crowns in the market. 
These two extremes, of which there is enough room for everyone. 
The choice is large. 
The life of the battery is also crucial 
Some readers high-end music are capable of much more than a simple reading music, but it is unknown function, of course, most mobiles. 
No current system Universal is also the phone. 
A side of key functions, telephone calls and sending SMS, he is able to read music and films, recording the latter, it has a camera of variable quality and can, for example, to be used in navigation. 
And if one takes into account the smartphones and communicators, you have in your pocket a small computer. 
Given that no frigidaire knows griller meat and no television will take photographs, we are witnessing almost a miracle. 
Or, the universality of the mobile is not without problems. 
Plus the number of functions that you use, plus the interval between two rechargements will be reduced. 
And reading music is one of the most important goinfres energy. 
Are rare in the mobile that are able to read music for 10 to 12 hours, in most cases, this figure is much lower. 
In this regard, readers of music (especially the most rudimentary) are significantly more effective. 
In the case of mobile market, count that they will play music that for a few hours. 
Moreover, if you happen to call from time to time, get, to be sisters, a second charge for the work - this is valid even for the more expensive. 
SE problem will not arise for MP3 players, who are able, as a result of reloading, a continuous operation at least 9 hours, including the less effective. 
Another problem occurs during the recording of music in the mobile. 
Unfortunately, that a limited part of equipment has a universal usb connector, and not all can not be directly connected to the computer, without a special software. 
On May, of course, record music directly on the memory stick, but little card readers know how to be without reduction, given the tiny dimensions of memory cards used in the mobiles. 
In regard to readers, you only need, without exception (ipod), no software. 
It is complete, through the usb connector, the music device from the computer. 
Most mobiles and readers will create a library media classified according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, style, or after the judgment of the user. 
Some devices are an index with a tree structure, in the manner of the explorer of windows, others are capable of two (iriver, samsung, Sony, cowon, the smart phones with operating system). 
Readers are easier to manipulate, the mobile have more expertise 
In the choice of a concrete, go to the life of the battery, to the ability of memory, quality and type of her and, of course, to the ease of the order. 
If the music is, essentially, a fond and if in the day you will listen to that for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you need any mobile reading the MP3. 
Virtually all mobiles are now able. 
You can not even required to too much attention to music formats that the mobile or the reader is able to read. 
All arrive to read the MP3 and the vast majority of music that is reaching out to you what format. 
It is one of the most common formats and in part, the vast majority of devices arrive to read music also wma format. 
The aac (format used by the firm Apple and its ipod), for him, is less common. 
The high-end mobile also allow, for example, the purchase of online music. 
It is sufficient to visit, since the mobile phone operator, web pages (or those of another provider) and buy the song or album in question. 
This service alone should be a compelling reason to get a mobile musical. 
The offer is unfortunately miserable and it is, in most cases, the radio tubes quickly facts. 
Prices are not the lowest. 
Nevertheless, it is generally considered that the way to buy music (either by GSM, wireless Internet, even by the Internet) dominate the music industry in the future. 
Most people are always their mobile on itself. 
A whenever you want to listen to something, you need to get the mobile money out of your own pocket, so that you forgot your MP3 player at home. 
Or, it is also important if you have on your headphones or a handsfree with connection. 
If this is not the case, you can use the pregnant integrated, that have virtually all mobile, but a minimum of MP3 players. 
For many, the main advantage of mobile music is their price. 
The cheapest are usually less than three thousand. 
For three and four thousand crowns, you can have a walkman already very suitable. 
Or, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of exit for headphones. 
The price of phones and better equipped, also filled a entrée for ordinary headphones, does not exceed 15 mile. 
Readers, however, have the advantage of being an easy. 
Do not matter who arrive to ensure control of readers the most rudimentary - that may not necessarily be the least expensive (see our choice). 
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the order with that of a cassette, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious. 
There is no risk of collision in the form of a mobile Internet connected by chance, followed by an invoice data immense. 
What device choose 
Even the least expensive mobile (e.g. the Vodafone 527) generally have a slot for memory cards for (the type M2, microsd, and so on). 
Even taking into account the purchase of such a card, you do n't go more than two thousand crowns. 
But be careful. 
The basic models do support in principle that maps with a maximum capacity of 2 gb. 
Only the most expensive are faring even with 8 gb of memory cards. 
If you already have a mobile and want to buy an MP3 player Bon Marché, take a cowon, a creative, Sony, samsung, a emgeton, or a iriver. 
Based on the ability (Max 2 gb), you should not spend more than 1,100 crowns. 
If you are part of the listeners more demanding, choose specialized mobiles-walkman (Sony Ericsson, Nokia and samsung). 
These devices are equipped with touches of independent order for MP3, and this is the ease of the order is closer to that of a MP3 player. 
Sony Ericsson, the mobile of the walkman series have the same user menu that of MP3 players sold separately, is that went as far in this area. 
The same service, in the same category of price, but with a capacity of memory (up to 16 gb) and a life of the battery (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the brands mentioned above. 
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this année-même. 
Perhaps 
The mobile market in Czech Republic is relatively advanced, our operators offering virtually the same services that their partners in Western Europe. 
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, to force the classic operators to lower prices. 
It may be that it will not for a long time. 
We already mentioned, repeatedly, on mobil.cz the fact that the Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe. 
The čtú (the Czech telecommunications), who reported that the price of a SMS was higher among us that in the rest of the Union, has confirmed. 
It is and that, following the last of the European Commission in the area of the regulation of roaming fees, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - the SMS sent from abroad will be cheaper for some clients of Czech mobile operators that the country. 
How is it possible that the Czech Republic remains so high, in comparison with Europe? 
The answer is simple, the lack of competition that would really get into the fight. 
It may seem counterintuitive, given that we have three mobile networks and penetration well beyond the 100%. 
Au contraire, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely concurrenciez. 
In this Pavel dvořák, the President of the Czech telecommunications (čtú), who has repeatedly stated that in Czech Republic there was more room for another operator, is chorus with operators. 
It is probably true that a operator classic with its own network apparently did a lot of chance (and now, it will find that difficult for frequency). 
Or, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator. 
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators on the mobile market that has led to a significant drop in prices, which were subsequently, respond also operators classics. 
Yet, even before the entry of spoilers such as Tesco mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, the voice similar to those that today are meant for us, suggested in Britain. 
Or, it appeared that he remained of the place for such operators and that they could have a real success. 
We are not obliged to get too far to find examples. 
In February we informed the launch, in Poland, the virtual operator mobilking. 
In just six months, the operator has managed to win over 100 thousand clients and become the fifth operator in the country. 
Also behind the mobilking, there is the financial group Penta, which has among the U: fon in Czech Republic. 
The advantage of virtual operators as the opportunity to focus on a target group much more concrete. 
For their operation to be effective, they need far fewer clients that a classical operator. 
They are, in effect, free of construction, operation and maintains the mobile network, relatively high. 
That is how in the world, virtual operators are emerging as operators to lower costs - they offer appeals and SMS Bon Marché, which is often countered with an offer of services limited. 
For example Tesco mobile, in Britain, the SMS at least two times cheaper than its competitors. 
Or, as demonstrated by the example of mobilking in Poland, building on an unusual target group may also be a lot of advertising. 
In effect, the operator specifically targets men. 
"real men choose mobilking - an operator who they like and which they can trust," said David seibert, the CEO of mobile entertainment company, this virtual operator. 
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to walk at home as well. 
Miroslav čepický, the voice of Vodafone, in doubt: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, which is based on most of the virtual operators. 
Much more than it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the provision of services." 
In Czech, no chance, say the mobile operators 
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, this will not be mobilking. 
"We discuss the expansion of this project, but in Czech negotiations are not very promoter. 
The launch of mobilking will instead in other countries in our area," said in a telephone has to mobil.cz Jana studničková, spokesperson for the Penta Financial Group. 
She has indirectly confirmed that the operators in Czech Republic were, in any case, not in favour of this idea. 
Au contraire, they are trying to do everything possible to ensure that a potential competitor can appear. 
The group GTS novera, which would also take a further step in order to become a real competitor of telefonika in the field of clients business, has made no secret, long enough, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator. 
"We would like to be able to offer to our clients not only of fixed, but also mobile telecommunications services. 
And the sooner the better. 
We ’ ve done negotiations about this opportunity to several times with the Czech mobile operators. 
With some, we managed to advance in the negotiations," said the group's spokesman Pavel kaidl. 
So maybe the future is bright. 
According to information and, it appears that maybe we could host the first virtual operator already by the end of the year. 
But for the moment, it is accompanied by a total silence. 
"At this time, we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such. 
The Czech market is in comparison with other very specific. 
For the moment, no issue with a serious and complex project in this area, we contacted," said vlastimil sršeň of press telefonika O2, in his return to mobil.cz. 
Other operators will also include the specificity of the Czech market. 
The t-mobile spokesperson martina kemrová said in a rare agreement with the return of O2: "We have not registered for the moment of viable project and bilaterally beneficial, which could serve as a base." 
And she said: "It is almost inconceivable that a virtual operator appears in the t-mobile network by the end of the year. 
To operate in a period of time also limited, we should have now of a concrete agreement." 
Vodafone is rather focus on the performance of requests for its own 3G licence. 
Miroslav čepický said in relation to this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the field of costs and infrastructure shared. 
This is what we believe, means the more input from the point of view of clients. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area are the discovery of a partner to put in place a common network for a mobile Internet." 
The authorities: in phase with the operators 
The approach of the mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase of competition, would lead to a decline in prices and therefore a decline in their benefit. 
What good is to facilitate the creation of a competitor? 
When it comes to their interests, the operators know it larrons in fair. The fight with the creation of U: fon, also testified. 
The apparent increased pressure on the čtú, during the creation of the U: fon, was that exercised by the company t-mobile. 
On information available to the public from the čtú Web pages. 
Today, however, the U: fon is used as an excuse to not accept a virtual operator. 
Martina kemrová noted: "competition in the mobile market has been, more recently, amplified by entering the market for a fourth mobile operator. 
Given the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is clear that the entry of a player additional submit it, and especially its services, to very high standards." 
But given the attitude of mobile operators that the indifference of Czech regulatory agencies is daunting. 
It is not only of the attitude of čtú, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately did not, in Czech, the power to intervene in the economic competition. 
It is wholly owned by the Office for the protection of the economic competition (úohs). 
Or, the latter adopted, dealing with this issue, its position. 
"the entry of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator on the location of the infrastructure necessary. 
No agreement has been reached for the moment, because the offer from potential bidders did a priori not presented enough interest for conventional operators," said in response to our question kristián eight-metre of external relations department of úohs. 
A statement made and if not the part of representatives operators. 
But from an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and between autre also take care, that person will take advantage of its position on the market, such a declaration is more than confusing. 
Much more than kristián eight-metre added: "a abroad, where the virtual operators are normally present, we can see that their entry on the market has contributed to a decline in the price of mobile services." 
Or, push in the direction of a functioning honest market and a decline in prices is apparently not part of the úohs. 
What is actually shocking, it is the Concorde almost touching of three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions. 
The question, if he is truly a chance, is naturally. 
In the same way, a price of gasoline strictly identical to all service stations is certainly random and the uphill battle of competition. 
"The agency has not been identified, on this subject, signs of a anticompétitif behaviour, there was no reason to intervene in one way or another. 
No operators a dominant position, none was therefore a corresponding responsibility for his behaviour on the market. 
The tools necessary to market opening mobile virtual operators are probably even in telecommunications regulator," said in his statement chaloupa. 
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many points of contention. 
Of course, there is a market analysis relevant developed by the čtú telecommunications, that is, from the point of view of the economic competition, a single market. 
None of the Czech operators a dominant position on such a market. 
However, some experts suggest an alternative vision of things: for the creation of a virtual operator is possible, it should get, each time, the consent of the network operator. 
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network. 
It is as well as he played a leading role in a certain segment of its business. 
Or, even without admit this argument, it should be at least concern for the úohs that three mobile operators are clearly in a similar manner. 
Yet, the complaints many (including the GTS novera, already mentioned) show that they face, in negotiations with all operators, similar constraints. 
Do the responsibility on the čtú is a tour quite common in communications, in which the úohs washed his hands of the case. 
We have already met with this type of attitude in several similar cases. 
On unfortunately has not been able to get in the novélisation of the Telecommunications Act, adopted recently, expanded the powers of the čtú on the area of the economic competition in telecommunications, although many experts promised an improvement of the situation. 
This, representatives of the úohs must be fully knowledge, but their interests are apparently other part. 
When no one is looking, it can walk 
That said, the operation of a kind of virtual operators pseudo, many in mobile networks Czechs, remains unnoticed. 
It is business publishing their own price list of mobile services, but they are public that in part. 
In most cases, it is question of firms involved in the multi-level marketing. 
Mobile phone services particularisés are proposed for example by amway, Bohemia Telecom, starlife and many others. 
Price lists of these firms can generally only for elected. 
The magic is in the fact that the company is before the operator figure of a client traditional business, who commands a large amount of SIM cards. 
As a major customer, she received the quoted prices (and others). 
This problem, it is that the conditions of all mobile operators Czech prohibit such resale. 
"If there is what you describe, it could be a breach of contract terms that we would consider and which could lead to a judgment of the collaboration with the company in question," answered our questions concerning this problem martina kemrová. 
However, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such activity failed to responsible for mobile operators. 
Especially in the case of three companies mentioned it can be thousands of customers. 
Auncun operator, however, does against such a procedure. 
Indeed, the activities of these firms have non-négligeables benefits, and, at the same time, as opposed to virtual operators real, they do not threaten with their own marketing official. 
Miroslav čepický shows the potential problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of these businesses are used only by a percentage of customers negligible. 
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, they may not have fully, in the manner of regular clients of mobile operators." 
Or, it is this that should seem strange to čtú. 
In addition, another question arises in úohs. 
If the mobile operators blind eye to such a procedure, why bloquent-ils the creation of a virtual operator? 
It should be noted that the úohs has relatively broad powers to disclose such activity, and if he does not wish just explanations of operators, who say they have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions the ban. 
When we will no longer be the most expensive country 
As we have said repeatedly, the entry of virtual operators on the mobile market has made a dramatic fall in the price of services. 
Or, in virtually all countries where appeared virtual operators, traditional operators are trying, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation. 
The arguments used by these were virtually the same - a market too small or too busy, problems with the quality of services, etc. 
Or, it is at this level that intervened, in developed countries, the regulatory bodies, who defended not the interests of mobile operators, but those of their clients. 
By formal action as well as an informal pressure, they eventually get the creation of a prime virtual operator, followed by others. 
Unfortunately, the regulatory bodies Czech address this issue in the manner of a hot potato that it will be sending it to a target near. 
As a result of the experiments that we have, we can not get rid of the impression that confusion in the skills is in these cases more than profitable. 
But not give the handle up so easily. 
If the information of scenes are true and a virtual operator will appear soon in France, the Czech mobile market is perhaps in movement. 
If one operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the úohs can only to remain impassible face rejection (discrimination) other interested parties. 
And we will have to call more expensive than in the rest of Europe. 
The new Czech anthem has four new versions. 
Choose the best 
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem. 
Sunday, on the occasion of the Czech nationality, Prime Minister mirek topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem kde domov můj (where is my country?). 
The anthem has again been recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Carlo bělohlávek. 
We have four versions - with a song solo male or female, an interpretation with choir and an instrumental version. 
The song is provided by kateřina kněžínková and Adam plachetka. 
Otakar jeremiáš and jaroslav krček are the authors of the arrangements of the anthem. 
You can listen to the four new versions on the server ihned.cz. 
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national as one of the most beautiful hymns. 
As it had already given previously to český rozhlas (the Czech public radio), he chose for the interpretation of versions solo singers with voice young and representative, who are marked and appreciated. 
"From the beginning, I tried to take care that the two singers, as well as the choir, have a good diction, so it knows the words, that they sing simultaneously," he said. 
The Czech national anthem, celebrate the next year, his 175è anniversary. 
The chant kde domov můj sounded for the first time in 1834 on the boards of stavovské divadlo (the theatre of states) in fidlovačka (fair savetiers), exhibit original Czech Josef kajetán tyl, accompanied by music františek škroup. 
It has become popular and people are the appropriate spontaneously. 
After the creation of the tchécoslaovaquie in 1918, the first verse naturally became an integral part of the national anthem. 
It was one of seven national symbols even after the creation of the Czech Republic independent. 
How is the "new" hymne 
Public transportation (mhd) pragois introduce Wednesday, the chip in their ticketing system 
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be included in the history of pražský dopravní podnik (the agency pragoise transportation) as the date on which ships in the subway, the trams and buses the first passengers, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will be in their pocket an electronic coupon. 
In this moment, this is accessible for about a hundred thousand people, owners of the smart card opencard. 
Passengers can buy a coupon 30 days or 90 days (it will be valid from 1 January 2009) and both the register on their smart card in the points of information and the offices of dopravní podnik (the transportation agency), located in the metro stations muzeum, můstek, nádraží holešovice, anděl, roztyly, letňany, kobylisy, rajská zahrada, kačerov and Luka. 
From yesterday, there is also the option to buy the Internet coupons on the web pages of dopravní podnik: www.dpp.cz. 
More than four hundred people took advantage of the service during the morning. 
Those who begin to use the online store can forget a final machines in the metro stations, where they were up to this tiny anticipation in long queues for the purpose of obtaining tickets on paper. 
Indeed, they buy their coupon via the Internet and on the record on the map opencard in one of the 13 městská knihovna (libraries). 
"In these points contact, there are available to passengers a window with a trained staff, which will help people with the purchase by Internet and, in addition, record the coupon that they have purchased on their card," said the project spokesman Martin opatrný. 
A side of libraries, it will be possible to record the electronic coupons on the opencard in vending machines installed in the vestibule of several métro stations. 
What are these distributors? 
They are red, recall the machines to composting tickets and the passengers may have already noticed in the metro stations roztyly, budějovická, I. P. pavlova, florenc and vltavská. 
"Today, the town in a five, but by the end of the year, there should be passed," added opatrný. 
Equipment will monitor the coupon to the place of the driver 
The vending machines that will operate from tomorrow, are easy to use. 
It is sufficient to introduce the chip opencard and the coupon purchased earlier will register himself on the map. 
The electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the outskirts of the city. 
A knowledge in the suburban rail and bus lines 300 to 500, that use essentially the inhabitants of Commons Bohemia central to the capital. 
"In the trains in pražská integrovaná doprava (integrated transport of Prague), controllers are equipped with card readers, to which they establish the validity and zonal coupons;" explained the temporary control of Filip drápal notes of the organization ropid, who designs the transit schedules pragois. 
Suburban buses are equipped with integrated card readers to the driver. 
During boarding it is necessary not only to show the chip to the driver, but he is also placing the opencard at the place on the side of the fund. 
It is and that the driver control the validity of the coupons. 
"In cases where the passenger would need to verify the validity of coupons registered, there is nothing more simple than request such information to the driver," was drápal. 
Passengers who do not take the bus suburban and did not remember the date the validity of their coupon expires, can reach to new vending machines, originally used to record the coupons on the map. 
This is, on the screen of the device, that will be posted information about the validity of their document. 
The Sudetenland called for a referendum in the USA 
The Germans of the Sudetenland asked in 1945 to what šumava is integrated into the United States. 
This is the result of a letter filed in the collections of the jihočeská vědecká knihovna (the library of the South Bohemia). 
If we can not be part of Germany and Austria, we want to at least live under the management of the United States of America. 
In 1945, some groups of Germans of the Sudetenland were allegedly to President of the United States with such a desire. 
This is among other a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now lodged in the collections of the jihočeská vědecká knihovna. 
The German český krumlov pray in the letter the American president not to allow "šumavská župa" (Forest region south of La Bohème) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich agreement - is made to Czechoslovakia. 
"We understand the situation and want to be sure that the words proclaiming that American troops are on the German territory not in oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is written in the letter, signed "people, which the fate of the šumava takes to heart". 
Given that the Council to Czechoslovakia was allegedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - that of brutality, attitude poorly, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter urged the president to take in his hands the protectorate of the šumava for now and forever. 
"We can not believe you would grant the territory to a foreign country to us, that oppresses and destroyed minorities and has no contributed to the Allied victory without taking into account the opinion of the quarter of a million residents," is written in the letter. 
The reason supposed to which the authors can not sign the letter is the fear of revenge of Czech "oppressors". 
If the President of the United States was of the opinion of Germans in šumava, he did that, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine whether its people wanted to be part of USA, or live under the management of the United States. 
Although the text in the letter may, given the current understanding of the history of the war, seem somewhat naïvely, according to some survivors, it illustrates the expectations of German Sudetenland at the time. 
While the Germans Czechs were at least that the question of their expulsion of the Republic will be, very few of them are reported such a possibility. 
Some waited for the United States and Britain would get to the Sudetenland a certain type of autonomy. 
Others believed they would simply in Czechoslovakia. 
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav eight-metre, born in contacted budějovice, the confirms. 
During the war, it was, as German contacted budějovice, joined the Navy in the Baltic states. 
When, at the end of the war, he was captured by the English and placed in the camp of capture of the region Holstein, dozens of German Czechs were available for what they learn the Czech. 
"They believed that once back home, the Czech would be profitable," said eight-metre. 
None of the Germans captured who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war did, he said, that, following the orders Beneš, it would be expelled from the Republic. 
You do n't think - you pay! 
An emotional campaign address drivers 
The action road safety the more expensive in the Czech history. 
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign that with the intention to launch, on Wednesday, the Department of Transportation. 
The minister aleš řebíček believes that it will discourage drivers of a dangerous behaviour at the wheel. 
This campaign costing $150 million will appear on television, radio, film, on the Internet, but also on tracts. 
It should discourage drivers of the expeditious conduct and drinking and driving. 
But also remind them to take the belt before starting. 
It is especially touching the conscience of young drivers, biker, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers. 
What will appear in the spots? 
Especially personal stories that will address the emotions. 
There is also the slogan "bloody" of the entire campaign: 
You do n't think - you pay! 
The phrase "you do n't think" is recorded in on the registration plate. 
Then, in a pool of blood, there is the phrase "you paieras". 
What needs to signify that we can pay the life a moment of inattention. 
The spots are "haunt" spectators until 2010. 
The department is inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see commonly images with dramatic images of victims of accidents. 
He believes that this will lead to a decline in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on the roads Czechs. 
The spots were prepared by the agency euro rscg. 
The strategy of the sugar and the whip against drivers 
"What works with drivers, it is the system of sugar and of the Whip. 
For them, the sugar is represented, for example, by the fact to save time, when they burn-out a red light. 
The whip, it is the threat of a fine or an accident. 
Risks should be recalled to drivers," said Martin kořán, the transport of the hospital psychologist na homolce. 
This is what we need information campaigns in the press and mostly negative ads, a psychologist. 
Signs indicating the danger to drivers are, according to him, already less effective. 
"When a static panel that warns against a danger is installed, it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will notice more," warned kořán. 
Olmert would in exchange for peace almost all the occupied territories 
Ehud Olmert, the Israeli President of an interim government, ruled in favour of the restitution of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Golan Heights in return for peace with Palestine and Syria. 
He made that statement in an interview published Monday by the daily Yedioth ahronoth. 
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all the occupied territories (or all)," said Olmert on a daily basis. 
"We will hold a certain percentage of territory, but we need to let the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory), because without it, the peace will not happen," he said. 
He admitted that the restitution would include East Jerusalem. 
"Who wants to security in Jerusalem, and especially does not want of tractors and bulldozers to smash the feet, as had happened in one of my best friends, will have to parts of Jerusalem," Olmert noticed, referring to the two attacks in the city, in July, during which several people were killed and dozens of people were injured. 
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred places and historic" located inside of the old city. 
"Who will maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city would be forced to integrate 270,000 Arab. 
This will not work," it was noted that subsequently. 
Retirement of the Golan Heights 
Olmert also ruled in favour of the retirement of the Golan Heights, which Israel is, according to him, a prerequisite for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria. 
Or, it would also require some effort on the part of Damascus. 
"I'm not make peace with Syria only on the basis of a Golan retreat," signala-t-il. 
"The Syrians know very well what they are going to give to get the Golan. 
They are going to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to waive their relationship with the Hezbollah movement (Shiite); they will have to give up the support for constant they attach to the terrorism of the Hamas movement (Shiite), the al-kaïda (terrorist network), as well as that of Jihad (holy war) in Iraq," said the prime minister. 
Questions that arise after the accident: the stewards in the car are illegal? 
The act ignore; walking in a car long distance is prohibited 
In the context of the tragic accident coach of society student agency near Padua, Italy, there's the question if the stewards and passengers may during the trip move inside the bus. 
"If you wanted to strictly enforce the law and formal, the activity of a steward is contrary to the road traffic act," said the spokesperson of the Department of Transport Karel hanzelka. 
The accident in question, during which has claimed a host of 22 years old, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that has crossed the path of the bus. 
The girl was at that time unfortunately sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous of the vehicle, although it has at its disposal two other seats. 
Or, the bus may have an accident, even stop abruptly, also at the time of the steward is the coffee or distributes newspapers. 
What is important is if the bus is under its fact sheet equipped with standing or not. 
If this equipment for standing is not registered, passengers must stay. 
Buses long distance student agency does not have places standing, which has been confirmed to aktuálně.cz by the director of the company radim jančura. 
"It is a question that we dealt with the department and, initially, it prohibits any movement of passengers. 
Then they have cancelled and we got that passengers can go to the bathroom during the trip on condition that they have their own seat," he unveiled his position. 
The act ignore the steward 
"There is no legal interpretation than the role of steward - there is no legal requirement is responsible for this role. 
On the other hand, no legal requirement does not prohibit the carrier to provide services. 
The law on road transport is only the term recipient of vehicle; it does not define its rights and duties," says with more marked the hanzelka spokesman. 
Josef pokorný, the director of the Department of motor vehicles, traffic is, on the contrary, that the law deals with enough the problem. 
"Everything depends on whether the bus has in its licensing permission to offer of seats. 
It lies in there," he says. 
Buses are divided into urban, where there are places and a maximum speed, distance with places and a higher speed allowed and in buses long distance without upright with the highest speed limits and seats equipped with seat belts. 
As in the aircraft, said an expert 
Jaroslav hořín, traffic expert to besip (security) safe in the transport, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem. 
"at a regular circulation, there was no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service in the aircraft. 
Again, it is not clear when a turbulence and the host of the air can knock the head." 
"or, in the cases where the bus had stopped in a brusque manner, the laws of physics would obviously be valid. 
In the same way that in an urban bus or a tram. 
The carrier to manage the safety of stewards by internal prescriptions," he says, and also found that from the point of view of the law, the issue is not resolved. 
Jančura is ready to remove these services 
Student agency is the only carrier bus to offer the services of stewards. 
He hired two cent. 
Even after the accident, the director does not consider their trade as a trade at risk. 
"However, as soon as I get the impression that he is a trade at risk, I supprimerai. 
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper to boarding. 
It also would reduce the cost," he says. 
The security concern is the reason that gives the absence of stewards in its vehicles the director of the asiana Alexei litvine, which, in comparison with her, a very small number of lines. 
"We do n't have to host. We oppose it since the beginning. 
Sooner or later it will end by a fatal accident," he said, there is a years, to týden.cz. 
A huge tragedy came 
A young hostess of the region of plzeň, who worked for the company for two years, has died in the accident on the line of Naples. 
A truck Slovenian was probably left the band emergency stop without the use of flashing and it has blocked the road to the bus. 
The driver of the last to try to avoid using a manoeuvre brusque, but it has been by his right side. 
Jančura refuse that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards have been sold. 
"In the case of lines long distance, it is not possible to reserve seats, they are blocked." 
The company will file a complaint against the driver of the truck. 
For compensation to the family of the girl, the agency will not wait the judgment of the court, but as far as the financial compensation, she also relies on the guilty. 
A change in the law? 
Not for 
A change in the law, which is being developed, for more than a year, by a group of 30 experts from the Department of Transport, could provide details as the stewards aboard the bus. 
"or, it did not lead to any conclusion on this point. 
True, it does not too bus, but rather the points system, to the maximum speed on the highway and the use of portable driving," said the expert hořín. 
"The Department of Transportation does not consider the activity of stewards as something that would basically risk the safety of passengers," the spokesman hanzelka, noting that control of security buses is under the authority of the police and the Office for security at work. 
The hopes of düsseldorfois based on Frankfurt. 
The words were not in the letter sent by the committee director of WestLB to employees of the House. 
As a union of the Financial Institute in Düsseldorf entities with the deka-bank of Frankfurt, "the institution central financial markets of Financial Group sparkasse" would be, according to the letter made public Monday. 
WestLB would provide "block of competence" doubled to sustainable productivity in such a case. 
After all, such a relationship would be the coup mailing critical to other concentrations in the banking sector of Länder. 
That is what it was like when a Committee executive board is keen to demonstrate its ability to action in difficult times. 
Car WestLB, injured, is always a strong pressure. 
This is not only the European Commission, but also the federal oversight of the Financial Services Authority, which has only recently, made it clear to the government of land of rhenanie of nord-westfalie that the time was counted in the search for a solution. 
It is, however, question for some time - also from Frankfurt - of a relationship in a form between the bank deka, who know the customers of the sparkasse by their investment fund, and WestLB. 
While the head of the deta-bank Franz waas said at the presentation of the half in late August that he saw no meaning in the amalgamation of the House of the mainzer landstrasse with a bank of land, that this is the helaba or WestLB. 
However, the board of directors of the deka, which each half is supported and by the banks of the Länder and by the groups in savings, instructed the Steering Committee of the talks with WestLB to commercial activities. 
He could then be the flow of the financial market, or parts of it. 
The talks have however only started, was told in the financial sector. 
This is not the first time that the deta-bank, which, with its 3,000 employees, account for one of the largest employers on the financial centre of Frankfurt, comes into play when it comes to industry consolidation of savings. 
In 2003 on a thought for a moment that the deta-bank could merge with the Bank of land of North wars and the halbab. 
Nothing is yet emerged from this bouquet simultaneously. 
Only the plans had they been made public that the government in Hesse voted against any participation of the hellaba in them. 
Subsequently, the other two houses no longer is not rejoignèrent. 
The Bank of land of North wars was attached to the place to the Bank of land of bade-wuttenberg in Stuttgart. 
But there were always new negotiations on the consolidation of the deka-bank with banks of Länder. 
Finally, Günther merl, chairman of the steering committee of the hellaba, was opposed to any commercial strategy of merger with its bank. 
Regardless of this, the sentiment seems to be spreading that the consolidation of different institutions of the public sector is particularly urgent. 
Now that the election to Parliament the land of Bavaria is past, a union of 176 with the Bank of land of bade-wuttenberg could occur in the first. 
For the helaba, it is not particularly good news. 
If the pressure that oblige to new mergers would increase, potential partners are gradually. 
In the South, she is now a junior partner, although she has so far resisted the crisis better than the banks of Munich and Stuttgart. 
The grouping of savings and transfers of hesse-thuringe, who owns 85 percent of the helaba, a contrast from a bolt at the beginning of the year on any union with WestLB. 
Would even the nordlb. 
Such thoughts géo-stratégiques does, however, that one of the facets. 
Another facet is the question of how the different business models of each of these banks may have. 
In June, merl stated that the key issue, to know what business model the future ability of regional banks should be assured, had not been previously resolved by the German group of savings and transfers. 
A term, a dismantling of WestLB could take place whaling, who here, of course, is not wanted. 
It is also what it is question in the Committee executive board in place: in any case, would be referred to a global `solution 'for the institution. 
How all this will be placed in the same basket with the Union of some entities with the deta-bank remains to be seen. 
The second weekend of the beer is also known as the weekend of Italian. 
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time. 
But this time, Elena accompanied him as a girlfriend, and therefore there is no such," he says.

Nights insomnia to shareholders of hypo real estate 
The German banking system is relatively stable, insisted the Federal Minister of Finance only a few weeks ago. 
What chance that the politician used the word `relativement 'and he slid down that the German banker would not be unaffected by the crisis. 
It is in effect this weekend. 
The financier of real estate Bavarian hypo real estate (hre), the German Dax, retains a consortium of banks a credit of one billion to protect the turbulence in the markets. 
A person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters on Monday that the aid is granted up to a total of 35 billion euros. 
The hypo real estate should now pay interest on the fraction to what she would have entitled. 
The money is private banks that banks of public law. 
In the background, it is the société-fille depfa that supports the losses. 
The crown was, according to a newspaper article, refinanced in the very short term for long-term projects for which it had borrowed money - which has not been possible since because of the distrust of markets. 
In the first half of 2008, the liquidity of the bank had been reduced from 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, the rate of capital also had a drop of 1.6 to 1.45 percent. 
Net profit and those from financial transactions were, compared with the same period the previous year, dropped to zero, profits from the attribution of claims and securities determined as well as the termination provisions in the credit operations had dropped by more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros. 
And it is only due to significant profits from reimbursement for accounting downstream from the restructuring of the former group depfa, as well as the repayment of interest in the book business tax and procurement procedures for konzern companies that the deficit gains of about 16 percent has proved to be moderate. 
After its privatisation in 1990, the former financier of state had first mal speculated on appropriations industrial estate, which then had been filialisés to the aareal Bank. 
Because the traditional state funding was not quite profitable, the depfa had more intensely in infrastructure projects and in the financing of projects in common between private investors and state (privat-public-partnership, PPP) and diverse internationally. 
On the value of the société-fille, the hypo real estate to proceed with the amortization which should be on the calculation of gains and losses of group a critical equipment that is still not entirely sure. 
The fact is that the dividends have been reduced. 
Already in 2007, they were truncated to two-thirds. 
The hypo real estate is, since the buyout of the depfa, an investor of state and highly important infrastructure. 
She is stronger than other institutes dependent on the refinancing on the market inter-bancaire because it does not have a deposit of clients. 
With the collapse of the investment bank lehman brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of funds between banks was again significantly cut off, banks with their liquidity. 
The hypo real estate needs annually for a party - about 50 billion euros - of the depfa credits of a short-term refinancing. 
According to a press release issued by the hypo real estate, the need for funding the group is covered with the long-term credit and the number of the influence of international financial markets largely out of running now. 
Other sources say that the refinancing would be provided with funds until the end of 2009. 
The chairman of the executive committee of HR Georg Funke explained, however, that the group hypo real estate should not need to financial markets in the medium term. 
The Federal Reserve and the federal institution for the supervision of financial services (bafin) assumes that the ability of the group hypo real on the market is now assured. 
Shareholders and creditors of the bank no longer have to hope. 
However, in light of the dynamics and the impondérabilité of the crisis, there is no certainty. 
This is not unthinkable that it should not use the funding in their entirety. 
But the opposite can not be ruled out. 
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest news releases, yet the doors of insolvency Sunday in the late evening, this rescue for the least interim will fail to reassure people's minds. 
The share price collapsed of 75 percent to euros. 
The bond prices, however, have been particularly well. 
While the debts in the first head have barely budged, loans to decline. 
Most affected are especially investment funds to the former société-fille Württemberg hypo and those of course that have a life beyond 2009. 
The obligations of the bank hypo real estate appeared to be a placement of speculation alternative, now their value should be regarded as dependent on the stability of the system international banker after the hardening net of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute even that brought the crisis in the establishment by the purchase of the depfa Bank. 
As long as the mints, governments and commercial banks less affected are still ready to support the system, we can assume a level of arrears in the time. 
Or will that no hope in this time - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months. 
But face to renouvellés noise of a partial nationalisation, the probability that approached security has now become a simple hope founded. 
This should reserve nights insomnia before any long-term creditors on the decision of whether they should secede from their commitments. 
Short-term investors may still use what they have learned a trait to build a report losses for the next few years on the income of capital gains tax stock automatically taken. 
Sylvana and the secrets of the box to bento 
When sylvana spear, 16 years, must be present for the first day of the highschool of tachibana, girls begin to pouffer laughing: Germany is so "kawaii"! 
What did it mean? 
Sylvana know already that word through the mangas - in his new log of trade, it speaks of Japan. 
"The first day of Japan. 
That is I was excited. 
Already the road to go to school me scared. 
I live in the outskirts of Tokyo in direction of kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes until the highschool tachibana. 
I find the road alone, fortunately I am not lost. 
The early course does not appear to be fixed so strict that home in Lower Saxony. 
Students are the one after the other from eight hours, until, at 9: 00 a.m. least twenty, a tour de table begins with the teacher, the "home room". 
But before the course begins, it was up to me to introduce myself. 
I am not at all the kind of like talking to people, particularly before a class of 40 students. 
As I had not yet the uniform of the school, I put an old skirt of my mother's home, as well as a shirt, socks rising blue and black leather shoes. 
In this place so I went to the desk, and I have tried to make correctly: ` sayonara wo she sylvana... '- I called sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week. 
At that time, I was very pleased to have started to learn the language there are two years. 
All 31 girls in the classroom made the masses basses, pouffé to laugh and signs, and I always heard the word "kawaii". 
I knew through my mangas. 
It is the vocabulary essential to the survival of Japanese youth and means "mignon, chou". 
Then I quickly made to my place. 
The girl next to me was a big smile ironic, she felt it was an Honor that the corresponding to sit beside her. 
The rest of the time was fairly calm, but when the bell rang, I was under assault in the rules. 
Everybody was talking to a better, pouffait laughing and I asked a lot of questions - in this case, it is quite difficult to understand the Japanese English. 
During the break, they all left their bento. 
My mother home had also made this kind of lunchbox - it is really something else that Les Misérables snack Germans. 
I had rice aromatic herbs, small sausages, a cucumber salad and algae, fruit and a kind of meat surrounded by tofu. 
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat here in Japan. 
Things have a bizarre appearance and taste completely new. 
What is certain is that everything is really good. 
Good, except perhaps the plums salted groups, brrrr! 
The bentos are not only breakfasts in Japanese schools. 
Sometimes a daughter to a boy a bento that she has prepared herself, and that is then prepared particularly carefully - in the hope to be able to do a little better knowledge of the boy during the break. 
I read it in my mangas. 
I am curious to know if I could watch here too. 
"Why Japan in particular?" asked me my friends when I told that I wanted to spend a year at the school in Tokyo. 
I then responded: 
"because it fascinates me," 
In the end, read mangas, this is what I prefer already for years. 
And in order to better understand the mangas and culture found there, at one point, I also began to learn Japanese. 
For me, it was clear that I had to travel a day. 
Because I also have a low for the traditions, the US and customs. 
And here, it gives them a lot of importance. 
On one side, Japan is the country of technology and the latest trends - on the other side, there is severe, disciplined and traditional. 
And as everything is so well organized, I never felt lost here, even if Tokyo is the largest city that I have ever seen." 
The rats also have sensations 
A rat or% fled before the danger, does this mean that he also fear? 
The neurophysicien Joseph ledoux is convinced: many animals have also sensations. 
But how could ensure that it has the same thing when he behaves in the same way that we? 
In the online magazine edge", contributions are published for several years by famous scientists. 
Spiegel online in a series of articles answers to the question "What do you think be true, but can have the evidence?" 
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else has until now been able to prove we can not prove that human beings have a conscience. 
But in this case, we can at least hoped that all human brains have the same configuration. 
As soon as we look to other species, and that discussed the issues of experienced or in general of consciousness, we're entering the land unworkable because the hardware is not. 
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing that many other animals: it is the death, fled or attack. 
Humans behave the same way, this is why some scientists feel subjective experiences comparable. 
However, I do not believe it. 
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make the implementation of our lives subjective difficult to the animals. 
One of the aspects is that the circuits almost always to human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of his participation in short-term memory and in senior management and delivery). 
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and appears to be entirely absent in others. 
Least therefore for these 6.5 of our conscience who rely on the prefrontal cortex, including the conscience of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human differentiates even other primates. 
Another feature significant language may reside in the nature of the man: a large part of its existence is linked to the language, it often means that his conscience depends on it. 
In this case, it could exclude the animals. 
But even if the conscience should not depend on the language, it surely would make, so that the conscience, regardless of how it is produced, is differentiates probably a lot of most of our states of consciousness. 
This is why it is difficult to determine what may seem like the conscience in other animals. 
SI cela, internal and subjective, was either measure or because of this particular hardware, based on our own experience, then his observation we pose big problems. 
Most of my developments refer to the content of the experienced aware, but there is beside another aspect of the conscience that should be more easily accessible. 
You could look at the process of animals irrespective of their content, and that is exactly what happened in studies on short-term memory of primates, particularly with the example of the display. 
But in this approach that followed christof Koch and Francis crick, it focuses more on the correlations nerve of consciousness that on the causal mechanisms: the two can be identical or not. 
Curiously, this approach also highlights the weight of the prefrontal cortex in the implementation of the display. 
But what an impact for the emotions? 
I find that a system emotions such as fear is activated in a conscious of his own brain activity. 
What we refer to as "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the defence system located in the brain (or its aftermath, as the reactions of the body) accounts for the Ram. 
Observed, emotions are closely related to areas of the cortex that characterize the primates and particularly the man. 
Of subtle degrees of experienced, associated with our nature talkative, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, different and categorize the states to be charged to other that we even. 
In contrast, Antonio damasio for example think the sensations from primitive activities are born in the body sensation of the cortex and the brainstem, as Jaak pankseep who focuses more on the brainstem. 
As this network has not significantly altered during human evolution, it could quite been cross-sectional sensations in any genre. 
From a purely theoretical point of view, I can not him, but I think this indémontrable. 
Pankseep argue the fact that this figure as fear among men and among the rats is likely also felt as such in the two cases: how could yet see if rats and men feel the same thing when they behave in a similar way? 
UN% fled before the danger, but if he feels fear? 
Similar to my eyes, attitudes are not enough to prove experienced identical. 
Certainly, the comparison nervous aide: rats and men have similar brain stems, the cockroaches are not even a brain. 
But is the brainstem is at the root of sensations? 
And even if we could prove this to the man: how could the show in rats? 
I think the rats and other mammals, perhaps even the cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations. 
But I would not know how the show. 
And because their sensations differentiate likely completely here (as human consciousness is based on special circuits and on the language), I prefer to explore the emotional behaviour that the sensations emotional rats. 
In all cases, progress poignent on the plan nervous in the extent on gauge the same thing in rats and humans. 
As I explore not the language and the conscience in rats, or the sensations, I don ’ t know they exist. 
On may find this as in the short term, but I prefer progress rather than knock against a wall. 
I am a émotionel pragmatic. 
Platini, President of UEFA: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine 
The Deputy Prime Minister iwan wasjunik explained that the preparations would soon be placed under the responsibility of the President and the prime minister.

From April to June, ticket prices in economy class have fallen by an average of 12.5 percent compared with the previous quarter, in business class and first class, however, the price variations were far less pronounced. 
In Germany, prices have been falling even more important than in other European countries. 
From January to March, prices had increased by 11.9 percent in the second quarter, they fell 23.6 percent. 
Domestic flights Germans have been divided by two according to the study. 
The reasons for this fall in prices would be a side declining economic growth, says the firm.

Hsv bat gladbach 1: 0 
With a goal and simple methods, the SV Hamburg becomes first classification. 
In the Borussia, luhukay has still not managed to find a eleven functional. 
De kristoffer Klein. Expand. Crash landing for international player Marko Marin. 
The player of gladbach returned late in the game and his TIR lifted failed on the part of the goal. 
His message was specifically formulated, he was out of his lips persuasively. 
It was simply that he was right. 
"We need this second goal", siffla Hermann rieger in the locker rooms of the arena of Hamburg. 
It was not much in the locker rooms, half was finished and most sat back in their place. 
Rieger has been for almost three decades the physiotherapist of hsv, he enjoys a reputation as many former players. 
And that is why its application was received at strategic places. 
The coach assistant cornelius jol has acquiesé and lifted the thumb to approve. 
Cornelius is the brother of the chief coach of Hamburg Martin jol. 
Dont seem to have been similar orders: and that it blows with the second goal! 
The implementation has failed. 
"It was not very nice to see today," confessed later Marcel jansen. 
Bastian Reinhard would "wanted to be more relaxed". 
The 1: 0 (1: 0 at half-time), the team of Hamburg to a successful strike of the head by mladen Petric (in the 11th minute); and the fact that the very small players in gladbach could not do harm to small players in Hamburg. 
"It has been a sale victory", was Marin jol. 
The SV Hamburg on Monday celebrate its 121 years. 
Already Saturday afternoon, the supporters celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the classification provisional tables on the giant screen that showed their club as first class. 
Ca will be an anniversary without real celebration. 
"We know take back", said marcell jansen. 
There is doubt that the result through the table reflects the unpredictability of the first league that the domination of its hsv. 
With his team arrived late committed - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as jansen débauché of FC Bayern - is certainly softly, but it is not yet. 
"We need more of charm and more dribbles," required jol.

Of the dark matter influence the flight space probes 
For years, a mysterious phenomenon leaves researchers in the concern: the dark matter influence the speed of space probes for what it called the support gravity. 
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not entirely correct. 
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" flies in space. 
Because of fuel conductions soon jellies, death cryogenic fluid the threat. 
For years, a mysterious phenomenon is cause distress among researchers - the anomaly of support gravity. 
Support of gravity is a manoeuvre space probes, by which they receive additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, the earth by example. 
Thus, the probes can save a lot of fuel. 
The probe research américo-européenne cassini-huygens used this trick physique, as the solar probe Ulysses. 
This is what surprised researchers for years: flying objects do not always behave to 100 per cent of the way on the attend according to the venerable laws of gravity. 
Well, irregularities in the rate. 
The probes are unexpectedly faster or slower. 
Until now, the physicists could not explain this effect. 
They baptisèrent the anomaly of support gravity. 
Some experts feared that the Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the pull of the matter as a result of the curvature of the space, may not be entirely correct. 
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in princeton still believes hard as iron that Einstein is not wrong and tries to explain the anomaly of support gravitational using what are called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe. 
"the dark matter could be responsible for this disorder, which is also close to the earth," he wrote. 
Researchers from space are aware of the existence of dark matter only for about 10 years. 
It is apparently it a magnet and the effect is found on other celestial bodies. 
It, by contrast, is completely invisible, i.e. it sends nor reflects no electromagnetic radiation, particularly visible light. 
According to the scientists, the dark matter would represent a good fifth of the mass of the universe.

The 19 participants of the excursion in the desert should already be en route to Cairo. 
The circumstances around a shooting before the release of the hostages remained unclear: as well, the kidnappers would have been close to put an end to the abduction, one Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army kills six kidnappers without warning. 
"The problem was resolved. 
They agreed with a ransom", said the officer. 
He left only to collect the hostages", when suddenly, "This surprise" occurred. 
Sudanese soldiers had shot dead on Sunday six of the captors in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and had arrested two of them.

The government has provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million savers in bradford &amp; bingleys. 
The value of the loan will be paid by all companies that collect money from savers, including 59 building societies. 
The director general of building societies Association (bsa), Adrian coles said that it was "irritating" to know that the companies and their members will have to pay the piped. 
The loan of £14 billion will be refunded when the mortgage of bradford &amp; bingleys will be identified. 
But at the same time the interests that will increase, will be charged, each year, to 700 financial companies collect deposits. 
The financial services compensation scheme has confirmed to the BBC, that the 59 building societies are included in this list. 
It is irritating to see that the institutions that had a prudent behaviour … must now pay some of the bills of institutions that were much less conservative. 
Adrian coles, bsa 
On proclaims that each company must pay a sum proportional to the deposits it holds, and that the intermediary companies must pay about 18% of the cost. 
The Treasury believes that the interests of the loan will be in 2009, to £450millions. 
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to resolve the interests of the first year. 
Adrian coles, director general of the Committee of the building societies, told the BBC that this decision was unfair. 
It is" irritant" to see that the institutions which have been prudent behaviour during the recovery of the real estate market, must now pay for institutions much less cautious. 
According to the bsa, no society has failed since 1945, the date of the first record. 
"We need to look at all aspects of this matter during the next few weeks, to assess the options to avoid that building societies and their members pay this invoice salt," said Mr Cole. 
Interest for 2009 cover seven months, in late September of this year until the end of March. 
In 2010, it will pay the interests of the whole year, that could double.

BSkyB lost the legal battle of itv 
BSkyB has lost his trial following the verdict of the Competition Commission, which would require him to reduce his participation in its transmitter rival itv. 
The competition appeal tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its parts of itv from 17.9% to less than 7.5%. 
The Commission said that, in the past, the participation of mskyb had prevented the competition and allowed him to influence itv unfairly. 
BSkyB bought its share in 2006 following an agreement to prevent NTL, now known as Virgin Media, bought itv.

New investigation in the case of US prosecutors. 
American general counsel appointed a special accuser to verify the dismissal of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006. 
It is born of the case by the inspector general of the Department of Justice, which criticized the actions of some officers. 
The report was critical of officers of the White House, legislators and the former attorney general, Alberto Gonzales. 
The survey is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political causes. 
The accuser special, Nora dannehy investigate now to know if officers interviewed in the investigation, have lied to investigators, stopping and justice. 
"serious accusations of potentially criminal conduct, unfounded, have not been fully confirmed or resolved", said the inspector general, Glenn fine, in its report. 
The appointment of a special accuser able to compel witnesses to file, was one of his greatest recommendations. 
The dispute began with the radiation in December 2006 to nine US prosecutors made by the U.S. Department of Justice. 
At the time, the department had said that prosecutors were dismissed for cause of poor benefits. 
But it emerged then, that prosecutors dismissed were not more criticism than other colleagues, prompting some observers to be assigned to the dismissal a political thing. 
Some of the attorneys have been accused of being close to Republicans in Congress, while others have refused to inquire about accusations of vote fraud against the Democrats. 
American prosecutors investigate and continue the courts for the government. 
It is certain that they can be dismissed at any time, but can not be for political reasons. 
The head of the Department of Justice, the Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was accused of being involved in this case of dismissal, and in the end, he resigned. 
A number of officials of the Department of Justice have also given their resignation. 
The inspector general's report was very critical of the role of Mr. Gonzales in this case, declaring that it considered" lead" of these redundancies, and eventually" surrender" its role as a leader," another remarkably to not involved in the case. 
Other corporate officers, including the former collaborator of Bush, Karl rove, have been critical for not able to cooperate in the investigation.

A dark side street in the town, often forgotten, and may be for sale. 
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other alternative routes, some famous, others only functional. 
. And even some taxis veterans as well as local residents of long date are giving directions to extra place, because they have ever heard. 
La Rue is found in the East Village and travelled to the north of first street- not to be confused with second street- between bowery and Second Avenue. 
About 30 feet wide to 120 of long, it looks like a dusty rather than an artery. 
And some signs indicate the street. 
It is virtually impossible to find on a standard Atlas. 
This Street, however, has admirers. 
For example, there are avalon Bay, the builder of luxury buildings on First Street. 
It would repaver extra place, and create a smoother passage stores and shops, which is expected to open in the new buildings. 
Other fans including neighbours, said be charmed by the shortcuts simply because he remains one of the last and oldest streets in the block. 
But the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of the city, which manages the street, has no interest to keep it. 
This month, at a meeting of the committees of neighbourhood, representatives of city agency and avalon Bay drafted a proposal authorizing the builder real estate to buy the street. 
But the committee would prefer that the Street remains in the hands of the city, and asked for a new proposal to submit the next month," said Susan stetzer, the local manager of the committee No. 3. 
"It is that few spaces in the city, and we would like to see the city retains extra place," she said. 
"They might propose to rehabilitate and manage it, what avalon could be, but we want to maintain public." 
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to repaver the small street and install the seats, some would be used by a café in which the builder will concede space. 
The proposal by the potential acquisition was made public in the meeting of this month. 
Michele of milly, the voice of avalon Bay, said that while the company wants to exploit the street, it does not mean that she wants to be the owner. 
"The main avalon Bay is to repackage the aisle abandoned, and make it public," she said, noting that this was the city to suggest the sale". 
Seth donlin, a spokesperson for the preservation of real estate, confirmed that the city would serve the street in addition, that the agency was to develop the property rather than the management. 
Compared with its neighbour more colourful, bowery, extra place left a small footprint. 
Some believe that extra place is the name since 1802, when the legacy of the great farm many children of Philip minthorne was divided, leaving aside the small piece of land, which remained since abandoned. 
The entry posterior of cbgb, a monument punk rock closed in 2006, has opened to extra place; the street is certainly more famous for the photo coverage of the album of ramones" rocket to Russia" 
"It was beautiful," said Danny fields, the manager of the ramones, who took the photo in November 1976. 
It was full of scrap metal, old rags, barrels, posters, leaves and cordes." 
Some residents, including the bloggers who had already talked about the evolution of the East Village, objected to the idea of selling extra place, saying that this humble small property should remain in public. 
Others have proclaimed extra place as a true rareté- a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be finished in peace. 
Jeremiah Moss, who led a blog called jeremiah' s vanishing New York (subtitled "the book of challenges: a bitterly nostalgic look at a town in the process of extinction") tells the story of the city and extra place, published in 1952 in the new yorker. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "extra place is a small cul-de-sac close, dark day and night, and bounded through the doors of a rusting iron and lacquered, full of newspapers in the last week that flew along the eaves." 
A few exceptions, the street was always the same allure. 
A rat court agilement at the bottom of the lane, near a door that was once the cbgb, and who is now the seat of a high-end clothing store. 
The graffiti on the walls, a bottle of beer 22 ounces empty, is next to newspapers that have just been discarded. 
Some people think that rarely extra said place, and suggested its development. 
Mr field, for its part, said that some under felt the attractiveness of the street in its current state. 
"the best years of my life," he said, "took place in dark, wet and filthy". 
The bilingual debate: immersion in the English language 
In this part of the supervision of education, Bruce Fuller and lance T. izumi discuss the position of candidates about bilingual education. 
Lance T. izumi, a former member of studies in California, and former director of the department of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not as good as you think. Why the middle classes should be able to choose their school." 
Attracting the favours of Hispanic voters is a complicated business. 
The proposals of barack obama on education are an interesting example. 
The campaign of Mr. obama points out that "African American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students." it is true. 
To combat these differences, the education program of Mr. obama supports, in particular, among many other subjects, "transitional bilingual education" for those who learn English. 
However, the question for obama is whether his desire to achieve a bilingual education who defends the instruction in languages other than English class, is also its interest to eliminate the differences. 
Take for example, Sixth Street prep, an elementary school of the township of Los Angeles. 
This school students are Hispanic, and the vast majority of low income. 
More than a third of the students, many new arrivals, studying English. 
Among the students from grades, 100% passed the review of maths in 2008, expert. 
Similarly, almost 93% of students took the exam of anglais-de langues-d' arts 
This incredible success was achieved through another ingredient that advanced by Mr. obama. 
Sixth Street analyses of the practice, a constant assessment of the capabilities and that an exemplary attitude. 
In addition, and this is an example that Mr. obama might copy, said Linda mikels, principal of Sixth Street, the school has introduced the instruction of the English language" full immersion". 
The total immersion in English focused on the almost constant use of English in education. 
Ms mikels, contrary to the bilingual education, a strong "We had a huge success with a student who had just arrived in Mexico, 12 months after, if you're going without his class, you would have no chance of the identifier." 
"This March, she says, "that a market for us." 
Mr. obama should not take example of Sixth Street prep and the reply in other schools in majority of Hispanic students learning English. 
The excellent results by this school speak for them; but policies on education within his party (the National Association for the education have long argued bilingual education) and its huge support in favour of bilingual education, obscure the prognosis of Mr. obama. 
Although it is favorable to the fact immigrants learn English, Mr. obama has recently seen this question as insignificant, when he proclaimed that we all need to stop polémiquer on the wording of the legislation in English. 
"On the contrary, he said, "You have to ensure that your child speaks Spanish." 
If Mr. obama really wanted to eliminate differences, it should be regarded with attention, education models that work, rather than the reject or considered irrelevant. 
Chute net oil new concerns of the world economy 
Oil prices fell sharply Monday, because people fear that the rescue plan in favour of marches financiers, managed to restore life to the economy. 
The crude oil futures, fell by 7 per cent to $99.80 a barrel. The New York Mercantile Exchange, in sales this morning. 
Prices have fallen by more than $20 a barrel since last Monday. 
These past two weeks, markets of raw materials have been buffeted by the financial turmoil on Wall Street, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. 
After in July, an increase to $145.29 a barrel, prices have dropped up to almost $90 a barrel this month, before rebounding to new to the deep uncertainty in financial markets. 
On Monday, investors are worried despite the agreement on the rescue plan, the greatest of history, concluded this week end by the leaders of Congress. 
The news was tempered by the recent concerns that the crisis would be durative. 
In the latest episode of this financial disaster," citygroup will banking operations of the wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday. 
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalised the conglomerate European financial, fortis. 
Barclays Capital analysts said that negotiations frénétiques this week end, made with the agreement of rescue" do not seem to have been able to revive the market". 
While the economic situation is détériorasse, demand for raw materials, oil included, is expected to slow down. 
"The prospective global equity, interest rates and exchange markets, has become uncertain" wrote Deutsche Bank analysts in a letter to investors." 
"We believe that raw materials can not escape this contagion. 
"In this raw materials, our most pressing concern is that to understand how far the U.S. virus to diffuserait-il globally and in particular, China". 
The bank analysts have reduced their expectations for the next year, given the falls of consumption of oil due to the slowdown in economic growth, was forced to drop 20pour cent, forecast oil and gas prices for 2009. 
The day of the second time crucial to improving the record of the team. 
After spending during the past eight seasons, more time than anyone in uniform of jets Shaun Ellis, the defender thought he had seen it. 
It was the second time, when the jets converted a 0 to 0 in an explosion. 
"I have never seen anything like this," said Ellis. 
The second time began after the jets and the Arizona Cardinals have dirty played under obscures cloud. 
Then the quarter back brett favre has managed to make a passe to laveranues coles for a touchdown from 12 yards, a precursor to an afternoon during which their relationship made a leap forward. 
Favre found coles for two further touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, at 10 seconds of the half. 
"I am not out of my zone" favre said about all his passes to coles. 
"This is a mediocre player" 
"We will release extremely well, despite what people think." 
While favre and coles played the catch, the defence was the quarter back of cardinals, Kurt Warner. 
Darrelle revis, corner back, stopped firing lost and fit 32 yards up the touchdown. 
Eric Smith made another passe and was intercepted. 
Linebacker David bowens, left to escape the ball because of Warner. 
The last change, the loss of the ball bowens, could well be the most charming 
The Cardinals have taken control of the possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the jets recovered the ball, jay feely made a goal of 20 yards taking advantage of 34 to 0. 
It was the best that the jets could mark a time. 
"The jets coach, Eric mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said "the second or third time?" 
When she was told the two jets missed 21 points based in the third temps- mangini said: "I can tell you that I have more appreciated the second time that the third. 
". Many points have been marked in a short period of time." 
Gebrselassie rested, is his world record. 
Haile gebrselassie, Ethiopia, a new proved to be worthy of his title of best runner of the century, after beating his own world record at the Berlin marathon Sunday, becoming the first running 26.2 miles in less than 2heures and 4minutes. 
With a victory in 2: 03: 59 of course accommodation on the flat, gebrselassie was still 27 seconds his record of 2: 04: 26, played last year in Berlin. 
A 35 years, gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his wonderful career during which he won the World Championship or the world record for any distance, the 1600mètres marathon. 
Last month, gebrselassie had missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing, craignant- can be wasteful way for today - that air pollution is his asthma. 
Au contraire, he promised to run in Berlin. 
In almost parfaites- sunny weather conditions, 48 degrees at the start, 55 to the arrivée- gebrselassie won Sunday, now an average of a mile in 4 minutes 43 seconds 
Runners of piste as gebrselassie and Paul tergat, both Kenyans, converted to long-distance runners, have contributed to the record of marathon for more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2: 06: 05. 
After the victory of Sunday, gebrselassie said the reporteurs, have suffered from calf cramps two weeks before, and have missed training for a week. 
It is clear that the rest he has been brilliant, but not corroded. 
"I am so pleased," he told reporters. 
"It was perfect. 
I am presented last week, and today, I had doubts; but in the end, everything is gone for the better." 
He was reproché- especially in Kenya, the African rival is the ethiopie- too orchestrate its courses, avoiding the global stars of the marathon, in fact on the hare as if they were in a competition of piste, and considering more world records that the meaning of the competition. 
But this critique is not the size of gebrselassie capabilities as a runner. 
Sunday gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1: 02: 04. halfway. 
Two runners elite Kenyans, James kwambai and Charles kamathi, continued to defy gebrselassie after the head of file are missing. 
A slightly more than three miles of arrival, gebrselassie made his final runup to detach from kwambai, who finished second in 2: 05: 36, improving its best personal record of five minutes. 
Kamathis is came third in 2: 07: 48. 
In the course of women, Irina mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, has completed a remarkable year with the seventh time of 2: 19: 19. 
English Paula radcliffe holds the world record of 2: 15: 25. 
Last spring, mikitenko 36, surprised everyone with the London marathon in 2: 24: 14. 
She could participate in the Beijing Games due to a hypothetical low back pain, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, his personal record of almost five minutes. 
It ran in to a clever strategy, leaving the Group of Ethiopian runners and people take a nice advantage, the more then about 18miles ½ after. 
Askale tafa margasa of Ethiopia came second in 2: 21: 31, while Helena kiprop, Kenya, finished third in 2: 25: 01. 
In a city in part, the pride and the events of black life 
Hidden in the development of its immense Park, a few miles from the sunny, the brilliant and the giant Orlando, is a small quiet city where are the pride and the complications of the African-American experience. 
"eatonville, first city entirely black to integrate, home of childhood zora neale hurston, this description she fit in 1935, is no longer so simple to make our days." the city in five lakes, three short of croquet, 300 dark skins, 300 swimmers, full of guavas, two schools and not in prison". 
It is now a city of pilgrimage 
Alice Walker, toni morrison and Ruby Dee came to zora festival, which is held each year to two, to pay tribute to hurston, the most famous of the Harlem Renaissance. 
And in a variety of ways, the city that it décrit- became tourism thanks to its inclusion in the tourist guide of the Florida published by the depression- era federal writers' project- remains a place to share. 
It is as independent, private worthy, and that it was already in the 1930s, when hurston said that the rural black population of Florida was often reluctant to share his true thoughts with the white man," we know so little, does not know what he loses". 
Even if it is the year of the election of a black president, Senator barack obama, who has relied on an open dialogue on the theme of the race, many here remain cautious du regard abroad. 
"We are very cautious about how to tell the story," said hortense Jones, 59, a resident and the oldest paroissienne de la ville. 
"It must be consistent with the reality. 
Two has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting. 
It represents both a model history of a black empowerment and a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average. 
It is a central point but also an example of culture rural Black sudiste- some time given short shrift, other times acclamée- reminiscent of the birth of American slavery. 
This explains why residents are both proud and protective. 
Interest in the image of two born with zora, that everyone here calls hurston. 
It was his hometown in world through books sincere, full of dialect, such as "mules and men" (1935) and "their eyes were watching God" (1937). 
Five paragraphs in the guide of the Florida transformed this city, located just the road 17, a route that runs through the centre of Florida, often forgotten, who leads in chapter of black history and the human drama. 
Bold such a big box in life as in literature, hurston led readers to store of the first mayor of two, Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parties. 
"The route on the left," she wrote, "you will find the modern public school brown and white, with its gardens and these areas of well-preserved game that Howard Miller has always taken care, although he can barely read and write. 
It also made mention of the new husband widow dash and wrote that Lee Glenn" sells drinks of all kinds and that everything that can be used to passage. 
So in barely a hundred words, hurston a two to an auto government but also to literacy, remarriage, and gender. 
Of course, fodor was not. 
This was not in fact a portrait that everyone appreciated. 
Zora a well described the reality" said ella dinkins, 90 years, one of the young girls to Johnson that hurston a immortalized, citing the songs without colour, performed by men who rented beauty." 
She added: "Some people did not like". 
On remembers of hurston as a person Vive and eccentric, which was frequently after his family had moved to jacksonville, fla. 
Augustus Franklin, 77 years, recalled that hurston was usually in town without warning, on a large chevrolet, a cigarette to the mouth and wearing pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional habits. 
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin told, while many made fun of it. 
"People were always glad to see zora" he said. 
But it also adds, swaying in his chair posterior of the patio overlooking Lake sabelia, where hurston was certainly called that "she was never too long". 
A la mort de hurston in 1960, she was poor and its books were. 
Two and the world seemed to have forgotten. 
Although she was once a star of literature, a contemporary of langston Hughes and the only black woman of Barnard College of 20 years, it was buried in a grave, to Fort pierce, fla, where she lived. 
A two, no major commemoration, or plaque for the general public. 
I do n't think they have understood the contribution or the legacy that she gave to the world," said Valerie boyd, author of "wrapped in rainbows", a biography of hurston published in 2003. 
A crucial moment came in the 1980s. 
Public officials from Orange County to get a highway to five lanes in the city, to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, main street on two lanes of the community. 
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 up to the west of the city. 
The proposal was made while two recovered just a difficult period in its history. 
A forced integration, among many other things, a relatively idyllic put an end to the isolation of the community. 
In the 1950s, the dispute on the mixture of races led hate the doors of the community. 
"At this time there, a band of young white came launch oranges or objects against people sitting on the side," said Mr. Franklin. 
"A woman is dead." 
They launched a watermelon in their car". 
In a letter from 1955 to the Orlando sentinel, hurston met at the request of the Supreme Court to a forced integration, outlining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education" insulting rather than glorifieuse of my race". 
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although in some aspects, a diluted the cohesion of two and a weakened the confidence of young people. 
"black children had the habit of embrassés- I remember being on time this morning, and at night too." said n.y. nathiri, daughter of ella dinkins and director chief of protecting the community of two, a group non profit. 
It lasted, journalist, until teachers and students came more from the same place. 
"You tiebacks not your Professor White because it is blanc- I want to say that there are here, a line of demarcation cultural" said Ms nathiri. 
Civil rights, moreover, have created space for many other zora neale hurston- black writers, actors and artists who went in addition to the damage, such that she, armed with a happy confidence and guidelines such as: "How can have fun of my company!" 
It is beyond me." 
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker went on the anonymous tomb of hurston and began to struggle to revive his reputation. 
Five years later, a biography hailed on hurston by Robert E. hemenway, a true best seller, the réintroduisit and the American guns. 
The highway project arrived just as the most famous daughter of two had regained her appeal. 
And this time, the old neighbours of hurston regard it as a sauveuse. 
The community began to organize a festival hurston to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences that would this highway. 
Hundreds of fans came to the opening of the festival two years after, and many returned in January, for the honour. 
After many years, the recount rejected the proposal of the highway. 
"the fiasco of the highway to five tracks, extremely rapid, a real civic pride" said Miss. Nathiri. 
Ms. boyd summed it up stating that "zora saved two". 
Victory against the project of the highway allowed him to change his own image. 
People non-resident, as rachelle munson, a lawyer in our church 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past. 
Two is classified historic town since 1998. 
A library mono theme (reputation of course hurston) opened in 2006, on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, repavé. 
Today, two remains an anomaly for the Florida: six miles of Orlando, it can at any moment be considered a back street later during a day of summer rain, small as she was when she was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s. 
(it now has 90 percent of blacks) 
Foreigners who come to discover the history of two, his rationale, are still treated with caution. 
It must seek permission for most of the interviews, and some choses- as the walls of the old church of two, painted by the white man, illustrating the black men in the champs- should not be photographed. 
Much to two, as Ms Jones, a teacher courageous and who has a low for the bright red, have always worried that their island community is well understood. 
However, the expansion of the festival hurston, a certain level of pride local emerged. 
Young people in particular, tend to consider two as hurston considered the race: beautiful, problematic and all, no better or no worse, but also proud, creative, bosseuse, crazy and mixed that other racial and ethnic groups in America. 
It is of the civic sincere affection that one hears in the voice of the nephew of Mr. Franklin, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to two after the college to work for local government or the police, who need additional forces. 
And even for younger people, as alondra and Alexia kenon of 11years, twins in Winter Park, appear to have learned the description two. 
"Most people, who spend in this area, think: ` Oh, this city is nothing compared to other" alondra kenon said after the mass on Sunday. 
But if you stop and take the time to look at the history, it is a beautiful city". 
Here in New York, all fluent finance. 
Still, nothing has changed. 
If tourists to Manhattan were removed from the booth and giant TV screens in Times Square, they do not realize that they are in the eye of the cyclone. 
They could not think that in the glass offices and honeycomb over their head, bankers and managers of hedge funds who monopolize New York, are the worst" day of work at the office" since the crack of 1929. 
The carriers continue to slip on the sidewalk, with their wagons and their trays of muffins for meetings matinières. 
The Latinos are always between apartment buildings, as mules, a 50 shirts luxurious hanged in a prepared on his shoulders. 
Office workers continue to lining up to buy their sandwich matinier to hawkers, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. on weekdays. 
I did n't feel the crisis despite the stories completely pessimistic until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account. 
Fortunately, I planned to work late afternoon, as I was finding my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, a 20 people in the queue. 
Not in front of the wickets of cashiers, or to withdraw from the case or make a payment, but before the customer service, where the regular clients had their chéquiers, tourists were the direction for the store macy, and the new clients opened accounts. 
Most of those before me, I apprendrais later by Starr, my personal "banker", were all the queue for the same reason. 
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their economies of smaller banks, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island. 
They withdrew their money from savings accounts referred to as thrifts (such as a building society), credit, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that do that in a state, and treat customers as their family. 
In the recent past, 15 of these banks have failed. 
These last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank in capital of $327 has used the trustee in bankruptcy, and while the New Yorkers were at home for the week end this Friday evening, another bank, wachovia, the savings accounts with a value of $440 million, was désespéramment a buyer for the save. 
The bureau and the store employees who are before me, afraid of another potential breakup, have transferred money to a bank that seems reliable, that is the most rescue on Wall Street. 
Of any New Yorkers have become very familiar to the world of finance in recent weeks. 
"I heard a woman in my local supermarket Chinese, speaking by telephone from lehman brothers, a bank that has failed, and his meagre chief Dick fuld, with the same familiarity that she could have had to criticize a colleague. 
And lyn, the concierge in uniform to my building, changed the subject of our normal conversation about brad and Angelina or deliveries of my merchant of fruits and vegetables. 
She told me, after my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in the money market funds. 
"I have changed, I do n't want to take a risk". 
Muslim graves desecrated while Austria is to the right. 
Heinz-christian strache, who gave up the right wing of the party Austrian Freedom Party and, Filip dewinter of the right Belgian Vlaams Belang, take part in an event to present the organisation" cities against the Islamization" to Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008. 
They are signs of mosques struck in red. 
Police accuse the right-wing extremists to have desecrated a Muslim cemetery Austrian, the week end of the victory of right-wing political parties in the general election. 
More than 90 tombs have been severely damaged in traun cemetery, near Linz, between the night of Friday and this morning; it is according to the police, of action organised. 
Offenders painted on several tombs, Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; the detectives believe, however, that this could have been done to disguise the feeling of hatred for extremists to Muslim immigrants. 
This accident could be in some kind linked to the election. 
A spokesperson for the local community Islamic said he "deeply shocked" to the announcement of this desecration, which occurs just religious during the month of Ramadan which is nearing its end. 
Austria seriously thinking about his courage, following his oscillation to the right during the parliamentary elections. 
The two right-wing parties that have gone almost 30 per cent of votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the future of Austria, led a campaign anti immigration. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to critics, as xenophobic. 
Heinz-christian strache, the leader of the Freedom Party that has gained more than 18 percent of votes, led his campaign against the wearing of headscarves and burkas, and has even expressed his opposition to the food alaha. 
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a brotherhood to avoid the rise of Islam. 
The two parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they would constitute a political symbol of the Islamisation of Austria and Europe. 
Surveys and analyses conducted just after the elections, have defined the extreme right as the most political bloc of countries, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because concerned about their future in the European Union.

"I photograph the Maître out of the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - photographer 
NI heels, or clothing of Jim flaherty breaking. 
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, from all tensions to obtain the relaxed aspect of the man or woman. 
On the one hand the artist. 
For another, the person. 
Inseparable except in the privacy, in these moments unknown to the general public, where close to actions and regards stolen artists who do not perform on stage. 
The German Günther Bauer mixture in "flamenco - people" the theatricality of some staged with singers, dancers and guitarists with this side less known artists. 
In this particular project, the photographer takes up the iconography of flamenco from different angles. 
Included in the Flemish programming of photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of the flamenco, more each day," says the creator, which clarifies that "flamenco - people" "may be anyone but, after seeing photos, the observer realizes that the images are not typical of performing artists. 
These people photographed "on the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage of the passion, sadness, Joy... in challenging the public. 
To capture moments of personality of these artists he should not make photos on stage. 
They have a personality and character. 
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera des moments of personality of the stars of flamenco." 
With the "popular song of mines," Bauer began in 1997 a long trip to photograph the singers, guitarists or dancers with a camera to plate. 
They are portraits that, thanks to the choice of the camera and equipment, given classic photography. 
The implementation of various means stylistic broke with the side of the image, giving a hint of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco Bauer: "a music with changing very traditional roots and surprise every day". 
It is not dance or the song itself, but the personality and character of the artist that captive the public with his art. 
The essential and magic was the constant of this work that it presents these days at the El fotómata. 
The flamenco acts as Diego El cigala, chano lobato, Cristina hoyos, Enrique morente, El lebrijano, Antonio canales, Vicente amigo, among others, are part of the selection from about 70 artists photographed. 
The project was transformed into an anthology of flamenco, soon to be published in a book collection of portraits exposed to the gallery. 
The passion for the portraits of Bauer led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "portraits of old sport" ("sportartproject"). 
Although the concepts are different in "flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves photograph the portrait of people, and be able to enter their lives for a moment more or less long. 
I think that in the photograph the portrait is the more difficult. 
You ’ re in front of people, characters that sometimes you don ’ t know or that you leave only a few minutes to make a photo. 
In these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try that my ideas become reality. 
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco called "flamenco - people", is on display at the gallery El fotómata, located at number 20 of the Rue de la mata (rue parallel to the parkland of Hercules) which will be open until 16 October.

The novelist hispano-américain acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and whether the books change life. "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "a effects" and "makes people less like", as it has asked the writers "not to go to the fanciful" and take their vocation.

Llamazares asked the Andalusian Federation of the United left to assume its responsibilities in the case Silva 
The general coordinator and member of the United Left, gaspar llamazares, said today that it is the regional Federation to make a decision on the case of the former adviser of Youth and Sports in the municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of preferential treatment to members of his family. 
"in these instances, I am very federalist, and this will be the Andalusian organization which will assume its responsibilities," said llamazares in regard to the behaviour of the political party that it must take within the municipal council of Seville. 
However, the leader of the United Left requested that the investigations show "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could commit: "The United Left has always defended such cases so that they have the highest degree of transparency".

"sangre de Mayo", the Pari dared to garci 
Based on the stories of Benito Pérez galdós, José Luis garci récrée the famous battle of Spanish against the French in" sangre de Mayo ’, which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with nearly 15 million euros of budget. 
Filmmaker tried "to stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of famous novelist, he said today during the presentation of the film, with quim Gutiérrez and Paula echevarría à la tête de la long list of actors. 
The film of a period of more than two and a half hours," sangre de Mayo" will be his release in cinemas on Friday, which later became a TV series for telemadrid of more than four hours. 
Great admirer of galdós literature, José Luis garci assure for having done with this shooting "a dream of child" through esperanza Aguirre, who instructed, three years ago, working on a film memorial for the two hundred years of May 2, Madrid, something that he has always accepted when the story is up to national historical facts. 
The EUR 15 million provided by the commune de Madrid are to garci a "unique opportunity" to reproduce with props and clothing appropriate the atmosphere of "a Spain which is wrong to head for the combat, because the struggle for independence led the people of rebellions in the reign of Ferdinand VII," he said. 
But the filmmaker regrets not having obtained as funding for the films" captain alatriste" or the ghosts of Goya" - more than double that for" sangre de Mayo" - because he was unable to turn a few scripted scenes in a script signed by horacio valcárcel, with whom he has worked for most of his career. 
Filmmaker" volver a empezar" has influenced in his usual work, on the mise en scène actors, with whom he had the habit of repeating before the shooting and that it does not casting, since it seems "humiliating" and believes that "the role of the filmmaker is to go on stage and in film to be informer". 
Many actors in "sangre de Mayo" repeat in front of the camera, as Miguel rellán, Carlos artesanías or Fernando guillén cuervo. 
Four times the Oscar candidate (he won one), garci considers that the three films candidates who represent Spain this year at the Academy of Hollywood," sangre de Mayo," seven billiard tables English" and finally the winner," the giant blind", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "which may be better known," he said. 
With this film garci does not expect a price. 
"At the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realise that you are working for prosperity, and now you pleased to make a film in addition," explains garci after more than 30 years of professional career. 
Isabelle bayón se met in the skin of the dancer sévillane tórtola Valencia 
A dancer sévillane will pay tribute to a dancer also sévillane. 
Carmen tórtola Valencia, daughter of a father Catalan (florenç tórtola Ferrer) and a mother Andalusian (georgina Valencia valenzuela), was born in the Roman and that at the age of three years will go live in London with his family. 
It was a dancer and dance specialist Eastern dances. 
It was an exciting life, a pioneer of the release of the woman, as isadora Duncan, Virginia woolf and Sarah bernhardt. 
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and pleaded for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women. 
The life of the woman who marked the history of dance in Europe between the world wars, was fascinated by Isabelle bayón. 
"I wanted to work with pepa gamboa and this last offered to interpret the dancer sévillane tórtola Valencia and it seemed incredible". 
According to the dancer, "We are not trying to tell his life but to translate his way of thinking. 
The titles of his dances made me think of flamenco. 
And, "butterfly dance" made me think of a Cuban popular dance and "Dance of the serpent" to some tangos. 
Her dance was all senses and they told me that my way of dancing was identical to hers," she says. 
La mise en scène was made through two notable contributions: Miguel poveda to sing again isabela in one of his performances, as he had done in "La Puerta open"; and the Professor matilde coral, which has exceptionally well to collaborate with that was his student. 
"matilde transforms tórtola into a character mature. 
I am happy because it has agreed to play a role in my work and I'm honoured". 
La mise en scène has also made through the music and the guitars De Jesús Torres y Paco arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, El pulga y morón; and on percussion of El pájaro, as well as the Rafa El Viola and collaboration of a player, juanfra Juárez, who plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were considered divas". 
This work is also, in a way, the life of the woman who was exhibited in places if distant, especially for the time, like India, the United States, or in Russia, but also throughout Europe, because it was usually in London. 
"I want to remember because I think they are these women who have a huge influence in their time and now no one knows and develop his work," says bayón. 
The performance will begin at 8: 30 p.m at the théâtre lope de Vega 
The publication of "Diary of a poet recently married," concludes the triennat 
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of "Diary of a poet recently married" in the St Stephen's Church in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez was married with zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "triennat zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2008), held to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the concession of the Nobel Prize for literature and their death. 
In this way, the "triennat zenobia and Juan Ramón" came to an end with the reprint of this work, with the international conference that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and the exhibit "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aspen light" that has been opened in May 2004 and who, after having travelled in different provinces andalouses, will go to New York at the International Congress. 
In the same way, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia bought Eight hundred copies of "Diary of a poet recently married", edited by Pedro tabernero and illustrated by jacobo pérez-enciso, to continue the work of one of the most well-known Andalusia poets. 
America or less without Paul Newman 
"Sometimes God created the perfect 
Paul Newman was part". 
This phrase is of the actress Sally Field, who has worked with him on "absence of malice", and illustrates the despair of American cinema, and America, face to the idea that Newman is not of this world. 
He had a penalty to get an Oscar 
There was more since 2007. 
Everyone knew he was ill. 
It was a blow for everyone. 
"Sometimes what one is exceeds any expression, and I have lost a great friend", was crying Robert redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to its existence". 
No one was afraid to go ridicule or to exaggerate. 
One of the fathers of cinéma et de la Patrie died during a period of obscure, where terrorists and stock markets are afraid, from the American fell well below, in desperate for reasons of dignity. 
When times are so hard and no reason to live, he is the human beings that the admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis cernuda for like Paul Newman. 
He was to tout Le Monde an ideal of beauty and truth. 
It was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the champion of causes lost and defeated, as the foundation to fight drug created in honour of his elder brother who died following an overdose and the creation of its own brand of organic food. 
This was a victory for a country that had the penalty to stand against a food culture suicidal. 
This vague expansive admiration sweep Hollywood without paying attention to the nationalities or passports. 
The latest James Bond, Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him. 
Another English, the oscarisé Sam Mendes, said that work with Newman marked the peak of his career. 
The bad boy arrived in Australia, Russell crowe, would appoint Newman as his greatest inspiration. 
"We placed the bar high", George clooney, who is perhaps the only today trying to enter the screen as Paul Newman: being very honnêt and having a serious privacy and away from objectives. 
It is still not easy or possible in the jungle media today. 
But there are those who tries, and Paul Newman is an example. 
After a divorce, it was married fifty years to joanne Woodward, who was true even if he was n't short opportunities to not be. 
"But why should I eat a hamburger away from me, if I have a steak in my fridge? ", he used to fool around. 
In heaven, he attended with pride to the meeting of his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so usual in America. 
"among all major roles that he interpreted, there has never been so proud that the husband dedicated, the father love, the grandfather thoughtful and philanthropist", disent-il. 
Madrid in the race for the 2016 Olympic Games 
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid to organise the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, this could be achieved by 2016. 
But I wonder if we are ready. 
If we take the example of the course yesterday: we don ’ t! 
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst course to which I have never participated. 
If they had taken into account all the errors during the race, they would be the subject of a failing marks. 
But look at everything in detail and from the beginning. 
Errors began with the withdrawal of numbers, which requires you to go ahead. 
This is not bad, but if they do you move it would be better than they give you all (including the electronic chip for the courses). 
Well, 
They were you go only to take the burden (first mistake, move only for it) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was that the size 'for the maillot (second error, because I need a size XL) 
In the world we live? 
Est-ce-t-il due to the crisis that they decided to buy a small suits with less than fabric and at the same time cheaper? 
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened the day of the courses. 
Apart from the fact that he should go very early to remove the chip, the queue is 15 minutes and, in addition, let his backpack at the entrance. 
The waiting period lasted more than 35 minutes, it is incomprehensible as 11,000 people are expected to these courses. 
Because there was a long queue, competitions have started and we had not even left our backpack at the entrance, although once made, the withdrawal was worse. 
In addition, the rain has accompanied the expectation of more than 40 minutes during which took place rebellions and assaults of the hut. 
I think about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, don ’ t even figurerons in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip that they gave me that, I think, has not marked the start. 
Of course, if they were asking me to cite an example of perfect race, I could to the idea. 
And I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016.. 
Microsoft is a receptionist (virtual) 
A conference on emerging technologies du MIT Microsoft has been presented a new system of image and human interaction, a species of artificial intelligence with little intelligence but able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move on the campus of the company) in response to what he was asked during a conversation. 
Thanks to a camera and a system of forms and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in place, which they are - including remember what they are - and to listen to the key words of their conversations. 
But also be grouped according to groups of conversation 
In the video, the receptionist detects a third person but she understands that she is not part of the group that is talking with her and that she is not part of the company. 
She asked if it is here to visit someone and she told him that she will respond in a few minutes. 
All this without a blue. 
Impressive. 
But of course this is the future. 
Now the company has other things on which focus, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows. 
This week on a spoken in more than a change of strategy at Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer be associated programs. 
Steve ballmer has discovered that if the computers were sold with the indispensable instead of applications, they go five times faster. 
This is a discovery since Microsoft, after version, has not stopped adding functions and "extras" to windows. 
The change in strategy is welcome. 
Microsoft has reason, its operating system loses of importance but also its software. 
When Google chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that Google chrome is the first step of the part of Google to compete with windows. 
Several people have rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not a workable system. 
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the base indispensable for computer hardware and software to understand. 
He served the same function that your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your stepmother. 
This is true. 
He never disappear but we must see the "death" of operational system not as an absolute truth, but as a truth relative. 
This week, ballmer confirmed this idea. 
People are less and less attention to operational system but increasingly the Internet browser. 
On the computer on only to turn firefox, explorer or chrome and every day people spend more time surfing the Internet than to travel windows. 
A serving half the applications with the system? 
Qui peut Le plus is the least. 
And Windows 7 will contain fewer applications, much less than Vista. 
Less crowded, months less complex. 
For the moment, Microsoft is the launch of its own services online so that they become finally an alternative to Google. 
They desperately need this, in effect, and I showed you a example. 
The photo is in this article, was taken at the beginning of this month in one of the rooms reserved for employees of Microsoft in redmond. 
On the distributor of beverages, a poster asked to use their own search tool - "your research. Our future". 
In 2006, a study found that 66% of employees of Microsoft used Google to search for information on the Internet. 
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7. 
It will not come early in 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or 2010. 
Microsoft will surely launch at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7. 
The phone, after all, looks more like a computer. 
But the launch of android is late and the iphone is already on the market, it will be expensive. 
The fabulous! 
Pablo Picasso the endorsed on the Côte d ’ Azur, Leonardo di caprio was one in the "blood diamond" of Edward zwick, as well as Al pacino in ` the godfather 'de Francis Ford coppola and is part of the Association of gay muscular. 
And if we are to list all its appearances, it could also mention this, moustachu who was lifting weights in a traveling circus. 
This is not just a simple design of male cotton, grinding and sleeveless. 
The English call ` Tank 'but the fabulous Marcel in Brussels stands out among all the other. 
First, by his nom flamboyant - although it is known as "Marcel '- that has to do with the sport since he took the name, according to legend, the boxer Marcel cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith piaf. 
Le 'Marcel' is distinguished from other members of its cotton excellent, by its unisex coupe, by his distinctive logo and the little Belgian flag (barely recognisable) that the singlets best-known have in the neck. 
But attention, because the mark Belgian not only that the tank tops. 
But it also produces sweatshirt, boxers standards, the cardigans in Kashmir, pants cotton, babies, mini-shorts... 
The clothes designed for the comfort of underwear. 
Even if it is unfortunate to be just as underwear. 
They have too much charm. 
"I want to be a young mother; the candidate does not worry" 
Its huge similarity with her sister did not prevent him to develop his own personality. 
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality. 
Currently the sisters Cruz take very seriously the new activity in the way. 
According to Monica, they are not that girls beautiful and famous who lend their names. 
She was present at the promotion that the mark mango did in Paris to its new headquarters but as well as the presentation of the most important de la mode that Spanish am a patron of the House. 
Monica is warm and timid. 
Raconte-nous what you do in Paris. 
I came to introduce a new collection that my sister penélope and myself have created for mango for the new careers, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of "mango fashion awards' and dinner of opera in honour of Valentino. 
A day very intense but, at the same time, exciting, we attend. 
On what basis your new collection created to mango for the fourth season? 
The 1950s and 1960s we charms and we have much to our collections. 
I really love me drove around the city and observe women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I am often. 
Dancer, actress and designer, you are a very versatile: is it not? 
I think, yes, but in the end it is joined and these activities have many things in common. 
Since I was a small clothing were; I désirai go to my grandmother to watch in the cabinets of my aunt and to see its clothing. 
It was awesome, almost better than an amusement park. 
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my way of getting dressed. 
Dancers love of dressing for the course and the tests, to look in the mirror and feel good. 
And in the role of actress, when you endosses clothing it is at this point that you put real in the character. 
At the same time, everything is connected. 
You got there is no long 30 years: it has been hard for you? 
Not at all. 
I feel better than ever, my 30 years I look forward. 
I find that the woman is more mature, had more experience and enjoy life with fewer problems. 
The biological clock does not make me fear. 
I did all the things that I wanted to do since any small and that gave me a lot of happiness. 
Then, think you become mom? 
Of course, I want to be a mom because my body me the application and, moreover, I want to be a young mother; I do n't want to lose it. 
With regard to the candidate, I'm not concerned. 
What I will do is to give happiness to my son and raise it with a lot of love. 
To the cinema, you expect that the different films that you turned out last year. 
It is true, I look forward to exit. 
I am a woman issue of theatre, I am very eager and worried about, I would like to have now but of course this is not possible. 
I look forward that kind of films "espacio hora 'and ` in busca de la tumba de cristo'. 
See what you think. 
There are a few days you as started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, is n't it? 
Not are saying it! 
I am not mounted on the gateway to the mannequin. 
Simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I know it for quite a long time, for inviting me to participate in London to a charity for his association in favour of women and clothing that we exhibions - I exhibited both of our collection created for mango - were sold at auction to raise money for the NGOs Naomi. 
People that Naomi is a person to reach. 
They say much on it, I know it, a lot of things are not true. 
In addition, if the right side of Naomi fascinates me. 
She asked me to walk to a cause if noble, but if she had asked me to do the poirier, I would have done anyway. 
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world. 
Repeat offenders of drinking and driving will install the system ` alcolock ' 
The Interior Minister wants the driver who had more than three administrative sanctions for alcohol, to install in his vehicle a system that prevents to start the vehicle in intoxicated, or if it does not breath. 
The initiative has already been announced in June last and it now appears in the report by the Minister of state in which this initiative is considered to be a pilot project that will last for a year. 
Its purpose is the rehabilitation of the driver with road retraining courses. 
The Minister of State responsible for road safety but also the general direction of road safety and the Technological Institute Foundation for the security of the automobile will participate in this initiative. 
According to the statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for driving more than once in intoxicated, took the car. 
The alcolock would avoid it because it is a system connected on the vehicle to measure the rate of alcohol in the breath and start the vehicle if the driver has not before; or when the driver's alcohol level is higher than that. 
The cost is greater than 1,000 euros and is in charge of the driver. 
In this regard, a study carried out in the United States in 2007 showed that the vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65% of offences during the first year of installation. 
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people each year. 
This is in administrative penalties for two reasons: deal with these behaviour before they turn into criminal offences. 
And facilitate its implementation, as the legal reform can be made by ordinary but, however, the reform made by criminal requires a reform of the organic law. 
The device is not yet available on the market in any form trade, although some commercial vehicles and an already has a as experimental. 
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of deputies will vote on an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party who proposes to install in school buses this system as it was made in France. 
Mexico without ` peep-toes' 
A p.m., official time, the Spanish air force plane in which the princes of Asturias travelling landed in the airport hangar presidential Benito Juárez, Mexico. 
The sun was on the eve of bed but its rays required to bring in a visor to view the royal couple off the plane. 
At the bottom of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present. 
A few hours before I had asked in the street, the taxi driver, if he was aware that the Spanish Princes visited the city to complete their trip. 
- Ah, very well, you can not go to the airport to take clients at that time ci... are you from here and then …? 
- non, non, je suis Spanish but I lived here about two years. 
- Ah, very well. 
But the press Mexican knows very well that are the princes of Asturias and knows the importance of the trip. 
They are several to wait in the airport near the red carpet and a row military composed of 27 soldiers of marine. 
The Prince is smiling and dressed in navy blue, the Princess, when to it, a hair to vent, is dressed very and does not its ` peep-toes' normal; perhaps they had told her that a storm threatened. 
They are a brief interruption to photographers before entering the room where the procession official the attend. 
At the door of the hotel where they live, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a Mexican television journalist rigolo ahead. 
The most prestigious fashion 
There is certainly not place more appropriate in the world to introduce a mode that Paris and he probably does n't exist living more extraordinary and good for Valentino. 
Mango is to present the second edition of the botón-mango fashion awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new talents of fashion. 
The winner will be rewarded with a price of 300,000 euros. 
Yesterday sandrina fasoli, the Belgian sortie, winner of the first edition, watching his models in the window of mango at 54 Boulevard haussmann in Paris and she was crying almost emotion. 
Certainly it is the second largest store brand in Europe that has just been launched with 1.335 square metres of surface. 
The first boutique is in London. 
The events, as well as the desire to thank the fashion designer Valentino, President of the board of the competition, have done that we are found in a lavish dinner at the Paris Opera garnier. 
With a table nearby the extraordinary family chagals, the presidential table prepared by mango, seemed even more dramatic.

Speaking in dormant 
Some children speak during the night. 
I do not related to those who wake up very awakened in telling us something that happened the day before, but children who speak during their sleep. 
The first time that arrive this may surprise you, but in reality it did not matter. 
It is a mild sleep called somniloquie alteration. 
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents. 
It is clear that there is more than one who speaks during the night. 
This phenomenon may appear to be a very sporadic (once in life for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodic (all days, once a week, once per month...), the day after the child could not recall anything. 
There is not one that determines his appearance 
They are often linked to other changes in sleep as the nightmares, the night terrors, the énurésies night (a pee in bed) or the somnambulisme, but this is not always the case. 
As we have said before, they may also be associated with very high fevers, in situations of stress or overexcitement. 
Anyway, it is a phenomenon understudied. 
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable. 
He may speak with a small voice quiet, with isolated words," or by the Cree, crying, long speech... 
In the case where the somniloquie becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to see if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and to get an explanation for this problem. 
We have said that this is a mild, that is why there is no treatment, unless it is linked to another alteration of sleep that can be treated (for example, if it is linked to a sleep apnea or stress). 
What we can do is to take into account a number of simple preventative measures such as: 
Try not to excite the child before going to bed. 
Therefore for games and avoid programs or television series that are more or less violent. 
With children very nervous and have the sentence to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help calm down inside. 
This will allow the child to have a sleep more peaceful. 
As soon as the somniloquies appear try to stay calm. 
Remember that they are safe for the child and the next day he will be remembered more for what happened. 
Tips 
Do not wake up. 
It is unnecessary because it is unconscious and you réveilleriez. 
Even if he talks, he was sleeping and is based. 
Remind you that if he is very upset many times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or verify what causes so much anxiety in the child. 
If you understand what he said (which is not usual), do n't have the temptation to ask for information. 
You will not get anything, because while sleeping, it is not aware to organize his thoughts. 
De Plus, you hear what he said, but do not know what it is in the process of dream, be careful how you interpreting the information and the conclusions that you are doing. 
Never say to the child that you can question him during the night to determine its secrets. 
Not even in jest. 
This causes a lot of anxiety. 
In conclusion, don ’ t worry, this is nothing very bad, it is an episode that lasts only a few minutes. 
Finally, illhaeusern... 
Illhaeusern has finally found their way to victory on his land after a long period of food. 
Without a big game, the yellow and black were created the largest number of occasions and have managed to transform one for the gain of the match. 
The pace was not very strong during this meeting where the attackers had to speak of. 
After a first attempt of captain visitor Kauffmann who was the dormer on fire by far, illhaeusern would be slightly the ascendant and in turn fonderflick de loin, then with hirn above Roman, the end of the foot or even diebold came chatouiller defence of dannemarie. 
In face, was bloc in the middle of terrain and let the stirring riahi at the edge of the attack. 
The early second half would be crucial with two occasions signed riahi and temporal for dannemarie immediately after the opening of the score for the illhousiens by Marsh, well positioned to resume a ball rolled on a first attempt to diebold (53rd '). 
But the scorer illhousiens can not enjoy the best long and will be forced to return to the locker rooms a dozen minutes later and leave their teammates in outnumbered. 
But dannemarie will not take advantage and will not be big issues at 11 illhousien who has just fallen a bit for "compact" its defence, except in the last seconds of game where, after a large scrambling, the ball was very close to the cross.

Obama, winning points on the first televised duel 
In the first debate on Friday between the two candidates for the White House has passed another to know that, John McCain or barack obama, the won. 
Not surprisingly, the campaign headquarters Republican and Democratic proclaimed their own victory in this duel that would have been followed by a third of American families. 
The policy analyst David gergen believes that the delivery of John McCain, although honorable, has not been enough "brilliant" to enable it to halt its decline in the polls to five weeks of presidential. 
The institute Gallup, including a survey of opinion published Saturday gives obama a lead of five points (49% to 44% to McCain), finds that it is the Democrat who has managed. 
Among the undecided voters, who are, obama is winning for 39% of respondents, while 25% of them are victory to McCain, according to a CBS survey. 
Obama should be able to confirm its advance Thursday with the right expected delivery of its colistier, Joseph Biden, on the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah palin. 
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it. 
It is a good instincts", however, warned Bill Clinton this weekend. 
The septuagenarian McCain has repeatedly to highlight its clear experience in foreign policy, while stressing the "naive" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face. 
"Senator obama does not seem to understand that..." he accused on several occasions. 
"I do not believe that Senator obama has the experience and the knowledge to be President", he also assured. 
The angle of attack hammered Republican since yesterday in television advertisements. 
Obama has, said that he was the future. 
Without clear, it was concise and accurate. 
He emphasised his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world. 
"McCain has still not understood, while obama, if," replied, this weekend, a spot democratic faulted the Republican did not take the measure of the impact of the crisis on the U.S. De La Rue". 
"During the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing on you, denounced obama, yesterday, to 20,000 personnesrassemblées for a meeting in North Carolina in the pouring rain. 
He did not even uttered the words "middle class" or "workers"." the failed financial advantage clearly obama, which is regarded by the U.S. as the most likely to save the economy to the brink. 
"the coming week could be a turning point", was yesterday, the influential Democratic Senator Charles schumer. 
The Democratic representative rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, has compared the "good economic instincts" of obama to those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis in 1998. 
For the Democratic candidate, the current débacle "is the final verdict of eight years of poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain." 
Reaffirming that he would come to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite the ups and downs of Wall Street, the senator from Illinois also pointed out that the achievement of a possible energy independence of the country by promoting renewable energy was his first priority, with the implementation of a health insurance. 
McCain, however, sought to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030. 
Cautious, both candidates have avoided questions on the $700 billion financial rescue plan (470 billion euros) adopted last night by the Congress and extremely unpopular. 
A Minsk, "you have noticed that there was an election?" 
Young and opponents had Sunday night on the main square of the capital Belarusian advance to reject the results of parliamentary elections. 
A few hundred Belarus met Sunday evening from the closure of polling stations on the central place of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation. 
While no results had not yet been announced, many young came out against the power of the President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation". 
Some admit that they did not even vote: "what is good, because they will do what they want with my voice," said a young. 
They do not believe that the regime that did well to foreign observers in order to resume language with the European Union is ready to make a turn democratic. 
The sanctions, including a ban on visas for 40 leaders Belarus and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were seen as clean by observers. 
They have not been in the opposition. 
"We have been shut out of election commissions and our observers were not able to count the votes," said Yuri Potemkin, the spokesman for the Union of democratic forces, a diverse group of 12 parties. 
"This is a cosmetic change," says Alexander milinkievitch, former opposition candidate in the presidential elections of 2006 and leader of the movement led, because the important thing is that the voice, and for us, it is the executive power. 
If members of the opposition are in Parliament, it is that they have been appointed, not elected. 
But their entry into Parliament can mean space to television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals." 
The opposition is therefore to enter the political game because "it must start dialogue with the European Union. 
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, between in crisis, and that we do n't réformons, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia. 
We want to be independent." 
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process does not recognize the validity of the vote. 
She pointed out that the participation figures are too high, and that the widespread vote by anticipation (26% of voters in Minsk) opened the voice to all manipulations. 
"You have noticed that there was an election? asked the Social Democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the two remaining political prisoners released in August of this year. 
There was nobody in the polls. 
And there will be a maximum five members of the opposition in Parliament, those who are most appropriate for power." 
The Silence of the night falls on the place of October. 
A television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission welcomed to their success. 
The interview - blood returned to secure 
Office yesterday marked the 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. Francine décary, had reason to celebrate as blood has become one of the safest blood providers and efficient in the world. 
And most importantly, it won the trust of the public who had been seriously undermined by the scandal tainted blood in the 1980s and 1990s. 
As we know, national blood transfusion managed by the service of the Canadian Red Cross were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980s. 
Before this tragedy, and the public uproar, the government of Canada launched in February 1994 a public inquiry, chaired by the judge Horace krever, which was designed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations for that such a disaster would not happen again. 
While the krever was slow to file his report, some provinces have established a committee that aims to plan a new management system in Canada. 
In Quebec, the committee gélineau completed this mandate. 
As a result of the reports gélineau and krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: blood to serve the Quebec and the Canadian blood services to supply all other provinces and the two territories. 
"In 1998, when blood started its activities, just 38% of people still had confidence in the system of blood in Quebec, recalls Dr. décary. 
The situation was desperate. 
To force efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work on the field during the years that followed, we returned public confidence," she says proudly, prior to say that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the general population had now confidence in office. 
Dr. décary Garde head, however that "confidence is something extremely fragile". 
From its inception, on 28 September 1998, Hema applied the precautionary principle. 
At this time, it was in Europe to the outbreak many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says that held the Fort since its foundation in 1998. 
"and we didn ’ t know at all if the disease could be transmitted by blood. 
There was supported on one of the main recommendations reports krever and gélineau, that when you don ’ t know and that a serious illness may be, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, it represents exclusion. 
In April 1999, thus on refused the blood of people who have spent more than a month to the United Kingdom since 1980. 
Or, there are a few years, it has been proven beyond any doubt that the disease is spread through blood. 
This episode has shown that the precautionary principle that it applied made sense." 
In 1999 had appeared on the market a technique much more sensitive of HIV testing: the nucleic acid (tan) that detect directly in the blood donor the virus itself and not that of antibodies against the virus, underpinning the tests used until then. 
Tan led to shorten the period silent, which lies between the time the person has been infected and where the first virus can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist. 
It was able to reduce this period in less than a week. 
On has been reduced substantially the risk that some donors are infected without the knowledge and that they can not detect. 
These improvements to substantially reduce the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion. 
Today, one in 12 millions at risk of receiving blood contaminated with HIV. 
"In other words, this means that he will distribute 12 million blood products before someone being infected with HIV. 
As office distributes each year between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product. 
Today, I think we can feel comfortable to receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover the health", says the chief executive of blood. 
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products. 
You never know what will emerge in the system. 
No later than last year appeared on the island of La Réunion chikungunya virus which, like West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood. 
You have to be constantly vigilant," Dr. décary before pointing out that in addition to a safe, blood supply should also provide an adequate supply. 
"The needs are increasing because the population is aging. 
The cancer treatments being more aggressive, patients often need a recharge in red blood cells and platelets. 
The aging of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors who has an average of 3% of Quebec eligible for donation." 
Any person, aged 18 years and older meets the eligibility criteria can give blood all 56 days, or six times a year. 
On average, 14% of people who offer their blood are not accepted, because they are living with AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they travelled in a country where malaria occurs, they will be excluded for a period of one year. 
"with these 3%, we come to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals. 
The shortages are very rare. 
But it to renew the members of this network of donors as they age and can no longer give blood. 
It is difficult to convince people to give blood, but most of them and encourage them to become regular donor. 
The life of today is so rampant, rarely found the time to spend an hour to give blood", désole Francine décary. 
With an annual budget of $297 million dollars, office provides not only of blood products, but also of human tissue, which the bone graft, heart valves, disembodied eyes and skin that is almost exclusively used to burn. 
These are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in office that also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec. 
The umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste is a sang rich in stem cells that could be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia. 
"We celebrated, there are a few weeks, the banking of our thousandth cord blood sample and it will take more than a thousand per year. 
On should begin to propose for transplantation at the beginning of next year," says Dr. décary who described the collection of cord blood program as very popular. 
"Several mothers are disappointed to not be able to access", because office does not have the means to extend this complex and costly in every hospital in Quebec. 
Soccer - the impact in the semi-finals 
The impact of Montreal has qualified for the final round of the playoffs for the first division of the paragraph, thanks to a 3-1 win (4-3 in total goals) at the expense of the Seattle sounders, yesterday, in the second and decisive match of the series quarter-finals in total goals, the saputo stadium. 
The terrain Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of play. 
After a first half without purpose to one side or the other, the milieu of terrain David testo and Rocco plancentino marked the other training Montreal. 
Roger levesque was the only one to thwart matt Jordan for the sounders. 
Recall that in the first match of the series return, Friday, the impact had suffered a defeat of 2-1 in starfire complex in tukwila, a suburb of Seattle. 
The impact will be measured the Vancouver whitecaps in the semi-finals. 
Saturday night at Minnesota, the thunder overcame a 3-1 deficit in the return match to win 4-3, but the whitecaps were still acceded to the semi-final 5-4 in total goals. 
The impact should face the whitecaps Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today. 
In short, but killing Kovalev 
The trio a number of Canadian is ready to start the season. 
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev and tomas plekanec and Andrei kostitsyn has led the attack in a gain of 3-2 Canadian to fire barrage against the Florida panthers, yesterday evening, at the bell centre. 
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, marked a goal, plekanec raised two aides, and Kovalev won a happening in this gain, the fourth of preparatory team in six games. 
Kovalev gave the victory with the sole purpose of the shooting. 
"I am not ready, warned the Russian. 
I need another game to feel comfortable." 
"He tried to do too much in first period, noted Guy carbonneau. 
But I think he has appreciated the end of the game. 
It was a nice ovation." 
Charest placed on the North 
The Prime Minister does not trigger elections before the end of the year 
As soon as the general Council of the Liberal Party completed, Jean charest was made yesterday in jean-talon, in Quebec, where the new minister of health, Yves bolduc (left), is trying to be elected to the by-election today. 
"the limits of our last great northern border": This is the long-term ambition that Jean charest was presented with visual force while remaining in outline, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party, out, yesterday. 
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a kind of moulin to images. 
Revolved loop, on three huge screens, dramatic images of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by "Google maps", maps, etc. 
The main ways as election period. 
In point press, moreover, the prime minister refused to exclude that he would trigger the elections this fall, although he noted that her schedule was very busy. 
The North "plan" is the fourth pan to a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims for Quebec, that of a "new economic area", which includes an agreement on the labour with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with the ontario. 
Often mentioned in the prime minister's speech recently, the opening of the North - the Northern Territory at the 49th Parallel - had never made a submission. 
However, the prime minister is bound to explain why the North was "a jewel of vast potential", but has not given a date, amounts investment, or precise priority for future projects. 
At most a few avenues of what could be developed more: including hydropower, the forest, but especially the mining sector, spiked by growth in emerging countries and rebuilding public infrastructure. 
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds", according to the list of Mr. charest. 
This "territory twice grand as France", "it is home, it is in Quebec. 
Not only is it home, but it is in us", he insisted, as to show he was a national founding myth. 
Quebec has been constructed in its relationship with the North, he said: the gold rush in Quebec abitibi, engineering, James Bay. 
"It is up to us, it is our future", he added, after a dramatic pause to contemplate the immense map behind him. 
The North, 70% of Quebec, includes a portion of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, said the prime minister at the press conference. 
"It is a position that all governments have repeated. 
There is a line of border on which there is no agreement for a very long time and, when the opportunity presents itself, I repeated this position-là on behalf of the government," he said. 
The rest, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the Northwest Passage, which will open year round because of melting ice. 
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that the land is a must. 
And residents of territory, the first nations and Inuit? 
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec would be very attentive to their respect and that the project would benefit, particularly to young people. 
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre corbeil and Michel letourneau (former Member Parti of population), have already begun consultations with a 30 communities. 
An inter-ministerial Committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie boulet, transport and natural resources) has an important place a work in progress. 
The Prime Minister does not preclude a large meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment where "there will be a common vision". 
The northern development would be in line with the principles of sustainable development. 
The plan North will be "concerted, orderly and respectful of the environment," he promised. 
Jean charest described the "vision" as one of First Minister liberals who have preceded. 
"As the liberals who have gone before us, we thought otherwise to turn challenges into opportunities for growth and development." 
This has been a recurring theme in the weekend, which was initiated Friday by a grand cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean lesage at the head of the party. 
One of the resolutions adopted propose to rename the central beauport in adélard-godbout dam. 
"of Anderson, who created hydro-québec, to lesage who made the quiet revolution and the nationalisation of hydropower, bourassa who made the Bay James, our party has forged the future", said Jean charest. 
In point press, he cited another reference, Conservative one, the program "roads to the north" of John 4, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963. 
In addressing the hydro-electric dam project of eastmain1a-ruper, Mr. charest said that the service was scheduled for 2012. 
"It remains between us there, but I plan to be there", he told his militants, eliciting applause in them. 
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, has not ruled out the possibility of an election this fall, what the law allows. 
He points out that his schedule, however, is completed, including a mission of the Federation Council in China and a Quebec York summit. 
The General Council of the weekend has provided the Liberal leader a platform containing resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that are past as a letter to the position: the under claims in particular the recognition "specificity du québec" in the Constitution. 
It also wants Quebec appoints members of the Canadian radio-television and telecommunications and that they have a right to veto decisions taken in Quebec. 
The side of the opposition, on welcomed the broad outlines of the plan north with skepticism. 
The chef Parti, Pauline marois, a clear policy development of the region that the government landry was launched in 2001. 
She, the liberal government, when they came to power in 2003, has decided not to apply. 
If it did, "there would be more advanced today" commented Ms. marois alongside his candidate in jean-talon (which takes place today), Françoise mercury. 
The adq supported the adoption of a plan North by the government. 
"But what we would like is that this is not just a show," said the leader sebastien proulx, to replace Mario Dumont, who comes back from vacation today. 
Letters - a country disgraced 
It was Mr. vic toews, Minister of the "justice" (O irony) in the cabinet harper, who allowed last summer to say that Louise Arbour that she was a "disgrace" for Canada. 
Jeter and the stigma about this woman, who led a relentless fight for justice and deserves our admiration says as long on the entourage of Prime Minister Stephen harper himself. 
We are facing a government that is the only, among all Western countries involved, not to have repatriated its national locked in the concentration camp at Guantánamo. 
A government that does not reflect the fact that Omar khadr was a young teenager at the time of the charges against them. 
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, rejecting his parole and left there in inhumane conditions a child soldier. 
The only one who relies on a travesty of justice to assess the guilt of the accused. 
For memory, note that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian bar association, in particular, are calling for the return of Omar khadr to ensure that it is a fair trial in Canada. 
It is the same government that condones torture: little is important that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever after so many years of abuses. 
It does not yet, but we are in the midst of an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", the word that harper continues to wave and whom if trough in his mouth. 
Now is the time where there are no moral plus: it may very, tortured, imprisoned arbitrarily a Canadian citizen at the whim of a head of government so far minority (so what happens after the October 14,...). 
Number of voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that promotes the virtue, law and order: they don ’ t understand that this government has abandoned what was the reputation and the dignity of our country. 
Shame, Mr. toews, it is in stopping, and not elsewhere. 
Free opinion - the speech Orwellian of barrick gold 
In its edition of 17 September, the duty has published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. garver, executive vice president of the mining Canadian barrick gold. 
Pursuing a logic -, he suggested that the world ’ s largest gold mining company filed a libel suit of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without the money in order to launch a "transparent public debate". 
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, this is not the truth that they feel, especially in the case of libel suits, but the law. 
Not surprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr. garver. 
Because, for barrick gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would lead to ruin anyone would support a position contrary to his own? 
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and the publisher of the book black Canada will spend a significant amount of money in order to prepare their defence and fight, on uneven, against an army of lawyers supported by the pockets almost without fond of the mining. 
The tactic, in uneven, is often struggles to ruin the defendants to impose an out-of-court settlement that bâillonnera opposition in addition to scare anyone who dares look again on the issue. 
If barrick gold really wanted to a public debate, it is before the public opinion that she should have its vision of the facts. 
Contrary to what is in many of the countries where barrick gold, the debate in Canada are normally by the exchange of ideas and not with batons. 
Therefore it was sufficient to the mining to open its books, records and establish a true debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the funding of independent research teams that could shed light on the question. 
But barrick gold appears not to trust the public opinion and reject out of hand the petitions and letters of support to black Canada. 
Perhaps Mr. garver to explain how it can claim a "public debate" while contemptuous the opinions of the same public? 
In the world of Vice-President, it appears that the word refers to only lawyers handsomely paid and not all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept. 
In a democracy, even critics have the right to speak. 
What does not understand - or doesn ’ t understand - barrick gold, it is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of black Canada is primarily because it rejects the sudden manner of the mining. 
The public is ready to hear barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many see as a poursuite-bâillon (with the "public debate", barrick gold has to file a formal notice to the location of black Canada their requiring it to stop the use of this term...). 
Beyond the surreal speech of Dr. garver, the pursuit of barrick gold is a direct attack against the freedom of academic research and the search for truth, essential to any democratic society. 
She denies, en bloc, the right to quote from credible sources and the debate on the facts and interpretations, which is the basis of intellectual work. 
If it is impossible to consider and discuss issues that utterances to rich companies in the world in a country such as Canada, under penalty of prosecution, who will be able to do this? 
If barrick gold really wanted to a public debate and transparent, it could do so in accordance with the scientific standards used by the authors of black Canada. 
It has a right to reply. 
The academic, which we belong, has long been known manage the debates and disagreements and resolve the conflict. 
The pursuit of barrick gold's disproportionate shows clearly that, contrary to what it claims, it has no desire to a debate transparent. 
It is a loss for the academic world, as well as to the public debate in Canada, and it is time that governments put in place measures limiting this kind of abusive prosecutions. 
Rescue of Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans agree 
The Bush administration and Congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, are finally reached an agreement yesterday on the greatest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
The new version of the US $700 billion plan aimed at reducing the current financial crisis Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both houses of Congress. 
It includes: a better control by the elected its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure repayment of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of homes seized for lack of payment, as well as a right to regard on wages paid to business leaders rescued. 
The Treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, the chair of the House of Representatives, Nancy pelosi, and the Republican representative to the negotiating table, Senator Judd gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a marathon of negotiations for two days. 
"We have made great progress towards an agreement which will be effective on the markets", said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson. 
"Everything was done in a way to shelter the real economy and ordinary Americans of the current crisis on Wall Street," said the democratic. 
"This is the fundamental point: If we do n't do this, the trauma, chaos and the disturbances on the daily lives of Americans will be enormous," said the Republican Judd gregg. 
Negotiations had turned to sprint in the last hours for fear of the effect that would lead to a new failure on the mood of investors. 
The deadline that it was given was the opening of markets this morning. 
With late in the negotiations, the two candidates in the US presidential election were in favour of the agreement, without fail to express their dissatisfaction that there is obliged to arrive at this end. 
Democratic Senator barack obama has attributed the addition of certain provisions in the agreement, including that aimed to allow owners to keep their homes and on the salary of business leaders rescued by the state. 
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there has not be welcomed. 
But these measures are necessary," he commented on American television. 
Interviewed on another channel for whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to see the details, but I hope that yes." 
"The major lines that I read [show] that it is something that we will all have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward. 
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable," he said. 
The $700 billion plan aims to buy with taxpayers' money the bad debt, assets at risk and sold American financial institutions. 
It came after 14 months of a crisis sparked by the collapse of a housing bubble that began with the collapse of mortgages at risk (subprimes) before spreading to other more common forms of credit (asset-backed securities) and lead on a freezing of liquidity and the collapse of banks and financial institutions. 
It is a group of elected Republicans who had capoter the first draft agreement last week. 
Believed to be out of the impasse since the Democrats accepted that some assets "toxic" companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased. 
In order to approximate the angles for everyone in Congress, it has also added a provision that if the government were to take losses for five years with the programme, it could put in place new taxes aimed to help recover its implementation. 
The new plan provides for the first $250 billion, which will add another 100 billion if the President considers it necessary. 
The payment of 350 billion should be endorsed by another vote of Congress. 
In exchange for his aide, Washington will have stakes in companies rescued which will dividends in case of profit and that it may sell when the storm will be gone. 
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the procedures of seizures on housing tied to mortgages concerned by this plan, as well as setting limits on compensation and severance benefits paid to leaders of businesses affected. 
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote in the House of Representatives today, and in the Senate Wednesday. 
Despite their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light. 
The votes were indeed continued to rise yesterday against this project, in both the Republican and Democrat. 
"Obviously, Washington is not", said to the address of his constituents the Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Finance Committee of the House. 
"Yes, we have a serious financial crisis. 
Yes, there are solutions. 
But not the one that is to take advantage of taxpayers". 
Facilitator for a small group to Congress nicknamed "the caucus", the Democratic representative brad sherman has things differently, but came to the same conclusion. 
"Four hundred eminent professors of economy, including three Nobel laureates, we wrote to tell us: the Congress not to press and to consider the way forward," he said yesterday. 
At the same time, in Europe, was once again the evidence of the global nature of the crisis. 
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the banking group fortis to 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion US). 
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French bank BNP paribas has indicated that it intends to acquire its rival sinking since she lost 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion US) in the crisis of mortgages at risk in the United States. 
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and the 10 largest insurers. 
"This is not money lost, said yesterday the Dutch finance minister, wouter Bos. 
In exchange, there is a right to vote in the bank and influence. 
It is something that savers and households value now that the appear uncertain times." 
During this time, on the other side of the channel, the British government seemed en route to nationalize another bank exhausted by the financial crisis. 
According to the English press, the government would resume on his account of outstanding loans in the bank bradford and bringley, including more than $41 billion (75.5 billion US) of home loans. 
The Spanish bank Santander said yesterday that it is buying branches and accounts receivable of the British bank. 
The bradford and bringley would be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, which the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis. 
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - death of an icon committed 
Beauty in the eyes of Azur was long a card asset, some say its weakness. 
, he released the mirror narcissistic, the U.S. actor to smile charmeur? 
Yes and no. 
Molested, sensitivity and a talent that sank to source the will also from the register of power that enfante the real sacred monsters. 
But it is a great runner! 
Paul Newman, disappeared Friday, at 83 years, died of lung cancer in his ranch of Connecticut, is one of the last American icons cinema in good years. 
Less monumental that brando, who he looked like and how it was long a kind of rival to the screen, more prudent in its game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of freedom and the outbreak of dramatic conventions. 
Blood involved are often beautiful children. 
He was born in Ohio in 1925, a German Jewish father and a mother Hungarian origin. 
Of these European roots will one of glorious faces of the American dream. 
Without ego disproportionate, the ultimate mark of quality. 
Because he is blew a whole country infatuated with the self made man, the Pacific war veteran, injured in battle, which in the early 1950s studied drama at Yale and then attended the actor' studio in New York, before triumph in theatre, television, soon to film. 
The same man who campaigned for the civil rights was also the pilot car that is placed second in the 24 hours of Le mans in 1979, accompanied by a sex symbol, although a member of a couple model trained since 1958 with actress joanne Woodward. 
Also disappear with the shade of this star secret, discreetly, committed, allergic to spark the show-business, which will not be quite punctured the mystery. 
An honest man, in the most noble sense of the term. 
The disappearance of Paul Newman has provided the vertigo in this weekend, as against its major roles on the black screen memories. 
More than half a century of a seventh art American ever-changing roll through it. 
Return to upset of the cowboy charm of butch Cassidy and the sundance kid (1969), the young man rejecting his all senses wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the golden on a roof burning adapted from tennessee Williams in 1958. 
Closer to us (1990), there is his sensible Mr. bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not meet all its promises. 
As other Paul Newman is the past. 
The boxer rocky graziano, offender, tormented, violent, memorable in somebody up there likes me (marked by hatred), Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, after his death, which launched really Newman in 1956. 
This malfrat sympathetic in the brillantissime the sting (the scam), Oscar for best film in 1973. 
Billard bitter and vengeful player in the beautiful the hustler of Robert rossen (1961), he will resume the character on the return in the color of money from Martin scorsese, which earned him in 1987 his unique Oscar on nine nominations. 
This face through the ages, it was him. 
Even him. 
The Times scramble through its path. 
Young people know him best through the cultissime slap shot of George Roy Hill (1977), in reggie Dunlop, a team of ice hockey coach unorthodox. 
Fans found him in 1994 in the hudsucker proxy of the coen brothers. 
With a last role of sponsor of the Irish mafia in road to perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the loop was gone. 
Against several stories film whose early enough on trade, Newman will be continued long in the saddle, while denouncing Hollywood, its ORs, its good and concessions. 
The French filmmaker Bertrand tavernier saw it, not without humour, "as a challenge in "The underplaying" because its benefits too supported. 
The profession has not always been reach for the beau Paul Newman who roles came long all cooked in the bill. 
However, it played less often younger than the marginal: névrosés, alcoholic, bastards over or desperate, which features perfect reflected the excesses and the protests. 
As director, Newman remarked of faces uncertain of his true sensitivity discreet. 
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (based on the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a female end portrait of melancholy. 
Lui who lost his son Scott overdose he dedicated his film Harry and his in 1984, oeuvre of modesty and sadness. 
Among the rain of tributes that déferlait yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former companion of weapons Robert redford (they had played together in the sting and butch Cassidy and the sundance kid), very saddened: "His presence has made my life and this country better." 
Generosity, love the existence are vibrant traits of the actor disappeared. 
Legend beyond his career, disappeared as a grand for civil rights activist, ecology, independent cinema, a challenging the excesses of Hollywood. 
It can be seen much its an trôner on pots of vinaigrette, sauces, cookies and other foods, saying the process of poor taste, although gag at the outset. 
The profits from these sales were paid to his foundation for children at risk. 
Newman, rather than sit on his myth, is committed to the end. 
He gave his five girls a letter containing these phrases: "always and up to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his star. 
It was a privilege to be here." 
And a privilege for us to have followed the path of an American artist if lucid and generous. 
Model citizen, in sum and beyond. 
That could make zuschlag &amp; amp; company in their plant to bills? 
Soon, on 8 October, will begin hearings relating to the criminal procedure, against liviu zuschlag and his accomplices. 
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of criminal organisation, permanently and regular, with damage especially important. Additional charges have been brought against them, for example, false and counterfeit. 
According to the prosecutor ’ s office, money from grants, was spent for personal use, while the benefits were justified by false invoices. 
State money and municipalities, about 65 million 25 in total, was a part in crates of movement fiatal baloldal and other part, in the pocket of some people. 
Their method, made public by the authorities responsible for the investigation, was to receive the money grants obtained by issuing invoices of costs, behind which no actual delivery was provided, the associations never meet their commitments. 
According to the indictment, a large part of the invoices were false. 
For them, they traded records of invoices to józsefváros market, while they made the fees to kiskunhalas. 
For the names of companies that would appear on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during tours of province north of Lake F, made by Emilio lados, at the request of liviu zuschlag. 
According to the testimony of this last, he should identify pensions and restaurants. 
For his personal consumption, he asked an invoice, on the model of which they made other bills that they would introduce, among other things, with the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and social affairs, as well as the municipality of the capital to access grants. 
The majority of bills was created by Emilio lados and his accomplice Paul őri, who according to our information, was especially to write records to obtain grants. 
During a "circuit tracking", a lados choices was a bistro. 
According to the two bills issued by the zuschlag in 2003, this place has provided the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association biztos bridge egyesület. 
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible that so many people have this place, at the same time. 
In the same way, in the summer of 2002, the invoice on behalf of the foundation jobb jövőért, who later will bear the name of együtt a harmadik évezredért, was always teeming with errors and substantive. 
A pension, located in badacsonytomaj, did in fact that three houses, and maximum ten people could spend the night there. However, the invoice was one hundred and thirty clients. 
Issuers of invoices to the imaginations are also in excess, when they mentionnèrent society pigal kft, also in horeca. In their accounting, or the name of jobb jövőért, nor the hoppá appeared, according to information provided to the prosecutor ’ s office. 
Győző farkas, general manager of the company, said the site hvg.hu when the prosecution called him and showed the invoices, he knew immediately that it was false documents. 
"The name of our society and our tax number were placed in a bad place on the stamp." 
He added: "beyond the form, the fact that after the bill, 100 people have lodged there, Don not because it has only 11 houses, which were not in place. 
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant is closed for a long time." 
Issuers of invoices zealous are not informed on travel agencies of Budapest, part of their choice, but with only travel abroad. And, naively, they indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to species, which is against the accounting practices of the agency. 
Of places, as it appeared during the investigation, they were also VAT on these documents, while the benefits for the activities of travel, including the destination is outside the European Union, are billed without VAT. 
Similarly, the VAT rate for four invoices on behalf of the hotel révfülöp to jobb jövőért was incorrect, since the benefits of society does not support a vat of 25% reported, but a vat of 15%. In addition, hotel employees did that printed, while the false invoices were written in the main. 
The prosecutor's investigation revealed that the "transmitters" have also committed errors in indicating the delivery the transport of goods by road, that the card issuer of bills could not exercise, because its profile was the investment advice. 
Moreover, it is also for vices of forms, such as types of invoices inadequate and incidental fees, that invoices to együtt a harmadik évezredért alapítvány, XXI. Századi kulturális egyesület and biztos bridge proved to be false. 
As in the case of the company Ravenna bt. or stage sportif de kunfehértó, who both deny be the invoices in their name. 
Counterfeiters have not pay attention to the fact that the corporation hib kft., established in Budapest, was in liquidation when (in 2001) the Group of fiatal városért egyesület was supposed to take a meal at home. According to our information, it is for this reason that the liquidator of the company denies having issued this bill. 
Invoices deliberately 
Another category of issuers of bills is composed of those who were fully aware that he was asked to make the bogus invoices. 
The foundation esély budapestért alapítvány, at the request of the Group of fiatal baloldal - ifjú szocialisták, established an invoice to the order of the együtt Foundation has harmadik évezredért, for a total of four million 25. 
According to the indictment, the manager of the society Al kft. was prompted to issue false invoices by one of the accused, ludovic györfi. 
Similarly, cooperated with the zuschlags, the company biogate kft., who is currently under liquidation and that in 2003, a issued invoices to the order of the foundation jobb jövőért alapítvány, of the association atlasz egyesület and the association vörösfenyő egyesület, for a total of about five million 25, but that no benefit was actually provided. 
No financial transaction took place, not more, as invoices were annulled by the suite, but this, the agencies have avoided mentioning it in their accounts. 
The next category of credit card companies bill is that companies directly related to the accused. 
As well, the delegate's administrative director general of the Delta trió kft., trading fuel and motor vehicles, whose headquarters was in Budapest, but where there was found was Iván kubatov. 
In October, November and December 2005, the company has issued several bills relating to the sale of computer equipment, for a total of about 18 million 25. 
According to the survey, the equipment have been bought by the company cash investment kft. of kiskunhalas, who was in liquidation since September 14, 2005. 
The director of the society was a man of Romanian origin, who Iván kubatov have also sent documents in relation to the company, between 2002 and 2005. 
Based on what we know, kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that it has issued invoices to the order of companies atlasz, hoppá and együtt a harmadik évezredért alapítvány, and that he was pocketing their equivalent. 
It is precisely at the request of Iván kubatov that masons Romanians have created the companies fa-bani Jos faipari kft. and jos-investment BT. 
In reality, none of these companies operated, that the accused explained by the fact that they were not working. 
It was still of these companies, because at the request of master zsolt szente, co-accused as well as editor of acts of corporate Foundation, it has established invoices to their names, in the order of associations relating to zuschlag, such as atlasz associations and y-generáció. 
Kubatov gave in 15 bills in total, issued by the companies cash investment, Delta trió, fa-bani Jos, Jos investment and linaxtrade, for a value of 14.2 million 25. 
The prosecutor ’ s office thought that 10% of the amount on the bills as well as VAT went in the pocket of kubatov. 
The man has even used the company szi-beri bt. for invoices shell that have been used in the framework of the grant application of biztos bridge. 
In January 2006, the association y-generáció and szövetség a modern magyarországért lodged an application with the organization of public utility of the Socialist Party, táncsics mihály alapítvány (tma). 
They received the grant for a maximum of two times 500.000 25, but these have not been used for the objectives set out in the application. 
To ensure that this does know, five bogus invoices received from the company works team kft. were presented to the tma. 
Moreover, these are the bills, which were found during the search conducted in the office of árpád kemecsei, the Department of Education. 
At the hearing, a part of the accused will relate the method of manufacturing invoices, as she had done before the prosecutor ’ s office. 
What would be really interesting is that the accused principal, liviu zuschlag itself, decides to uncover any history. 
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although it has promised on several occasions to tell the details, it has not yet done so. 
The question is whether it is in its interest, or, possibly, the Socialists have concluded an agreement under which in exchange for the return of a large part of the fifty million 25, zusi would only the hat. 
Today, the latter is probably upset, as applications for its placement under house arrest, on the basis of a streamlining of the conditions of his detention, fall continuously in the ear of a deaf. 
While those who caused much larger, and the authors of economic crime beyond repair, wander freely, or at least for their own home the end of the procedure. He has no such possibility. 
The psychology of the teaching: Why is spent more money? 
At auction, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the goods. 
Researchers in neurology and economics at the University of New York have managed to update the bases, and economic of this behaviour known and apparently irrational. 
According to the study published in the journal Science, humans do not want to be left behind during this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that is why they prefer even pay too high a price. 
These research have tried to draw a diagram neurological of this kind of "game" with the help of experimental auction. 
A groups of volunteers played in the lotto, while the other group was taking part in an auction toys, while using a process of functional magnetic resonance (fmri), researchers analysed the brain areas assets of experimental subjects. 
In the two games, participants could earn money, but during the auction, an essential element is more a third, all under the brainstem, called the striatum, was moving so intensive at the loss of the party. 
This part of the brain, with several other functions, played a role in the mechanism of "auto-stimulation" of the nervous system. 
That is why, according to the researchers, the prices with the escape from the violent reaction of the striatum. 
In support of their theories, members of this group of researchers continued financial analyses of surveillance. 
At these three groups surenchérissaient face to a partner, in various circumstances. 
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and they have done their development. 
A another group, they promised that if, in addition, they went out winner of the party, then they would receive an additional $15, as a reward. 
While the third group has received these 15 dollars before the auction, but members of the group also lost money, in case they lose the auction. 
The difference between these two groups is that the emphasis was placed in one of the victory, while home on the failure. 
In proving the hypothesis of neurologists, members of the team players "against failure" were willing to set higher than those made by the control group and the group "for victory". 
"These results can not be met by any existing economic theory. 
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena found at auction by the pleasure to win and the parade before the risk. 
Only imaging procedures neurological helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories in leading, now on a third explanation." - found Andrew schotter, professor of the faculty of economics at the University of New York. 
Hepatitis: When do we see a doctor? 
In the world, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, the chronic liver disease is mentioned as one of the leading causes of death. 
One hundred thousand people are estimated to carry the virus hepatitis in Hungary, but only seven miles after treatment. This is the fact that patients often do n't know that they are infected with the virus. 
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to liver and infections caused by different virus. 
There are a lot of similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice is features, but the pathogens and the smoking-related illnesses differ from each other. 
Hepatitis viruses, according to the bacterial genes, are primarily in two forms: the hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example: contaminated food or water), the hepatitis B, C, D and other virus in the blood and body fluids (semen, vaginal, saliva). 
For passengers, it is in any way recommended to be vaccinated against the virus A and B. there is no vaccine for the C. 
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the consumption of contaminated food, in general, accompanied by a poor condition, weakness, stomach and nausea. 
Then emerged on the skin and in the white of the eye a jaundice visible, stools become more clear and urine is a darker colour. Healing can take two to three weeks. 
All over the world, every year, a million people died from the more severe form of the disease, such as cancer or cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B. 
The main cause is that according to estimates, only a patient on ten receives medical treatment. 
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if she is not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. 
Most people do n't know whether they reached the virus, because the gene pathogen destroyed in an underhand liver cells. In many cases, the symptoms occur only after 20 to 30 years. 
Accordingly, an early prevention is very important, and of regular testing. 
The contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: those who suffered a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and the tattooed. 
Currently, on $200 million patients with chronic hepatitis type C in the world. 
Since the disease can be detected by a review of routine in the laboratory, it is advisable to consult their physician from the observation of symptoms of unknown origin. 
The disease can be cured, if it is detected in time. The virus could be eradicated from the body, the risk of contagion disappears and the development of a cancer is notified. 
On 30 September is the world hepatitis day, held for the first time in 2004 by the organizations representing patients from around the world. 
Its goal is to attract attention to chronic cirrhosis of the liver, caused by the virus, on the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease. 
The fastest growing in God has he less pain? 
Based on the results of recent research, the religious belief would function as a kind of analgesic, who has already made more bearable death of martyrs Roman Catholic. 
The British Daily Telegraph published an article in which researchers at the University of Oxford have made an interesting experience in analyzing what level the belief in God could influence the pain tolerance of human beings. 
In the context of this experience for the least bizarre, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists have been administered electric shocks, while each of them was a painting of the Virgin Mary. 
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude a large part of the suffering. 
With a touch of the human brain, it was also discover that Catholics have been able to activate the part of the brain responsible for the regulation of pain. 
This analysis is the first of a series of experiments, which academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians are from different sectors of the university. 
Specifically, the experience goes as follows: a device emitting sparks and disseminating electroconvulsive therapy is set on the left hand of the experimental subject. 
Researchers asked participants to experience to sustained two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the lady with an ermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century. 
Researchers at the origin of this experience hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary is a kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of painting of Da Vinci, not very different from the first, focused on the soothing. 
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during that time, received 20 drugs in four successive part, while watching the painting to religious theme, is the general theme. 
Catholics said that in the view of the Virgin Mary, they feel as "safe", as someone whose on "takes care" and they were "cooled down, and the peace has invaded". 
In view of the religious painting, they have reported 12% of pain in less than when they were looking at the work of Leonardo. 
The psychologist Miguel farias, which itself has taken part in the experience, believe that we can achieve the same effects with any other strong, among the atheist, as long as the right photo. 
"We should find an image face to which they respond very positively, such as a mother or father", said the psychologist. 
Tom Wright, Bishop, welcomed the results of the research. 
"The practice of the faith should change and in many cases, actually change our personality", Wright said. 
After these excellent results, it is more than the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of pain of topics if it is shown to believers a madone painted by Leonardo or a painter of the same calibre? 
Is that the sight of a Virgin Mary of better quality will produce better results? 
You are what you or to your topic 
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google says that it can be found at the bottom of the people in the same way as the sky above their heads. He knows where they spent their vacation, which specialists browsing and what are their centres of interest. 
But this is not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of influential people in society. 
While in regard to the skeptics establishing a parallel with the vision of horror of Orwell, they do not see just the Web 2.0. 
Eric Schmidt said, there is little, the Financial Times that the main ambition of Google is to gather more information about its users. This is necessary for the founders of Google to meet their original purpose that was as follows: "get in a system all information du Monde! ". 
According to the chief executive officer of Google questioned, after ten years of a work of chamboulement world, they are not always that at the beginning of their objectives to treat all the information. 
A question: Will there be in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google can answer questions like "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What is the work that I would be the better? ". However, the software will respond to this type of issue, simple at first glance, that the day they know enough about users. 
It is not entirely clear to everyone that the words used in research on the Internet, the IP address of the computer that lance research and the pages visited by people interested are listed. 
Through the programme personalized search launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own historical research and can see what they sought, what they clicked. Through this, in the long term, recommendations, based on the same logic, will be able to provide answers much more personalized, and we will submit products and services on the basis of our previous statements and our preferences recorded. 
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if it looks at what is my job? users, who are concerned the monopoly of Google. 
In most cases, it is the potential represented by the company that may lead to fear, and this is not the remord, fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly the revolt against the power that can generate among Internet users a used. 
It is, however, a fact confirmed that the search terms are not only registered, but in justified cases, they are sent to a third party, and in this type of case, nothing protects personal rights of users. 
The most astounding these days is probably the coordinated action against pedophiles Brazilian, during which Google sent the Brazilian government information he had collected on the public page called orkut, allowing an identification. 
Mindful of the rights of the individual users were able to breathe a sigh of relief last May, when Google, bras top below with the electronic legal protection agency EFF, has proved her right to the court face the FBI. According to the judgment, in the future, Google will still not be required by any of the Constitution to disclose information on the request secret FBI, whatever. 
(at the same time, the federal government has successfully obtained 50,000 Web addresses and 1,000 search terms that he had won compared to law enforcement on the protection of the child, voted several years earlier. But in the end, it fails to get the lists of research into private users, or the entire list of Internet sites and keywords in the last two months.) 
The judgment of Google is somewhat contradictory: it is castigated by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think their intimate sphere and their private domain in suffer when they begin to use Google services. As a result, they deal with them in the spirit of revolt that there was against multinational corporations proud of their conservative image. 
During this time, the American geek culture and its "sauvageons" with fans, activists and enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries see Google the next generation of large companies, the "Corporation connected", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, catalogued as invader of the world because of windows, even if both are fighting for the same purpose. 
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, is not asking users of identification code does not money for its applications. The code documentary and the package of programmes, continually refreshed, has a much more accessible, more young and cool, face to the practice of official of the software giant. 
The reason may be that the geeks are exactly the problematic relationship between the rights of the individual and the Internet, and what the Web 2.0, the keyword most proclaimed in recent years, tire just behind him. 
Indeed, the Web 2.0 is not something other than the collaboration, that the fact that we are intentionally traces behind us, and that we use channels of communication available, and while the dimension of these change one by one, the essential remains the same: on himself. 
A young, in general, can hold a public profile on several pages, facebook to xanga, and it can connect them to other benefits, such as at twinter, or to last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then, it can connect them to a tracking system, like friendfeed or blip.fm. these young people may also be blogs, in which appear automatically their most recent photo galleries that they store on flickr and picasa. 
While on can be seen numerous examples, such as the girlfriend that includes easily to the photos in the morning, taken by the circle of friends, with which his friend infidel spent the evening, or the company that dismissed one of its employees, nothing for the opinions sincere that he wrote on his blog about the top management, you may be on to something: the term of privacy is completely to reconsider our days. 
Celui qui lives a life online, is made up of what it shows of himself, and that can be defined the principle hiding behind the behaviour of young people today. 
That wants to hide something, or at least, trying to circumvent the monopoly of Google, can do (starting, for example, with scroogle, using the Google search system, but, at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace). 
Deliberately, the number of people who did not register on the public pages so that it is not possible to find, is not the least. The Google services online, through the treatment of text in image processing, à la reading information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not related to huge parks of servers and who assemble not our best profile, having been up to this day. 
The attend public opinion, without really is in hiding, the moment where Google will unveil its true nature. 
Society, with its present value of 156 billion, is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). The areas advertising adwords and adsense threaten the turnover of advertising agencies, while the benefits introduced at a speed of more important cause of severe migraines not only to Microsoft, but in many other creators of computer programs. 
However, critics find, next to it, contradictions with potentially serious consequences: For example, the top management of the company refused, in its entirety, protests by employees, after it has doubled the price of kindergarten business and after the company was deemed too expensive restoration multiple daily, anytime. It seems insignificant beside the fact that already in 2006, Google granted to the Chinese government and the terms of their agreement, the company detects all results that hurt the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime. 
According to one of the rules of society, the new services have not announced when they can be used. What is on, it is that in the coming months and years, they will move the world on new points. While some think the project to scan and archiving of books and magazines of Google takes dimensions so important that the company will soon find themselves face to the Supreme Court of the United States, other tremble before its health system, because in it, you can build a complete medical profit from our results of previous analyses, our doctors and our problems. 
The fact that Google is a DNA database can provide a good material to the next generation of science fiction writers. The novel's famous Cory doctorow, written with demi-tons orwelliens, described the future in which a man may be closer to alarming levels only through the data to Google. 
Two minors have helped to remove traces of the double homicide of ózd 
"The police called two minors to them in the case of the double homicide of ózd. After suspicions based, they have helped to remove traces of crime.", said the office's spokesman department of borsod. 
Young people have recognized the facts that they are charged. For the moment, they are accused of complicity. 
The two minors, who, according to the information of mti (Hungarian telegraphic agency) are girls, defend themselves free. 
The complicity of murder can be detention of up to 5 years. 
The suspect's double homicide of ózd, a young man in the corner 23 years old, has been remanded in custody on Sunday. 
The charges against him are multiple homicide, committed with premeditation and interest. 
During the investigation, it was revealed that the young man of 23 years was a large sum of money to a man of 53 years. 
The suspect did not want to pay off its debt and it is for this reason that he drew his creditor, last Wednesday, in a ózd where he was killed, as well as the daughter of the man, 9 years old. 
According to the information mti, the young man was premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he would commit crimes hidden on the scene of the crime is proof. 
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists. 
The Warsaw is a proposal for the redemption of the Prague stock exchange 
The stock exchange of Warsaw has proposed two hundred million euros, about five billion, for the redemption of 100% of the package of shares of the stock exchange of Prague. 
Ludwik sobolewski, le Président de la bourse in Warsaw, confirmed this proposal that Poles have made despite that, above, the Czechs have ruled out the Warsaw's circle of potential new owners of the Prague stock exchange. 
The cause of this exclusion is that the award of Warsaw is in the hands of the state. 
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state to secede from more than 60% of its actions in a few months. 
According to the business daily Czech e15, the Polish represents the highest offer that has been made so far for the redemption of the Prague stock exchange. 
According to the Czech press, the Vienna stock exchange, the transatlantic exchange NASDAQ, the stock exchange of New York, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse made an offer to date. 
Petr koblic, the director of the Prague stock exchange, said last week that among the interested, the Warsaw stock exchange would be the new owner the least, and has not ruled out the fact that it could lead to the demise of the Prague stock exchange in the future. 
The value of the award of Prague is estimated to be between 5 to 10 billion Czech crowns by specialists in the market. 
On the basis of an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of papers would be sold. 
The largest owner of the Prague stock exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with about 25 percent of equity, followed by the 14.7 percent of the bank ceská sporitelna and the tiger holding four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent. 
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press 
In their comments Tuesday devoted to the international financial crisis, is worsening by the day, newspapers leaders of the European press is already a "second 11 September". 
"The overall financial catastrophe, it should the American President" - accuse the Rome daily, La Repubblica. "the President has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill, impromptu on the fly, aimed at rescuing a desperate situation..." 
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as was the billionaire Warren buffett, it is more appropriate to talk about a second 11 September. 
A part of the press Madrid also saw the scapegoat to Washington. 
According to the vision of the newspaper El Mundo, this is the case of the political leadership of there who led the global economy on the verge of collapse. 
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system is growing every day, and as a result, the world will pay a high price. 
The Bush plan was far from perfect, however, after the vote of the Congress, a real threat, that Washington is not proposing a political tool to deal with the crisis. 
The world economy hanging in the void, just at a time when the history of capitalism, one of the biggest changes took place. 
We can not ignore the threat longer - says the tages-anzeiger of Geneva. 
Some states may still be a lifeline to their financial institutions titubants, and with the money from taxpayers, they can save them from bankruptcy. 
Of course, if still more banks collapse such as domino, then or financial resources, and improvisations are sufficient. 
A long term, we need the member states of the European Union to make little of their national self-interest, and that they have moved control over financial markets divided. 
Nothing that Monday, weakened financial organizations have received more than 100 billion euros - recalled the Viennese daily, der standard, adding that fears that the European taxpayers also will have to put his hand into the pocket, very deep, similar to the Americans in order to address the crisis, are becoming more and more realistic. 
So far, the EU has not really handled the crisis, which, as a tsunami, traverse, part in part, the old continent. 
The "rescue" should not raise tout de suite a hundred billion euros, however this would be wise if they noted in which case it is rational to taxpayers' money, with the aim to prevent more damage. 
The Smart car mimics the flight of bourdon 
What method would be best for developing technologies to avoid an obstacle, if this is the imitation of a detector obstacles that already exist in the nature? 
For example, the bees. 
In the project surprising presented at the ceatec, held in Japan, the bees busy gave the idea strategic starting to engineers at Nissan, to inspire them on how they need to develop the next generation of detectors obstacles. 
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini car robot, a system in order auto-robotisé bio-inspiré, type br23c, that it has equipped with qualities of bees, the ultimate goal is to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles. 
During its flights, each bee is its own space, oval, which in reality, resemblance to secure our hull of protection - a explained, at the exhibition, kazuhhiro doi, the director of the technology research and development and public relations department of the mark. 
The eye to facets of the bee plays a role, since he is able to see in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees. 
To mimic the functions of the eye, engineers discussed the idea of mountainous laser. 
He identifies the obstacles within 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters before the br23c, he assesses the distances and sends a signal to the microprocessor, which transforms it into avoidance maneuvers tout de suite. 
The perception of the obstacle is held in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini car robot, mimicking the movements of the bee, immediately change the direction of its wheels in the turn of a sufficient angle to avoid the collision. 
Unlike any existing system, this avoidance maneuvers takes place entirely instinctively. 
"If it was not, a mini car robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle" - said toshiyuki andoh, director of the laboratory mobility and the robotic car project. 
It must respond instinctively and instantaneous, since this technology correspond to the most vulnerable and the inner layer of the envelope of protection, a layer that for the moment the collision is considered inevitable. 
All this process must reflect what the bee is to avoid other bees. 
The process should take place in a blink of an eye. 
Is the opposite of bees, the difference can not go to the top, down or in diagonal, it can not be only two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels may turn. 
In this way, the place of endless combinations that have the bees to avoid other bees, in our case, it did not use the Rotary motion, speeding up and slowing as labourers in the mini car robot 
The br23c uses lithium polymer battery that are lighter and the concentrated energy is greater, what makes their life longer than in the lithium-ion version. 
According to andoh, it is the intelligent instinctive response that is paramount, not the data processing, and even less capacity to store. 
This mechanism should deal with some incoming signals per second, and react to them. 
And store it is not necessary to respond with the intuitive logic based on data from previous manoeuvres. In this way, he uses only a few dozen kilobytes of memory continued. 
There is no need to memory of a giga-octets, or even megabytes. 
It is the first step towards the design of a technology used to instant avoidance. Based on estimates of Nissan, this system will enter the cars manufactured in series in the next 10 years. 
Another application could be its inclusion in the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination in avoiding obstacles in his way. 
On even gave a name the baby out of Prix 
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue plan, aimed to buy the credits doubtful of banks, and to use on several occasions, is ready. 
In the first round, half of that money will be spent. 
Reuters announced that during new discussions extending until after midnight Saturday, local time on the East Coast, the leaders of Congress agreed on the controversies that have existed for days and days, around the rescue plan for a total of $700 billion. 
"We have made a serious step forward", said Nancy pelosi, the Democratic President of the U.S. House of Representatives, it is more than to put the accords on paper. 
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two candidates for the presidency, barack obama and John McCain. 
The Treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, said in commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will operate and will be effective, however other measures need to be implemented. According to pelosi, there is no question here, the rescue of Wall Street, but to turn the fundamentals of the economy in the other direction. 
The written version of the plan was made public before the Asian markets, Sunday night at 8 p.m., local time in Washington (i.e. Monday at 2 in the morning, according to the local time of Central Europe), but has not led to spectacular rise in the awards. 
Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote the bill responding on behalf of Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. Then, its fate will be in the hands of the Senate. 
Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to pelosi, then the White House has also welcomed news of the agreement. 
"We are satisfied with progress with this night, and we appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and for protecting our economy", said Tony fratto, a spokesperson for the White House. 
Moreover, the program differs from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which indicated that the $700 billion to be spent in only once, for the redemption of dubious titles on appropriations. 
Now, more than half of the $700 billion can be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the adoption of the law by Congress, probably on Monday. This first amount will be used to Secretary of the Treasury to buy bad debts of banks, while the use of 100 billion will be left to the discretion of the President. 
The program will be overseen by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate. 
The expense for the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new order in Congress. 
Under the act, the Secretariat to the Treasury will put in place a combined strategy: he can, at the same time, purchase of bad loans, on bad mortgages and mortgage securities, as well as other types of claims "toxic". 
The department's authorities have said that buyouts may take place in the framework of an auction, but also directly. 
Rule provides an opportunity for the companies involved, to take part in a programme of insurance, where the Secretariat to the Treasury guarantees the tools at the origin of concern, for which companies will be paid a bonus equivalent to damage predictable. 
Henry Paulson stated that the law provides the necessary tools to spend 700 billion dollars to the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the large buyout of dubious claims, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of seeing the system resulting in the collapse of one or another major financial institution. 
"We will take the necessary steps, to be ready to law enforcement, as it will be signed" - he said. 
In contrast, the leaders of the banks in bad postures and attendant state aid can expect that their severance benefits, called simply golden parachute across the Atlantic, will be capped by the government. 
The salary cap was made only in specific cases. In addition, the limitations will depend on how the Secretariat to the Treasury propose its assistance to the company. 
The principle of cap means that if the Secretariat to the Treasury purchases in the context of an auction, they will draw down a surplus of tax on the golden parachute, unless the President of bank discredited parte to retirement. 
Directly after the redemption of bad debt, the government will respond aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to leaders should not be exaggerated. 
For the image to be complete, it is still add that the existing golden parachutes are not amended. The cap is that the new contracts, this to motivate participation in the plan. 
This is the first time in the history of the United States, legal ceilings will be in force on the party for general managers - said the President of the Commission in charge of financial benefits of the Chamber of Deputies, the Democrat barney frank. 
Further, the state is a right of acquiring shares in banks taking part in the plan. In this way, the risk of taxpayers decreases, because they may even win in the case as soon as the economy and the banks saved return on their feet. 
The bill said that in the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal that will decide on how the losses will be returned to taxpayers, from the financial sector. 
On both sides, there was obviously those who have expressed their doubts compared to this plan. 
This is not for that American citizens we have appointed, this does not protect taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican member of California, darrell Issa. 
His colleague Democrat of Ohio, Mary kaptur think they were the ones who urge the action, that those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Barack obama and McCain support both the rescue plan for banks 
Sunday, barack obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both major parties, have given their support to the $700 billion government rescue plan. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of Treasury Secretary. 
After negotiations marathons, which lasted for days and days, representatives in Congress and the administration have finally announced, Sunday at dawn, that they have reached tentative agreements on the rescue plan for banks. 
This financing plan, aimed at the break-up of the crisis on Wall Street and the paralyzed credit market, has become a central issue in the presidential campaign. 
Obama and McCain are the same, each as more able than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis. 
According to the latest opinion polls, with the exploitation of economic issues, obama has succeeded again to get a little advance. The advance of McCain, with the nomination of Sarah palin as running mate just after the Republican convention, has melted. 
During a campaign meeting held in Detroit, Sunday, obama has expressed his hope that the Congress vote quickly the law on the $700 billion rescue plan. 
He stressed that the proposal contains the passages of consumer protection that he also argues. 
"It is now that action must be taken, with responsibility (...) a threat your work, your savings, industrial sectors and the stability of the economy as a whole" - he said before a crowd of 35,000 people.

Nancy pelosi, speaker of the House of Representatives, said Sunday that there is a serious hopes that the House passed the bill on Monday. 
The press of German language 
The right camp was intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - it is and that evokes the Der Spiegel, the low score of CSU in the two countries. 
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of red and black. 
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de) 
In the online edition of the German magazine information left, Franz Walter analyse the causes of the dramatic defeat of CSU in his article entitled "the revolution in Bavaria devours his fathers". 
According to the political scientist, the erosion of CSU began well before the sad duo beckstein-huber takes his duties. 
The Socialists Christians have transformed the Bavaria for decades and now, these modern citizens that their turns its back. 
This time is at the same time the problem of any democracy Christian, and this fact, also of Angela merker. 
For the CSU, failure has not been quite a surprise, but Sunday, arrived in a process that was likely there, just ten years: their hegemony of the national party was completed. 
There is this decade, in 1998, the CSU is up with 47.7 percent, and for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the level of 50 percent. 
This was repeated three years ago in the Bundestag 2005 elections, at the time of so much discussed Stoiber. 
The cause may be attributed to the modernisation "consuming yucca his parents", put in place in the region consistently by the CSU. 
It is 40 years since sociologists call this but they are misled about the pace. However, secularization, the results of education and the establishment of German north and is in the region of Bavaria, developing, could not remain without consequence for the loyalty of voters CSU. 
A modernisation goes hand in hand with increasing opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible. 
The right camp was intact, it is within the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and locked with their opponents. 
It is surprising that in recent weeks, this is the classic groups of citizens who have rather distant from the CSU, such as the independent, artisans, holders of Lac and graduates of higher studies. 
In these groups, support for the CSU has fallen below 40 per cent. 
Die Presse (diepresse.com) 
In his article titled "who? with that? the president of party held on the reserve face questions from the coalition", the Austrian daily conservative handles the situation of domestic policy confuse Austrian who has installed after the elections. 
The Socialists Austrians of spö wish to discuss with the Conservatives the övp. 
The övp banned in spö of meddling in its internal affairs. 
The populist party bzö is open to negotiations. The Greens are not yet agree on the coalition. 
The elections took place, now everything revolves around the coalition; during the debates held on public television, party leaders have barely suggest their cards. 
Werner faymann, the President of the spö, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with the övp. 
The spö wants to show that the two parties was possible - this is what already exists in some regions and in the partnership. 
The question that he imaginerait a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the övp, as Chancellor, remains open on the part of faymann. 
As he said, schüssel-molterer was, in any case, dismissed. 
A replica of this combination is out of the question. 
Molterer reacted with caution to the red. 
As he has already stated, a collaboration will no doubt be unsuccessful if faymann attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the övp. 
In her party, the opposition or entry into the coalition is a question completely open. These items to be discussed within the övp. 
Jörg Haider, the President of the bzö, is open to all proposals. 
"to avoid the coalition of red and black, we are ready to take responsibility for government" - said Haider. 
Járóka said: It should break the cycle of poverty and segregation 
Today, began in Paris, the European summit for equal opportunities, hosted by France, as a representative of the current presidency of the European Union. 
In his message presentation to the plenary session, as one of the main voice of the consultation of experts, livia Járóka, MEP Fidesz European People's Party, has focused attention on the segregation in education, because it is a violation of the law that is most Roma children and this fact, one of the main brakes to their success in life. 
On behalf of the French presidency, this high-level conference was open to a part, by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of labour and social affairs, and on the other, by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for work, social affairs and equal opportunities. 
Among those invited to take part in the consultation, there is the European social partners, as well as the leading representatives of legal protection and civilian agencies, in the field of equal opportunities. 
According to the media office of the popular member Fidesz party, Járóka warned that alongside the distinctions on hiring, Roma disappear from the labour market, in first place, as a result of their low qualification. 
"an overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have high school diplomas, and as a result of a basic education of poor quality, only a tiny part has the opportunity to get a graduate degree." 
Moreover, Járóka insisted that education as a basic right of human beings plays a key role in it must assert other fundamental rights. 
Investment in education early Roma children means a strengthening of the economy of member countries of the European Union. 
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these reports in a circle the widest possible, also between Roma and the who. 
Indeed, Roma earlier a child starts school, plus it increases his chances to become a productive member of the labour market; by the taxes paid from his income and its drinks, he took part in the state budget. 
"by their nationality of the European Union, Roma should be assured of their right to a quality education, and be protected from a lower quality of education and sectarian." - said livia Járóka. 
According to the MP, a collaboration of the European Union directed towards a goal and immediate action is needed for an acceleration of the process of desegregation of schools. For this, the directives of existing anti-discrimination and in preparation is of paramount importance. 
"We must break the vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and underemployed. Must be given opportunities provided by democracy to Roma children, so that they can participate as citizens of right to the future of Europe" - a required Járóka. 
On behalf of the European year for equal opportunities" provided for all, the objective of the summit for equality of opportunity in Europe each year since the summit in Berlin last year, is to ensure a unique platform to support the measures taken in favour of equal opportunities and for the fight against discrimination, targeted at European level and the level of member countries. 
CSU: the thanks for a period of transition 
It is in October that will be taken a decision on the fate of the duo lost huber-beckstein 
Despite the poor electoral setback, heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues to the top of the CSU Bavarian was postponed. 
The party chairman, Erwin hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still keep their place. The question is, when will the grace? 
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic loss of voice of 17 per cent, will be on the agenda of the exceptional Party Congress, held the last weekend of October. 
The members of this pair a lot, in any case, felt that they did not specifically to their seats. 
Through this, they are used to soothe members furious about the fraction and of the base, which a day after the "tsunami Bavarian" demanded the personal consequences for the loss of an absolute majority. 
There is this five years - it is true, even under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the peak of his career - the Christian social Union won 60.7 percent, while today, a year after the coup against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of their strength. 
For 46 years, the CSU has been the "unique sovereign" of Bavaria with 18 per cent of GDP. 
But, the Conservatives have always strongly in this southern region, key to the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced to the coalition. 
As one of the first signs of a redevelopment of the party, the vice president and the Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as the successor of Huber, has also received a place in this small group of recognition, who initiates discussions" with the FDP, as well as people free, formed along the right values, about a possible coalition government of Munich. 
A foot nose strange fate was that using the list of voters free, between in the legislation Gabriele pauli, including the measurement against stroiber served as a possibility of coup by the duo huber-beckstein, and then be careful without the very ambitious politician. 
Now, the leaders of the CSU put all their energy to stabilize, in one way or another, Beckstein. 
In this transition, Stoiber, who so far was pulling the strings behind the scenes, will also receive an active role. The former head of the regional government and former President of the CSU, has appointed on 28 September as the day the most bitter of his political career. 
Monday, Huber has launched a scathing towards the CDU. According to him, they would have earned much more support from the party brother. 
Other politicians CSU have interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and also for Angela Merkel. 
Following the parliamentary elections, which will be held in September 2009, Merkel will again be Chancellor if they give up one way or another, with a joint force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005. 
According to Merkel, hiding to his disappointment with the fiasco, the loss of the CSU will not a negative of the grand coalition of Berlin. 
Which is relative because it will not be easy to manage the CSU injured, and the Social Democrats crisis lasts. 
Since 1946, the SPD has reached its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria. 
Lukasenko - its rivals: 110 - 0 
No member of the Belarusian opposition has elected to parliament after the elections on Sunday. 
According to Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, who ensures prosperity and stability, while from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by illegalities committed during the counting of votes. 
The OSCE, sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the election. 
Although the transfer of 110 people in this country of 10 million people is going really well opposition for many decades, before the election, the opposition between its forces under the name of United democratic forces (odsz) was seriously that Lukashenko, renewing his term as president for the fourth time in questionable elections, on the traces of the amendment to the Constitution in 2006, "would" this time the presence of some members of the opposition in Parliament. 
In this way, the odsz has waived his boycotts originally intended. 
The fact that Belarus, financially dependent on Russia ’ s increasingly, would like to improve its relationship with the EU, where because of the political Belarus qualified undemocratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive entry visa, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus has to take a credit due to the decline in imports of Russian natural gas, always more expensive, and a contributing to the passage of society beltransgaz, owner of conduits of gas passing through the country, in the hands of Russians. 
The fact that the OSCE, in the evaluation of the campaign, focused on the positive changes rather than on shortcomings, such as the ban to run for a third of candidates to the opposition, referred to a prior. 
However, the release of the OSCE Monday was already the campaign, during which the bulk of candidates to the opposition could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present at the counting of votes. 
Despite all this, the opposition is still an improvement seen in the political system: the political detainees have found freedom, and Minsk is ready to small confrontations with Moscow, always in refusing to recognize South Ossetia and the abazzia separated from Georgia. Or, Russia with which the Belarus form a confederation on paper, considers the two independent territories for a month. 
"We made two steps forward, and a step backwards, but most important is that the dialogue has begun between Belarus and the EU", said Alexander Milinkevich to our newspaper. 
According to the opposition candidate for the presidential election in 2006, it is desirable that it is so, although "the power was afraid in Parliament which has no weight, to get even a single opponent". 
The opposition does not provide for shares of protests in light of the results. She tries to send his message on the need for economic reforms with voters. 
"of course, we have a lot of problems in this regard: We need to print our newspapers opponents in Russia, local authorities have gotten in the way for what is in circulation, but I can see also that they are increasingly to support the elections, even in the circle of older people" - said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that in the current system of Lukashenko, who considers social security as its principal outcome, the layer of pensioners most supported officially considered plus vraiment as appropriate. 
"Because of the country's debt and the increase in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, ` the silence of a cemetery ', is not only a question of time" - estimated Milinkevich. 
Unlike politician of the opposition, the Russian observers described the democratic elections. 
Sergei Lebedev, leading the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in deeds.". In this way, the absence of the opposition is that the maturity of Belarus voters. 
Brunetta: "from today, breakfast before the work". 
Never in the history of the Palais Chigi had revolving doors, not for the entry and exit of employees. 
But from ‘ today, is in force this new measure against small committee, pointing and will then drink coffee to bar during working hours. 
The novelty anti loafers has been presented today by the Minister of public administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the secretary general of the Council, Mauro masi. 
"The doors tournantes- tells brunetta- are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more than attendance and more services" says the minister. 
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency. 
"It is the reform" also emphasizes Brunetta. 
The facility in all of the presidency of the Council is complete with the palace Chigi. 
According to masi, "the revolving doors is important even from a point of view. 
No resistance from employees were registered, assure the Secretary General: "It is a process shared by employees, and we had the cooperation of all". 
In short, plus breakfast during working hours; more coffee or growing. 
Promise of Brunetta, which suggests with a smile, "a good cappuccino at 7 in the morning is an excellent and safe resolution". 
At a conference at the higher school of public administration 
In Rome, the minister communique that "‘ in three months, the absences of public employees were reduced by 50%, or 60milles workers in a year". 
And he added that he is essential to make more efficient, public administration. 
Italian, "the dynamic salariales- says the ministre- these 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and well above the rate of inflation. 
At the same time, thousands of state employees, have united to challenge the standards of order Brunetta making use in codacons. 
"While the minister of the public service implemented today data about the decline of absenteeism in the workplace to cause - the author of the Association of consommateurs- people" loafers assets" continues to grow. 
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of employees of public administration correct and productive, gathered to declare war on the standards illegitimate contained in the order. 
In particular, the tar, on the exclusion of additional allocations in case by infirmity due to service; the extension of the schedules of permanent home of sick worker, during which are made visits to control, as well as other aspects of the new provisions intended by the minister. 
Accidents on the workplace, Napolitano: "crucial" 
Each day, Italy, there are 2,500 accidents, 3 dead and 27 people who remain permanently disabled. 
In 2007, the inail confirm that the dead white were about 1,200. 
Figures reflect the seriousness of the problem that remains one of the leading causes of death, and almost twice more deaths than the killings. 
To have the attention of institutions, social forces and ways to information on this aspect drama, the anmil famous today, in all provinces Italian, the 58th national day of victims of accidents on the work, which the second Sunday in October. 
"data released by the anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirmed the importance of prevention in the workplace," says the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of the anmil, National Association of maimed and invalides du Travail, Pietro mercandelli. 
The head of state expresses" sincere appreciation for the ongoing effort community in favour of prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to families of the victims and awareness of public opinion" 
"Naturally outraged, everyone hit the blitz to put an end to such tragedies that, by their size, have the clamour of the media and the participation of public opinion, even if the daily reality presents the case drama, even repetitive in their dynamic. 
Napolitano has made no secret that "there is certainly a problem of resources: it is essential to invest in training and information" 
Many initiatives promoted in the education sector, have particular importance for a greater awareness of the young people entering the world of work. 
It is our duty, to maintain the attention to this phenomenon, not be the alarm on the severity social, and improve standards legislation. 
For its part, the speaker of the House Gianfranco Fini said in how much" this phenomenon of dead white is an emergency social absolute, who insult the conscience of each of us, and requires all institutions, to make a conscious effort to end quickly". 
The injured data on the work seem to report a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of dead white is still impressive," said later the chairman of the anmil Pietro mercandelli. 
"We do not want this "tend to discount" will result in fact, in a minor attention because it is precisely when attention is relaxed, that the tragedy. 
"We believe that in general, it is not enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done through multiple actions." 
"According to do pointed out mercandelli- more controls and inspections are needed, as well as a more important on the training of workers, and this, at school." 
- it has ajouté- "that needs to be done to an effort in regard to the communication and awareness of public opinion. 
"But the more important, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers face to a social phenomenon that is an emergency." 
"mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of conditions to save the allowance for the victims of work" and the drift of assistance that the system is moving in recent years". 
"The objective, therefore, is to restore the insurance – he ajouté- so that the fate of that has an accident, should not depend on the spontanéisme or the enlargement of the legislator" 
MP3 players pointing the finger, they risk the hearing. 
Listening to music at full volume for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as MP3 players, can cause permanent damage to the hearing. 
This is what announces the European Commission, which, in a news release issued in Brussels, cite the opinion of the scientific Committee, on unexpected and recently identified health risks (csrseri) of the EU, published today. 
"This report scientifique- we read in the note- it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music at full volume using portable music devices, for more than one hour per day per week, are a permanent loss of hearing." 
"I am concerned that such a high number of young people who use frequently portable music devices and mobile phones at full volume, can unconsciously their audition in irreparable damage" says Meglena Kuneva. 
"According to data scientifiques- continued the 2003 there is a clear risk and we have to respond quickly. 
What matters most is to educate consumers and make the information public. 
We need to review in addition, existing control systems in the scientific opinion, so that they are totally effective and can follow the new technologies" 
Brussels has asked the independent scientific Committee, to examine the problem, given the extensive use of portable music devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise that they generate. 
"The scientifiques-conclue the executive 2003 confirm that there are good reasons for worry, and that the European Commission will now with the Member States and other interested parties, what steps might be taken to better protect children and teenagers, from exposure to noise of portable music devices and similar devices. 
There is already a European standard of safety that limits the level of noise portable music devices to 100db, but the concern is growing about the damage hearing that could stem from excessive exposure to such noise sources. 
It is possible to restrict these data use solutions such as the reduced levels and the length of exposure to noise. 
The EU Scientific Committee noted that users of portable music devices, who listens to music at full volume (over 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the limits currently in force on the level of noise maximum agreed on the workplace. 
Those who listen to music in such conditions for extended periods of time, are a permanent loss of hearing after 5 years. 
This is 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to around 2.5 and 10 million people in the E.U. 
Rome, Alemanno gave the order to start the Commission on the future of the capital. 
Today we begin, in March, concludes in June we will take the money. 
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the Commission on the future of Rome capital", which took place this morning, the new headquarters, behind the baths of caracalla. 
In six months, the President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other components of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome. 
In March when they have completed, the committee and the Municipal Council will assess the analyses and projects, to present in June, the strategic plan for Rome with the official" stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno. 
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all the political, social and cultural ideas are représentées- emphasizes alemanno- it will propose ideas of development of Rome that can be used policy makers, which remain the committee and the local council. 
No possibility of roles, but only the desire to have a corner develop a grand project in Rome. 
In March, it will have finished its work and then disappear, as this experience must have a specific time period. 
In juin-annonce the maire- we will strategic plan from work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome capital." 
For those who accuse the Commission to be unnecessary, given that his opinions are binding, Alemanno said: "Everything depends on the work that the commission will be able to do, and the quality of its proposals. 
If there is quality, as in France with the Commission Attali, as elsewhere in Rome, I am on, his contribution will be crucial. 
Too often the policy is overwhelmed by the day-to-day management of emergency and that occur from time to time. 
We, on the contrary, we want to see, and later, to a prospective deeper, working seriously to the development of Rome and its future." 
In addition, the mayor of Rome emphasizes that "this is not a body unnecessary or a whole bureaucratic: it is absolutely free, and does not cost a euro to urban Roman, and will be used to study and engaging the best minds that express the capital. 
For Alemanno, in effect, "there is a draft strategic reference, or farm or immobile, in order to allow our city, to improve, they absolutely need, while about his future now a spirit unit, ". 
A future that, says the mayor of Rome, "is not the usual local borders, but which will further" not only in the context of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of capital, but" also compared with the role that Rome can and must have, as capital of Europe and the Mediterranean". 
Obama? the first anti-American President. That's why. 
A famous American politician who would like to spend for independent, wrote: "barack obama will be the second President anti-American. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, in its decisions, destroyed the economy USA and reports (as he has always today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam." 
The attacks on obama as the date of the election approaches. 
A woman in Miami has written on a Web site: "This person is full of ambition". 
Obama is really culotté: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation that has in all, two governors and five senators black!" 
In reality, it is of attacks that are not grand thing; this is obviously racial attacks of nature, and do not respond to the question of all voters: it will be a good president? We also all surveys, which reported that obama wins and with a good advantage. 
In this case, it is still of someone who speak from the heart and not with the brain. 
A Mississippi newspaper, in the depths of the southern United States, wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know who the U.S. Patriot will give his vote. 
So emerged a aspect of the American kept secret until the end. 
"say what you want, we will we even to put the cross, on obama or McCain. 
There are even people who profess: if obama wins, we will be leaving the United States. 
Things never revealed until now, to the point that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain. 
In any way, despite all these considerations, winning for the Democrats is George Bush. 
1500 people asked: What were the errors made by Bush during his term? 89 percent responded: Iraq. 
The change America. 
In Vietnam, the nation has lost 50 miles soldiers and was sent home by the buttocks. 
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers have lost their lives, and the Americans have not been forced to make the suitcases. 
Despite this, Iraq has been, for most, the point of weakness of Bush. 
Who will take the place of George W will be a huge task to do. 
USA, the economic turmoil is evident even among journalists: in the press, it is the time deletions. And many are Internet, this" assassine" of newsprint. 
Five hundred American journalists have been affected by the Pew Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future. 
Well, almost all journalists are now pessimistic about their future. 
However, they have not reported openly to attachés information, feel less worried about credibility. 
They do not feel isolated as in the past. 
The problem of American journalists, it is money, the money. 
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of economic model destroyed. 
In addition, deletions in the newsroom, in the room where the writers work on the assemblage of newspapers, are a major problem. 
It is an issue that must be resolved, according to the journalists interviewed, if one wishes to that traditional journalism as the general public to be reduced in any meaningful way. 
A clear but complex pessimism invaded the American journalism. 
Six in ten seniors executives and journalists of newspapers are convinced that the journalism at the national level is in the process of completing a bad way. 
Locally, the executive group is to 65%. 
Printed publication broadcast. 
Journalists did not hurt to see where the web. 
Most major publishers to spawn a passage to the Internet, seen by many as the assassin" of newsprint. 
The "economic pressure" that feel journalists is increased at 79%. 
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to the technology hoping that it "do something good" for their journalism. 
Today, the breach the largest in U.S. journalism lies between who run the newsrooms- i.e. the directeurs- and reporters who work for them. 
56% of directors at national level, are convinced that the reporters shared their values, while at the local level, this percentage descend to 23%. 
For some, this is related to the "safety of work". 
Directors who think lose their position in the space of three years, were 47% at national level. 
As far as journalists, we are going to 30%. 
The "safe" work at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda. 
Only 13% of journalists work under contract. 
In a nation immense as the United States, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly became a question of take it or leave it. 
Directors receive almost always big salaries, while the editor can earn 10mille dollars per month, besides retirement and the insurance payment. 
For the holidays, the logic is complicated: X days after the first year, X days after the third, up to 15 days in all, spent a number of years. 
But, according to their revelations, the American journalists, are often "sick" during the year. 
It is the fault of the climate. 
Unipol: tribunal Rome, danilo coppola is a grottaferrata. 
The President of the second criminal section of the Court of Rome, Carmelo rinaudo, decided to reject the instance of the real estate agent, danilo coppola, who had been asked to leave his city, grottaferrata, for a unit in Rome. 
. Coppola is being investigated for war in the framework of the instruction on the unipol-bnl. 
At the trial in his charge, last week, he had obtained the release residential converted into a residence to grottaferrata. 
His lawyers, Michele gentiloni and Gaetano pecorella, had requested that the real estate agent can browse the provincial town to a house in the capital. 
According to the tribunal, such travel (that the PM has not granted) would influence his company and have access to evidence that charged. 
The elites in danger. 
The phenomenon had already shown there a few days, with the vote in the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion rescue plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans was, and still is, more interested in punishing Wall Street to save the American economy. 
And this is the New York Times yesterday that confirms this communicating that the current crisis dividing the Republican Party, more shared between his day soul East Coast, moderate, favorable to federal institutions as well as the business community, and his new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to those of Washington" and the world of the powerful Finance, mainly in the states of central and southern. 
The soul, precisely, who has made a despotic impact with the vote as I said at the beginning. 
However this is being cited is just one example of the changes, major economic changes that the earthquake in over monetary or have already run: not only in the United States, but across the West, and can be not only here. 
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis appears to be accelerating the phenomena incubated for some time, to the point that, in the new climate, they solidify and more. 
The first of these phenomena is the review, the extraordinary revival, the double category etat- sovereign, compared to a kind of renationalisation of the economy. 
The crisis, is a crisis of bancaires-financières institutions that have, of course, close links with the foreign, but, above all, large scale are involved, the balance sheets of individuals and families who live in one country, in one state. 
This creates a political problem for which the government: that is to say as meet the challenges and the protests of individuals and families who are also a electorate. 
In short, the crisis is economically world but politically, it is almost that national here. 
Internationalisation policy seems to really out or did little to say: the evidence is provided by the European Union which shared, as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, arrive to decide no common political line. 
And so is the government of each state that all waiting for the interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and especially the affection of appropriations: when is a difficult period, there is that states that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources can try to put things in place. 
They also have the means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of inestimable value, in which no market or international organisation will never have similarly. 
This new emphasis of the crisis nation-state is in perfect harmony with the importance always major that the more recent economic developments of the economy tend to attribute to a factor enough linked to this element: territoriality. 
. Ironically, while we were confident that entered the realm of the network, always more sophisticated technology, not equipment, convinced that the finance global was intended to dominate the world, we realised a coup for one, that our future must address its accounts still more with the pretty little material such as water, crops, the oil. 
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth, but who are absolutely linked to a space, a territory. 
As well, which is sovereign, has certainly more cards that is not, i.e., that has the misfortune of living in a place without harvest, oil and water. 
I now turn to the second novelty, but provides a fracture. 
Qui dit territory, state, government, inevitably said, and therefore leadership. 
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena. 
On one side, the conscience of need objective of authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who can take control of the situation. 
On the other side, a wave of disrepute to the existing leaderships, economic species that have proved to be inadequate and full of area of shadow. 
And in addition, something deeper, in a certain sense, even worrying: a discredit, suffering, an image of mismatch, a sense of distance that tend to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of countries in the West. 
And further the conviction of various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of social elites until now at their peak, the way to listen and be, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to always be more foreign to the views of majorities. 
In short, the application of leadership, is underground, a powerful and branched délégitimassions movement of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which occur in the election" protests" ad or, in collective mood changes at the same time last time, from the conservative ascent in Austria Bavaria, in the fall of Labour in Great Britain, to the way Americans against Bush (and it may well be that the victory of the right in Italy did not arrive by chance). 
On a the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, newspapers, their intellectual accredited, their format, like someone, have always more difficult, which is not today, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis builds, increases and stirs up potentially disproportionate manner. 
In view of all this, talk of a "current rebellion of the masses" to the order of the day, seems plainly exaggerated. 
But it said well, keep your eyes open, it is not without reason. 
The supercolle to walk on the walls. 
Breaking the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and, in the future, walk on the wall as spiderman. 
That is the objective of various American research centres, and today, a team of four institutes is almost succeeds. 
With an adhesive was just 2.5 centimeters Square, the researchers were able to maintain "a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall. 
The etude- the American Journal science published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, in akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the air force research laboratory. 
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular structure, called Nano carbon tubes. 
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes set up as a pile of spaghetti." said zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
Scientists are inspired by the legs of geckos, covered in microscopic hairs that provide adherent to the animal, a perfect. 
Tests conducted on various materials, such as glass, the teflon, and the paper glass, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it is "easily detached from the Wall" said liming Dai, researcher at the faculty of engineering at the University of Dayton. 
Walk on the walls? – "this material could be used as temporary adhesive" said liming Dai. 
May be to walk on the wall as spiderman? may be that yes, but researchers think to use much less fascinating as the connection between electronic devices, given that the Nano carbon tubes are drivers of heat and electricity. 
Other applications could be aerospace engineering. 
For the moment, no super hero. 
The other research and the University of California at Berkeley, devoted too, in search of a new adhesive. 
In an article in the journal American American Chemical Society, California researchers presented an adhesive that (as hair, Auto cleans dust during the movement on an area to ensure a perfect and constant adherence. 
Drugs: never with fruit juices. 
Attention in grapefruit, Orange and apple juice. 
These drinks, consumed primarily summer because désaltérantes and rich in vitamins, if associated with some life-saving medicines, affects the absorbement increasing or decreasing in the case, their effectiveness, with the same serious health consequences. 
David nailey, a professor at the University of Western ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juice that they are, canned or, if costs associated with the ingestion of some drugs; during the 236ème national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launched a new alarm: it is a glass of grapefruit, Orange and apple juice, to reduce the absorbement of some life-saving medicines, cancelling their beneficial effects and putting at risk the health of patients. 
Grapefruit juice has been strongly criticized because held responsible to increase the effects of some medication arrhythmic, antibiotics, anxiolytics, Anti stamen and neurological, up to toxic levels. 
Drugs a risk - it is the Italian agency of the drug itself, which gave the new in a newsletter dated two years, alerting doctors and patients not to be the danger arising from this mix and to pay attention to what you drink, if we take medication for example, diazepam or methadone. 
Not that the pamplemousse- according to the experts, even the orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit the drugs. 
Long is the list of ingredients inhibited by the grapefruit and other juice. 
De là, Michele carruba, director of the Department of pharmacology at the University of Milan: "These findings are in general, immediately reported to various national and international agencies of drugs that will need to, change the briefing notes of drugs. 
It should always be read the papers illustrative of drugs you take, and if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but speak clearly to the doctor or pharmacist" stressed the expert at the agency Ansa. 
The Nobel economics at Paul krugman. 
The Nobel Prize for Economics was attributed to the American Paul krugman for his research on models of commerce and on the location of economic activity. 
Krugman, 55, is a néo-keynésien who teaches at princeton University and it is also a famous columnist for The New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the largest critiques of solutions in economics and foreign policy of the Bush administration. 
A few months after the 11 September 2001 attacks, during the days of the collapse of Enron, krugman wrote in an article published in The New York Times, that the second event would have been more critical than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States. 
A forecast that release of many controversial, and who was alleged to the economist for years, but now proved to be accurate. 
"I am surprised and even a little shocked the speed with which the memories of the scandals such as the collapse of Enron or WorldCom, have disappeared from the public" said krugman at the end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the executive committee of the European Central Bank, krugman is a "economist of great value", but also a whistleblower in style" very aggressive, especially critical of the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration. 
Open office, this is the third edition of the package "anti-microsoft" 
It is the day of the release of openoffice.org.3.0, the open source of personal productivity that aims to touch is still more users, the House in office, professionals and the public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office. 
Following a work of almost a year, directed by developers volunteers, monitored by sun microsystem, the new package open office is in public with something new: the welcome screen, and the interface and become less austere, to other more important, as the compatibility born to the system operational apple Mac os x, and the support for the new format odf (open document format) 1.2, the last version standard ISO. 
Open office a particular attention to the interaction with Office 2007, and it is possible to open the documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.) 
Also interesting, certain specific functions modules, as one which allows to reduce the size of powerpoint presentations, for example, to send them by e-mail, or to import pdf file in the module of development chart, the original aspect of the page. 
Always on this front, it is possible to create "pdf hybrids" that unite the chart typical of adobe to elements of a spreadsheet or a development of text. 
Collaboration between several people is something which has had various improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on the amendments, in the development of texts, because every employee is given a color commentary for more recognition under review. 
Some companies are even working to bring certain functions of openoffice on the web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the next few weeks, they should issue the final result. 
The Italian version is déchargeable at http: / / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.htmlet and adds to the English version that was on the mirror since Friday. 
In addition to windows and Mac os, the result is as usual available in addition to the operational Linux system. 
Upon request, the CD installation can be sent to home or on the workplace. 
And if the theme of the free can be a way for the diffuser in homes, it was precisely in the business, that open office is the Grand Challenge, which already rely on various projects in public administration and schools. 
Without the realities that offer a service training, consultation and assistance, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open to prospective business. 
Open office consists of five main modules: writer, for the video writing equivalent of word; calc, is a spreadsheet that aims to replace excel; impress, for rival powerpoint presentations; dbase, such as the famous access, is the programme, working on the databases; finally drwa is the chart. 
Target for 2008, arrive at 5 million download, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, on may even exceed the number expected 
Kohl also, is positive, it is the fourth case of doping. 
New cases of positivity in last Tour de France: it is the Austrian team gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and maillot winner of the best climber. 
It is the site of the team that reported the new. 
A 26ans, Kohl is the fourth cyclist positive for cera, the third-generation EPO, after the Italian Riccardo riccò and Leonardo piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of gerolsteiner. 
Blood tests carried out on the Kohl tubes are part of those achieved in recent weeks, by the laboratory in Lausanne and chatenay-malabry. 
If the analyses confirm the positivity in cera, the Austrian will lose its third place in the Tour and will necessarily expect two years of elimination. 
News of the positivity Kohl's to the third-generation EPO, was confirmed by the head of the French agency anti doping, Pierre bordry, which provided to The Associated Press, have notified the positivity to Austrian authorities. 
The Austrian 26ans was placed on the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos sastre and the American cadel Evans, winning the maillot peas for the best climber. 
Immigrants: New York Times wonders if Italy is racist? 
Italy "as a country of migrants has recently transformed into a destination for immigrants" with reluctance. 
This transformerait-il Le beau pays into a nation of racist? that ’ s what has intéroge the New York Times who has dedicated a long article discussing the topic of racism in Italy, based on the case of the young Abdul William guibre, from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of biscuits. 
This case highlights what the New York Times defined as the North "paradox": northern regions are both those where there has been" more integration and more work", but also a sense Hungary the strongest of the country and the most important support to the Lega Nord" 
To confirm the growing tension between Italian and immigrants, the nyt has also refers to episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parma, Rome ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
Not only. 
Even the new legislature required by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal, is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy. 
Trend underlined by the pope as well as by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano during his meeting with Benedict XVI in October, has requested that the state and the church are working together to overcome racism." 
Students victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros for a house. 
The market for students is unaware of crisis 
According to the latest survey of sunia, the union tenants, rent a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euro in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome. 
"The phenomenon has now reached aspects of very serious to point to exclude entire categories of young, right to the study because of high overall costs that families from must soutenir- said the head of the office of studies of sunia, Laura mariani- in these cities, the strong demand from students so distorted the market that an increase was amorcémême for residents. 
In most cases, the location offers also includes a series of violations: free contracts, not registered, without limit of rent, subleases. 
For the sunia, extraordinary interventions by the revision of the taxation, are needed to calm prices. 
Reading in detail the investigation, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the area brianza, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, moving 650 euros minimum (zone band nere), at an average value of 800 (lambiate area, udine, and fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (zone Vittoria) 
A Florence, a bed costs on average, 350 / 400 euros, a house about 700 euros. 
A Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the university, he is 250 / 280 euros for a bed in a double, and 370 to 500 for a single room. 
In Rome, in areas close to the universities central (San Lorenzo, piazza Bologna), asked about 600 euros for a simple, 450 for a bed in a double. 
Slightly lower values (550 euro for a simple) for the areas close to other universities (ostiense and cinecittà). 
It can not save that if you away in the outlying areas: 300 euro to a bed, and 450 for a simple in the area predestina, centocelle or similar. 
A Naples, for a lit it is 300 / 400 euros, for a simple, on expenditure of 400 to 600 euros, with rates highest in the zones policlinico, vomero, and Colli aminei. 
A Bari, in bed, it takes 250 / 350 euros, at least 350 for a simple. 
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a major importance in the city economy. 
Finally, cities such as perugia, in which the locations are often taken by students extra community, there has been a further anomaly: the rent for foreign students is increased by 25 / 30% compared to that applied to the Italians. 
Farewell old cinema paradiso, cities éliment the rooms. 
Movie historic ferment in favour of multiplex. 
"a city with no movie theatres is a city blind, it is like a face without eyes" 
The image provided by the director Giuseppe tornatore, illustrates what is happening in large urban centres, but also in the cities of province, 
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth outside of major multisalles, and the death of consumption of mono rooms in the core areas of cities, is a major event which is inescapable and incontestable; he plus all the characteristics of a true crime. 
A disappear, they are often historic sites and responsible for memory, "it is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone that you know, with which we shared a bout and so many emotions" observe the director of Italian cinema paradiso, film that offers tornatore there 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of the Cannes jury duty, and who represented the poetry of a province, and the nostalgia of a way of life cinema, can be lost forever. 
Figures provided by ANEC, the main association of traders, want to say: over the past five years, 316 cinemas in traditional have closed, and the rooms are major cities who have paid the fees: 10 fewer in Florence, 9 in Milan, Rome and Naples, Bologna, 6 in less in Turin, 5 in Palermo. 
Among the areas most affected by the closure, the Roman Emilie leads with 82 theatres mono salles lost, followed by the Tuscany (44) and the Lombardy (41). 
The evidence that t confirms that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, because these are the three Italian regions which have registered more than new theatres multisalles: 195 screens in more in Lombardy over the last five years, 81 in Tuscany as Abbey. 
"The Italian operation has been irrational" observe Paolo protti, President of the ANEC, "it is useful to build new structures, but it would still be necessary to ensure the survival of those that already exist, because when a room farm in a city, these fréquenteurs are not necessarily all willing to go to the multiplex. 
Without talking about the deliberation missed credit in favour of traders: antecedent debt of the state is approximately 10 million euros. 
It is a disgrace that, from a point of view ethical and moral, the government does not comply with the law. 
To support the sector, it should be between 16 and 18 million euros per year. 
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about these closures, decided to resolve the situation through the signing of a memorandum between city hall and ANEC, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote the theatres mono rooms of historic centres and the surrounding area. 
Among the normative planned, there are measures of tax benefits in favour of managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be allowed to enter the area to traffic limited, and will have special rates for parking lots and in some areas. 
"It is an initiative that I want" observe Giuseppe tornatore "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna with other measures. 
It is clear that, in contrast the super power of multiplex, the traditional must also improve the quality of the son and the image, as the public today is more demand. 
Defence of traditional film is a theme that for me, has always been important: the closure of supercinema bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "new cinema paradiso" which I thought already for 10 years. 
I live in Rome for 25 years, and when I go to the rialto, or the October via Nazionale, now closed, where I have lived for mixed emotions, I turn to the other side not to see these panels by the dust. 
Links between politics and ‘ ndrangheta, arrested mayor of gioia tauro. 
"The mayor of gioia tauro was willing to standardize the choice of the city to the interests of the clan piromalli." 
De Lourdes accusations are launched by the Anti-Mafia judges of the direction of Calabria, to the mayor and the vice mayor of gioia tauro, Giorgio dal torrione, as well as rosario schiavione, and the mayor of rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning to competition for Mafia Association. 
The levers for gioacchino piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the government, and his grandson lawyer, namesake of the boss, already convicted criminals of Mafia Association, as well as to pay 10 million euros. 
"an affront to the normative legal and moral, and especially of common sense" write prosecutors, both local authorities had expressed willingness to pay consultations to master piromalli. 
"It would have been given the clan -écrivent the juges- officially inside the halls facilitating opportunities, already considerable, control and orientement of public administration" 
The President of the regional Committee even agazio loiero, has made no secret that "collusion between the local committees and organised crime, there are more than one" in its region: "There are areas where the Mafia is stronger than in others, where the collusion is almost inevitable. 
But there is also a lot of politicians who resist pressure from the ndrangheta, heroes who are honest" 
The arrests this morning after those last July, following which the police announced that, decapitated, occupies the foreground the clan piromalli. 
At the end of April, the municipal council of gioia tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and always due to alleged co-operation between organized crime and the local government, local politicians had been discharged their service to administer the city. 
Giorgio dal torrione, mayor of the udc at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed leader of a coalition of centre right, after the run-off elections in May 2006. 
He loudly when the scandal prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council. 
He accused the vice Interior Minister at the time, Marco minniti, accusing him of having manigancé for a political question, but given the application of incarceration signed this morning, the judges explained that the clan piromalli had even managed to request the variation of the A3. 
From interceptions ordered against dal torrione, the PM write, emerged the availability to marry the requirements of a businessman, representing a group best known, close to the piromalli, standardizing the choice of public administration to the interests of clan. 
When energy was born waves, now the big move. 
This is a deposit disproportionate that accounts for more than 70% of the planet and now the world energy companies are in the process of discovering. 
Waves, currents, tides, this is the new renewable sources on which the giants such as Chevron asked the eyes, and now trying to put the hand. 
The opportunity to get energy from the movements of the sea is as now hundred years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, the research intensified. 
When the price of oil fell, to 1980, the idea of harnessing energy marine was set aside, but now the instances environmentalists and the new increase in the oil sector give a major boost to 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London said in 2007, 15% of the global need electricity could be covered by operating systems swell. 
This amount would be double that produced nuclear power plants. 
And in addition, there would be currents and tides. 
Giants in the attack. 
The first company to build on the marine energy was the enersis, which in 2005, a siglé an agreement to build a facility in northern Portugal. 
When the agreement was announced, it was a true revolutionary. 
A two years ago, always more candidates among these companies has always doomed to traditional energy focus on marine energy. 
"Chevron is currently studying the technologies on energy océanique- said the voice of a company associated with the colossus American tanker, the economic daily Wall Street journal- and evaluating opportunities to cooperate with us". 
Cooperation in question, is obtaining a deliberate licence by the U.S. Commission for energy necessary to give rise to a marine energy project in Alaska. 
This is a very interesting signal, especially if one considers that in Alaska, the United States continues to extract oil, and President Bush has put in place a project for new excavations 
In addition to Chevron, Il y a verdant power Inc. New York and ocean power of New Jersey, along the path of the energy from the sea, and investment until today, although their details are known, according to observers, a growing interest. 
Detailed to point. 
Experts speak of a technology still in its infancy, part of the fact that energy Navy does not move the fears of the impact environmentalist. 
A current systems, such as those of Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small, and do not seem to create big problem to the ecosystem. 
To produce energy on a large scale, however, requires the use of technology with an environmental impact. 
"and the choices are different: ocean power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other. 
The surge of waves, which makes sludge to the top and bottom, is converted into a hydraulic pressure the pistons and cylinders inside the floats. 
The pressure turns a turbine, which in turn feeds a generator. 
Energy is sent to the bank through the submarine cables. 
For the moment, we have four systems of this kind in phase, pending a single federal approval and a part of energy could be used to a military facility. 
Verdant power, to the contrary, already produces energy for a commercial centre and a parking using six turbines under Marines of the East River in New York. 
The movement of water at the tides, turn the blades of turbines, creating a rotational movement that feeds a generator. 
Verdant announced that he had a long list of customers waiting authorizations to draw energy. 
After the waves, tides. 
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for Research of electrical energy, at this time, the potential of the tides. 
Although it is a phenomenon intermittent, the tide is more predictable wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable source of energy. 
And it is precisely on the power of the tides that states such as New York, maine and Alaska, with other, look to the coast, have invested $7 million and a half in 2008 and provides for investments up to 35 million in 2009.
