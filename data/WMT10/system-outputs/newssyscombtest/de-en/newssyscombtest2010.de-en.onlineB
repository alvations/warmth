Lack of snow on the mountains, the hotel owner tortured
Scneelose slopes make not only the giant mountains Sorgenn-residents.
The lack of snow discourages people from ordering the Lipno hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, one can get in the Giant Mountains is still availability for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, determine the prices, but now they are afraid to order binding.
And if they ask to call us immediately if we believe will be after this year's Christmas in the snow or slush on, the operator of the leading information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura on.
Who the New Year's stay in the spindle mill just wants to go to his ideas, should not hesitate with the order.
Those who prefer to save and where is the quality of the stay only in second place, who may try to wait another few days.
The spindle mill hotel owners are now offering New Year's Eve mainly just for the weekend stay.
I think that they will strive for a time, sell them, but then also have to give them, and respond to shorter times.
And then the free room quickly disappear, estimated Jandura.
Available Beds in all winter dates still offers always the travel agent also Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now, we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is now not sold out.
In our offer about half of the seats are still available.
So we've already prepared some expensive Christmas holidays for the last moment, which led the director of the travel agent Ingtours, Petr Schiefert on.
The New Year's Eve in Giant Mountains Vrchlabi can offer travel agent too, but here there are fewer free seats.
Good sales will also find the first fortnight in February, the rest of the winter events are on average sold.
This year the interest for the winter holidays is negatively influenced by the fact that in the Giant Mountains is still no snow.
The people are waiting to see whether the snow falls.
Nobody wants to spend the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes have snow within a week will also be sold out Christmas, says Schiefert.
Conversely, and somewhat better than in the past year it manages to occupy the rooms in Hotel Horizon in Pecpod Snezkou too.
We are about five percent better than last year.
On New Year's Eve and Christmas, we only have a few spare rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holiday in Janua, and in February, the business is well run, informed the director of the Pec-best hotels, Karel Rada.
To 80 percent for the New Year holidays, the hotel also Omnia is occupied in the central parking Janske Lazne.
On the other hand remains to Christmas in the newest hotel in Janske Lazne still free half of the beds.
Pleasantly surprised us this year in January, for which we are occupied at the time had about 60 percent.
A bit weaker now in February, but the moment when the snow comes, also increases the interest intended to stay in the Giant Mountains, led by the Director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch on.
On a larger snow mess the Giant Mountains-Hotel owners now wait.
On Thursday, it should cool off and if there is rainfall, which should be on the mountains of snow.
But then will come back a warming, informed Jiri Jakubský from the site of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It's almost comical, with which Schülerstrebsamkeit Barack Obama, the president and his call of the brightest, the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan question repeatedly, which he himself believed to be the dumbest.
When he finally his eagerly awaited in Afghanistan ausschwitzte doctrine, it became apparent that he had copied out on the copy paper from the bush-Iraq Szenariovor three years.
Not only that, in the text itself several times the phrase "as in Iraq" is used, he even has the name used by the Bush Declaration in January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "A new forward path, without hesitation.
He has criticized himself three years ago, the Bush idea - fresh contingents of troops to send out by the civil war-stricken Iraq - as "irresponsible and in its consequences karastrophische decision."
Subsequent months, but showed that the recommendations emanating from the Bush military strategy, the only possible and so far has been very successful that today on the news about Iraq, no longer speaks.
The reputation was not improved by Bush, because he is objectively a much more grateful to his successor Neglected baseline than was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama is hoping that the miracle is repeated.
To increase the troop strength, he once again asked the military, especially the chief commander of the Afghanistan operation McCristal General Stanley, who even despite the harsh criticism Subordinationsgewohnheiten hesitant to protect the White House.
He called for 40,000 troops to reverse the situation for the better can.
The President hesitated for three months, but come on no better idea, and he has the General wenistens deceived by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has pressed the promise of 5,000 more, even though he originally expected, with at least 10,000.
Highly problematic in the entire Obama strategy is to withdraw its proposal, the troops already in Afghanistan in 18 months, and complete this process within three years. The whole Obama Doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the increase was halved to bring the same effect as the action in Iraq.
In spite of the fratricidal wars of recent years is the Iraq relatively well-structured society, and its leaders to honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the contra - you can rely on no one and it held no agreements.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, who are used to change every day, their opinion.
The political institutions, even if they have been properly established formally only stay Scheinbauten will flourish behind which the patriarchal strain relations further attention.
The balance of interest between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the complexity of the situation, the Pakistan and Iran, complicating factors even further.
Even the building of a "capable of acting heads of state", which is the minimal goal of the whole operation is very unrealistic.
Time horizon of the Obama strategy alienated by his voluntarism
Over the past eight years, the situation has only deteriorated further in Afghanistan, and now she is on the edge of the explosion.
To believe that the young soldiers who burst into the war-cry about the "Frühheimkehr," creating a miracle here, only a truly romantic soul that facts can not be impressed.
From a policy perspective, the settlement date for the withdrawal of troops pure irresponsibility, because the Taliban will take up the indirect as the confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to take part in the fighting in Afghanistan is low.
Europe's politicians can not and will not explain to their voters, related how the security of Germany or Italy, with the war in the Hindu Kush foothills.
Another possible factor that can radically affect the situation, the development of events in Iran.
Should the situation continue to deteriorate and will not affect the increased sanctions on the Iranians, the result for the United States is a very serious question whether the problem was not solved with troops.
This question must be answered in the period in which America strides after Obama as the winner withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Any solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years remain until the presidential election, and thus have enough time left so he can resort to another strategy fallls this would prove to be catastrophic failure.
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs Prämienboni not receive more in cash
The senior executives of the U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will receive this year Prämienboni no more cash.
Announced by the company, thereby responding to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receive, instead of the money stock, which one may sell, but only in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from the managers in the case when they act overly risky.
Goldman Sachs raises so under the agency Reuters at the forefront of efforts to link the Prämieboni Wall Street with long-term performance.
I think that is conscious of the Wall Street over the further direction in which it has to go, leading the former banker of the Company, JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott, it's.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs made himself the target of criticism after it had laid for the first three quarters of this year nearly 17 billion U.S. dollars for Prämienboni aside.
The overall level of Prämienboni during this Jahra is likely to exceed the agency Reuters, in spite of today's action displayed 20 billion U.S. dollars.
The high Prämienboni in the banking sector at the beginning of the financial crisis in a number of countries have become the hottest political topic.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to use the bonuses of bankers in excess of 25,000 pounds, with a one-time tax charge of 50 percent.
Similar steps are also preparing France.
This year, women have won Nobel Prizes in all subjects, except physics.
Five women have a record today in Stockholm from the hands of Sweden Carl XVI desKönigs. Gustaf, this year's Nobel Prizes in the professional categories, and for literature accepted.
In addition to the four scientists was among the German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, below.
The Nobel Prize in medicine have two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, get together with her compatriot Jack Szostak Chromosonen for research in the area.
The prize for chemistry has received the Israeli Ada Jonath, together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for elucidation of the ribosome structure and function.
The latest laureate awarded the Nobel Prize in economics, have received the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for analysis of the economic report.
The only professional category, was in this year a woman a Nobel Prize, was physics.
Won this price today, the scientists Charles Kao for research in the area of glass fibers and Willard Boyle, George Smith, together with the CCD chip invention, which is the foundation of all Digitalkammeras, fax machines, or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these winners received the diploma and certificate Nobelmedaile the purchase price of money.
The amounts in each category ten million Swedish kronor.
If there are multiple winners in each category, the cash prize shared among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has the most expected this afternoon received the Nobel Peace Prize today in Oslo.
He has acknowledged in his speech the controversial appointment, because he is only beginning his journey, and beyond, is at the head of the country, leading two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In defense of its policy, but he added that wars are necessary in certain situations for the struggle to acquire peace, even if the price for that high.
Minister Janota is considering resignation. Klaus has invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus received early on Friday, Finance Minister Eduard Janota, who is thinking about his continuance in the government, because he with the performance of the state budget for next year in the form in which this has been released by the Assembly of Deputies on Wednesday not to agree .
It is believed that the budget and perhaps the continued presence of Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget has also been criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also deepened the crisis of public finances.
About the meeting briefed the President spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
About his continued stay in his role will Janota on Monday with the prime minister, Jan Fischer, to negotiate.
After the Budget Act, which now receives Klaus for his signature, the Czech Republic should have treated a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
In Parliament, but were voted on Wednesday on the Left Party's proposals on monetary circulation and increases the money for the civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and Direktlöhne of farmers.
The government has relied on the proposals of the Social Democrats that they obscured increase the budget deficit.
Is between the Left Party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and Justice Party, on the other side, thus arose a sharp domestic political controversy, to render a question mark over the future work of Fischer pays official Cabinet on their design, the ODS, CSSD and Green Party have agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget as it was adopted by Parliament, virtually liquidated the package of austerity measures that are enforced by the Fischer-government in the fall, and finish in their view, the national debt is.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget, but need not, said today at the breakfast discussion with the entrepreneurs, that is the politicians, the "serious problem" that "the unsustainable deficit of public finances, have neglected for some time.
In his opinion, there are now no longer a good solution.
An improvement could bring only a strong government that could be used to build more on a broader consensus among the political parties.
The ODS chairman Mirek Topolanek, led to that the budget is terrible, and the government should consider its continued existence.
The ODS-setting chairman Petr Necas, told CTK that the concept of Cabinet officials obviously with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer described in the newsroom similar words as "strong statements".
The CSSD leader Jiri Paroubek, Topolanek reacted to the words-that the budget deficit is horrifying that the former government of Mirek Topolanek had prepared for this year, and exceeds the 200 billion kronor.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD evaluated the approval of the state budget for next year as a success.
The People's Party was satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood movie "Invictus: The unbeaten" in the world shows many of the country, whose struggle and victory, despite some criticisms that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells of sports, race relations and about Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid system of government in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is in its life history, the American actor Oscar, Morgan Freeman, dar.
Freeman said that he was asked by the einundneunzigjährigen Mandela, if he could represent him in the Eastwood film.
Another significant role does Matt Damon.
I told him: "When I play, I need to meet you.
The seventy-two actors, the prize for his role in the Boxbereich Eastwood drama "Million Dollar Baby" received ", has already represented the leaders of the movement for the abolition of slavery, has become of the Finally to slaveholders, a fictional U.S. President, and is also God Almighty in "Evan", but rarely someone who is still alive and is so important to many people like Mandela.
The former South African state man was 27 years for his active work in ending apartheid in the South African Republic in prison.
He was placed in 1990 released undfür four years he was president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is Latin for "unbeaten," and while that's the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, which was published in 1875.
The requirement was, as he spoke to
The film depicts a true story, in which Nelson Mandela his strength with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, merged to unite the country. The new President Mandela knows that his nation remains divided even after apartheid is still racially and economically.
He believes he can unify his people through the sport, so he decides to rugby players, are the world's few outsiders, too.
Finally, the South African team go up in the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman spent several years working to bring the Mandela story on the big screen.
He had no other goal than playing this role in such a way around this as closely as possible closer to reality, "said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, so to speak, as he did.
The actor said that if he would be in the same country and the world leaders, he would try to meet with Mandela, dinner with him at night, and before his speech behind the scenes to be.
The most important thing was for him to shake Mandela's hand.
I've noticed if I shake your hand, I take your energy, it is transmitted, and I had the feeling that I know what you feel, "he said.
For me, it is important to have become a different person.
Matt Damon is in the movie Francois Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team is in the majority were white players.
The actor said that he had six months time to prepare for the role of hard rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I rang the doorbell, he opened the door and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar in my life was: 'In the film, I look much bigger. "
Despite the obvious differences in stature of the actors in comparison to their real role models, he is unbeaten, led by director Eastwood "Invictus," received positive reviews and is also known as prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the paper Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his analysis in the following words: "This was a very good story, very well done film."
In the movie reviews on the Web site rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light disbanded secret about Norway: The Russians have tested a rocket
About Norway a special lighting effect of unknown origin was observed.
The Russian Defense Ministry has admitted just yesterday that near the Norwegian border has been tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The start was again not successful, and as type "Bulava" missile called, which was originally the pride of the Russian army be, will slowly turn into a nightmare of Russian generals and the prime minister, Vladimir Putin will be.
His repeated presence on site at the missile test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava is usually not even started or been damaged in the air.
In the Russian press is already writing about "Bulava" than about a "missile, which does not fly."
A rocket does not fly to, but illuminates
This is already 13th Attempt was normal at the beginning.
Only at the end of the flight are again technical damage occurred at the rocket.
Presumably, the motor exploded in the third rocket stage.
This time started "Bulava" from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij, which went under the water of the White Sea.
This allows the Sounding rockets firing from the submarine.
It is therefore likely that the undefined flying object through a mysterious light caused about NORDWEG actually damaged "Bulava" was.
In addition, the Norwegians have not doubted since the first moment that we are dealing with a Russian rocket.
The Generalitat has protested against this time and claimed that one can not speak clearly of a setback.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fall off and the accident was only the third stage involved.
In the previous cases, like the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Although not a test launch took place without error, holds the leadership of the Defense Ministry, only six out of thirteen for success.
The nearly fifty per success, therefore, the generals met with optimism and will continue to claim that the "Bulava will fly" again without any problems and even to ten hypersonic nuclear warheads weighing a total of max. Contribute 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov signed with 51 years of one years contract with CSKA Moscow
The legendary defender Vjaceslav Fetisov was raised again, with 51 years ago in a professional hockey game.
The former World Champion, Olympic Champion and Stanley Cup holders CSKA Moscow to help his team in trouble, and probably occurs at the Freitagsduel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who is his career of forty years, has been completed in 1998, currently president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We need to clarify a few remaining formalities, the agency quoted the AP Coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
Meanwhile, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will affect only a game.
I think that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morale of other players led to players Nemcinov.
When Fetisov coming back on the ice, he is by AP, the oldest Russian professional hockey game.
In the NHL, the legendary striker Gordie Howe with fifty-one years a whole season has played for Hartford and was zuguteschreiben, 15 hits and 26 assistant.

Hyundai gave in to the unions. All overtime will be abolished
The management of Nosovice-car manufacturer Hyundai reached an agreement with the union on the removal of all overtime.
Because often arranged overtime, the union announced on Monday the strike propensity.
This was confirmed by the spokesman for the Hyundai car factory, Petr Vanek.
The management wants to, but some still with the unions on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, therefore, was posted on Saturday, 19 December, voluntary overtime proposal on the grounds that two working shifts would be worked, "said Vanek.
The site Sedmicka.cz said that the company employees who were working the Saturday shift, a bonus of CZK 400 offered.
Received by employees even after the event for the Saturday shift, 28 November.
Vanek said the company has decided to change the Motivierungsart of staff for the proposed overtime.
Either they get paid the overtime payment or they can substitute for this holiday on 28 December to and prolong the Christmas holiday, which led to Vanek.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift for the fare and lunch to be paid.
Considering the fact is that the overtime was the most urgent and most vital point with regard to demands and grievances of the union, which last week had stopped production, the management decided yesterday afternoon, with immediate effect on the elimination of all overtime for the month of December, which led to Vanek .
The employees of the automobile factory until last week had been forced to work almost every day after the eight-hour shift for 2 extra hours.
From signing the agreement, the strike propensity is revoked by the unions.
WeitereVerhandlungen between the management of the automobile factory and trade unionists to come on Friday afternoon about.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they were ready to lift the strike propensity.
The situation in the automobile factory is last week, intensified on Wednesday when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of constant overtime.
They also protested against poor pay conditions and alleged harassment.
The management did, however, that employees must make the overtime to comply with the automotive supply needs.
The union called for strike in ihremMontags readiness proclamation also that the employees who were suspended last Wednesday, the production, be subject to any penalties.
In the area of overtime, the unions demand, reduce overtime work to a minimum.
Moreover, they demand this year to pay the fee of 5,000 kronor.
The Nosovice Hyundai automobile factory now employs 2,000 people.
The series was launched in the company in November last year.
Until this September about 80,000 vehicles were produced here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works well with 'steeled' HIV virus
The team of Czech and German researchers testing new compounds that are intended to prevent the spread of HIV virus in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved material is that it works even when the viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact prevails against the disadvantage that the connection in the usual virus variants does not so strong as one of the existing drugs.
The disease AIDS can not be cured.
Patients may extend the drug combination but life and prevent the proliferation of HIV virus in the body.
Their revenue is however accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus multiplication has also supported the development sg. Resistentviren result against which no medicine is more effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, from Prague (Chemical-Technological Institute), Prague and by the University of Heidelberg opens the way how to deal with the virus resistance.
They have shown that those marked as Metalokarborane substances act on the protein that is responsible for the increase of HIV Viruses.
The Metalokarborane are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus multiplication in a different way than all currently used drugs, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists go to new 'improved' compounds, which were prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the viral protein.
The Metalokarborane have a unique three-dimensional structure: two vielfächige cages of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and are linked by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Insidious and persistent virus
HIV's protease protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the by the HIV virus causing HIV protease cleavage would occur and no mature infectious virus particles.
If we eliminate the HIV protease, we turn off the replication of the virus in the body of the patient, explain the researchers in the press release was issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Academy of Sciences CR.
The work was published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry Science paper, researchers describe the whole series of connections that are coupled in which two pairs of cages (see table) by a short organic chain, which is then systematically changed further.
Somewhat weaker, but more reliable
The impact of this series of substances against the HIV protease wurdne tested in vitro, even against the persistent (resistant) variants derived from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of Metalokarborane in the normal enzyme variant is not as strong as in the clinically used drugs, but she does not lose its effect on the Resistentvarianten against which the unused drugs are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action as well as its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and possibility of further chemical forms makes the Metalokarboranen interesting links for more on the development of effective drugs directed against HIV Research says Pavlina Řezáčová, Head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute for Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences.
Due to budget dispute. ODS went for Fischer, who defends himself
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "horrible" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider his opinion, their continued existence.
The expression of the ODS, the Prime Minister described as "strong statements".
It can be said of time for analysis.
The ODS deputy chairman Petr Necas, said that the concept of Cabinet officials obviously with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party no longer works.
According to the Prime Minister Necas must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in parliament, if it is to combat the rising deficit, or whether he, at his continuance in office using the parliamentary Left goes.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits is diametrically different, it has pointed Necas.
The Parliament adopted Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, but with the Left Party's amendment proposals on more than 12 billion crowns.
The Parliament has raised the money for state officials' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct payments to farmers.
The government has relied on the proposals while the Social Democrats that they obscured increase the budget deficit.
Czech Republic should economies with a gap of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS has left the hall before the vote, it has fulfilled the wishes of the government, as well as the amended budget is only a less bad version of the provisional budget. Frase not clear
Frustration and futility
The Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, has spoken of his disappointment and a sense of meaninglessness, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer has stated that the government assess the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota would have seriously threatened to resign in the event that the amendment proposals were adopted, the situation would look different.
According to the Czech Television has Janota registered for the Monday after the government business in the Premier.
He has hinted that he thinks his remaining in office.
Reason for this is his disappointment with the Verhandugn budget.
The extent to which fishermen in favor of the continued struggle with the budget deficit, so the Nominanten Necas, in accordance with the Social Democrats (CSSD) who had implemented the changes in the budget to do in the government nothing.
The prime minister should make it clear that he will resign if Parliament continues to deficit-increasing legislation takes affect, for example, the sick pay and pensions, or the Service Amendment Act.
Topolanek: The nominated by ODS ministers not got it wrong
That is the job of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The nominated by the ODS ministers have made no mistakes, Topolanek has highlighted in a text message from the U.S..
It was mentioned that in some ministries in people sitting vice-function, which is committed to agenda 09, which voted against the budget.
Necas said that, if Fischer daru chooses to forego, for the fight against the deficit amount of public finances, "it is entirely logical and correct that it is based on the Left majority, which is currently in Parliament."
Then he allegedly can count on the support and tolerance of the Civic Democrats not.
I have not thought about it, and when it will be up to date, then I'll work on it, said of the Civic Democratic Defense Minister Martin Bartak nominated the journalists in the parliament.
Premier fly fishing in the afternoon on the European Council meeting in Brussels.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Prime Minister
Necas said the same time that the ODS would probably vote in parliament on Wednesday against the revised budget, if the Premier Members of the Civic Democrats would explicitly ask that they allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not come to us as orphans, we are not small children, so he responded to the question whether the ODS was not suppressed in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party leaders in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I have not noticed that my voice would be missing.
Even when I gave up the mandate, I knew it was going to go in coming months, especially at Bolshevization of Parliament and the destruction of everything positive, reacted Topolanek himself
Under the new schedule of the CD (Czech Railways) are driving less features for about the same fare.
Czech Railways stopped or restricted from 13 December some of the less busy fast and local trains and other connections are strengthened, however.
All traffic will be reduced from the scope of validity of the new timetable, compared with today, at two percent.
Most tariffs incl basic and Kundenfahrtarif is not changed.
Multiple connectivity options in the capital, for example, receive the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, the railroad uses for this route of type Pendolino trains.
The express train will not travel to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Fewer trains will travel on the route Prague - Pisek - Ceske Budejovice, in principle, the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad be reduced.
The largest reduction is planning to train in Hradec Kralove (King of Graz), by eight percent, an increase on the other hand can look Prague and its surroundings.
Are repealed and two night trains on the route Prague - Tabor - Ceske Budejovice and on some days a week will reduce the operation of some trains on the route Prague - Pisek - Ceske Budejovice.
One of the biggest changes include the introduction of the new Direktverkehrsweges from Milovice to Prague, currently have the residents of Milovice change in Lysa nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth of the suburban traffic route system Esko, whose opening thanks to the electrification of the railway from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice is possible.
The Fernlangstrecken in the capital will end up in the target station Prague - Central Station.
The CD takes more lines of SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava, and the trains to Sumperk / Jesenik will ride in the time interval of two hours.
The Pendolino passengers can since 13 December will not longer go to Bratislava.
This year's bill for Regionaleisenbahn: increase of 200 million
The trains have been ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, the Railway will receive for a total payment of the so-called loss of liquidity in the next year, four billion crowns, genaus as this year. The local trains serve the districts, in total they pay for it in next year, eight billion crowns, with the State zuschießt three billion.
This year, the regional 200 million Czech crowns are more expensive.
For local trains and express trains, the railway has signed a new ten-year contract, until now, the contract was made only for one year.
The railway praised the system, perhaps she has also not resorted to price rises in the great majority of the tickets.
Net changes to occur only in one-day net tickets CD and Eliska at internet cheap tickets.
For passengers without the loyalty of the CD Net Price shall be increased from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price will depend on the eliska driven Put up until now it was the same for the journey between any two district towns, and costs 160 kroner.
Philippine Aunt Milli arrest more than 50 people, the children were released.
Milli aunt today in the southern Philippines kidnapped 75 people, including some primary school students and their teachers.
This has led the agency AFP, alerted the originally more than 65 abductees.

Jancura rising criminal complaint for libel against three Head of CSSD.
The owner of Student Agency, Radim Jancura, now does criminal complaint for libel against three social-democratic leader.
By Michal Hasek from the South-Moravian region, Radko Martinek in the Pardubice region and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty Inteview on the radio journal.
The action is related to the effort of the company to operate the Regionalzugverkehr in some districts.
All regions have signed but ultimately the long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three conductors to attack us and say that we have removed the raisins, but we submit the offer is only on the level, as was agreed with them.
They claim that we are expensive as the Czech Railways, because we would know the prices of the Czech railway, completed last week were.
Thus we have no choice other than to defend ourselves.
Because of this slander the company Student Agency, said the radio Jancura Journal.
At the same time he mentioned that he has evidence from all the districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
Therefore, we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek holds the collection of criminal charges for the further continuation of the Medialshow Jancura of which he serves as free advertising for his company and for his own person.
I am of course ready my good name and reputation in my area to defend, and I also call on other leaders.

According to Vancura such behavior is illegal and inconsistent with the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of the train services in the districts threatened him, according Jancura, already a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was, if we do not give out that we can lose the Buslizenzen.

Vaccination against pneumococcal free and voluntary
Imfung against pneumococcal change from January, the usual.
It will be the first to families free of charge and voluntary.
But even now, sign up for, that the mandatory vaccination would be effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcal culminate.
The drug institute has already sets the maximum prices of the vaccines, which must pay for health insurance.
Experts are also on the vaccination procedure in the clear.
New vaccine
August-free vaccines for children
As of January children can be vaccinated against pneumococcus for free, on 2 August last year and later were born.
St the condition that they have not received any vaccine dose.
Anyone who has been with vaccination in the last year or earlier begun to pay must also weitereWiederholungsimpfung itself.
The first dose must be between 3 and 5 Month of life the child will be given.
Even last year, one quarter of the families had their children vaccinated against pneumococcus.
The parents paid 1600 crowns, and more for one dose.
For the vaccination of the youngest children four doses are required.
On the whole, experts estimate that spending on health insurance for 300,000 to 450,000 krona vaccine doses per year.
But they save on the treatment needed by children without vaccination would be.
Until now, the state has spent on all area of child abuse around 500,000 per year.
The compulsory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package introduced.
Pneumococcus causing otitis media, as well as serious infections, including brain, skin infections and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections die, according to research at our hospitals each year up to 28 children under the age of 10 years.
Outside the Czech Republic, the mandatory vaccination of children against pneumococcus in 40 countries, was introduced.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
At the same time it is said that the vaccination may be required in future.
From January this will be paid by the insurance and be voluntary.
That the mandatory vaccination would be better, for example, mentioned the chief of the civic association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky.
His organization promotes the long term even for the pneumococcal vaccination.
The experts at the international conference, in which our organization was involved, were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination.
This is not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we succeeded, at least enforce it.
I believe that this is the path that we now have to go, led Kalovsky.
The Ministry of Health but will not change the procedure of vaccination against pneumococcus.
At this moment we are considering is not at all, "said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, say the doctors.
The chairman of the professional association of paediatricians practical, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, then one might think about reducing the number of re-vaccination, "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that the vaccination was started as a voluntary," but says Cabrnochova.
The experts anticipate that more than 80 percent of parents their infants against pneumococcal vaccination from next year.
Vaccination against pneumococcus is also groundbreaking in it that it is paid as the first routine vaccination of health insurance and not by the state.
The insurance companies should spend money on prevention so that they save for further treatment, tells yo Cabrnochova.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
This, however, a concern of practical pediatrics connected, which concerns the purchase of vaccines.
After the initial plan, vaccines should be purchased by insurance companies and doctors will receive these in the same way as other vaccines issued by the State to them.
Some members, however, feared that the insurance companies so "could use the money from the Krankenversicherungherausführen.
Therefore, the doctors, vaccines will have to buy myself and wait until the insurance they paid for.
According to estimates, the individual practitioners 40,000 kronor per month will have to invest, which is a significant sum.
That will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.
Still, they and we
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Voted in a time when the Swiss electorate voted for a ban on minaret construction and the concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe is widespread, has John Bowen, an American academic, an informed and well-considered report written about whether Muslims in one of the more secular avowedly European societies can be integrated - and integrated.
Some readers of this new book will be out of admiration for the last work of the author, "Why not wear headscarves, the French love" (original title: "Reading Do not Like Headscarves Why the French") (2006), an elegant and tightly argued in a trial issue which the country announced a half decades and employed and their effects are also perceive today.
Bowen's latest book offers a broader and bolder spectrum.
Like a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what the politicians and the media about Islam in France say, but what's really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutions that are now the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it "Islamic freedom offer.
He is a good listener, he gives discussions between teachers and students about the issues again, which worried them most.
If marrying a Muslim in a mosque or a hall (or both)?
If young Muslims about evolution and gay rights to be taught?
Can a Muslim woman marrying a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use a zinsorientiertes banking system in order to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane matters, he says, represent the daily life, in contrast to the political dramas, which employ the media.
The author sees a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of which have a known name, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, a native of Switzerland in the Arab-Muslim scholars and academics.
This new generation tries to reopen the debate about how it is possible to be both a good Muslim and also a good citizen in a modern secular society.
You do not have any arguments on their side.
The conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
Thinkers and activists who questioned Bowen, with their Salafi counterparts usually disagree - supporters of the purist Sunni Islam, which stands with Saudi Arabia in connection - now showing a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires a give and take on both sides.
He does question the extent to which French policy-makers (and the intellectual elite, the so passionate, the separation of church and state guards) genuinely committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may find a rougher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, which in turn had to make their historic compromise with the secular republicanism.
Rather, he sees a "tightening of the screws values" as a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet."
The desolate view of the world
The Arctic is changing rapidly and dramatically than any other region of the environment on Earth.
The ice, which she identifies, is melting at an alarming rate and takes life with it, can survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have moved to the newly open water, with diplomats, lawyers and writers now in their wake.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, is characterized in "On Thin Ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice"), a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bear.
Versed in the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arktiserforscher who have proved themselves in the hunt for the polar bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with a polar bear as a brave 14-year-old midshipman, who fought only with his rifle butt of his musket is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young Bear, caught as they were swimming behind the bodies of their recently dead mother, were placed in zoos and circuses.
A circus performance beginning of the 20th Century was 75 polar bears at a presentation.
Even today Zooanlagen have still typically a millionth of the life range of a wild adult animals. The climate is rarely capable of: Polar bears in Singapore has been growing quite green from the algae, which in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians, and often returns to the threat posed to the survival of the hunting of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killing goes on in Greenland and Canada, where hunters using helicopters and snowmobiles-driving Inuit powerful assault rifles to bring their booty to the track.
Ironically, will remain in the waters in the north of these two nations chase the ice there the longest.
In his new book "After the Ice" (original title "After the Ice") offers Alun Anderson to develop a former editor of the science magazine New Scientist, a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic, and a haunting insight into how the future will could.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither scientists nor atmosphere oceanographers can adequately explain the rapidity of the changes.
This is not due to a lack of explanations.
The pioneering journeys of Fridtjof Nansen end of the 19th and early 20 Century were the first time hints at the turbulence of the pack ice.
Submarines surveyed during the Cold War, the ridges of the fork-lift shifting.
Satellite measurements are a useful addition and the application of large electrodes on icebergs, but is still a lot of fearless people who camped out in the cold reaches.
Anderson takes a look into the strange and tiny world of the flow system within the Arctic ice that is formed by Salzwasserrinnsale that are compressed during freezing.
But, from the bear on the ice and the microscopic wonders of the ice, all of which threatened once when passing the summer ice is expected to be accomplished during the period between 2013 and 2050.

Marines were among the 6,000 who resigned in Arlington Wreaths
Lance Corporal De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours on a bus in order to lay a single wreath on the grave of a soldier, whom he had never met.
For him and the other Marines, who was traveling from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, the National Cemetery in Arlington, undertook to decorate graves, the day is a tribute to the men and women who have entered into the footsteps of her.
In a few months from where we could be back ever, we have, "Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would hope someone would do the same for me, so I try so to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company, manufacturer Funeral Wreath in Harrington, Maine, founded 1992, this tradition when he and some others have decided to decorate several hundred graves at the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now a 18 years old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who keep making the journey each year in various cities along the way to conduct events, dedicated to the people in the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded a nonprofit organization, Wreaths Across America (wreaths across America), which has expanded the event to other states.
This year more than 16,000 volunteers laid wreaths on the graves at Arlington Cemetery in areas at the Pentagon on graves of the National Cemetery in Fayetteville, Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York and at the memorial site for United Airlines Flight 93 In Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation has donated for the second time more than 150,000 dollars for the purchase and transportation of the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said that it has made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldiers.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, "Hunt said, this is their way to give something back to those who brought sacrifices.
She said it is a small contribution, how we can support our soldiers are civilians.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers traveled across the lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers were older tombs from the 1st and 2 World War and the Vietnam War as a target because they are not visited as often as the more recent graves, so the organizers.
The mood was happy, playing children and couples clung to his hand, while they carried the fresh pine branches to the graying headstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a little red ribbon that was attached to the upper part.
The section 60, which is located in the vicinity and where mainly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, almost remained calm.
The United Service Organizations 1000 donated wreaths to decorate this section, but the dark mood of the current wars filled this area.
Some wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends held firmly against each other in the icy air.
Some read aloud the names carved in stone, while others bent down to small black and white place cards that had been set for those in the wet mud, whose tombstones were not yet completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who shed beside the grave of her son, bitter tears.
It is 8 hours of Zanesfield, Ohio driven, to visit the tomb of Marineinfranterie-Corporal David Shane Spicer, who was killed in July in the struggle.
No one should ever forget why we are free ... my son has paid for it, "she said.
"When I'm long gone, I wish that someone remembers him."
Contractor for the U.S. government arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has a contractor for the U.S. government, mobile phones and notebook computers sold in the country, detained, representatives of the Foreign Ministry said on Saturday.
The contractor, who until now could not be identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc. of Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as USAID, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officer of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana to try to gain access to the detainee, on 5 December was arrested.
The specific charges were not yet published, although, according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor for almost everything, on charges of "endangering" can be arrested.
Include all the so-called counter-revolutionary activities, the ease of protests and critical writings, carry a risk of arrest.
Graffiti and anti-government statements are regarded as serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogging community, led by the popular journalist Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband attacked and persecuted by government officials.
Sánchez has repeatedly sought permission to leave the country to receive for prizes, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to be tensions between the communist government of Castro's brother in Cuba and the Obama administration to increase, which had sought a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that the United States will provide a return if the Cuban government is taking concrete steps in this direction, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, even though they are new and desirable products in a country where the average earnings of a government employees is $ 15 per month.
The Cuban government allowed only since this year ordinary citizens to buy a cell phone, they are distributed primarily used for sending text messages, since a 15-minute phone call would cost one days wages.
Internet access is extremely limited on the island.
It is in expensive hotels, where foreign visitors and in some government agencies, such as universities, accessible.
Cubans who want to sign in, often have to report to the Government of their names.
On many web sites, access is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens who are in Cuba are in prison, for crimes such as smuggling drugs behind bars, "said Gloria Berbena, the press spokeswoman for the U.S. Interest Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could give no further information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity which would be legal in any free society - the duty free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the American section of the group Human Rights Watch, which recently embarked on a harsh report on the freedom Cuba with the title "A New Castro, same Cuba" brought out, a reference to the inauguration of Raul Castro as the leader of the country, who replaced the ailing older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused would be arrested within a day very often convicted, and imprisoned.
He said that any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, precisely at a time when both countries to show more readiness for dialogue to move towards one another.
Pakistani officials meet to plan to send men into Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities on Saturday detected an alleged head of a major conspiracy that aimed, five men from Northern Virginia to send to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, and said they hope this might help a broad network uncover terrorist recruiters, search the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they had sought an opaque rebels, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had managed to find them, because one of them on the Internet video site YouTube had made favorable comments about terrorist attacks.
Saifullah was after her arrival in Pakistan of the leaders of these men and tried to help them to reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service, who was briefed on the matter said on Saturday, Saifullah was not al-Qaeda leaders to convince them that the men are not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were detained for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the barren mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist haven.
They were considered as part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government official who wished to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The officials said that the men were not discouraged and continued to try to get the right recommendations in order to gain access to the al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement agencies.
The case of five men - who are still in Pakistan and interrogated by the FBI - underscores the crucial role of the recruiter to identify future terrorists, and possibly even more important in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001 has allowed the U.S. Secret Service made a matter utmost urgency to accommodate human assets within Al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as a gatekeeper to keep out those whose commitment to the holy war is not serious enough and might be of those spies.
American would-be recruits are from A Qaeda undergo special testing, said analysts.
Because of their potential access to U.S. objectives and their propaganda value, but they are also seen as extremely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst with the NEFA Foundation, based in the United States, said that terrorist groups had in recent years also become much more cautious with regard to who they allow access, for the U.S. intelligence community have become experts in their recruiting methods.
If you try to sneak someone in these groups, what better way could we go but to follow the recruitment model, which so many have been followed? "Said Kohlmann.
The model is now based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators demanding the Copenhagen Climate Action "
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched here on Saturday through the streets and demanded that the negotiators at the Bella Center congress of the city bolder action against climate change.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, while the police were based on estimates rather about 25,000.
The event passed off relatively peacefully, despite a handful of masked activists lit small explosive device near some government buildings in the city.
On one day, than at the UN-sponsored climate talks little happened, thousands of activists walked through the city with banners on which was in English "There is no Planet B" and one in Spanish, which said "The earth says" Enough " .
Some stars joined the protest, for example, the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, the birthplace of her mother, she deliberately make harrowing problems with which the country due to the already significant impact of climate change has to fight.
This is part of the reasons why I decided to participate in the big demonstration - to pass the word and urge world leaders to bring a fair, ambitious and binding agreement reached, "she said.
It is no easy task, but it needs to be done now and there is no way to question the fool of.
The police kept the demonstrators from it, too close to the Bella Center heranzukommen and said they had arrested 19 persons, mainly due to the fact that they were either masked or pocket carrying.
According to Danish law, these actions at demonstrations are banned.
According to a bystander who refused to be named because he is involved in the climate negotiations, set fire masked demonstrators dressed in black, several explosive devices in the vicinity of the Copenhagen main channel, located in the vicinity of several ministries.
They threw them in the vicinity of the building, he said, adding that she started out as flares, but were then followed by "a few big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of TV screens to watch the afternoon demonstration.
But the protest has increased awareness of the principal officials, such as Su, China Chefklimaunterhändler, apparently not reached.
When he was asked whether he thinks that the demonstration would have a constructive impact on the international considerations, "he replied in English:" This is something that I was not aware of me. "
He then proceeded in Mandarin and said: "Because the venue is great, I can not hear what's going on out there."
He noted that it depended on the individual's perspective, whether the demonstration would help or hurt.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, "he said.
On the other hand, one can also say that the negotiations or the freedom of other people upset. "
Test data show persistent racial divide
The evidence for mathematics performance last week was welcome good news for the public schools in Washington, DC
Although the district Washington is still far behind the country's schools, which produce peak performance, the evidence shows that the fourth-and eighth graders in the last two years, more rapid progress than cities that did include Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures from the National Review of Education Progress (National Assessment of Educational Progress - NAEP) is the persistent performance gap between African American and white students on the local level and nationally.
The average scores of white fourth-grader from Washington DC in the past two years increased from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500) that their African American peers but increased by only three points from 209 to 212th
The performance gap actually increased from 2007 to 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-American eighth graders remained basically the same, it fell by a statistically negligible point of 245 to 244
The average score of white students was not included in the test data, because the sample size was not large enough.
The image of a six-year period of time is also not encouraging.
The gulf that separated white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first NAEP recorded in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the number of points achieved, the children of both groups has grown in that time period, the difference with now 58 points hardly diminished.
Some education advocates in the district last week expressed its concern that the results were hailed by Schulkanzlerin Michelle A. Rhee and the Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty, mostly by white students, who are anyway powerful children, have been promoted.
This suggests that we have increased the overall classification by the treatment of those at the upper end of the scale, what is problematic and difficult, "said Jeff Smith, a board member of DC Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for education equality in Washington DC.
I do not jump on for a span of two or three points up and down, "said Washington, the Democratic City Council member Kwame R. Brown, a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton's primary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee said, is the message of the test scores of city schools that need urgent attention.
Of course you always want to see the positive signs, which I respect.
What frightens me is that we do not spend nearly the time and energy we would use for our school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of underperforming students to be.
This fall, for example, some teachers are trained to a new Leselehrplan, the Wilson Reading System used to be, aimed at students in upper grades of elementary school and middle school who have not mastered the basic skills of reading early in their school career and The lag significantly behind their same age classmates.
Brought Everyday Mathematics, a curriculum that was from kindergarten to sixth grade games and brings real life experiences to the fore, under the former chief inspector of schools Clifford Janey to Washington and this curriculum are some of the NAEP-progress reports last week were attributed to .
I think that we said to continue to need to work to benefit the best measures of the students who are below the grade level, Rhee.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can not continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the additional money and resources for underperforming schools available that are necessary in order to divide . reduce
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, "said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, examines the urban audit results.
The conventional remedy is to direct its resources and management reforms at the schools that are located in the poorest areas of Washington DC.
The objective could result in political consequences that work against this important agenda item.
The weak spot is, of course, as with other urban school superintendents that they tried to keep the white and black middle classes.
Our focus is to ensure that we establish a system of great schools.
We must strengthen our schools in the neighborhoods so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be assured that their children can receive an excellent public school education.
Janey, who is now inspector of schools in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to close the performance gap is the traditional public school, which is currently in Washington, 180 days lengthen, to the charter schools to compete.
You have the school year to nearly 200 days, increase the power to change to have, "said Janey, who came with his teachers' union last year, an agreement about 185 days per year, which he described as" a milestone "on the path to greater increase in the next contract considered.
Higher education for more people than the future prospect
The coach reached the Gettysburg College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, gets out and blink for a moment at the sight of the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Gracielas parents have barely finished high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, had also Graciela, which was recovered in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eighth graders the group to explore the Gettysburg, where the instruction will cost $ 38,690 per year, was more like a respectful visitor, as the future of our enthusiastic students.
"Yes, I will be here soon!" Graciela said, would like to study medicine, as the leaders announced that they had entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully, as she was a professor reported the low-to-student ratio at school.
The College in Pennsylvania was the 7th, have visited the children on their three-day tour, and now they have fully absorbed the intended message: The question is not whether it's going to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand there is a growing concern about the large number of US-born children of Hispanic immigrants who do not finish high school or become pregnant as a teenager, on the other, there are hundreds of thousands who receive the college education that is needed to ascend to the middle class .
In truth, including a starting five of these "second generation" of Hispanic college - which is a remarkable achievement, since many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the U.S. without having completed high school with.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because for a generation that will play a huge role in the workforce of the country, show the way forward.
Those who say investigate powerful children, they often have a natural affinity for the school and an inherent drive to succeed.
Many of them have parents who set high goals to their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But outreach programs also play a major role by Graciela and millions of children as they help to come to college, especially to persist if these efforts over a long period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them with the path search through the system, then a single measure does not solve the problem at some time, "said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California at Davis, Latin-American students studied.
We need to think about it, ask a support network for these children from preschool through high school available.
The federal program that had funded Gracielas College Tour, is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - Gearing a gear - and serves more than 300 million U.S. dollars per year to start for local school systems are available to college-preparatory programs that start when low-income students are in middle school and continue until they reach the high school have been completed.
According to the U.S. Department of Education since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, of whom more than 60% have gone to college.
Iraqi Oil Ministry concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability has been able to bring the Iraqi government on Saturday completed auctions for two major oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure again.
Close to the 10 contracts signed with foreign oil companies of the Iraqi Oil Ministry indicate that China, Russia and European oil companies are willing to play an important role in the reconstruction of Iraq's oil industry, which has been paralyzed for decades by war and economic sanctions.
American companies have recorded only shares in two of the 10 fields auctioned for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for their participation in the second auction, which started on Friday.
The only company that has submitted a bid, has drawn the short straw.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for auction in June fields.
The thinly sown representatives of American oil companies in opening up the Iraqi oil industry, surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its gates after 6 years of war and to give instead of U.S. companies in Asian and European way, "said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers long in Iraq.
Safety concerns have been accentuated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and the political instability due to the withdrawal of the U.S. military have American oil companies probably deterred, analysts said, to become more involved in Iraq, which has the third largest proven crude oil reserves in the world.
U.S. firms were at a disadvantage in some cases, because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy company, have much lower labor costs and respond more risks because they must take no account of shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that were able to conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Major U.S. companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which are to be maintained with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and close relations in recent years with technical advice stood to one side, empty-handed.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the key players this weekend at two of the awarded contracts.
The state China National Petroleum Corporation has provided for more contracts than any other company, and was able to walk with large packages of contracts for two major fields back home.
We all know, "said the spokesman of the Oil Ministry, Assam Jihad, that China is on its way to becoming one of the greats of the world economy as well as a technological power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can match its bidders and will fulfill its obligations towards Iraq.
For the pre-selected firms submitting bids bids indicated which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil, which the ministry was willing to pay in order to increase the output of each field on the current level and beyond.
Top planners of Al Qaeda killed in Pakistan evidently
In an apparent U.S. missile attacks along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan this week, a top Al Qaeda planners of the operation said to have been killed, representatives of the U.S. counter-terrorism reported on Friday.
This would be if it were confirmed, the second deadly attack on a high level leaders of the terrorist organization this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs who were allegedly killed according to U.S. sources and Pakistani government officials in the region by a number of missiles which hit their vehicle on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan.
Local authorities reported that the rockets were fired from a Drohnentyp, which is used by the CIA in Pakistan's lawless tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle in the direction of the Afghan border, as the car was hit, authorities said a representative of one of Miran Shah, Pakistan's civilian intelligence service over the phone.
Include local residents, are suspected, to the militants, ran to the spot and quickly took everything for itself, what was the "completely destroyed" bodies remained.
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US-led fight against terrorism to unspecified evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
Somaliland has been described as the leading military planners of Al Qaeda, the operations of terrorist groups outside Afghanistan-Pakistan region initiated.
He was involved in conspiracies in the world, "remarked a senior official, who wished to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of the U.S. air strikes on Pakistani soil.
If we assume a central role as a given, this also included the planning of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He took instructions from the strategic Topführern of Al Qaeda and put them into operation planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American government officials said that Somali quickly in the Al-Qaeda hierarchy had risen, and would best links to other extremist groups in the region.
He may have some Americans do not know, government officials said the second, but this in no way reduces the danger he represented to us and our allies.
If his death would be confirmed, would be the second leading Somali Al Qaeda or Taliban leader who was killed in September, have been killed than in a similar attack Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area and three other Topaktivisten.
The pace of attacks by unmanned aircraft of the CIA since the summer, and fall according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a nonprofit organization, from an average of six operations per month to two.
The decrease can be based on improved tactics of terrorist groups, have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability and kill suspected informers standing at the same time brutal, reported the website.
A leading UN envoy in Kabul, will retire
The leading UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, which would be a stormy tenure ended by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-supported Afghan presidential election was marred.
Oath departure takes place when the Obama administration has decided to send 30,000 more U.S. troops into Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supports the troop increase, but he also expressed his concern at the fact that the U.S. timetable for military withdrawal, which will begin in 18 months, other NATO could encourage governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the building of the Afghan security forces, and thus send the right signal to Afghans that they can trust said the international community, oaths in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long term.
The Norwegian diplomat urged the United States and other military forces also increase the number of international civilian aid workers, which should help in the political transition in Afghanistan.
The troop increase on the military side must increase to meet the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he does not resigns, but only one in the March 2008 agreement reached to satisfy his family to stay only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted the notification to the UN
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon forward now, so he had time to care for a replacement.
What I said is that he better start looking for a successor, "said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has begun in accordance with UN representatives in the search for a replacement.
The UN representative said that it uses the Swedish-Italian-descended Staffan di Mistura, who has led recently the UN Mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guehenno, who previously headed the UN peacekeeping operations, has taken into consideration.
Oath position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, had indicted him in September, President Hamid Karzai in the presidential preference in the country and cover up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has rejected all accusations, but he also said that the accusations made by Galbraith - who was fired - "have undoubtedly caused harm to the mission because there was already a great deal of skepticism about the international interference in the election."
Eide said that he has recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of the US-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted that the UN leadership allowed his successor to recruit staff from the United States and other Western countries that donate money for the Afghan mission, and said it would increase their confidence that their money is being properly used .
Eide expressed his disappointment at the reduction of its forces in Afghanistan expressed and said that the UN cumbersome recruitment rules have undermined its ability to bring in talented people.
The UN rules are designed so that I since May, he said, set only one person could.
This is catastrophic and can not continue.
U.S. Defense Secretary Gates: Iran must reckon with additional penalties
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that imposed by the world powers will soon be "significant additional sanctions" on Iran, because he has not participated in talks on its nuclear plans.
Gates said during a 7-day trip through war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, a group of some 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq and played the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran down.
In Iran there are no good options to choose from, "he said in answer to a question from a soldier on the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things that I lie on the soul is, if we have learned in the last six years, some from Iraq, the war's own unpredictability."
The Obama administration pulls a package of sanctions into consideration, aimed at the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranian.
He said that a "package of incentives and disincentives" is needed "to convince the Iranian government that it is protected with nuclear weapons is in fact less" because "their people will suffer immensely under the sanctions.
On Friday in a statement from White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, joined the American government to European leaders in warning that Iran was likely to "plausible" consequences be if he and his nuclear program to the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, meets.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology are to be obtained only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on 1 Iran said in October that he would resume talks to curb its nuclear program again and would give up a substantial part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The U.S. government has pushed for this type of agreement to rebuild the trust between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
To have left Iran since that time, but it seems the negotiations on the interim agreements - in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is split over whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
That Iran, the international community in relation to some proposals, which they had already agreed in early October, just stand has left, has, frankly, the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, in a way together, as they were associated with significant additional sanctions on Iran never said Gates.
President Obama 31 December as a deadline set for Iran to respond to these proposals, before other options, including those who called the Secretary of Hillary Rodham Clinton once "crushing sanctions" will continue.
In an opinion issued in New York, the Iranian Mission to the United Nations has condemned what she called Thursday "baseless and unfounded allegations" of some Security Council members on Iran's nuclear activities and said that they are willing to talks with the United States and five pursue other world powers, "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution."
Gates, who last Friday was supposed to return to Washington, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki before he flew into the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk with the Kurdish government officials in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, in particular in relation to boundaries, ownership, and because the distribution of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict in order to avoid the delay of U.S. plans to reduce American troop levels until the end of August from 115,000 to 50,000.
Gates also sought to allay concerns about the upcoming Kurdistan's pullout. U.S. officials quoted Gates, who told Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdish Regional Government, "We will get your security, your wealth and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you. "
A change of course in the aging of China
Weijia Wang and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters, which they held talks that "Mother Earth is too tired to keep more children" and "One more baby means a more grave."
These lessons they have learned so well that when government officials in Shanghai, which by the low birth rate and aging population suddenly began this summer to change the course and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, her answer immediately and was final: "No way".
We have already invested all our time and energy into a child.
For a second child is nothing left, "said Wang, 31, a personnel manager with an 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of one-child policy in China, the two generations of well-plump, spoiled only children who are known affectionately as "little emperors", has produced, pulls up a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate was at 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time when those policies fell into force, represents the United Nations
Division notes on population issues, while the number to the population aged between 60 years and older in 2020 from 16.7 percent of the population in 2050 exploded to 31.1 percent. This is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is greater in the rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, identified 60-year-old and older, almost 22 percent of registered residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate has been lower than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai city population and family planning commission said that couples need to get in the reproductive age babies to help, "thereby, reduce the ratio of the elderly population share and to alleviate the shortage of workers of the future".
Shanghai will soon be "so old - but not so rich - like the developed countries, like Japan and Sweden, to be," she said.
A gradual relaxation
Enshrined in the constitution of the country in 1978, should China's one-child policy probably be the most controversial available, which was introduced by the ruling Communist Party to the present.
Couples who violate this policy, will face huge fines - up to three times their annual salary in some regions - and with discrimination in their workplace.
Chinese government representatives have attributed to this policy, that the critical stress on the country's natural resources could be avoided, while human rights activists have condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural regions, some officials pregnant women who already have a child, forced abortion,.
Many couples have also had the sex of abortions can be carried out, whereby an unnaturally high ratio of men to women was created.
In recent years, government officials have gradually softened their attitude to people one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule - including city residents, members of ethnic minorities and in cases where both husband and wife are only children have been - and 2007, the harsh tone of many messages were mitigated.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Peking University said that government officials have debated recently even about radical changes, for example, permit couples to two children, where one partner is an only child.
Shanghai in July for the first Chinese city, which has launched an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Posters, instructed the families to have only one child, were replaced almost overnight by guidelines that will describe in detail who is eligible for a second child, and how to apply for approval.
The city council has sent out municipal employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and durchzuschieben leaflets under the doors.
She asked also to provide psychological and financial advice for the disposal, which have more than one child.
The reaction was not exactly encouraging, said family representative.
Disappointing response
Although officials said in a small rural town in the outskirts of Shanghai, that an upturn is seen at the requests of couples, which after the start of the campaign will have a second child, however, the urban districts report no change.
In Huinan municipality with a population of 115,000 are included as examples are still a month just four to five applications.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that the expected number of births for 2010 in the city despite the campaign are still at approximately 165,000 - slightly higher than 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Juying Feng, director of the Family Planning Committee of the Shanghai Municipality Caolu, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why many people do not want more children.
First you want to give her the best, "she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and this is also legally permitted.
But they have, how many Chinese people, only a minimal health and life of the government.
Without a social safety net, they say, that decision would be irresponsible.
Rate People in the West, the one-child policy was misrepresented as human rights issue, "said Yang, a civil engineer, whose wife is seven months pregnant with her first child.
Yes, it robs us of the opportunity to have more than one child.
The problem lies not just in politics.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for her hesitation.
Wang, the personnel director, said she wants only one child because she was an only child. "We were the center of the family and stayed that everyone took care of us.
We're not used to care about others and also do not really want this. "
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, said it bluntly.
For parents from the middle class, with dual-career, which reduce the birth rate, he said, turning it came to be successful and for that you have to be selfish.
The age group of today's 20 - to 39-year-old grew up to see their parents fighting during the early days of Chinese capitalism experiment and they want as a life not for himself, he said.
Even a single child, he said, makes huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother needs to give up their social life for at least two years.
Then there is the problem of space - "You have to rebuild his house - and life planning -" If the child is 9 months old, you must already have a resume ready for the best pre-schools have. "
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, "said Chen, but not twice
Our generation is the first person who has achieved a higher standard of living, "he said.
We do not make too many sacrifices.
UN group plan designed to reduce emissions
, Supported by the UN Climate Change Conference - which until now characterized by wild poses and recriminations - has set on Friday with the publication of a document once again a focal point that records for the next 40 years an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases, with the industrialized nations shoulder in the near future, the biggest expense would have.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate the greenhouse gases, has exhibited both the remaining obstacles, as well as the path shown to the front.
But he was considered an important step forward in the negotiation has run out of time, because next week will get more than 100 leaders from around the world in Copenhagen.
The text, which was formulated by a specially created UN working group is silent on the amount of money, should give the rich countries to poor countries to enable them to cope with short-and long-term global warming.
He also offers a range of options for key issues, including such industrial and major emerging economies to limit their carbon emissions and what should be the upper limit of global temperature increase, which would support the political decision-makers.
The process is given a lot of flexibility, said John Coequyt, a senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document that has brought together a 180-page negotiating text to include this in the heart of what the leading representatives of the UN Climate Change, Yvo de Boer, as has described the big picture. "
It shows the outline of a possible agreement in which developed nations would reduce their emissions by 2020 by 25 percent to 45 percent, compared with the limits of 1990, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions over the same period by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries could reduce emissions by 2050 by 50 to 95 percent.
The European Community has given talks on Friday also a boost by its commitment to provide over the next three years, 3.6 billion U.S. dollars per year to help poorer countries to adapt to the impacts of climate change - from the masters of floods and droughts to avoid deforestation.
The Friday brought yet the same verbal fireworks, which had determined the talks in the past week.
The American Klimasonderbeauftragte Todd Stern has rejected formulations that call for mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared with voluntary reductions for major emerging economies, if they are not financed by the industrialized nations.
This train has announced that the Obama administration takes a harder line with China, as a representative of the Bush administration does not even two years ago.
The United States will sign an agreement without major emerging economies to stand up and take action, then Stern, who also complained about the fact that the text does not go far enough to ensure, that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave his opinion of one hours after the declaration by Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei, which said that the leading American Klimaunterhändler either "reason" or lack "highly irresponsible" of him was that he said earlier this week that the United States, China would not financially to help tackle global warming.
The fact that the future economic direction of march of the great world powers is at stake, have been found in both within the industrialized nations, and between the industrialized nations and emerging fault lines.
The current struggle applies equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as saving the planet, feuds with China and the United States because of their corresponding obligations, while poorer countries argue that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the great powers to fight about who should bear the cost of the braking of the greenhouse gas emissions, as even the countries concerned have begun to aggressively having to do so, the countries with very high greenhouse gas levy for their actions to account.
This is clearly a game, from which will develop a new economic domination, so Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change adviser for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries that are the most exposed to climate change impacts, said that they would continue fighting for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will result in the best case for a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, with 43 members has presented early Friday morning a 24-page draft treaty.
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states' political pressure on the entire political process, "partly because they are now united and policies of the emerging countries like China and India, demand.
The talks were given a new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding questions must be answered before the arrival of government leaders to come to an agreement.
High-level representatives, as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice Minister emerged from their planes and raced through the aisles of the Bella Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences in order to outline claims that are negotiated during the next week.
The pure scale of the Assembly - 13,000 people walk daily in the convention center and out, guitar-playing activist organizing nightly shows in which they make fun of the countries that they believe betrayed and sell, and contract designs are from hand to hand rather than forwarded by e-mail - already provides a challenge
The intensity builds up until now, almost all the key ministers are now here and will be starting Wednesday 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
We come to the league, "said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of the organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights come.
Britain's Top 225 km / h faster train defines the Monday feeling new
Monday morning at 5 clock 13 is a pipe penetrating the darkness, to announce a train departure, which represents a revolution in transport in Great Britain.
The first Hochgeschwindigkeitspendlerzug in the country will achieve its Ashfort flash drive from Kent to London St Pancras 225 km / h and travel 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be issued Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin commuter services from London.
He hopes that the new service quicker UK ultimately to an international network, will dock and reliable trains will connect the major urban areas of the Midlands, the north of Scotland in London.
The neglected province could become commuter towns of living, working journey times would be drastically reduced and the shift from air and road to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds that are required for the construction of a new national network, to the inevitable battle planning and concern over environmental damage at the British high-speed tracks could still pull the brake.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to assist the Government to submit a feasibility study, Lord Adonis, according to the Times report on 30 Present in December.
Thus he receives a detailed route map for the next stage of the planned high-speed rail network.
The new railway line will connect with the London, West Midlands, is way past with a margin of five meters in urban areas and in places where the impact on the environment are controversial.
In open terrain, the plan will outline the approach within a distance of 25 meters on the final stretch.
HS2 will also create three options for a larger, high-speed rail networks leading north.
Lord Adonis, will react in the spring.
The preferred option proposed is a Y-shaped route that would lead to a single high-speed line in the West Midlands.
The line would divide into or near to Birmingham and a branch would lead to the west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and another upon the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"There seems to be working best option," said a railway insider.
Upon completion, would increase the journey time between London and Edinburgh reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first leg, which would not be opened before 2025, would enable travelers to traverse the distance from London to Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with today, just over an hour.
The draft guidelines would be offering the opportunity to drive at a speed of 400 km / h, making the British rail network would be the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned so that trains can be 400 meters long with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people ride it.
Up to 18 trains per hour could be on the London-Birmingham in operation.
This in turn would mean that in London terminus would be needed on the 20,000 passengers per hour could be handled.
Given the space limitations in the capital is expected that an existing station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Rail experts say that only St. Pancras International and Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes this plan should be continued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning policies mean that a final decision will be made until after the elections.
But even if he sets the wheels in motion, the railway must be built in phases.
The trains would have to first of the high-speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham switch, making the journey time between London and Scotland would continue to be in excess of three hours.
This is considered a crucial sticking point so that a change can be secured from the aircraft to the station, a beacon for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers are eligible for mortgage for £ 75,000-a Conservative on Orangery
Alan Duncan, leading TDs of the conservatives, has put the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year for the cost of an orangery into account, the building he ran into his house in his constituency.
The prison spokesman for the party by David Cameron was demoted because he complained that commons "from a meager rations" to live, have increased their mortgage to £ 75,000 in order to make an oak-timbered building extension to his second home in Rutland to .
He was allowed to ask the taxpayers the additional Zinsaufkommen into account, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The leaders of the House have approved the applications at that time and they were also made by Sir Thomas Legg not question, conducting a review of the expenditure of the TDs. Last night, Duncan said that the requests were "not clean or understand" can be.
Duncan, one of the richest TDs, has a two-story house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
In the vicinity lying houses have made a purchase price of nearly one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor comprises kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, an output control of the House, has agreed that Duncan needed more space.
Last year he planted a winter garden, which is called for in the plans as "Orangerie".
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment."
Duncan was not asked during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage contracts by the Committee on Standards and Privileges to take on increased borrowing position.
The Committee has cleared him last month after an investigation of his spending by breaking the rules.
2004 Duncan has the security for a mortgage of 271,406 pounds (300,000 euros) from his London house transferred to his constituency house that he had 1991, bought one years before he was elected member of parliament.
This week released documents showing that Duncan and March last year, about 1,400 pounds was refunded (1,500 euros) per month as mortgage interest.
In April, his claims rose to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The rate of Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during this period, suggesting that the entire increase was used to finance the borrowing of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
The normal continuous RBS mortgage interest rate of 7.94 percent fell in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, when he stands still.
The latest documents published by the House show that Duncan this May continue to be entitled to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month claimed.
Duncan lost his post in September as the opposition leader of the House after an undercover reporter filmed him there when he said after the scandal issue that members of Parliament would be living "by meager rations.
"Basically it means if you work for the state, from a meager rations that we must live and how S ***** e is treated."
He said: "I've spent all my money for my garden and raise a right to a very small proportion, as measured by to what belongs to him.
And I had the whole damn sum may sue, but I do not do it. "
The Parliament member, a millionaire from his earlier career as Ölgroßhändler, was first attacked in May because of his spending, when it became clear that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden until he had clarified with the Fees Office that this "as exaggerated claims could be considered ".
An activist protesting in Duncan has dug a hole in the form of a lawn sign pounds, after it became known that he had claimed over three years, 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros).
Last night when he was asked about the increased mortgage, Duncan said: "This was both from the Fees Office, but also to have been approved by Legg on the following appreciation."
He added: "There is no debate about dodging and durchschlängeln or bending the rules or the like.
Everything is completely transparent and is moving strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It could not be cleaner and clearer. "

"I have the head of the prison ordered to take immediate steps to ensure that such a situation, which is caused by poor estimation of the costs of overtime, are not repeated in the future," added Ms Alliot-Marie added.

"At a time when we are burdened with more responsibilities without more staff be employed, is an attempt to enrich themselves to the funds of the staff, more than inappropriate," said the CGT union of Bordeaux.
The unions say the situation is not the same in all regions. Some are less affected than others.
In any case, it is wrong, notes the Secretary-General of UFAP, Jean-François Forget.

Me Olivier Metzner, a lawyer of the Medical Association, has described him as "a man without scruples," which has been "responsible for regularly" before the Appeal Board, and "anything but recommend it."

That said, the intervention would be "perfect run" and the post-operative investigations would "normally have been."
The operation is called "produced no bleeding, and therefore require no drainage," he added.

The UDF party alliance) (Union for French Democracy vigorously and called on the Party Nouveau Center, no longer use their seal
The party alliance, which is supervised by François Bayrou's party MoDem, responded on Friday to a takeover attempt of the seal, which once set up by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing party, on the part of the Chairman of the Party Nouveau Center, Herve Morin, violent, and him under threat of a prosecution asked to use this seal on any documents anymore.
Herve Morin announced publicly its intention to adopt this UDF label, since he thinks that François Bayrou is worthy of defending this political legacy, after he had served his left hand.
The Defense Minister, whose party partner, the UMP, Incidentally wanted to reiterate this policy on the Saturday before the National Council of NC.
For his efforts he was strongly supporting the deputies Hervé de Charette (former UMP, is now available from NC), who makes a claim to ownership of the mark UDF because he was the first that mark the 2004 National Institut de la propriété industrielle has applied.
However, the business office of the burst of François Bayrou's UDF Friends Party Alliance monitored the silence and made it clear that they were not expropriated and put to the minister and the deputy under threat of prosecution a deadline to stop using this seal and her to transfer ownership of the brand.
You have submitted in the last days many statements that you would suggest your political movement, the UDF Siegelzu page + +, said the party in an alliance of 19 of the 24 office members signed letter, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the party MoDem and Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
They probably believed also that you have the right to the name of this movement + Nouveau + center, the slogans of the present UDF + +, can be printed on their political and material on the home page of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use the same label, said the office of the UDF and urges the NC party, "without delay, the mention of the name UDF status of all material and remove it from (their) site.
In addition, we were asked by Hervé de Charette, transfer the ownership of the brand to their legal persons entitled to ".
If you refuse, we will bring an action against you to gain respect for the law and defend the legitimate rights of the UDF members, warned the undersigned.
In their letter, they emphasize that "UDF" is a full-fledged political movement since 1978 and remember having that Morin and his friends "made a choice" to leave them in 2007 to found a rival movement, as others have already done 2002 had to start the party "UMP" too.
The Party Nouveau center has, therefore, that the undersigned, any rights, the UDF Siegel (Union pour la démocratie française use) to.
They continue to remind you that the last Congress of the UDF 2007 has adopted the three-year membership of the party MoDem and to set up an office to defend "the material and moral interests" founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing movement.
As regards Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "it was the time when he applied for the brand, for three years, no longer a member of the UDF," but the UMP.
He benefited in a scandalous and fraudulent manner, the absence of deposit of the acronym UDF to do this for themselves.
Furthermore, They consider that this lack of consideration is on the way to transform himself into a crime, and ironically, the strategy of NC: "It seems to us but in politics as in life more dignified to make himself a name, instead of trying to come out of anonymity, by itself, to fraudulently appropriating a name to which you have no rights.

Affaire Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier is convicted of exploitation of weakness
The Court of Nanterre has decided on Friday to assess the artist Francois-Marie Banier to determine whether he has, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt said exploited a weak moment of octogenarians in order of getting a portion of their assets.
The 62-year-old photographer who is known for his celebrity photos, will be on 15 and 16 April 2010 responsible for the exploitation of weakness before the court must, an offense punishable by imprisonment not exceeding three years and is punishable by a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will be, in fact, a process in this affair, which is the saga of one of the richest families in France worthy of both mother and daughter simultaneously shreds and have the reins of the L'Oreal cosmetics empire in her hand.
Equally, however, ordered the 15th Criminal Division A medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, it is carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heiress and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially not by him, during an investigation by the prosecutor of Nanterre conditions submitted.
The doctors are still appointed on Friday before 10 March 2010 to submit a report in which you specify clearly known, may have been whether and at what times is Liliane Bettencourt in a state of weakness.
I think she will submit to such examinations.
I'll talk to her, said the attorney of Mrs. Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, after the hearing.
As for the lawyer-Françoise Bettencourt Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court.
This is excellent news (...). The report will prove that he) (Banier this old lady has manipulated the protection you need, "he insisted.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier has allround photographer, introduced and accused him of having for years exploited the weakness of their mother to be gifts of a total of one billion euros in the form of bank checks; to elevate insurance policies or paintings.
Turn, Liliane Bettencourt had always refuted that he had been manipulated by the photographer, whom she regards as an old friend.
Although the court would consider the admissibility of the initiated by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers proceedings, the closing speeches of the lawyers on Friday led to a large family debacle.
Thus, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt at three appointed by his client to her notary sent letters (1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she wrote that she distrusts the husband-Françoise Bettencourt Meyers.
According to her lawyer Liliane Bettencourt added the following: "could you please explain to my daughter that I was fifteen years, I have a write-once or twice daily Banier.
Francoise, I was able to speak since her marriage, never again. "
The prosecution of Nanterre is once again the opinion that the plaintiff had no right to react that way, especially because a guardianship judge has rejected in the final days of its application to initiate a judicial protection procedure against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt is the full legal capacity, is not under protection and has no guardian.
Nobody has the right to act in their place, "affirmed the representative of the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court has now decided to issue a ruling after the process has taken place on the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers.
Manager revolution or the end of the strategic foresight?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence in vain ...
For over a decade ago, the attitude of the management of large enterprises in terms of its staff, said the position of companies vis-à-vis the consumer from the marketing revolution: It is joining the staff, "values" determined the top, as It used to be on the consumer products from the engineers designed the plant to be imposed.
By the customer at the heart of the company's marketing strategies, the revolution has been the conquest of markets in the city ... Although the authoritarian temptation products separately Factors preferences of customers again impose regularly!
A demobilization of staff can lead to a fatal demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon, which affects particularly the employees.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company, especially those of R & D and what is even more crucially, to those of economic intelligence.
In fact, calls for the IE (Intelligence Economique \u003d economic intelligence) by all parties as a proactive approach and forward-looking perspective, "they claimed by the employees use (...) to contradict completely the instructions of the authoritarian management.
We therefore call for an operational revolution, which would consist of the employees in denMittelpunkt the concerns of the entity provide the same quality for the customer.
The highly conditional use internal polls
If the internal polls, has put forward as the questionnaire, the Orange's wage earners, this revolution in terms of management practice to encourage?
I fear not, unfortunately.
- Firstly, because I could see that the entire framework, given a new situation after many detours, finally arrives here, the priority is to do ... what it has always done.
Also because of authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power increases in proportion to the significance of his own failures.
And finally, because most managers have a simplistic conception of human behavior.
Emerging from the great engineering schools is their interpretation of the mechanistic psychology.
You assume by intellectual comfort the old behaviorist theory, which was reactivated recently by the U.S. "neuroscience" and unknowingly spread extensively from research institutes and through the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to "leverage" (sic) the commitment of employees to operate, encourages one aktuellein Le Figaro.fr published survey by Ipsos, the executives in a posture to a mechanistic control system that for the present world is inappropriate.
Mobilizing to identify and measure factors
Instead, for the proper functioning of modern enterprises is necessary operational revolution preceded the adoption of a final vision of human behavior.
It is to integrate into any idea or practice of management is a fundamental protocol: for the wage-earners for the company's commitment is only possible when it clearly appears as a means to some of their dreams, their ambitions and their projects . realize
Currently accept only the studies from the multi-functional analysis of this conception of motivation among employees.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their enterprise based on a predetermined doxa, which allowed them by their perceived image of the company to estimate what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these factors can mobilize the leaders of their companies 'social performance' control, predict and anticipate human resource management, and place it back in the right place.
So they create a fertile soil that is favorable for the concerted development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Speaking from Oslo: the "just war" Obama brings praise from right
The American right has welcomed on Friday the eve of Barack Obama speech delivered in Oslo and was satisfied that the Peace Prize of 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, the allocation of the prize to Obama on 9 October had ridiculed, this time applauding the President's speech, the example of former vice presidential candidate in the elections of 2008, following Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, said Palin, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the newspaper USA Today, adding that it had placed itself the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war ihrensoeben published memoirs discussed.
The war is obviously the last of which I think the Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists down there, "she says.
Obama, who has inherited two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, has sought on Thursday in Oslo, justify the use of force, a way of explaining his Entscheidungvon nine days to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, was of the opinion that the Präsdent've done in Oslo "a very good job".
I found that the speech was very good, exulted the former President of the House, particularly the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama's acknowledged.
In some parts of this speech habeich entirely historically perceived as explained Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio program "The Takeaway".
The former deputy who is regarded by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for president in 2012, said he was pleased to have seen a "President of the Left," the members of the Nobel Committee recalled the fact that they are "not free had and could not hand over a prize for peace when the use of force would not exist. "
For Michael Gerson, former clerk of George W. Bush and now an editor at the Washington Post, Obama "a very American speech" on hold.
In addition to the fact that he was "cosmopolitan" is how "he always does," he has "talked like an American President," as he pointed out that the Europeans "like living in a security bubble that they created not even have to do and for whose protection it is not much, "said Gerson.
Among the few who was not convinced by the right, the former UN ambassador John Bolton called, a hawk of the Bush era, the discourse on the website of National Review Online as "boring, pompous and inspirationslos.
To the left of the President shows the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich worried about how to defend Barack Obama, the recourse to the armed forces.
Packed letting the war under the guise of justice to justify the massacre of the innocents simply, he warns.
The press of the moderate left, however, remains to praise the President's side.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was awarded to premature Obama, described the speech, even for a speaker like him, who is known for his talent as a "monumental".
Speaking in Oslo "provides a roadmap for the management of international decisions against the conflict, poverty and oppression," so impressed the California newspaper.
The New York Times thinks that Obama "proclaimed the necessary discourse" and described his speech as "somber and exemplary at once".
Sleeper: Three marathons for an agreement that ensures the supply for Christmas
After a three-week marathon negotiations, the unions of the road association and the TLF arrived - the only employers' association, which remained until the end - on Friday night to reach an agreement to stop the strike order and the threat of severe shortage at Christmas to an end.
The signing session on Friday evening, "welcomed" the Secretary of State responsible for transport Dominique Bussereau the agreement, which was launched on Wednesday morning after hearing several weeks.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators broke early Friday morning, hoping to swiftly sign the agreement in the late morning.
And although the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting raised.
However, it passed more than six hours from the start of the meeting at 11:00 clock until the conclusion of the agreement and only at 18:00 clock, the Agreement was signed.
The conflict "might have caused the company a lot of damage" and "it was feared that he would undermine the holidays at the end of the year," said Bussereau.
The agreement provides a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and above by 2.9% for the highest income earners (international shipments).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages, is rising of 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"This is not very much, but we only catch once small," said Patrice Clos (FOR).
The activists are now being told to stop blocking the supply centers.
"However, it will probably always had resisted giving, with the agreement are not satisfied," he added.
The TLF-chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "difficult to grant them wage increases, given the international competition".
According to him, is increasing at 170 euros per month for the low and at 100 to 120 euros for the high-income earners.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for the employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douin (CFTC) spoke of "a historic agreement."
Richard Jaubert (CGT) said that respect, "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the increase in travel costs by 3% and the maintenance of the total budget for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will, in particular, the issue of 13th Tackle monthly salary and the modernization of the collective agreements.
M. Bussereau reiterated that "was the sinking of the duties on employers amounting to 100 million euros," the subject of an amendment to the government's revised bill of finances for 2009 which was passed in the night from Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly .
The government calls "an equal" vote by the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows that the agreement initially applies to this organization for the affiliates, and that they then apply in the case of an extension by the Minister of Labor for the whole profession.
This will "in no time" to be the case, assures Bussereau.
The opposition of the employers' associations can only delay the process.
The association FNTR denounced a "fraudulent trading on" because the 100 million euros, "were the sector to offset part of the carbon tax has already been promised."
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, not discouraged but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but the goose-eaters at the approaching Christmas days, lamented the Unostra.
Otre for the Association Agreement "to small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector over the next 12 months to dig a big grave danger."
RER A: disruption this weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the RATP
The disturbances on the RER line A, the largest train network in France for the Paris and the Ile-de-France, continued at the weekend during a meeting on Friday 2 Strike between the unions and the management of the RATP (the Paris Independent passenger transportation management), can wait for the strikers in their demands for wage increases further.
On this important shopping weekend before Christmas, went 10:00 to 20:00 clock no trains. On the Zentralstrecke (between La Defense and the nation) was only one of two trains and outside the Zentralstrecke only one of four operational trains.
The connection to the SNCF trains were suspended at Nanterre Préfecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
The department store chain Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that seeks "to the RATP, to link congestion on the big stores."

The section of the RATP connects the villages of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre, and Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about a planned intercourse between two trains at peak hours, and almost none during low-traffic times.
As stated on Thursday, there were no crowds on the platforms, since the inhabitants of the Île-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, mainly because of the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) Jack Nbakina, Engineer (29) stated that he would be extra "up one and a half hours early to get on time for work."
The SNCF, which had scheduled a service of passengers by officials and police, pointed out that in the Gare Saint-Lazare had come to no bottlenecks.
Which from the SNCF on the RER line A from or towards Cergy-Le-Haut-operated trains arrived and departed on the Saint-Lazare station to ensure there connection to the metros too.
On Saturday and Sunday were again held meetings of the strikers, while the results were reviewed that had classified boards, after the meeting with the leaders on Friday afternoon as "poor".
The RER CEO suggested the specific elaboration of a protocol for the RER line A in respect of all relevant aspects of work, careers, etc. before.
This is probably not the, what the drivers. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they demand a long-overdue pay.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP set their own wage contract proposals in parentheses, and stressed that the leadership "is not able to solve a problem, whereas with the truckers and the SNCF, but it was also possible."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting was planned for the "comprehensive review of working conditions" for Monday.
This is also the associations that the company ignored the weekend rider.
In the morning, about 150 drivers went to the establishment of a committee in Paris.

The drivers of the RER, which have years of professional experience, obtain a gross wage from 2200 to 2700 euros, plus an additional payment of 600 to 650 euros for shifts, Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolved pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court said on Friday announced the dissolution of the main pro-Kurdish party in the country, a decision that immediately followed the angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the Southeast and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to complicate enormously the work of government, which strives to reach out to the Kurdish community a hand to put the past 25 years-long conflict to an end.
The "Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a" center for activities that are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity, "said the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision to the press.
According to Kiliç the decision would be unanimous getroffenworden of 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes was required to change the resolution's provisions. He also pointed out that 37 of the executives of the party, including the chairman Ahmet Turk and Aysel Tugluk parliamentarian, were excluded for a period of five years from the political scene.

The decision followed a in 2007 initiated by the Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya of Turkey's Federal Court proceedings. He accused the DTP, the "instructions" of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) to follow, which is regarded by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organization.
Many observers are of the opinion that the DTP, the legal political showcase of the PKK's rebels.
The party asserts that "no connection" to have the PKK, but refuses to call them a terrorist organization and calls on the Government to negotiate.
The verdict of the Constitutional Court sparks between the Government, which strives to meet the Kurdish community and to propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds to have the support of the PKK to dry by the Kurds and to put an end to the conflict.
The leaders reaffirm the DTP that a resolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where many demonstrations led to the detention conditions of the PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan in recent weeks clashed with police.
Since the announcement of the court, thousands of demonstrators gathered in front of the premises of the DTP in Diyarbakir in the southeast of the metropolis, which is mainly populated by Kurds.
The police used tear gas grenades and water cannon when demonstrators started throwing Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict Turk was assumed that the decision of the court, "the despair will deepen even further."
"This is Turkey (Kurds, editor's note) issue is not resolvable on the prohibition of a party," he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party that has emerged from the Islamist movement, deplored the decision.
"We oppose on principle against the closure of the parties.
This does not solve the problems, "said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is one Ahmet torpedoing of the democratic opening, which was funded by the government," said the political market observers island.
"You can obviously be prepared for a reaction from the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack in which seven soldiers arrived three days earlier in northern Turkey killed. This was one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it inaccessible as a secret city, for Western visitors.
Zelenograd, was one of ten districts of the capital Moscow, the Soviet Union, a closely guarded secret location for defense research.
Today the community is with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers away from Moscow's center, as "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production facilities for micro-and nanoelectronics are lying here.
Since September 2008 representatives Zelenograd had established contacts to Frankfurt Research Campus Riedberg - with Uniinstituten and the company of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several exchanges of visits on Wednesday and now Zelenograd Riedberg signed in Frankfurt, a "protocol for closer cooperation."
Vice-Mayor of Moscow Yuri Roslyak Anatoly Smirnov and prefect of Zelenograd led the Russian delegation, signed the plan for Frankfurt Councilor Edwin Black.
2010 will be traveling representative of the FIZ and small and medium enterprises in the science Research foci for a seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific Exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it's also about economic relations.
Companies of FIZ is possible to break into the growing Russian market by foot.
Likewise, Russian companies want to get hold of science jobs in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters of major Russian companies and research institutes.
These include for example the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the big corporations and Sitronics Rosssijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for the defense research.
Zelenograd (literally "green city") received its name from the wooded hills, are embedded in the research.
Stuttgart brake
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 can not start high enough.
For the proponents of the project is simply to "the new heart of Europe".
That's right. S21 is much more than the Lowering of a station more than a monstrous construction projects that will plunge the city of Baden-Württemberg's state capital for a decade in construction unholy mess.
Stuttgart 21 is formed from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminal stations with tracks that end up in the middle of the city, then regarded as traffic-engineering of the 19 fossils Century, looking like a modern railway brake blocks, as it once took enormous amount of time, clamping changes locomotives from back to front.
Running in, stop briefly to go further - so it should go.
And therefore the terminal stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And Stuttgart: a transit station, which lies about midway along the trans-European rail-highway between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - hence the slogan "Heart of Europe".
S21 is now being tackled effectively, even though the visions of the 80s no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have recognized that it is in the Hessian and the Bavarian metropolis, almost unaffordable to implement the Lowering.
Terminal stations, however, have no entry and exit problem anymore, since there are modern-pull trains with locomotives and driving at both ends.
Nevertheless, Stuttgart, 21 is in addition to the new ICE line to Ulm is now addressed.
State and local politicians have managed it.
The path joins in and also because bears the risks of the largest infrastructure-specific project of the Republic of taxpayers and not the state group.
Urban design can not reasonably justify the project.
This creates new urban space, which - believe it is the computer-generated graphics of the planners equipped - with lots of greenery.
For the rail transport system is detrimental S21.
The transit station and expansion of the trail are designed for passenger transport, which was ascribed to - typically 80 years - huge growth.
At that time there was not competition from budget airlines.
Contemporary transport policy but it must first aims to enhance the transportation of goods, since transport by rail is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new line is good because of severe slopes not for freight trains.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly affect many other railway projects.
The six billion euros will be Verbuddelt in Swabia.
This is the official figure
Experts last ten until 15 billion to be realistic.
It is established in the next decade the money to other hubs and bottlenecks in the network will be missing.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of Transport.
One of the most important is to develop a good 180-kilometer route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 is built on the track in slow motion.
Urgent need would be to press here on the right tube.
But S21 will act as a brake.
The Rhine Valley line is a bottleneck for the international carriage of goods: in the heart of Europe.
Government is currently ruling the airport
The state government has left open the Wiesbaden diet, whether it will go against the decision of the Hessen Administrative Court (VGH) for night flights in revision.
The CDU / FDP coalition have asked experts to more than 400 pages long can VGH-examine legal verdict, "said Economics Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH Kassel had justified in writing on these days that the country had to reorganize in the case of the construction of the planned northwest runway at Frankfurt airport, the night flights.
The approval of 17 flights between 23 and 5 clock, as mandated by the state government, is not inconsistent with the statutory protection afforded the public from nocturnal aircraft noise.
The coalition needs to 4th January to decide whether it goes against the verdict in revision.
The opposition criticized the postponement and penetrated to the representatives of the Government to waive a revision to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD head Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and FDP, back to their pre-election promises made to a ban on night flights to return. Otherwise, this was seen as a "breach of faith" to.
It's damned difficult when you must keep his word, "said Greens leader Tarek Al-Wazir, alluding to the FDP's campaign slogan," We keep our word. "
Posch minister rejected accusations of pastoral Gümbel, the state government trying to "Rechtsverdreherei and trickery" but come to their night flights.
A detailed legal examination need their time.
The coalition did not operate on the basis of a "quick first impression."
We need a legally Entscheiung said Stefan Müller (FDP).
Thus, as it describes the opposition, the statements of his group have been grounded for the night before.
U.S. banks to pay back support
The troubled U.S. banks shake off their state bonds.
Bank of America on Wednesday (the assistance from the bank rescue fund Tarp totaling 45 billion U.S. dollars over 30 billion euros) back in one fell swoop.
And Citigroup is planning after a report by the U.S. broadcaster CNBC reimburse the state aid.
The institutions want to get rid of the restrictions that have accompanied the adoption of the money - about the limit on payment of Managerboni and to pay high fees.

The rest of the sum she took from her own fund, which was filled with division, inter alia, good sales.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis on Wednesday night expressly thanked the American taxpayer: The cash infusion has helped through a very difficult time.
The money the house had verhoben itself the culmination of the financial crisis with the takeover of investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup intends to procure the liberation of their debts to the State also funds the capital market.
Already on Thursday the U.S. bank with a roughly 20 billion U.S. dollars could announce major increase in its capital, CNBC reported, citing circles.
A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment.
In June, had already been repaid, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, its aid.

Until shortly before the election, there were protests, therefore, in which castigated the political interference in the ZDF was.
Modified as 35 constitutional lawyers had interfered in the debate, which assessed the actions cook as unconstitutional.
Use of it has nothing.
Personal
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 Born in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romance.
He then worked for the Southwest Radio and Frankfurter Rundschau.
1983 Frey moved to ZDF, the first "heute journal".
Subsequent stages: from 1988 to 1990 as personal assistant of the chief editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington, until 1998, director and presenter of the "Morning Magazine", until 2001 Head of the ZDF's foreign policy, and since then head of the ZDF-Capital Studios.
The Greens announced after the election defeat Brenders, who was elected on Wednesday by the industry magazine or media magazine to journalists of the year, a constitutional challenge.
Koch's counterpart at the Board, the Rhineland-Palatinate Premier Kurt Beck, said last week that countries should change the ZDF treaty so that staff proposals of the director can not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
An extract from party politicians from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF also concluded, however, from Beck.
Brenders likely successor, Peter Frey had recommended to the Board with a clever move - by the body immediately after the Brender-unselect fiercely criticized for this.
Thanks to this document journalistic independence could butcher him both without loss of face for the post of chief editor nominated and the Board choose not to be suspected to heave into a partisan office.
In the party arithmetic Frey is already allocated to the left-wing liberals.
Study is debugged
Partial success for the students: After a year of strikes, the Education Ministers of Education drew on at last Thursday with a meeting of Ministers of Education and Rectors' Conference both sides agreed to improve the study conditions at Bachelor and Master to try.
Students should continue to be able to cope with their studies also.
Specifically, they agreed to reduce the examination burden to: Basically, each study module is still only finish with a single test.
In addition, the workload should be reviewed by the students and "a realistic and reasonable level of autonomy."
Policy and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examination results between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to a more flexible joint structure requirements for bachelor's and master's courses.
Any different state regulations will not exist beyond.
Fewer tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, Minister of Education and university rectors saying by the improved manageability to bear in his mouth.
Now it was first filled with a concrete content.
The so-called accreditation council decided to reduce the number of audits partially dramatically: "Each module completes normally with only one test," says a 30-page paper, which is to regulate the admission of new courses of study in part.
With the "significant reduction in the load test," said the Accreditation Council Chairman Reinhold Grimm, should an "aberration to be stopped, which affected the manageability significantly."
In addition, the "manageability is to" continue "the decisive criterion" to be with the design.
Modules such as content were "strictly checked then to" whether "unnecessary narrowing of the students in the choice of
Events would be avoided. "
The students would "get right, margins that allow and encourage individual initiative."
Should apply the rules for authorizing new, but also in the review of existing studies.
These need to be re-accredited every five years "- meaning, however, that it will take until 2015 until all courses have been reviewed.
Responsible for this are ten o'clock nationwide accreditation agencies, under the authority set up by the countries of Accreditation.
The Minister of Education had asked the country in October "with vigor" so influence the agencies that the material wealth is not too large, and the testing regime is not too strict.
In a few states have universities and colleges with the state ministries have agreed to be taken.
Only country so far this said, Rhineland-Palatinate to the further development of the Bologna Process further resources.
Of the money that universities should set up primarily tutoring programs and strengthen Studying and exam and Foreign Offices.
Land and universities want to spend ten million euros.
Early 2010, the Government intends to introduce an amendment to the Higher Education Act into Parliament.
After this is the conclusion of a study model, only one test may be necessary.
The study design should be flexible, also the recognition of credits to guarantee that at other universities and to facilitate access to the master.
By the end of next year, all courses in the country to be assessed for their manageability.
Government and opposition had argued again on Thursday on the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Executive of the Young Socialists academic groups claimed that the design of education policy should in future no longer "behind closed doors," held by the Ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the formation of strike should now have a say and the students as victims, "a word".
Support received by the President of the future graduates of the University Rectors Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experience of the students," she said Thursday during a meeting with the ministers of culture, which advised the HRK on a common reform document.
The Union for Education and Science (GEW) was awarded the Bonn Agreement a total not far enough: it requires a legal right that enables every graduate with a bachelor's degree with access to a secondary master's program.
On the other hand, countries must ensure that available for the current generation of Bachelor's Master's students tomorrow sufficient places with the best possible study conditions is available, GEW board member Andreas Keller.
The countries need to adjust a lot more teachers.
To a freer access to the master, those who were Minister of Culture did not.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Go down in Germany and is beautiful, almost no control ... "reads the opening line of a poem of poet Werner Söllner, in which he addressed in the coming Sprachfetzen disturbing experience of a dissident who has won freedom, but also lost his speaking.
Born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat Werner Söllner later had initially worked as a German and an English teacher in Bucharest and as a lecturer in a children's book publisher before he moved in 1982 after Frankfurt.
Söllner has been awarded several literary prizes, 1993, he held the legendary poetry lectures at the Frankfurt Goethe University, and since 2002 he is head of the Hesse Literature Forum in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
For major non-literary sensation he made last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, when it was a "German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror their Securitateakten.
Visibly uneasy and embarrassed Söllner read out a statement in which he before romania German fellow writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer and his active involvement as IM for the Romanian Securitate admit.
Together with some of those present had received in 1989 the Germans Söllner Sprachpreis.
The recruitment efforts have begun insidiously, first 1971st
I concluded Söllner, "so someone who has not resisted attempts to intimidate the Securitate enough."
The poet is Werner Söllner IN Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize award for Herta Mueller and their unprecedented literary analysis of the mechanisms of dictatorial rule has been rocked the literary scene and in particular the community of German authors from Romania by a case that makes the abysses and the infamy of a political system indicated that at based surveillance and spying.
Werner Söllner, so far we can say according to current academic knowledge, not only perpetrators but also victims.
In his Securitate file had played a role in IM, Walter, said after the confession Söllner the literary scholar Michael Markel and pointed to the positive influence of IM for him Walter.
He had carved out for him in all his delicate time points, ' "said Markel.
As he was a moral need to make this remark.
Söllner statement was unexpected in the manner and before this audience, a complete surprise is the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian Intelligence Service does not.
Germany was a cozy sanctuary for Securitate informers were, Herta Müller had written back in July in time, after she had read her own file, 914 pages.
The person concerned, one may suppose, to speculate and have known in many a case, probably, clear name which hid behind the pseudonym Sorin, Voicu programs and also Walter.
Unlike in this country now very verfahrenssicheren sighting of the Stasi files is how to deal with the legacy of the Securitate surveillance is still very vague.
A systematic reconnaissance has been thwarted and hindered in recent years.
One of the Birthler authority of appropriate National Council for Research on the Securitate files (CNSAS) was founded only in 1999, the publication of the acts passed since then, however, rather slow.
Only since 2005 there is a law that governs the management of files.
That the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very large, occupied after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Muller interview in which a former Securitate chief in Timisoara expressed disapproval of the winner.
She had a psychosis, and finally they had interrogated only once.
The infamy of the power of thought here expressed openly in the guise of freedom of expression can too.
Certainly are connected with the case Sollner, as is so often associated with silent guilt, inevitable questions.
Why now? Who was harmed? The prudent response by the listener on Söllner confession gives hope that the continuation of this chapter is rather of curiosity than of blame and shame to be determined.
The genesis of the work by Herta Muller, who yesterday received the Nobel Prize, it is more than a footnote.
Saturation Supplement Champions League
It looked as if there would be just a smartly dressed sales staff from a very nice Christmas party that had spread to the sporting goods manufacturer goodies, as the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag, of the operator a quarter past midnight, summoned to a C-Class increased. ¨
The man with the distinctive bald head could be because of his chauffeured still strange city.
Otherwise, he would have to drive themselves - alcohol was not finally in the game, and drunk with happiness of the 55-year-old was just as little.
Was a pleasant evening before, but the morning we continue to work flat.
Or just really going on.
In the words of the first three days previously committed Schweitzer: "We've reached the knockout stages," namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1-win against Unirea Urziceni in Romania, "but we must not be blinded by the success: It will be a brutally tough fight against relegation. "
The more important task "was imminent on Sunday.
Then, we repeat in Mainz, the king class performance in league everyday life.
And certainly bring further weakness revealed by the quick three goals by Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.).
Draw
The knockout stages of the Champions League (first legs 16-17. + 23-24 February / Rückspiele 9-10. + 16-17. March) is on 18 Drawn in December in Nyon.
The joy over the brilliant debut from Babbel successor remained subdued so.
Not only at the supposed savior, who had negotiated the uncertain Stuttgart professionals in the short time self-confidence, commitment and joy.
I went up to the players and told them that they should reflect on their strengths, and they had continued to be bolder, said Gross, shrink it as simple-sounding recipe for success, which had produced under a therapist Babbel, but no longer effective.
He has sparked a certain magic, "admitted Babbel supporters Jens Lehmann," when is a new momentum in football, sometimes things happen, no one would have thought possible. "
And Sami Khedira, who advanced after weeks of injury break, thanks to its momentum equal to the best player on the field, tried to found a "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh air" and describing the operation of the new boss: "He is a man who upheld and discipline required.
That is what we need in the current situation. "
Under Babbel had it clearly lacked.
VfB Stuttgart had not yet turned the corner, warns Sports Bureau Horst Heldt
VfB Stuttgart, but needs above all consistency.
How Gross were careful because even players and managers before the victory against a ersatzgeschwächte and completely overwhelmed by the Romanian Defense score overestimate.
They would have won in Glasgow, before it arrived four days later in Leverkusen 0:4 at the rude awakening, there Khedira consider.
And Sport Board Horst Heldt warned that there is a season goal has been achieved, but the other was still a distant prospect.
We are not yet on the mountain.
That Heldt on his 40th Birthday was even after the first home victory in three months not to feel like celebrating, lay in the events of the weekend, in the form of a freshly revived immediately before kick-off broadcast television interviews from goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that countered meet others and not of Jens Lehmann's Heldt, the harsh criticism.
He had been accused of weak leadership and the board decided to change coaches to pressure pubescent fans have.
Also the fact that his day had been canceled after the games, Lehmann appreciated as a sign of lack of sovereignty and resentment.
Lehmann's statements were "characterized by pure selfishness," lashed back and announced Heldt consequences for the fullback.
They are probably no more friends for life, the forty-two.
Nevertheless, they were united with all others is that without the preparatory work by the detached coach the team playfully combative and strong performance would have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share in the success," said Heldt and Lehmann in unison - and the man with the plastic bag, agreed.
World Championship Heavyweight Fight
Fiery duel in Bern: Time and again provoked challenger Kevin Johnson champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds of Ukrainians defended his heavyweight title by the WBC version.
The verdict of the judges was made unanimously.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko is boxing world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old champion after defeating WBC version of the federation in the early hours of Saturday in Bern, the American Kevin Johnson unanimous decision (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko, it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainians already twice world champion of the WBO and WBC groups.
Unfortunately, it did not work with the Co, expects to have all.
Klitschko building his record to 39 victories in 41 professional fights, twice he had to be defeated because of injuries.
Johnson had challengers in the 24th Fight the first defeat suffered.
Before some 17,000 spectators in the arena of the Bernese 2.02 meters wide Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight, especially with his left hand lead.
The eleven inches smaller Johnson, had announced before the duel of the end of Klitschko era, but again escaped the blows of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous right into the decisive goal.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and was just trying to make ends.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his shots hit the world champions but only rarely.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went with Klitschko over the entire distance of twelve rounds.
The challenger had seen before the fight in the Swiss capital of some turmoil.
He insulted Klitschko as "ugly zombie" who can "not correct".
Weighing could be the champion on Friday will provoke, push Johnson sunglasses from his nose, "to be able to see his eyes."
Fourth victory for Klitschko's Comeback
Klitschko was also in his fourth fight in his comeback on 11 October 2008 victorious.
After almost four-year break, he had beaten the time the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and "his" WBC belt recalled that he had previously submitted without a fight.
This year he defeated in his title defenses Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and Chris Arreola in September from the U.S..
I've gotten in this fight only once, and am physically in good shape, Klitschko had justified the rapid return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the unification of all four major titles in the family.
Brother Wladimir is the WBO and IBF champion of the associations.
The belt of the WBA, but the Briton David Haye claims that after he was dethroned in November to 2.13 meters wide Nikolai Valuev.
Haye had earlier called off a planned summer for September fight against Vitali Klitschko.
Apparently the promotion is already the company now plans to fight Klitschko in London's Wembley Stadium.
Case Kunduz
Has a frontal attack from the opposition: the Open Group Chairman, Defense Minister Jürgen Trittin Guttenberg known for giving false information to Kunduz affair as a liar.
SPD and the Left demand clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg / Berlin - After the recent evidence relating to the bombing of Kunduz, the opposition Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU), a deliberate deception assumed.
The Minister had the deadly bombing of two fuel trucks in September, "knowingly untrue," said Green parliamentary group leader said Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news show "Tagesschau".
It's called popularly: He lied.
The order to kill had been issued in violation of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).
This has been read, the substance of the report, had the NATO, which Mr. Guttenberg said Trittin.
On Friday it became known that it was the attack not only the destruction of the hijacked truck, but also to selectively kill two Taliban leaders.
In the Kunduz by the German commander, Colonel Klein had requested U.S. air strike, according to NATO investigation report up to 142 people were killed or injured.
Greens, the SPD and the Left on Sunday called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to submit immediately to the Bundestag and to clarify what Guttenberg had really known about the incident.
Ms Merkel must determine whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the Afghanistan policy of the federal government - and whether there have endorsed Chancellor's Office, Army and intelligence service, this new strategy, called Jürgen Trittin and Green Mrs Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism back decided.
The Chancellor did not refer to specific deployments of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan influence, he said.
On Saturday questioned the representation of the Ministry about the background of the sacking of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert had been voiced.
According to information from SPIEGEL both Guttenberg properly and fully informed about the background of the tank-truck-bombing.
Officially, she had said that they had denied the existence of NATO, the minister denied reports and sensitive details.
From the environment of the two top officials, however, rumored that they had made even the Department of Defense on several reports, including a two-page document of befehlhabenden Colonel Klein and a Military Police report.
Wichert is now said to have sent a letter to clarify the facts, reports the Frankfurter Allgemeiner Zeitung Sunday.
One answer he had not been received, they say.
The ministry said on Saturday not to the allegations and pointed out that the matter would be clarified in the inquiry of the Bundestag, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
Dreamscapes
Some see in the waking state pictures and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only for the mentally ill and on drugs blur the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we lie with closed eyes in our dark rooms, we must give ourselves the wildest ideas, and uninhibited imagination forms.
However, those who experienced the waking dream-like state, sees and hears things that others do not see or hear is, in the modern Western world, mostly as crazy or a drug addict, at least as eccentric.
But such images and voices are not only persons of unsound mind or on drugs.
The guilt of our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, and sometimes to ensure that the boundaries between dream, illusion and reality.
Changes may occur Wachbewusstseinszustände dreamlike in many different forms, in the best case, we call them visions, delusions at worst.
Although cause and effect may be different, can the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophets, Carlos Castaneda, shamanic Entrückungszustände, psychosis and hallucinations, but attributed to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of neuronal messengers in the brain - most notably dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - derailed and the interaction of different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional ideas occur most frequently during a schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him
The connection between madness and dreams has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood as a form of dream hallucinations when awake, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted 1861 a "great similarity of insanity with dream states, for Sigmund Freud was the dream at all" a psychosis, with all the absurdities, delusions , hallucinations such.
It is autumn 2001, when Henning T. transforms into a cartoon character.
His body is two-dimensional and quietschbunt.
Gravity has no power over him, he floats to the ceiling.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devil with blood-red figures, distorted faces, snarling.
They chase him, kicking him with heavy boots, flaming, throw him against the wall, he can feel the pain all over my body.
Loud, vicious voices booming out from the walls and radio.
He can no longer bear the voices that berate him and insult.
Henning T. pulls two cables from the stereo, she knotted into a noose, and fastened to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbed onto a speaker and puts the noose around his neck.
Jumps.
The noose dissolves.
You shall be a lesson to the screaming voices in the choir trommelfellzerfetzendem, "go to the hospital and let heal you!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last is 2 years back, the first nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective, paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, he takes medication against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In the worst I have experienced psychosis, anxiety and deep despair, he says.
The illusions are cruel reality
About one percent of the population infected at least once in your life with schizophrenia in psychiatric hospitals, they will be treated as second most common illness after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, sufferers can often not distinguish between inner and outer world, they fall into an overexcited state of hallucination, size, relationship, or may cause paranoia.
Particularly common is hearing voices - voices that command a comment, or a dialogue.
Also, visual hallucinations are not uncommon.
The person concerned can not separate the important from the unimportant to filter out unwanted signals, the brain can no longer consciousness is overwhelmed by impressions.
As the dream also opens the floodgates for psychosis in a flood of ideas and fantasies that originate from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, "says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the Clinic for General Psychiatry in the University Hospital of Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is located in the center of things, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he will, like in a dream, overwhelmed by the events and it can not actively make.
Schizophrenic thus often feeling threatened, controlled and manipulated.
An adjustment is a reality they usually not possible, the phantoms are excluded cruel reality, waking up.
Once in a life have experienced a hallucination
Unlike in the dream, "says Fox," but remains the sensory and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in psychosis, basically. "
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based in reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in a real context.
Why, exactly, our brain capers proposes to provide researchers are still puzzled.
States of emergency in every man can cause he briefly loses the reference to reality, "says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the sole determining factors.
Researchers believe that, where parties minimal brain damage or wear.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain at an early stage of development is disrupted by a viral illness of the mother during pregnancy, for example, says Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery how the disruption of the neural system is reached where the question is initially manifested over many years not at all.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic events may trigger psychosis if the disposition is available.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can induce psychosis, as they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brain is running hot
This is insane, suffering from psychotic hallucinations and swallow their expensive drugs to get rid of, others are spending money on drugs to get what, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Luebeck.
Whether illusions are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant, is often just a matter of position.
Box collects a decade reports of hallucinations and Trugerscheinungen, last year he has analyzed his results in the book "The unreal world in our head."
Although hallucinations are a typical concomitant symptoms of psychosis, but also a surprising number of other diseases.
These include not only mental disorders such as depression often borderline or even illnesses such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease and traumatic brain injury.
Surprisingly hallucinating under certain conditions even the brain of healthy people.
Hallucinations, such castes, are composed of memory contents that are normally withheld.
They are formed when areas of the brain where sensations are processed, over-active or inhibited little, if our brain is running hot or if the stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can cause this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also sensory deprivation, stress, heartache, or other mental states of emergency.
In recent studies, gave up a third of respondents having experienced at least once in life is a hallucination.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attends high school.
A normal girl, actually.
If it were not for the images and voices.
During the intermission, it may happen that a lanky boy with long dark hair, it appeals.
When he replied that the classmates are amazed to see - no one else sees or hears the boy.
Hold the unspun Tagträumerin for a shy girl, but Sarah K. has not dreamed that she knows.
She is awake, she hears and sees this kid, just like her the girl in the bank beside her sees and hears.
She can feel his presence even, at least for the moment.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, She wonders sometimes.
But she knows that this boy and the other illusions are real and vanish again.
At night, the symptoms are usually scary
Often, the Mirage is a drag.
If she is sitting in the classroom, they can not follow the curriculum at times because of the teachers in their eyes and ears just imagine the new classmate, while for all other audible and visible at the blackboard explaining mathematical equations.
At night, the symptoms are often frightening.
If she waits in her dark room to sleep, which occurs far too infrequently and too late, they often can not distinguish whether she is awake or dreaming even if the pictures that she sees the faces or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, before their eyes open or closed arise.
Leave me alone, she cries in the figures.
Parents and friends telling them about it, which would consider them crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
It has existed in the past year, the high school and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations have stopped.
Since she started on the Internet contact with the psychologist box, she knows that she is not crazy.
Delusion is a work of art out of desperation
If someone is socially isolated or suffer from sensory deprivation, he is highly likely after a while, hallucinations, says Kasten.
I suspect that the brain is then underemployed and even provide for his entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, had a little girl afraid of other children, they often played alone.
Their hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she called Daddy, since she can remember, is not her biological father.
Because visual and auditory hallucinations of the same brain areas are active, which also handle real sights and sounds, it is concerned how Sarah K. difficult to distinguish between illusions and reality. "Every experience," says Box, "will take place in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that gives rise to the brain, which is why they become so real "
Even nocturnal dreams evaluates caste as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations and healthy subjects did not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics are mentally healthy in a position to recognize their phantasms as to be unreal.
Box advises his patients, therefore, appreciate the hallucinations as a special ability.
Limit state between dream and hallucination
In our imaginary world is too much bewusstseinszentrierten experience, unfortunately most pathologized says Michael Schmidt Degenhard, a professor in Heidelberg and Medical Director of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of Florence Nightingale Hospital in Dusseldorf.
A psychosis is a severe and painful disease, but it also carries positive, creative - madness is also a work of art out of desperation.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called Oneiroid form of experience, a special form of dream-altered waking consciousness.
Oneiroid are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, which holds the experiencing it for real, and even after the event can not be distinguished from the waking state.
The Oneiroid state of consciousness arises in extreme trauma or illness, for example polyradiculitis patients who experience the fully conscious, a motor paralysis.
When is a man of self and loss of the world is threatened, possibly by sustained, complete inability to move, it replaces the real life situation through its own imaginary world, which is decoupled from the real world, says Schmidt Degenhard.
A sort of limit state between dream and hallucination.
Since the deal with a situation in reality is not possible, there will be a changing world, the real situation is being re-presented in the imagination.
An intense form of sink meaningfulness and meaning in an inherently intolerable situation, which allows us to design their own human ability, not a nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen Oneiroid describes his experiences in his book "heart change" as a bailout of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness for days after heart valve replacement surgery, followed by cardiac transplantation goes on trips, while his body is doomed to immobility in the ICU.
Claussen is immersed in a self-created world, visiting alien times and places: He experiences himself as a bedridden old man aboard a Zugsanatoriums, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages, nobles under producing drugs from blood.
Is kidnapped by a Greek on the bike in his home country, surf with his hospital bed in the firn in the Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
He goes entirely to the imaginary events, all is real, though later in his memory.
These inner journeys are different for Claussen fundamentally different from every dream.
Dream is another state, he describes his experience.
On the other hand, are my memories from mental Travel abundantly clear even after years and in minor details.
Clearer and more intense than even really experienced.
The intensity of this experience is beyond the horizon of our other life-experiences, "says the psychiatrist Schmidt Degenhard.
Ultimately show Oneiroid, psychosis, hallucinations and drug intoxication, how fragile our internal representations of external reality are also in the waking state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, says the psychologist box "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that may well also be enriching.
The snow fall can occur
Burda
Children should take over the publishing company with 27 years
The new Executive Publisher Kallen is an intermediate solution: Hubert Burda long run will give his company into the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding company will include in the future to 100 percent of the family.

Both children inherit at age 27 and have the firm intention to enter into the company, "said the 69-year-old told SPIEGEL.
The details we have laid down as a precaution.
The question of whether they are also active in the industry to meet, at a later date.
The question of whether they are able to do so.
It can not be set before 7500 employees his children, if they are not sufficiently competent.
That brings the children to and the company as well.

With regard to cases Schickedanz and Schaeffler said Burda, that not even family businesses are safe from destruction: "It always affected families who were infected by a Kapitalsucht, which completely speculation and thought they could get it to really big Players climb.
My strategy was never.
He had "never had dreams of world power," said Burda.
I do not see myself as political tutor of this country, as was the runner, and I will not even in the World League with 'Time' to play, these shops have become too large.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is limited äuβerst, a device with which you only can read his e-mails, without a chance to see some attachments, or may be able to surf the internet.
It has enjoyed his five minutes of fame, when Time magazine chose it as one of the products of the year.
To see it on the street, it is unlikely, but the idea itself is still mainly for young people of interest.
In contrast to the Smartphone Peek costs very little and has a very low flat rate, for example, only half the price of the flat of an iPhone.
As the company has seen success with it, it has launched two new devices on the market: one that is intended only for Twitter, the other with a lifetime free service for data, in contrast to the Peek, which is six times higher in price pay.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the event Le Web, is the European version of this invention, and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as his American counterpart, however, has a surprise in store.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros a month, including roaming across Europe.
Those who know to stay with a smartphone around the world already, what does it mean to have to give up all the data in order to be able to read his emails once you have crossed the border or when you desperately looking for a cafe with WIFI ( or connectivity) with Fon.
The idea of roaming with a flat rate is incredibly seductive, and should actually already be for a long time possible.
It is true that some phone vendors already offer special contracts and prices for trips abroad, but in my experience, you need to have a PhD in physics and a good pair of spectacles to read all the fine print can.
The repeated criticism by the European Commission in relation to affordable roaming rates across Europe were almost always ignored.
Auβerhalb of their own country there is always afraid to read his emails, and rightly so.
That a small device like FonPeek (although it is always is amazing that it is called Fon, although there is no WiFi / WLAN features) can offer this type of charge means that phone vendors need to rethink slowly but surely begin and consider various possibilities into consideration, as they can use their data network.
Kindle is this another good example, in its prices to download books and other questions is contained in the Internet.
Without contract and without hooks.
This is an Internet-enabled device and you'll pay for it only once, namely the purchase, and not every month.
And that is exactly what I expect one day of FonPeek, an Internet shopping available with life as it already offers the Peek in the U.S..
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I am of the opinion that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to be able to see once a computer with the same system.
The color Fetish by Michelle
Yellow is without doubt the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Even the inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of paint and has the same color again voted to him by his, no doubt assist, the second most important moment in his life: the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has taken on both occasions very similar models, auβer that it was almost the same color - a bright green, yellow - which consisted of three parts clothes - dress, jacket and coat from the same cloth, and for that she wore something groβförmig embroidered or a necklace.
It even goes so far that it had at first sight seem that the First Lady of the United States would follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress in more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses but very much in the fabric, are made from.
At the inauguration, she wore a gown of lace and one out in Oslo patterned velvet.
Even the accessories were different: the first time green shoes with medium-high gold heels and the second time änhliches indeed a model, but.
Also, the hairstyle was different every time: The hair was pinned up on this occasion as a fringe of hair, she wore the previous open the hair.
75% of working mothers have received because of her motherhood issues in the work
The discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have kids.
This was the result of the CSIC, in collaboration with the Institute for Women study, "Fertility and careers of women in Spain."
The survey of 9737 women aged between 15 and 75 years leaves no doubt: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labor market due to their limited maternity.
The study reveals that there Height differences in the decision to start a family and gives the number of children, depending on whether women work or not and if so, what kind of work they perform.
Those of them who do the auβerhalb of the house no other activity, work only part time or have no fixed employment, and mothers are more likely to have more children.
In contrast, the women move to a permanent position, especially in the public sector, to start a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group 35 to 49 years with a permanent position had their first child on average only 3.7 years after the contraction, a figure which increased to 4.1 years for women with a fixed appointment, which is no longer needed have to do this and have their contraction and the first child realized until much later.
HOT STUFF has the kind of work a big influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar terms of receptivity, "explains the CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
Educational attainment is another factor to be considered during the age of women at marriage and first child needs.
According to the survey, the age at time of marriage and first child is higher, the higher the educational level.
This difference could be detected even when the women the same age.
For example, the women were in the group 35 to 49 years, depending on whether they have only the secondary school or higher education, an average of a 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time mother.
Furthermore, there are, depending on their level of education, another difference between the women.
While the women marry at the main overall conclusion even before their first permanent position and have their first child, making it the women with a middle or high school and looking the other way around, only a permanent position and then get married and then had their first child, says Delgado.

Cowardly aggression
My 70-year-old mother last week went for a walk through our neighborhood in the town of Fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people 15 to 18 years were running next to her and our dog, our dog is a hybrid, which we got from the shelter and of just six pounds weight, and then out of nowhere they missed him two kicks and injured him so severely.
Our anger can not even put into words because it is incomprehensible to us, where is there supposed to be the fun at a cheap aggression against a small, helpless animal that was obviously running on a leash.
Not including the choking, which was a woman who was walking comfortably, as if to rebuke these people because of the incident, she even feared for their lives, because if such a lunatic attacked a dog, he is perhaps the same with a woman, a child, an elderly gentleman, or even likely to make anyone weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally peaceful city by five clock in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog howled all day long.
Of course, we have made in a nearby police station to display, however, we have still a lot of doubt whether it will even bring some order to avoid any prejudice, and from the outset, we wish to make to that cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our outrage at what has happened has led us to view this incident.
We can not understand what is going on in the minds of these young people must ensure that they have a cheap attack on a helpless animal amused to see on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good are still education and respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tire manufacturer Michelin has in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Traffic Safety (Fesvial a campaign) to promote helmet use, particularly among younger motorcyclists launched, as both companies are announcing today.
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of helmet use, since this is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in case of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of their commitment in terms of road safety, "encompasses much more than just how to design and manufacture of products that are becoming safer with each passing day," and further reiterated that even with other actions educational and informative, contribute to realizing this goal every day one step.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be running', will be distributing posters in a first phase in over 500 bike shops in order to achieve the best possible dissemination.
In conclusion, Michelin said that road safety "a constant concern" is the company, which is precisely the reason that it commits itself as a manufacturer of tires for two cars rädige always to see that one of its main objectives the development of ever-safer products must be.
The sale of small trucks is rising again slightly
After nearly two years of the auto market for light trucks finally beginning to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9425 vehicles, which were approved in November in Spain, represent an increase of 12.6% with respect to the year 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first ever increase after 22 consecutive months of steady decline, pursuant to the manufacturer's association ANFAC and the Auto Dealers' Association Ganvam numbers presented.
These good figures, however, currently enjoy groβer only with caution, because the reference data used for comparison of November 2008, which is a particularly bad Verkausjahr was associated with a decrease of 60% for the preceding year.
However, one must bear in mind that, apart from the increase are in the last month, the total number of admissions of 11 months still 40% below the sales of the previous fiscal year.
Since January a total of 95,853 vehicles were sold in this figure are, however, all vehicles that make up the small van market, include: the descendants of passenger cars, pickups, vans, small vans and small trucks lighter / chassis.
Furthermore, are still the same storm clouds on the horizon, which attract demand in the most affected, because even if some of the vehicles are purchased by individuals who goes Groβteil sales to small and medium enterprises, which in almost 100% of all cases, the purchase with an active third-party financing.
How should we add to these restrictions, which are the result of the twisted end of the credit tap money einschlieβen, additional factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
In this view, and unlike the passenger cars have the financial support to help with the purchase of a vehicle of the plan 2000E little.
This plan is intended not only for individuals but also self-employed and small businesses have a right to if they are a small van up to 3.5 tonnes of CO2 emissions, not to exceed 160 grams per kilometer may want to buy But the low sales figures speak for themselves
Just yesterday Ganvam was reminded that it is absolutely necessary part of the state to send a special attention to these small trucks, and of course to the industrial vehicles (trucks and buses) to.
The Automobile Dealers Association predicted for 2010, a similar straight year as the past, for which it expects a loss of sales (passenger cars and SUVs) by 19%.
The support for braking in critical situations is now a must
As was already at the ABS anti-lock brake system and how it is happening now with the ESP stability control, the auxiliary systems for braking in an emergency a duty equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly registered passenger cars and light vans, for the remaining vehicles a waiting period was fixed by the end of February 2011.
The adopted by the European Union's provision setting aims to improve the protection of Fuβgänger, although this may help brake systems due to their working practices also help prevent many rear-end collisions.
The task of the Emergency Brake Assist is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical braking maneuver, which the system recognizes the driver executed by the braking force on the brake pedal.
However, this system exerts this pressure is not until the end.
According to a manufacturer of components for vehicles, the Bosch-commissioned inquiry, came third of drivers involved in an accident before the collision not even to step on the brake pedal, and half of them had not slowed down with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The braking means engages the other hand, with the maximum force in the braking system and thereby reduces the braking time, and hence the braking distance that a car travels during braking.
According to a study by the EU every year up to 1,100 fatal accidents, which could be prevented Fuβgänger be harmed, if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assist.
It would even give them fewer accidents - one expects that one accident could be prevented or injury - when the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems are popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that (using radar or a camera detects) obstacles and warns the driver, but it also carries even a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver then responded, helped him, the system hopes to increase the pressure on the brake pedal, if it would be necessary.
If the driver does not react to the warning, and even if the collision is already inevitable, Brake Assist exerts the maximum pressure on the brakes to keep in this way the damage as small as possible.
A plan for General Motors Opel moves to January
While the workforce at the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza already) by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, have been informed that will start production of the new Meriva in the first week of April, probably on 8, According to Javier Ortega, who has the American car manufacturers point out that he needs more time to bring the rescue plan for Opel to a conclusion.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, will in fact achieve that the affected side gives its consent to each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason it may be that will be deferred to the final document that is first presented to the workers and then the governments of countries where there are works until early 2010.
Dementgegen is insured by GM that it will take on in the coming days, a decision on the sale of Saab.
Since it is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on American car makers, so that as soon as possible makes a decision.
GM admits, with some potential new buyers are in contact with.
One such buyer may be Geely, which would also like to buy Volvo, however, the option of the manufacturer of the Holland Skyper sports car that has the backing of Russian group Converge wins increasingly popular.
If it should come with any of these buyers in an agreement that GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision, Saab are closing the end of the year, if it has not been sold by then, will also continue to maintain.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel, the engineers of the Boxster S used as a basis and managed to really make it lighter by 80 pounds, with which he brings now only 1275 kilos.
To create such a thing, they gave first to the automatic folding roof that was replaced with a canvas roof with a manual drive, so it alone has saved 21 pounds, thanks to the aluminum used in this model as the doors of the GT3 "vanish" for another 15 , by removing the air conditioning again 13; HOT STUFF we have reduced the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, into savings of more than 7 pounds, by the installation of athletic Bacquet seats 12 and again with the lightweight 19-inch wheels again five saves.
Then there was also by the omission of the audio system CDR-30 again six kilos less and achieved through the replacement of door handles with handles made of fabric, the lack of pounds.
Although it is available with the dual-clutch gearbox PDK is the test drive was carried out using a vehicle with a 6-course manual transmission, mainly in the smaller Landstraβen of California, on mountain trails, as these were really winding.
During his ride, you can give him the note perfectly.
The reduction of its weight but has no way to geführtdass he would now lie not so sure on the street.
It is rather the opposite: we have long since no longer so small and light model driven test that informs a while but there was also a sense of security among groβer curves, even at high speed.
He is a little athlete in a position to warm up his muscles in a low gear in the required time until we give him the orders to rave, brake, recover and then again everything out of his engine ... get
He does everything he is told. The car does everything that we indicate to him with our hands on the wheel, thanks to its steering, which is just as communicative as well as accurate.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
An engine sound for all tastes
The sound of his boxer V6 with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and it can not increase with the 'sport' option as well as through a system that can change the engine noise, which has already been the first time to the Panamera was used.
The acceleration is unimaginable brutality, whether out of the stand or when re-accelerating.
The springs are strong, but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the Landstraβen, where we took the Boxster Spyder, was already quite damaged, but the car has mastered well the potholes.
The electronic assistant had to do on the twisting, almost nothing at all, and that, although we have some of these curves ice at dawn and gravel found in the morning.
In summary one can say that it is an ultra-light car, a car with which it has an incredible driving fun, as it otherwise there probably are rare and do much more to him than just a small improvement in the Boxster S's.
The car will cost to come to market in February 2010 and 70,831 euros.

Teletovic already beginning to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, even iff lieβen to "guess minus six" Evaluation of cluster already that this would not be the best night of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, the game was, despite the marked advantage in the break still far from decided, and the Maccabees wanted to Vitorianer once again remind you that not everyone is a winner on their board, and thanks to the constantly attacking "Hand by Elías" they came back into the game .
Pnini and Eidson were crucial to ensuring that turned around the "Yellow" at the helm (50-49).
More disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, hurt, but anything but dead, had to prepare a few moves with precision, to regain air and one of them suddenly came the pistol by Mirza Teletovic, with three almost consecutive three times and with the support of Ribas English and made sure that was displayed on the scoreboard again einberuhigender distance of (54-67), which could adorn the host at the end of the third quarter with (57-67).
The Alaveses were bloβgestellt in the last quarter, and English, and San Emeterio (60-75) has already announced that they would allow anyone to take away the victory that they had honestly earned during the first thirty minutes, again.
Nevertheless, resigned Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team and not trying to give back their team by three points from the line from (70-77) force.
Nevertheless, and despite split was made because of fouls by the court, gave the team not to Ivanovic, who defended well and although the Israelis still caught up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already been a winner and lost to Tel Aviv the first time this season.

The Brazilian government has set the residence of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa a deadline.
The compulsory retirement from office the President must be diplomatic representation not later than 27 January 2010verlassen if seinMandat officially expires
Catunda Francisco, the Commercial Counselor of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to the TV station TV Globo that "Mel" white, that before that date, the message in which he since 21 September had found asylum, must have left.
"He is the bewuβt that he must go on 27 January when his mandate expires on that day and he must seek a new accommodation."

This, however, foundered on the refusal Zelayas to recognize the status of asylum-seeking politician who wanted to impose on him the "de facto" government headed by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much!
According to the most alluring of days since last spring, which was the inflation of assets, the prevailing mood in the markets is the markets have returned the uncertainty, which is surprising in any case, since this is their natural state in an environment where which the brokers to make decisions about inherently uncertain future.
Applied to stabilize the markets, the provision setting was to settle the debts with the direct purchase of assets and to have free rein in liquidity indirectly, interest rates, which move to zero in order to buy the banking assets in this manner for billing.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are as good as over, and without compromising their heterodox policy on liquidity in question must begin to sprinkle a little sand in the wheels, as is the BCE NAEC has already demonstrated how, with their annual auction, Next week will take place.
Therefore, the investors doubting the ability of the global economy to sustain the economic recovery without these heterodox MEASURES and we are currently witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premia.
The volatilities of the stock market and the differences in the Unternehmensboni rise again, even if they are still far from paranormal from the sums which they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states have been forced to nationalize the private risk and public debt to rise again.
It is now back on quality and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred refuge for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences of the euro-zone countries in respect to Germany.
Spain has so far been hardly affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new downward revision on the Review of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not hurt to bring the defenders of moral hazard to silence that had once tried to create among the leaders of world economic policy awareness, for that what she had caused, because the devastating effects they , which led to the restriction of loans to loss of jobs, had slowed down as if they had actually beschlieβen Thanks to a new day of action should be.
Nevertheless, what has happened in Dubai, an indicator of a tribal war between the Emirs to restore power in the UAE and the development in Greece has also been predicted earlier.
A government that conceals the national debt, elections and a new government, which draws on the same strand.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that the Ecofin Hungary at the beginning of the year saves from abroad to meet their payments and therefore a euro member country admits to meet its obligations anymore.
However, it is logical that the Ecofin, the Greek government has forced to be transparent and take its citizens in need of auβergewöhnlicchen measures in order of their duty to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, we are, as expected from an episode of normalization of risk premiums, would after a few excesses on excessive amounts, which now lie within the expected One.
In the case of Spain, you have to worry as long as the differences of the national debt increased at the same speed as the European Unternehmensboni.
Dannn If, however, diminish the differences in European and Spanish to increase further, it would be this is a Spanish special risk.
The Standard & Poor's is a farce. While early indicators show a local market research Groβteil are forced to bring forward their scenarios for the recovery and to correct their scenario for 2011 upwards, including by OECD and the European Commission, which promises to once again come along with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all despite warnings not have a long life.
