A republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
The republican leaders justifièrent their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre as a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States that the number of people killed by lightning.
Furthermore, the lawyers Republicans have identified that 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will affect negatively the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will undermine the US democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, US states are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of US governments promulguèrent from 2009 new laws making more difficult the registration process or vote.
This phenomenon has grown after the elections in November 2010 which saw add 675 new republican representatives in 26 states.
Accordingly, 180 projects of laws restricting the right to vote in 41 states were introduced during the one year of 2011.
The new election laws require that voters have an identity card with a photograph and proof of US citizenship.
Moreover, these laws also reduce the periods of vote in anticipation, invalidates the right to register as a voter polling day and withdraw the citizens have a judicial matter their right to vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no state american required voters to present an identity card with a photograph.
The Indiana became the first state to make such a demand.
The Supreme Court of the United States in 2008 upheld the constitutionality of the law in Indiana.
The authorities are republican empressèrent to extend this to other states.
Over the past two years, sponsors of the bill in 34 states to force voters to present an identity card with a photograph.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, american citizens have no identity card as the map of universal health insurance.
In fact, 11% of american citizens, 21 million people of voting age, have no identity cards with photo issued by a government agency in their state.
Furthermore, five million new voters in 2012 will not have such a piece of identity.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the identity card required.
The new restrictions will disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and those on low incomes.
In fact, 25% of african-Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000; 18% of people over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not possess the identity card required with photo.
Much more.
The students, voters considered voting more for the democratic candidates are not allowed in several states to use their identity card with a photo issued by their institution.
However, these same states allow members of clubs fishing or hunting who vote more on the republican side to use for voting cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no state demanded proof of citizenship to vote.
The Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are american citizens.
These measures are clearly intended to limit the hispanic vote.
However, it appears that two in three hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
Moreover, republican legislators have sponsored in 2011 laws revoking the registration of voters on polling day in eight states.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters to register.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, in the general election in 2004, campaigns for voter registration have contributed to record approximately 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have dropped by 17%, the rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, republican legislators have passed laws in five other states to reduce the voting period in anticipation.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the electorate who voted in advance were african-Americans, when they accounted for 13% of voters in the state.
It was the same with Hispanics.
They accounted for only 11% of voters, but 24% of people who voted in anticipation.
In return, the whites who were 76% of voters were only 46% of the electorate voting in anticipation.
Of course, democratic lawmakers and their supporters are strongly opposed to the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes Governing Democrats.
The Advocate General of the United States intervened to suspend the laws the more controversial.
They were able to limit the damage in part.
For example, only 16 of 34 states have enacted laws requiring the presentation of an identity card with a photograph.
However, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make more difficult the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
The criticism Democrats denounced the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed and they see it as a clear objective to influence the results in 2012 in key states.
A report from the Brennan Centre of 2011 shows that states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will affect negatively the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will undermine the US democratic system.
Screening for prostate cancer: pass the test or not?
Indeed, the PSA test would sometimes incorrect results, with false negative results or false positives, which cause unnecessary medical interventions.
What do hesitate even more men already reluctant to pass the screening tests.
Pass the test or not?
We asked the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between the groups witnesses, so it is difficult to interpret the data and make firm recommendations.
Another study, this one, has concluded that a difference in mortality among patients who had a screening and those who have not.
This study has also shown, with a follow-up after 12 years, that between 30 and 40% more likely to have tumors being detected.
I commend the test from 50 years ago, or from 40 years if it has a direct parent who has already had a prostate cancer.
The men of african-american are also more at risk.
The key is to take the right decision once it has detected a cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and others which are indolents.
We really need to understand the patient the degree of risk of his cancer, offering him the options, not treating necessarily prostate cancers that do not harm the life in the long term, and opting instead, in these cases, to active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who we detect a cancer will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We will suggest to the active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we will offer them a treatment.
Increasingly, it determines precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I therefore recommend when even pass the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with her doctor to determine if it should happen or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of urologie, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately there is no recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of good habits of life remains the best way to reduce the risk of damage.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and move enough, we could prevent 30% of cancers.
“If nobody smoked, this rate grimperait to at least 50 %,” says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the canadian company of cancer.
However, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several also remains totally unexplained.
For the canadian company of cancer, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the fall in the number of smokers.
Cigarette smoking is linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
This is harmful to people's health.
“Until today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” laments the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Given encouraging: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, the risk of dying of cancer fall by half.
The weight
The embonpoint and obesity also promote the emergence of the disease, according to the SCC.
They heighten the risk of breast, colon and rectum, oesophage, pancreas and cervical cancer.
“Research shows that the practice of regular physical activity during a lifetime protects against bowel cancer,” adds one.
Nutrition
The body also recommends to limit their consumption of red meat.
In too much, it raises the risk of colorectal cancer.
The cold meats, too, and they should be avoided.
The conservation of the meat by fumage, drying or curing can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“These recent can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer,” explains it.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have studied the links between cancer and vitamin supplements.
Their research, however, are not conclusive.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC.
When one of them showed a lower risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clear either.
Moreover, Mr. Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking about his concerns and his family history with his doctor.
“A screening test, it does not give the cancer.”
The Higgs husked
The announcement of the discovery of the likely Higgs has created quite a stir, last summer, and for good reason.
We believe that this is the Higgs mechanism responsible for the mass of all things in the universe, nothing.
And then there is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model-our best, or “less worse” explanation of nature and the behaviour of matter-but which has not yet been empirically.
But for physicists, it is still not completely sure that it is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we take a genuine new particle, and that it resembles the Higgs particle predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major conference of physical, in Kyoto, seem to confirm, but it still lacks data to be absolutely sure.
Suppose there is the Higgs, since the chances of being wrong seem slim, and see what it is.
There is, in this world, a law inevitably ignored two things that may not be in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule-and do not try too hard, you are wrong.
But even if the physical particles is a very strange world, it turns out that it, too, has a law like this: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same state “quantum” - this “rule” of roughly in some of their characteristics.
From there, the particles physicists divided into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens appointed close, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.
And the other is shaking the bosons, a nasty bunch of anarchists who have respect for nothing, at least not for this principle, which means that they may well find themselves in the same place at the same time.
These bosons will then divide into two groups, according to the website (absolutely extraordinary, incidentally) The Particle Adventure, Laboratoires Berkeley: mésons, that we cannot tackle here, and “particles”, by which the major forces of nature is spreading and that the Higgs is in some way related.
These bosons, it must be said, are not all bestioles as exotic as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronic, it is thanks to a Higgs of extraordinary banality: the photon, or particle of “light” which is the “messenger” of electromagnetic force.
When a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it “disturbing” the electromagnetic field in this particular place, much as a pebble in a pond.
This “disturbance” born an electromagnetic waves (of the light, or the infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this agreement is nothing other than a photon-and therefore a “bosons carry strength.”
More stable scope
Even with the Higgs, with the difference that this is another area, the Higgs field, which must be “disturbed” that the Higgs appear.
However, the Higgs is far more stable than the electromagnetic field; for the inflammatory, it must achieve very, very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond which only a very large rock rider could surface.
That is why there is a huge particle accelerator as CERN-the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km of circumference! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field again is useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
These are not all particles, or all the materials, which interact with the magnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but other non-a piece of paper, for example, will never of himself on a fridge.
And in the same way, it is not all particles that interact with the scope of Higgs: those that do have a mass, while others (such as the photon, like) do not have.
Now, what does “can” all this research, ask Mrs Plamondon?
For science, it serves to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows the physicists to scrutinise any gap between the observations and predictions of MS.
They are also several to wish fervently that it is because the slightest difference could open a door on a “new physics” and plug some holes of the Model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, offering no explanation for the seriousness (oups!) or the dark, who form about 80% of the area of the Universe (re-oups!).
But it has not found such differences at CERN until now.
Repercussions
The repercussions of this research in the everyday lives of Mr and Mrs everything-the-world, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no.
Wait: at the beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of the laser, Laboratoires Bell, did not realize the revolution that their work would trigger.
They saw the scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we have already said the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs complex, where the laser was invented in 1960 and who has himself developed the first laser continuous (the first were pulsés), in 1962, initially the laser was instead seen as a “gimmick of labo.”
Imagine …
And then, the applications can also come from all the instruments that surrounds the research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle has developed a small sensor light in 1969, during its work in perspective.
This sensor, although this was not his original intention, is now “eye” to all the digital cameras of the world, and he has earned the Nobel physics 2009.
This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it means that, really, you never know …
Palliative care-the best way to die … &pipe; duty
With his committee to die in dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate should resume shortly while a bill is preparing.
However, in this crucial area, much remains to be done.
The Duty tried to look more closely.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
Prostate cancer, which the rongeait had left a respite for two years.
“They gave me five years to live, I did seven years ago,” he says, half-hearted mid-grape, lying in bed in the home of palliative care Victor Gadbois, Beloeil, where it arrived the day before.
“But it is always a shock may not be prepared for it,” he said.
The disease is his work: a huge weakness which prevents go only to the toilet, and even eating alone.
A very attractive attablé before lunch, he agreed to get help to eat, resigned.
Courageous, sometimes even to smile, talk to strangers who were busy around him, giving him his medicines, offer him a bath.
The courage of the death.
“My greatest wish is that I am cure of diarrhoea, it is humiliating,” gives it.
A few hours later, the “team has found a cure for this disease.
“During our lives, we learn that a man, pisse rose,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at home Victor Gadbois.
Back at the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“Stuff depends on the ability of the person” to accept the regression, see it.
Because, in the view of several people working in palliative care, of great moments take place in the heart of this decline.
Patients who come to the home of palliative care Victor Gadbois suffer all the cancer.
They have a prognosis of life a maximum of three months.
At this stage, the “team of doctors and nurses around them will mean more care” called curative.”
For Mrs. 89 years, the worst fear is dying “aware and suffocated.”
But the disease has made me find my children.
“I have good children,” she adds.
“I have more things in life,” she said, before accepting that it poses a mask to help him breathe.
It expects even, in the coming days, a final visit to his son come to Italy.
To Victor Gadbois, profligate, with a group of volunteers, the care of the body and aid to food.
This is palliative care, that is when there is nothing else to do.
To make the death more comfortable.
In Quebec, a bed of palliative care for 11 700 people.
This is very little when we know that we will all die one day.
Here, life continues in the best conditions possible, explains the'Dre Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the house.
That is the level of comfort physical, emotional or spiritual.
The dying, take care of the mouth brandy or Pepsi, according to demand.
Diabetics are not obliged to monitor their rate of sugar.
And death is part of daily life.
Yesterday evening, there was a beer to Mr X, who died during the night.
This morning, it was his son who completed the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We support the relatives as patients,” says Nathalie Savard, Director of care.
The house Victor Gadbois, the days to follow but are not alike.
Alongside an old man of 93 years relishing his last House family in court, of stalled in its oreillers while we rap in his honour, a young man of 36 years dying tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, having tried to survive.
“For six months, there are still three to five beds which are occupied by cancer aged less than 45 years,” worries the'Dre Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the house Victor Gadbois arrive home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of canadian simply do not have access to palliative care, that is to say care designed to alleviate the suffering when a patient has reached the final stage of his life, be it at home, hospital or nursing home care.
And several agencies, such as the house Victor Gadbois and society of palliative care at home of Greater Montreal, specialise more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancer.
It is precisely this great deficiency in healthcare Quebecois who fear to several doctors specialized in hospice care, the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by luminaries of palliative care which Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, travels to show their opposition to such a move.
According to the'Dre Christiane Martel, the health system Quebecois is not good enough to ensure that everyone is entitled to the palliative care quality before they agreed to proceed to euthanasia.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient from 14 days to the urgency, in great pain, without making the necessary for the relief.
I fear that patients want to die because they do not receive the appropriate care.
And at the same time, several oncologists is stalking their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognoses.
Hopes for the survival of Helen Richard were already minimal when it abandoned a bruising chemotherapy.
When I announced to my oncological I arrêtais treatment, she replied that she regretted that I stop to fight, she told.
However, she had told me that I was “finished!
Not all-powerful care
The Martel'Dre believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thanked carers not to have complied with their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a team of palliative care.
But it must be said that palliative care are not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care to society of palliative care at home of Greater Montreal, patients would be resistant to treatment for pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors have so often use palliative sedation, which amounts to numb the patient until the time of his death, intermittently, is permanently.
We cannot pretend not to hear that part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the patient not relieved will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
Patients who are not relieved always say the same sentence: “I want to die.”
But this does not necessarily mean “I want you euthanasiiez” means “I would be relieved.”
The achievement of this report was made possible by a grant of journalism research institutes in health of Canada.
Property scandals of large scale in Quebec
Officials of the roads, the entrepreneurs of the BTP, fundraisers of political parties and specialists from the italian mafia told day after day that they know a formidable “system”, involving the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
An “industry” that has cost the taxpayers Quebecois, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
“It is curious as the system crumbles since we took the great resources,” Jacques ironise Duchesneau, member of Quebec and former chief of police in Montreal.
It is through him that the scandal has erupted in 2011, through an investigation of substance on embezzlement linked to contracts for road work in Quebec, the liberal prime minister, Jean Charest, had made that backwards.
The report “Duchesneau” established a direct link between industry, hidden financing of parties and corruption of officials.
“Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he insists, the Department of Transport have saved $1 billion on contracts,” some réfrénant their instincts to touch a part!
The Commission Charbonneau “has already brought down two mayors,” he adds, hoping it will “demonstrate the trickery behind individuals.”
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The ongoing anti-corruption unit, created in 2011, is also working with its army of auditors, investigators and analysts of the government.
More policemen “Marteau squad”, which since 2009, have led the “cartel of sewage” Montreal to put the brake on gonflements contracts …
In recent weeks, it has carried out searches in series and made accusations of fraud and corruption against city officials, as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city suburb.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned his post as mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
It is suspected of having received bribes to repeat in exchange for public contracts.
Are formally accused by engineers to the roads of Montreal and entrepreneurs of italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
This last has raised eyebrows in explaining to the mechanics of the “system” of obtaining government contracts.
Himself has paid for years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a broker linked to the mafia reversait money to Union Montreal party, Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito has spread in all directions in the years 2000, giving more 88 000 CAD (approximately 68 000 euros) to the provincial liberal party, especially when in power.
He also admitted having organised a collection of illegal funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister, liberal Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts for which it drains gonflait costs
Montreal, has the “system” of corruption worked well.
Gilles Surprenant, ex-engineer public work, has detailed before the Commission: in ten years, he has received for construction companies gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totaling $736, in exchange for contracts which it drains gonflait costs.
Other officials of the roads have disclosed that fact smear by swelling from 30% to 40%, the bills by fake extras.
Then an organizer of the mayor, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately turned a blind eye to a budget parallel fueling its coffers with dirty money.
Following the revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal in a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected Montreal to sound the alarm.
The mayor of the district of Rivière-of-meadows, in the east of the island, it reacts in 2010 against the sale of a municipal ground bought $5 million and resold … 1.6 million to developers, booming real estate.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation is finally in place, she says she “draws on a thread to understand the workings of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the rot and pinpoint the culprits.”
The process, she said, is “painful but positive”.
We are in the process of cleaning the wound but there should be a unit of inquiry in Montreal and a vigil, not to see the return of dubious practices.
As we do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau note that “officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars,” but is concerned about the role of “elected the ploy”, when they are not in the trempaient magouille!
Estimating that 70% of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, it ironise: “they told me that this was a pale reflection of reality.”
The government proposes to limit Quebecois $100 donations to parties, but this does not change the situation, he said: “as long as we do not strictly limit election spending, there will be dirty money in politics.”
He advocates a thorough review of the system of awarding state contracts and financing parties: “you cannot go lower; get to the bottom of things, with courage, will help rebuild the house on firmer foundations, with more checks and laws.”
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in their own backyard …
“The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!”
This season, you have taken a new size with PSG.
How do you explain this?
This can be explained by an awareness of individual but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players arrived.
Every day, I am making progress on their side.
The technical staff has also contributed much.
Daily, these elements lead me to lift my game.
And, in the match, it is easier.
Everything is going very quickly in football.
But I did not catch fire.
My debut at the centre of included the INF Clairefontaine in my move to St Etienne, I have always made by gradual.
You learn therefore benefit from competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti …
The recruits this summer are used to playing matches at a very high level.
They also know that every training is crucial.
The fact that a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my position.
It is supported by deputies as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the man for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all the technicians.
Today, he has no equal in League 1 and is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has great experience and has won a lot of titles with clubs brigade.
He flirted with great players.
I think he wins other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a discussion with comforting him.
I then outside of a series of injuries.
The confidence it gives me also explains my performance.
How would you on the first part of season PSG?
In League 1 Lyon, we took the place of leader.
But we remain in ambush.
One of our key objectives is the Champions League: we have qualified for the final with the 8es way.
What is the purpose of a club in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
Now, anything can happen.
But we have our say in very good european teams.
We want to finish first in our chicken, in Porto, able to receive at the 8th of final return.
The PSG can become a big european club in the short term?
It already has the budget …
To become a major european club, Paris needs to win titles and to register in time.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially, the PSG provides the means for this project to fruition.
In League 1, does not win the title, as last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
This year it was really important to pocket the title of champion.
Last season, it has not gone away.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
There has been a very big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, one is supposed to be champion …
But another team, Montpellier, has done a season even more fantastic.
This year, I think that is good.
Even if the big teams as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are in the fight for the title, I think that we have the weapons to win.
Do you think that the media ahead of PSG too?
It is normal that we expected a lot from us in light of what has been invested and the players that we have.
We fully accept.
After, when we won 4-0 at home against Troyes and there are still things to blame us, it is that it is a little frustrating.
One wonders what people expect more.
We can never win 4-0 all weekend.
It is not the FC Barcelona!
We are trying to put in place a draft game.
A team is built with time.
It was shown in the Champions League that they could attend.
Look at Manchester City, who are not, for two seasons, to qualify for the final 8es, they have also made huge spending!
Compared to the sums invested, you imagined with 15 points ahead of the truce.
It was neglect our opponents and the championship in France.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, have been inspired by this new PSG.
This shows that the League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can smile at us saying that, despite all the difficulties, it was eventually prevail.
The PSG seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Much better that we say that there is a “Zlatan dependence.”
This means that Ibrahimovic is very efficient and it puts a lot of goals.
It is time for that and it demonstrates that it is the star of the League 1.
It has shown wherever it is that he was a great player, a global star.
Within the group, we respect the rights and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
This prompts others to hoist their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How have you experienced Euro 2012 with the french team?
As a disappointment.
I had to participate in this euro.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from time to grab the game.
I have seen things there and I am stronger.
Today, I come to make good matches in selection.
That is what I expect from my baptism with the blues.
We have learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine and we must now have an exemplary behaviour.
How would you on the first months of Didier Deschamps led the blues?
It has the results for him.
It is well placed in the group description for the World Cup.
The breeder is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the wins.
As Laurent Blanc.
But I do not want to make comparisons.
White had reached its target in calling for the euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the blues in Brazil.
The right one (1-1) scored on 16 October, Spain is a match founder?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has fought for everyone.
Before this clash in Spain, I had never experienced a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without the banks
The opposite of monetary exchange current, based on central banks, transactions and identified the costs of treatment between the stakeholders.
In addition, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, from bank monopolies, led to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible in dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol to secure exchange of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files from hand to hand.
Around 200 000 transactions have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network.
A few thousand Web sites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin, having reached a peak of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2, five months later, before returning today around a dozen $(courses are listed on the site bitcoincharts. com).
Nothing very impressive, compared to the global trade in real currency or in financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
Bitcoin described it as “the virtual currency with the most success,” “in competition with the dollar or the euro” and “similar to conventional currencies.”
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currency as the “credits”, used to move in a video game wins by playing or that we can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But, each time, a central authority and control trafficking trade.
Bitcoin, with all the nodes of the network are both trustees of the Book of accounts, auditors, issuers of currency, and buyers and sellers.
How this network?
Each transaction between two users are in fact done between two electronic addresses in the manner of an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, ensuring anonymity.
A set of information relating to this transaction is electronically signed by a system of encryption key to double.
The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoins traded exist in the book of public accounts, disseminated throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It depends on the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers, and that the winner, sort of central banker provisional, have the privilege to add this additional line.
It is a phase of hachage database, which is processing a large file in a digital footprint shorter and unique.
The computers “take” the new transaction, and he added a number of “grinding” before the whole.
The aim is to find the number which gives a hallmark (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is reached, the other nodes easily check that this is the right.
The transaction is then indestructiblement linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, to cheat, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than 10 minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network – the other remaining orphan because the two have different fingerprints.
The computer have solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this award is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but they are divisible until the 100 millionth, which leaves the room …
The difficulty of the challenge is also raised to each increase in the power of calculation.
The network has had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and the bitcoins in deposits stolen.
“The flaw used is not the protocol itself”, said Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a company of payment in real currency using the network Bitcoin.
The ECB is also the possibilities of laundering money through this service.
But the cash has also this defect.
Players of weight as Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, such as the blogging platform WordPress, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, have analysed the book of accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins does not flow.
In November, sales of “giants” were launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” welcomes Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts of bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also the author of a book on teaching this currency, believes the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a payment by mobile without contact, but it uses to validate the Bitcoin transactions, which are also cheaper.
The carrier manages its identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in the merchants, who do not need to install new hardware or software.
They only need to communicate an address that a phone can “photographed and recognise,” says Pierre Noizat, having thousands of users.
There is a movement called into question hierarchical systems for systems more horizontal.
“It will take time for Bitcoin is required, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicted.
The ECB, in its report, also provides for the reassessment of varying risk, today considered high, in case of success of this currency.
We left Afghanistan.
And after?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow end 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army takes possession of its territory and that the Afghans choose their future, without any wait for us.
It is the Afghan farmers that we have punished as terrorists.
And we, with our 88 soldiers killed, injured, and maimed.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former leaders refugees in Pakistan, but often of peasants who refuse the foreign military presence, such as the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, old and archaic, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, they no longer be when westerners are more discreet.
The departure of french troops on the basis of Nijrab, I have observed the high hills planted with almond trees through appropriations french, was in order.
The convoys of trucks and armoured joined Kabul without being attacked, overflown by helicopters.
There will be no flood of Taliban in Kabul by the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible breakthrough from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was empty, the country ablaze because of infighting between different factions.
They seized control of the country had been seen as a kind of liberation, a return to the security.
The Afghan paid the price of obscurantism of these farmers have been overtaken by the organisation of al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved.
Former mujaheddin, Afghan government and current Taliban are united in the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The most notable of the anti-soviet war have returned to power in 2001.
They are enraged by profiteers, seizing land government to sell them in land to build the refugees returned from Iran and Pakistan, with “huge contracts american subcontracting.
They are déconsidérés; most of them have not fought themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, and leave those who were able to take advantage of american largesse: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of the war and its ideologies.
They have flirted with the modern world in their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they have appreciated the benefits.
Approximately 65% of the population is under 25 years old; Kabul now has 5 million, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the government schools are full, girls as boys.
It will provide work for those young people who do want more return to obscurantism of the old parties nor the corruption of leaders.
All, including the armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones, television, and its turkish soap operas that have a modern world, is followed everywhere.
The army is now presents.
The authorities that the commission will be regarded as legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-soviet fight care already to reconstitute the militias provincial, who dodge the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, the strong local identities, should enjoy a degree of decentralisation, the image of western nations, but the US wanted to turn it into a centralised state, to presidential power, abolishing the post of prime minister, which had existed since the 1964 constitution.
President Karzai does not want controls foreign, especially during the planned elections in April 2014.
But his country is, since the 1950s and already well before, dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been challenged in road, no dam is in state, no important irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing happened, except for fruit and vegetables.
The priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined by 30 years of war, a government control on infrastructure have been necessary.
The noise was widespread that Afghanistan had huge mineral wealth.
This has only added to the feeling that the western “were there to take them over.
Without energy to treat the iron ore and copper, or means of transport for export through the mountains, not of mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the Aynak copper mine of Oh, leaving archaeologists international (funded by the World Bank) search the vast Buddhist site and remain the most important employers in the province.
The day will also that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The departure of french troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of the traditional aid: high school girls, boys, Department of french university, french institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural support to the archaeological.
Since 2009, to try to “win hearts and minds” and achieve the impossible task of matching aid and offensive actions, a service of actions” including civil-military” Ministry of Defence (Cimic), deleted in 2012, has conducted, and is carried out by a small french NGOS, many work of collective interest and rehabilitation work in agricultural in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, efficient workforce “force, could help to contain the insurgency: irrigation wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase of farmland.
Let us remember that as, after two billion euros of military spending?
A budget far more modest help to improve living conditions for local, very hard in these valleys often located in more than 2,000 metres.
The embassy has received dozens of requests written small agricultural achievements from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
For that they will release the insurgency led by foreign groups, that the farmers told me, it should keep in their favour a small civilian aid, well controlled and that affects them directly.
A constitution steamrollered through Egypt
This is a new gamble of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever about the constitutional declaration, which gives it temporarily full powers, he decided to play everything.
Took everybody by surprise, he announced Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly approves his final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had granted two additional months to this House to finish its work.
Nearly two years ago that Egypt is based on a provisional text, repeatedly amended which weakens the institutional stability and led to legal entanglements.
This new initiative has only increased the divide in the country.
For his opponents, the President is continuing with its autocratic “madness”, continuing to betray its “floor” and “trampling the law.”
The side of its supporters, is that it is a means to end soon with the institutional and political crisis, speeding up the process of transition.
A referendum should be held in the 15 days.
A very short space of time which obliges the brothers to renounce their project to explain the text, article by article, the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to regain a popular and democratic legitimacy while protests raged throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians vote in favour, as he said in an interview with the weekly US time.
So much so that a hasty vote takes the ultimatum to the egyptian people: “either you vote for my text, I retain full powers”, supposedly to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the constituent assembly, large islamist majority, voted the text yesterday.
Most liberals were missing from the appeal.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, believing could not assert their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done likewise.
So that the quorum is reached, 11 people, members of replacements, have been added to the rush, yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, it is most often unanimously that the articles were adopted.
Commentators have also amused that one of the only differences of the day has spoken … around the time of prayer, some members of the committee felt that the pendulum of the constituent was wrong.
The text, which was still “be voted yesterday evening, contains 234 articles.
Objects of attention, Article 2 finally is identical to that of the 1971 constitution, stating that “the principles of sharia are the main source of law.”
The Salafi parties, for which the “establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hope to replace “principles” by “rules”, which would have allowed stricter application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a measure of their goodwill and their respect for the other components of egyptian society.
“Hypocrisie”, meet the liberals, who see it as a blow for communication.
Because to them the Islamisation of the Constitution is through other articles.
They include Article 220, which gives the university Al Azhar an advisory role, particularly in regard to verify compliance with sharia law.
According to the expert in Egypt Sophie Pommier, that is worrying because “people are called upon to vote are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings of a theocracy.”
The fears of liberals are aggravated by the fact that the next rector of the university should be much less moderate than the present.
“For the moment, there is no specific religious involvement.
With this constitution, it remains within the framework of the civilian government.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulemas but academics, some trained in the french system” tempers Blouet Alexis, who prepares a thesis on the egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that “there may be some ambiguity around Article 220, because the words borrowed religious vocabulary.
It refers to the “fiqh” islamic jurisprudence, including [says].
And the question in the future could be asked how judges civilians are competent to decide on.”
Beyond its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is very criticized because of the broad powers granted to the president of the republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood, claim that they are considerably reduced in comparison to what they were under the old regime.
Another point of contention: the powers granted to the military.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but at a National Council of defence.
Neither be banned the trials of civilians in military courts, as were the associations of defending human rights.
These are also expressed their concerns about the text, which they deem liberticidal.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and the insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression and of the press.
Moreover, no article does more to the protection of women, says Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
In it, the only positive is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
The word does not appear in the previous constitution.
While the egyptian president to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned this afternoon.
The support of the head of state défileront them, on Saturday.
In Israel, the holy sites, the centre of the world and a sea of brine expect ukrainian tourists

“Who was in Moscow will”: migrants save money to learn the language
When the members and human rights activists polémiquent on what will give the law on the mandatory language test, fraudsters selling “false” certificates have already made their appearance in the country
Each year, 13 million migrant workers coming to Moscow, St Petersburg and other russian cities.
Most of the time, these are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only purpose: to earn money to help their families remained in the house.
From 1 December, a law came into force and stipulates that every migrant worker will have to pass an examination of Russian.
For the moment, this rule is that those who intend to work in the services sector, housing, personal services and retail.
However, with time, promises the federal migration service, the tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
Moreover, it will validate the knowledge of the language, but also the history of Russia and the foundations of law.
It will validate its linguistic knowledge in Russian to obtain and renew his work permit.
Not only are nationals of countries where the Russian has the status of official language.
People with certificates or diplomas education before the collapse of the USSR in 1991, are not affected by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of centres to be examined under the auspices of the Institute of russian language Pushkin, the University of the friendship of the peoples, the Moscow State University, University of St Petersburg and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants can pass the tests in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been open throughout the territory.
This initiative to introduce exams was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Service of migration.
But, before the law came into force, the human rights defenders have repeatedly asked the question in the press: what it will give?
What is the obligation to know the russian change for the Russians and immigrants?
First of all, to meet representatives of the migration service, it will reduce the number of people suffering from “slave labour”.
Many speak of defending the rights of migrant workers, says the director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must start before their departure.
Only a selection system organised will solve the problems at 90% foreign labourers.
The problems arise for immigrants without work, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, certifies Sebelev, future migrant is designed to meet some dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, provide a “journey” in a crowded maisonnette where he and dozens of his ilk are tourmenteront for months without food and without paper and toiling between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
“Chez themselves, they are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are mistaken, taking their passports, and they do not affect the pay plans,” confirms the chief of the direction of migration to the work of the service migration of Tajikistan, Tolib Charipov.
I do not, Mr disputez police!
However, many residents of the republics of Central Asia who want to earn money in Russia confiding that they are not only the language of the country where they want to travel, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
This of course is not their fault, but their misery: little, Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow a primary education passable.
Indeed, their families do not even have to feed their children without talking about the dress properly and to equip them for the school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people are moving to earn money when the opportunity arises.
It is difficult when you do not know the language, nannies.
“Do you feel diminished and diminished.”
The human rights defenders, psychologists, however, one important aspect of the law on the language.
The reviews are intended solely to migrants who have a legal status.
Without status, there is no review or official work afterwards.
However, most of the migrant workers continue to live in Russia.
“Welcome to enter or defence”
Many immigrants explains that it is not so easy to get official status in Russia.
The reason? administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
In addition, the legalisation costs money: between 12 and 16 miles rubles.
And then we can get a false registration quickly to only 1,500 rubles.
The russian police know that we have of false documents, that we have not recording, where cases of extortion.
“They ask us, 100, 200 rubles to buy cigarettes, tea,” confided to journalists Oumed Khouchkadamov, citizen of Tajikistan.
“Do not quickly, denied and buys you a beautiful work of art”
From the first day of the entry into force of the law on the language, it was discovered that the papers of registering migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several false certificates examinations of languages have already been confiscated by the employees of the federal migration service.
The falsified papers out of a printer ordinary colour.
Of course, their new owners have not had for nothing: each migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of the examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
It is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Representatives of power and human rights defenders, agrees that the short-term objective is to protect the system against corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these “bits of paper.”
The authorities can give to migrant workers who have not been able to validate the examination of the first time to follow the language.
In addition, the immigrants who do not know the Russian will be offered a work in areas that do not involve actively communicate with people.
The Ministry of the Interior is not involved in arms market
The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against carrying weapons.
That is the reaction of the authorities in response to recent incidents: whether the shootings carried out at weddings or the killing, organised by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who has seven deaths.
The police want to ban the wearing of weapons to rubber bullets in public places and meet the legal age of obtaining the permits gun ownership from 18 to 21 years.
The idea has been backed by the head of the State Duma committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who has promised that the amendments to the law on the weapons would be introduced in the State Duma shortly.
Not everyone is pleased to see that the russian authorities trying to solve the problem by “turns the screws.”
An open letter appeared on the Web in which its authors, representatives of various centres of firing, demand to abandon this crackdown “crazy”.
The percentage of crimes committed with a gun registered is minimal, said at the service of russian Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and expert on crime for the BBC.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm, registered in the police service while 1,168 thousand crimes have been recorded over the same period.
The authors of the letter are certain that the strengthening of laws on civilian weapons will not prevent criminals from buying on the black market.
According to them, can be found today in Moscow any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Interior Ministry says it is monitoring the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from the factory to the officer
The black market weapons is provided through several channels.
The main channels are five recounts Viktor Baranets, retired colonel who served ten years at the Ministry of Education and the Quartier general.
A screen capture from a site taking orders weapons
The first is “the military”, that is to say the weapons were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
“These weapons have been stolen by the russian officers, but also by the Caucasians,” explains Baranets.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals to the forces of order.
Baranets explains that it is both weapons stolen in the stocks of the police that those stolen directly to representatives of the forces of order.
The illegal handguns go on sale since the military warehouses.
Many of these have often suffered explosions.
“Certified versions indicate that some fires were triggered intentionally to conceal the deficit”, explains the former military.
For Baranets, arms manufacturers are for something.
“You see the factories of weapons that do not compete with private competition on the international market and sell weapons on the black market, particularly in Moscow,” says one expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
An important part of pistols and rifles from poorer countries, as the Kyrgyz.
“It is a small-scale local production, sometimes, a mafia formed and organises the supply,” adds the former military.
Where are the weapons?
Experts have calculated the share of roughly every source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the issue was formed in 2011 by the centre for analysis of the problems and study for the public administration.
Experts have analysed the reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal case and the public data portals for weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, say the researchers, from the army and the police.
Half of weapons on the black market was “rediscovered by fault of employees whose work is linked to weapons,” we explain in the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places of military conflicts, 14% are stolen during the manufacture and 5% are from “clandestine searches.”
A seller and a consultant armurerie have requested anonymity ensures that long nobody buys weapons found by these specialists searches illegal; they are too old.
Most often, he says, sellers will seek new military goods in warehouses.
The person buying through a teaches a unit, for example a pistol TT.
Is it the book moving goods by a fence.
“It carries in the city and sells for $900 per unit with two chargers”, tells it.
“It is true that the police are aware of all the cases, and, when the crimes are being investigated, it does a purchase of control with the merchants of illegal weapons,” adds the seller.
“As in a boutique luxury”
The buyer and seller are usually through knowledge.
I have consulted websites, blogs, until a kind arises and propose to come to the station to Begovaya where someone became take me in a “corner” to haggle.
The price of the gun, I was given on the spot
Viktor Baranets in military observer
To find a gun, I know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I do not trust him.
There are sellers in the markets, but there is also coming in saying, for example, “the part of this person, who has asked me to convey that his daughter has lost a tooth.”
Now I buy a pair of fists american aid to a person who I trust.
It was the only book to me because he knows I do not give.
The small seek new weapons in different ways.
The former military Viktor Baranets is tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid 1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The schemes, according to him, have not changed.
It has given him a photo album in which there was “everything we want.”
“I thought in a boutique luxury,” remembers the military.
There is no secret to the buyer, explains Baranets, you can try anything.
As a potential client, I am not content to buy, it goes with the seller and forest is a target.
“It leaves me learn and when I am convinced that the weapon is working well, you start to negotiate,” describes the expert.
A shop for his sofa
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons “for different uses.”
For that, it needs no document and people to meet.
“It is enough to have a specific amount of money,” writes one in advertising on the site “Buy a pistol or a gunned battle.”
Users can leave their request and asking their questions.
And sold to minors?
“Without permits, of course,” asks the user “Ivan” (spelling retained).
“Achète TT. Moscow,” wrote “Fedorenkov” in its request very direct.
The Federal Security Service broadcast a vast network of fake sites and paved with a shovel people looking to buy weapons to fight.
People are jumping on the food like hungry wolves, and then they find themselves to exploit coal in Siberia
Viktor Baranets, observer and former military
I have heard of this kind of patterns: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of russian laws.
People take the lead.
The buyer the payment on the brink of automatic.
“It gets in return a photo and instructions which is hidden weapon”, explains the secretary of the association “Droit a weapon,” Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baranets says that by making a request on the website, you can find themselves without a weapon and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service broadcast a vast network of fake sites and paved with a shovel people looking to buy weapons to fight.
“People are jumping on the food like hungry wolves, and then they find themselves to exploit coal in Siberia”, he says.
A Makarov are about to $100
The purchase of a firearm illegally, say the experts, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov Association Law “a weapon”, you can buy a gun for Makarov are about 100-300 dollars.
It will wait for about a month and a half.
It is out of warehouses by the long-term direction of these warehouses of average size.
According to official data from the Ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of these crimes has generally fallen in Russia of 7% and amounts to 22,9 miles while confirmed cases of theft and extortion, weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs dropped by 7.8%.
United States: employees of fast-food outlets and supermarkets are on strike
Almost a quarter of american teenagers spend by a cashier at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages rise is charged by the supermarket Walmart and famous fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the moment, no one can predict if this wave will take the scale or steam quickly.
These actions are supported by unions and a number of associations left.
Alongside the modest wage increases that employees receive basic home and Walmart in the fast-food chains, organisers of demonstrations to the creation of unions.
This sector is currently not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents per year?
The protests began last week after thanksgiving, the “black Friday”, when a rain flood of balances seizing millions of people in America and triggering sometimes esclandres.
That day, some employees of the company, which employs Walmart worldwide 2.2 million people, have left their posts to organise picket lines with the trade unions and left-wing activists in the shops of the company whose products are intended for consumers of modest and middle classes.
Walmart sold everything: layers of hunting rifles through the car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in the major supermarkets.
That is why many poorly paid workers at Walmart shopping solely on their place of work.
The price and the choice of products made from Walmart, one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products cheap partly because of low wages to its employees.
They also complain about the difficult working conditions, for example the lack of forklift trucks or portable scanners.
The participants of the demonstrations of “black Friday” demanded a pay increase, they complained about the fact that the cost of medical insurance provided by the company had risen from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
To the employee base among Walmart, which affects $9.5 hour, it is a sum that it cannot afford.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkley show that if Walmart increased the average salary at $12 an hour, this will cost the group $3.2 billion.
This is 1.1% more of what it currently spending.
If Walmart transferred any wage increases on consumers, every race in the shop they amount to 46 cents.
They spend in a year only 12,39 dollars more than now.
Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that the protests have taken place in only nine states and have brought no injury to the group.
The “black Friday” has continued in the shops of 8h the evening at midnight the next day and Walmart has sold on this period 5,000 articles to the second.
Its banks have done in every 100 million transactions for the “black Friday”.
The spokesman of the society Dan Fogleman said in an interview with the Huffington Post website left that “less than five” employees of Walmart had left their posts and that the protest was a “operation com” among many” from the trade union organizer.
“Client next!”
The protests have continued this week in New York and were not more shops Walmart (progressive in this city, they are not very popular, which is why they are not yet implanted) but the McDonald's and other restaurants cheap.
McDonald's announcement sell billions of portions and after they do give you not even leave disease and do not pay for the work that you have done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council of New York
Currently, the minimum wage set by the federal legislation and that of New York is $9 an hour.
Fast-food outlets the increase with time, but little, on average, its employees plumbing in New York 8,90 $earlier.
Nobody affects less than them in this city.
For me it is inconceivable to live with this sum in New York.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of american teenagers working in McDonald's after school while living among their parents.
Few people saw their primary source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing employees McDonald's who complain about having to live with this salary and sometimes have to feed their children with.
Moreover, on the forum of the Wall Street Journal newspaper found the comments saying that it is irresponsible to make children if you do not know what you are going to feed them.
The protesters who launched the movement Thursday to 6h30 near the McDonald's of the 40th street on Madison Avenue and demanded that the cashiers and cooks fast-food are paid at least $15 an hour, or an increase of more than twice the minimum wage.
They also demanded that the unions in the catering sector quickly.
American law prohibits the administration to prevent and punish the protesters of a union by bullying or redundancies.
However, the administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a syndicate, grabbing fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for practical reasons.
One of the biggest is the extraordinary turnover of staff.
They are not in agreement
Other demonstrations were held tumultuous near several other fast-food chains.
The flagship of the protest has been gathering in the middle of the day near the McDonald's Times Square with the intervention of several political local Democrats, particularly that of Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, who said: “McDonald's announcement sell billions of portions and after they do give you not even leave disease and do not pay for the work that you have done honestly!”.
The demonstrators were supported by other Democrats in New York, particularly by the candidate for the post of mayor Bill De Blasio who said that “we must all support the employees of fast food so that they get a fair pay and economic well-being that deserves every New Yorkers.
The New York Times has characterized the protest as the biggest ever of the catering sector early in its history.
But only a few hundred people participated and that all were not employees of fast-food, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is difficult to say if this will spark a mass movement of small.
“For the moment it is moderately to fool the brain”
Lately, fans of the new technologies are used to collect the augmented reality through special glasses.
At the outset, it is Google, which unveiled this summer its current model at its annual conference and in November it was reported that Microsoft had made the request of the patent.
However, it is clear from the conversation with the director of the interactive 3d technologies of Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for scientists in this society, the glasses are already history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
Could you tell us in a few words what your research group?
We are working on the interaction between man and machine, and at the same time we are trying to expand the borders of this interaction.
The humanity as a whole remained for the moment the pixels on a screen flat and sometimes the tactile.
We want to look five to 10 years before and we guess the radical changes that occur with this interaction.
For example, the games console Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and virtually no Xbox can sell today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the order by the gesture.
We also reserve the future?
Although the Kinect has delivered the physical interaction, lots of things are happening on screen dish, sometimes in 3d.
The seizure of the information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the yield, for the moment, not really.
We are trying to change that and we are working on systems of 3d imaging really operating on different technologies, including technologies projection.
We must get the computer world in ours, in the physical world, the more tactile.
For that, however, we must identify not only the user, but also the space surrounding it.
Thus, we can complement the real world by objects in a virtual form more practical.
First, we should dismiss these stupid helmets of virtual reality!
– What do you think of the voice command?
It is appreciated, but is it not overrated?
We cannot say that this is a panacea: the issue of confidentiality arises because we did not always want to inform others of his actions or his intentions.
In fact, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but everyone in its niche.
For example, to command the equipment in public places, we had a project for which we thought to gestures, not broad gestures, but rather to gestures discreet, restricted.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a police brought to the hand that recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
Currently it is great, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a show.
In fact, the future will be marked by the Joint Command, for example: gesture + voice.
That is to say?
For example, how would you ask me you can get this?
You would do with the words and gestures.
- Usually I speak only.
- Oh, it will be difficult to recognize.
So, you want to force users to adapt according to what the machine can or not done at a given moment?
Not necessarily, but it is a rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that enable us to better identify the reactions of the man.
It may be, for example, laser sensors, they produce a good enough resolution in depth, and that is very important.
If you are interested in your work on the Xbox Kinect sensors, what is it that you do not like in the modern cameras?
They lack of resolution, depth or something else?
In principle, it is on the current generation that we base our work on the recognition 3d.
Of course, it would be good to get around 8 mégapixels with a speed of 1000 / it is.
But the problem is not the mégapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
On this last point, all current technologies are quite good, this adds to the labour designers algorithms.
We must keep in mind the resolution in the axes X and Y, but also Z.
The speed is too much, the number of managers in the second.
The movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 / it is really not enough, especially for the gestures.
Steven Bathiche, our laboratory Redmond has given the touch sensor a delay regular treatment between 1 and 100, the current µs sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction of man and machine.
I have a system of this type in my work, but not requiring, for most of the second.
But it is not, increase the number of cameras?
The Kinect has today three “cameras”, which is in fact an infrared emitter and the receiver of the signal, a second thought.
And the third is in fact a camera sensor's usual immediately visible.
It is not used to determine the depth of the subject.
Many cameras could solve this problem …
Or worse by increasing the volume of calculations required.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, to play with the curve of cameras and to see how it could help determine the locations.
As I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not submitted his glasses in public.
Do you not think that, from the point of view of the daily use of technology, the augmented reality glasses are one of the platforms with the most prospects?
Of course, walk around all the time with a smart phone the hands is not practical, but what I think: the best option would be a reality increased “transitional” which you would from a cloud platform to move glasses in smart phone.
The glasses are a very personal and that makes their force (the personal elements are those that you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: the augmented reality from the glasses do not allow you to work on the virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of holographiques virtual objects in the air is no longer accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also the mere mortal.
There is a problem on which the opponents of this idea are pointing the finger: there is no tactile sensation!
The hands do not feel nothing!
What answers your group preparing it compared to this challenge?
In my way, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand for support of image.
It is perfectly the pressure!
But there is also the technologies that are really designed to assign the palpabilité to these “pictures in the air”: for example the interference of several shelves ultrasound led to a point where the finger and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, a breath of air on the ends of the fingers.
There is also the bracelets worn on poignets that affect nerve endings of fingers, they are also a line of work with prospects.
And have you tried to fool the brain?
Make him believe that he feels that he should normally feel when he sees something?
That was a good idea, we have not yet tried.
There is still a task here below on which we still have long to give the evil: how to pretend to someone who is physically in a very small area that it works in an open area almost infinite-we are working on the concepts of carpets of race (nothing to do with those found in the clubs of fitness), mobile platforms and also the giant baubles.
For the moment, is moderately to fool the brain, there are still many years of work.
That is what makes the work on the virtual reality if interesting for the researcher: many things are still in a state of absolute fertilization.
The reign of taste and not the culture-Rosbalt UK.
“Rosbalt” continues the project “the vanguard Petersburg” dedicated to urban dwellers who are in advance, at the vanguard of culture and art.
This list ultra-selective has already hosted prominent actors artistic St Petersburg whose achievements are beyond the borders of the city and have found a recognition in Europe, having been known throughout Russia.
The new hero of “Rosbalt” is the painter extraverti Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, this man, bearded, dressed in red that you can sit near the Russian Museum Garden, the summer or in the festivities and vernissages plugged.
The tables of Kirill Miller still rallying crowds, whatever their exposure.
It is one of conteurs pétersbourgeois fundamentally social and philosophical, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is an eminent representative of the vanguard Petersburg of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, his appearance made people smile and puts in a good mood.
It has recently taken in his hands a culmination of Barbary and it became the symbol of this instrument to St Petersburg since it had matured enough for this difficult role of its existence, its philosophy and its image of bohémien.
 - Kirill, why are you through the city while not in red and yellow or blue turquoise, for example?
 I chose the red as clothing firm specialising in aspect and image.
In this world, the red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of image and society.
Even if in the society, which is not grey raises the aggressiveness and a negative unrest.
But my provocations are designed to initiate the discussion.
The whole history of my actions provocative is an invitation to the debate.
 And when did you understood that you had to be painter?
 The exposure of the Palace of Culture Nevskiy where were my work.
I understood that this was my way.
Then, the wave of old painters unofficial was gone and the new, free, like me, were misunderstood.
I started at my friends with painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina which gave birth to “Pouchinskaya-10” and then there has been more vague.
I am interested in the theatre, fashion, music, all the Equality except for the words.
 And all this is in your clinical artistic … it was important for me to be at the centre of the culture of St Petersburg where must meet the best creative forces.
In 1995, I have taken place at Pouchkinskaya-10 which housed the work before a club musical and artistic, a club bohémien, the home of Bohemia Petersburg.
Many are born: NOM, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project “the ear of Van Gogh.”
Chnour and his friends sang songs easy in play-back in swimming moulants, they were among them, composer Igor Vdovin today.
When the group began to happen in Live, it became “Leningrad”.
Trakhtenberg infused not emissions before the time of Hali Gali.
We have given them Trakhtenberg and then his great career began, but his training and his basic education, it is at home that he has received.
“Galérie D137 Club”, “Griboïedov”: these are the repercussions of the artistic clinic.
Our employees are parties as accustomed.
I am a hero of the past century, when the culture wanted to say something.
In 2000, a poll was organised in the press: it was the price “personalities of our city.”
I have been appointed “artist of the year”, and that is when my reign was ended.
This is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and the culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, we may be popular, but not really a person of culture.
 - Your work is characterised by a recognisable style.
 Many of my tables are hits, they have a situation and a very strong.
I will have an exhibition scheduled “the museum through the russian clowns.”
The clowns belong to a category timeless.
Before I was a social, today it hurts and that fear of being so.
But with the clowns, receding, the tragic fall.
I love the grotesque, I have ideas grotesque.
For example, the idea of saving the world via the nakedly total and compulsory.
Today, it is the dress that is important, it is interested in the mechanism outside, but not in person.
Perhaps we could not give him the hand, but rather to spit the tronche.
And the lie will be wiped out by the nakedly.
 Recently we will have seen in the role of player culmination of Barbary. - a city cultural must have this kind of hero.
Who else can play.
 But perhaps the art trade can also be beautiful?
 Today the art trade must be treated, delicate liquoreux.
A disintegration of the culture is happening.
Before, people were divided in herds, supporters of Bohemia loved something dumb, another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is hard to please everyone.
I am not a ticket for a hundred dollars to please everyone.
Today, we need to think about who you please.
Each star has 100 fans.
 But thousands of people come see Stas Mikhaïlov!
 What are people that we have thrown who come to see, is the sexual and social work.
But for the cultural side, 300 people come, 10 miles will not, and ultimately that is less management, money, just languishes.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I peignais tables a collectionneur has hung alongside Falk or Larionov.
I started with the tables which usually are those that are painted in end of life.
Today, we often confuse the ideas.
We say: there is the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
The consumer culture, it has nothing to do.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused the money just to paint.
I am to this culture.
 - Kirill, what is lacking in St Petersburg?
 - Good experts.
It is this concept: the official culture.
But all may not work in the culture.
During the reign of the Tsars, this was not like that, the tsars did not understand the culture, but they understood that it needed to retain the good experts.
In Moscow, there is now good consultants.
We have people here in St Petersburg who could be experts, but they are discarded, because experts higher which accurately assess these experts and their fraieront a path.
Currently, it is the “reign of taste evolves.”
The same Erarta, but they differ in that they say honestly that they do not take all contemporary art, there are painters who must find other museums.
 For you, what is St Petersburg?
 St Petersburg-is not the cultural capital, there is much more to Moscow of culture, there is a ground for this.
And on our stones, art is hard to push.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, that is bad.
In Europe, there is a lot of curious who will see exhibitions, concerts.
At home, this layer is very fine.
We must make the art to fashion, as was the case at the beginning of the last century.
Project done with the support of the stock of St Petersburg
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Warming or collision with an asteroid murderer.
Caravans of space shuttles with land to go in search of a planet of rescue.
To save humanity, a big question is: how can we continue to live our species in weightlessness or even on a planet of rescue?
I believe that there is not much choice.
There are in fact two real planets that we can win, if only by hypothesis.
“It is about Venus and Mars,” believes Vladimir Sourdine, researcher from the Institute of State astronomical P.K. Chternberg (GAICh).
If on Mars conditions are more suited for life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500.
We cannot live there at very high altitude or on the orbit of Venus … in space.
We began to take an interest in matters of reproduction in space by focusing on flora.
There was still a half-century, carried out experiments on the plants.
Four generations of peas grown on orbit is differentiated in no way varieties of land.
Secondly, it has put into orbit of insects, small flies drosophiles milking.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to the area to see how a developing embryo in weightlessness.
You get to the exit a poussin quite normal.
It is then that the problems start.
“The problem is that the poussin must find a medium, he must get on its feet and start moving,” explains the director of the institute of forensic biological problems of the Academy of Sciences of Russia (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
By not finding any medium, the chicks are waving disorderly.
And after 10 p. m., the new born saw their instincts entirely atrophying.
The chicks will react to or the light or at her.
Unfortunately, they simply die after quattre days.
“We have widened their eyes twice, then we have abandoned, because it is simply impossible to work with them there,” explains Vladimir Sychev in noting the failure of the experience with the chicks in space.
The last “miniature ark” organic with animals has been sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, the “biosatellite Bion” take on board that the species of the same sex.
There has been an experience with rats sent with their fetus in space.
In principle, there is nothing supernatural being discovered.
“It was still biosatellites and then it is the only experience to carry out this kind of research,” said Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the rats in the area have given birth to their offspring.
However, we cannot yet make reproductions directly in space.
This is no small feat.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realise their sexual impulses.
Unlike animals, humans can, in principle.
The Homo sapiens has abstract, it is able to create a proper emotional content.
This kind of experience is not done for ethical reasons.
But women are in the area for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And the female body is what humanity has more valuable.
Our mouette has disappeared and nobody on Earth could not say whether it would take after a flight into space.
If she could give birth to a child after the theft.
“Nobody answering this question,” explains Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, pensioner sector rockets and space.
In June 1964, just a year after his flight in space, the first woman, Valentina Tereshkova – gave birth to a girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaïev was also –.
In 1988, the second woman – Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been twice on orbit and having worked in middle non-working, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk continues.
We have very little, even little spaceflight who did nothing and who give birth to a descent into full health after long flights.
“And if they are longer, this presents a danger even during flights into orbit,” concludes the pilot – and, hero of the Soviet Union and heroes of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
But humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, protection against radiation and the creation of an artificial gravity.
Laboratory of hydrology of central preparation of spaceflight: obligatory step in preparation for the flight.
Here, in flottabilité zero, spaceflight has lead to exit non-véhiculaires.
Water imitates the weightlessness.
If for adults, water is comfortable but a middle abroad, for infants, it is their true element.
The small amphibious men seem to confirm: life on Earth from the ocean.
As the baby moving around 9 months in the liquid lymphatique the belly of its mother, it is easier to get used to the water.
This is, in principle, logical, since its birth until his first bath, it happens only 2 weeks.
“It is very unlikely to forget,” explains the instructor swimmer for infants, Marina Aksenova.
In a word, whether for the child who just born the weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs of gravity, a force of weight.
In weightlessness, the muscles in the womb, the basin is atrophient very quickly, the ability to push the baby is lost.
Good to know that agreement, based on simulators childbirth.
Of course you can prepare a birth in a special chamber, the woman will bring it out.
“And then?” asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite to reflect on this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs an artificial gravity.
If he does not feel the soft ground, the body does not form the skeleton or the muscle system.
We cannot pay a baby as an adult with a combination of special for the exercises.
It will simply be deprived of its vital needs.
“And this experience that we see in this case in imagining the birth of a child in a strange environment will return to Earth of a disabled child, entirely désadapté”, says the director of the ethics committee in the Institute of forensic biological problems of the Academy of Sciences of Russia, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in the area is still theory.
However, with time this will become reality, when the people travelling in their commuting to a distant planet, which will become the habitat of their offspring born in space.
The head of the ISC (institution more control of public finances) said: “the control of pseudo-independent work (in Czech” system Švarc”) failed because of politicians.
In the area of government procurement, the Czech Republic has trained inspectors and legislation of quality but it is lagging behind in its application.
That is what was said Miloslav Kala, Vice President of the institution more control of public finances in an interview for Aktuálně. cz.
“The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, that is what is missing here,” said Kala in his explanation of the current situation.
An inspection conducted jointly by inspectors czech and german also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practice approach of the “system” by Petr Nečas Švarc.
The first minister said recently that the ODS would not upset the entrepreneurs with controls; is permitted or prohibited?
“The law must be applied in one way or another, even if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent act one authority to inspect to demand respect for the law,” says Kala.
At the meeting of the supervisory committee in the House of Deputies, you mentioned a Czech-german project in which have been compared to the laws of procurement of these two countries.
What was it actually matter?
There is a parallel control that we have launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, the european legislation provides for how to manage the public markets and national legislation and a special practice itself will follow.
We have brought all this and that this procedure is not yet complete, we are very interesting differences emerged: generally speaking, our legislation may be “stronger and better”, however, certain parameters, such as the practice is best in Germany.
This confirms that it does not do enough to continually develop rules increasingly detailed but that it is necessary to devote themselves to the implementation of the law.
What this project can help you specifically and result in it for you?
A joint control of this type should contribute to that we stop to try to clarify the laws, lowering and improve the thresholds, when this was not a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), to exclude all enrichment and a possible criminal activity.
But by lowering thresholds of markets, you will not necessarily this objective.
It could be that this system is so overwhelmed by paperwork, that those who seek loopholes will find many more opportunities if the threshold was remained high.
You talk about internal problems concerning the implementation of the legislation of the public markets.
How the control system in Germany?
Is there a similar institution in our ISC or a mode of organisation different?
For those institutions, similarly to the ISC, works there the Bundesrechnungshof which is organized similarly, it also has a board was a little differently, but these two institutions are basically in a similar manner.
The powers are also, to a certain extent, similar, with nuance, however, compared to our system: Germany being a federal structure, it has also over the accounts of this kind at the level of individual states.
The BRH can only control the federal money, which is home to the resources of the state.
The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities, are there controlled level over the accounts of the Länder.
As regards the national legislation, is simpler than ours?
I do not wish to make general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often cited as a model but we can certainly do better in all areas.
It may be due to the fact that they have better inspectors?
Not, certainly, but I repeat, I do not have data for comparison.
However, it must also be said that this country that we regard as a model is also facing a whole series of problems.
Otherwise, they have no advantage to cooperate with our institution, no?
As regards the national legislation, that has meant for you, as an institution, the amendment of the law on public markets, its effects are already feel?
This amendment being entered into force relatively recently, it has no impact on our control operations.
As we do the controls, it is with some delay.
Our observations only concern, for the moment, the process of preparing future controls-we have launched a new instrument of “detection of risk of bad management” with which we have previously screened nearly 14 000 public markets, these changes will, of course, because the thresholds have been modified so that the conditions of some types of tendering procedures and so on.
Is this so that you consider the adoption of this law rather than as an advantage or as an additional burden for the administration?
I think that this law is a step in the right direction, and I hope that the future will confirm this.
The problem that can arise is that these rules are becoming more severe and that it is not possible to meet them.
Already under the regime of the previous regulation, the provider (for example, the regional council, in the case of the regional operational programmes) recruited subjects monitored to accept that any violation of the law on the markets means a breach of discipline.
So is it really appropriate to make the law more severe in this way?
No, not in that way, I think.
The system has to exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse but not punish those who commit errors formal without consequence on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put greater pressure on the administration.
So what is the solution to cope?
Look at where we are not.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not upset the entrepreneurs with the controls of the so-called system Švarc-what does that mean?
The system Švarc is banned or allowed?
The law must be applied in one way or another, even if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent act one authority to inspect and demand respect for the law.
He can say: “we are going to change the law and allow”, but we cannot say that we are going to act as if nothing had happened.
The law on the markets has relatively strict rules on formalities to achieve and what, precisely in order to protect the tender.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated solely because of defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and is, in my opinion, what is lacking at home.
The roads are frozen in places, but most penetrable.
In some places in the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also covered in snow.
The network, however, remains largely practicable, in some places with increased vigilance.
Region of Karlovy Vary
In the region of Karlovy Vary, roads were this morning practice, but in places frozen and also covered in snow.
Temperatures have dropped and oscillate between 5-and-10 ° C but they should slightly back in the day.
The snow had stopped in the region and remains in the plains that a thin layer of snow.
The peaks mounts Erz Mountains (Krušné hory), however, are overlaid by around 30 centimetres of snow.
The data service regional maintenance of roads because of the fog, the visibility was reduced by places.
The fast track R6 and the national roads in the region are now feasible without difficulties.
Vigilance remains, however, for example on some bridges whose décor can be frozen and slippery.
All roads and minor roads to third category, including the mountain roads, are also practical.
It remains on some of their sections of the remains of snow and frozen in places tassée by traffic.
Especially in areas located in altitude, drivers must strengthen their vigilance.
Regions and Hradec Králové Pardubice
The direction of roads and motorways says on its Web site that some roads in Bohemia East are threatened by the formation of ice and snow layers of tassées by traffic can be found on the roads in the mountainous and located in altitude.
The upkeep of roads warn drivers against the risks of training of ice in areas of the region of Pardubice located in altitude.
There may be ice in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, mainly on the local roads and third category.
The roads I / 43 and I / 34 around Svitavy have been chemically treated.
The snow lies mainly in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) and the hills of Aigle (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a layer of snow tassée by traffic is present on the roads in areas located in altitude.
In the East, the time will be dry today, most often reached, with possible passages overcast.
It will be a wind and low temperatures vary widely between-3 and + 1 ° C.
Region of Pilsen
The roads in the region of Pilsen today are feasible, although, in some places, it should show an increased vigilance and adjust to weather conditions.
It is freezing this morning, temperatures oscillate between-3 and-9 ° C.
After the recent snow and cooling that followed, some channels of communication can be frozen in places.
Drivers can expect to cross areas of fog, visibility will improve gradually, however.
It is this that is the information service regional road maintenance.
The motorway is practicable d5 almost without difficulties, the upkeep of communications traffic recommends, however, increased vigilance among the 80 kilometres and 131.
The surface of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in the district of Pilsen-south and in the district of Tachov.
The local channels and third category are wet and in this case applies the warning against stretches frozen.
Drivers must be vigilant, and particularly on the roads less crowded region Šumava National Park.
Olomouc region
Drivers travelling in areas of the region of Olomouc located in altitude must now reckon with a thick layer of snow and soft on the roads.
This layer remained on the collar said “Červenohorské sedlo” and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after the operations of chemical treatment.
The snow have forced this night the staff of road maintenance to travel on the ground; according to the services in charge of the roads, it fell more than three centimeters in the district of Šumperk.
In other parts of the region, most of the roads are practical difficulties.
“On the heights of the district of Šumperk lie the remnants of snow.
Drivers travelling towards Jeseník must expect to meet the collar said “Červenohorské sedlo” a thick layer of snow and soft “said today in ČTK the upkeep of roads district Šumperk.
Their colleagues district Jeseník also went on site during the night; in the latter, after the chemical treatment, the roads are now available and mouillées, even in areas of the highest.
In the district of Olomouc roads are practical difficulties, in the district of Šternberk drivers should, however, be careful in stretches in forest areas to the kerb remained wet.
Regions Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
This morning, the upkeep of roads in northern Bohemia reported several difficult stretches.
The data from the police, that in some places covered in snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
Temperatures remain below zero in most low altitude, and therefore the snow and the ice should stay on the roads in the lowlands, especially to the south is the central plateau of Bohemia, there is, in fact, no problem, and the roads are usually dry.
No difficulty of movement has been found for the moment.
The upkeep of roads have indicated the presence of ice, especially around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions were ideal night to his training: rain and melting snow during the day, Sky and freezing during the night.
It also points out that, since the main roads, the difficult conditions on the road to national 13 on the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the movement between Telnice and Knínice is due to the branches of trees that are courbées under the weight of the snow to reach the road.
Šimon Ornest said: “together, we want to collect the positive energy.”
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month, this should be the end of the world?
This is just one of these alarming news, the kind of traps in which we love down.
In our group The Tap Tap, rigole rather and we are told that we are the only group able to collect a remains positive energy in order to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, you go up in December a project quite unique: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you offer in more detail this project to our readers?
It is a charity that we prepare for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the mayan calendar announced on 21 December 10 to 11 hours of the morning.
The day before, on 20 December, three concerts held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will run almost at the point where the mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati, which is in the ocean, on a peaceful time zone in advance of 12 hours compared to us.
That has had this idea?
Initially I think that was my idea, then we have all designed with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want, together with the public, think about the state of the world we leave to our children.
At the end of the mayan calendar, we have created a unique collection of objects, including shoes, t-shirts, bags, and the original key against the end of the world, buying online at www. e-tap. cz people can also support us.
The group The Tap Tap with other interpreters has also recorded an anthem against the end of the world, which is called “the end of the world (“cancelled” in Czech Konec světa zrušeno”).
It is already very popular on YouTube, the hearing is also at these concerts charitable?
Of course, in the end, finally, if we succeed and that the end of the world has not …
It will be chantée simultaneously by all the performers in the three concerts.
The anthems are also joining at a given moment in a broadcast live, quite unique, television Czech.
The words of that song was written by Tomáš Hanák which also takes the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X is also singing …
How are you come to cooperate with them?
We work with other figures of show business, because we have many concerts and charity events …
We try to make them intensively involved in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that the fun.
What are the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the training centre Studeo which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and we are working to achieve in the framework of the Institute Jedlička, with the association Tap, and that for six years.
Teachers are regularly pupils Institute Jedličkův and offering activities that interest them and amused.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the courts, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Institute Jedlička we will transfer this project in a new building.
Several groups of music and performers get on stage at each of these concerts?
By what criteria, you have the chosen?
We have tried to develop a programme that appeals to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, set on stage Chinaski, Support Lesbiens Illustratosphere, with Dan Bárta, the Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You can find all the details on www. kpks. cz.
Prepare yourself to other “mega events” of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the framework of the Prague Spring; also, surely we prepare a programme of quality with guests interesting.
We would also like to play next year in the house of the Czech Republic to New York and personally, once in the US, I like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimal, you played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is nevertheless a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your touring?
This is not so terrible that it sounds at first.
We have five members in electric chair whose gear must travel in bunker, naturally we trimbalons too many bags and boxes of instruments …
So far, everything is always more or less well past ČSA and British Airways were always well prepared for us, they have surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything happened without problems.
Thanks to your travel abroad, you can compare what these countries differ in terms of ease of access for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of the public towards disabled people and so on.
What have been your experiences until now?
After Luxembourg, Madrid, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that is all that is still in the initial phase.
In Prague, Moscow is still very few accessible to people with disabilities; there, it is still not aware that a person moves only in electric chair in the city centre.
They do not yet see evidence to give priority to a person in a chair in a lift.
Fortunately there, too, an association seeking to draw attention to the problems of disabled people is being created.
What do we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things for which we are still lagging behind …
It is important to mention that the improvements and refinements are always dependent on efforts by the people involved.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a severe handicap travelling alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, the museum, anywhere …
It is not very often where a large number of disabled people actively participate in social life, on this point, you, the Tap Tap, are rather the contrary to the cutting edge!
The respect of the public and the access facilities are one thing, but the situation really begin to change when we have among us athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers.
For the moment, they are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The group The Tap Tap is currently very popular, going back a few years, which would you drove in 1998 to create this group?
I started to work as an educator at the Institute Jedlička, where I found myself surrounded by a lot of young people willing to invest in something.
And as I am myself (I musician plays, among others, of the saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a music activity.
And then, with time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič, has lost control of the situation (laughter).
The success came in recent years, if I am not mistaken?
That is true, to create links with singers known and work actively to promote the group has helped us.
We understood that, if a job is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the fund.
Thanks to European Union subsidies, we can, in addition, our teacher quality, equipment, and so on.
Had you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential to change things.
Show business is full of tricks which copy from each other.
In a way it is logical: everything new is accepted with caution and it takes a long time.
Few projects are original, and I daresay that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who we see for the first time the pity is, of course, that is natural …
But the pity is completely unnecessary, because people with a disability are not in pain, abandoned of all, that we need to take in pity.
These are people who can live a full life and flourish, provided we have the necessary resources, of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities to achieve something, this is not only a step for them but for the whole society.
Has your success is also due to the fact that you are a leader, you are demanding as described by many people?
If we want to do the work of quality, we must be firm in many areas and demand a certain discipline.
But I think this is quite normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and the head in the clouds and, when they realise that they must come to repeats twice per week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the roads to the concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The group The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
“How many of them were already there in 1998?
A single, Láďa Angelovič.
We are a group opened, people entering and leaving, we can do nothing.
Our doors are always open to those who want to have or want to join us.
This is the eve of the day planned for the end of the world, on Thursday 20 December 2012 from 9 p. m.
This action in Prague in the arena Incheba in Brno to Fléda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by relays visual when chantée jointly the song the group The Tap Tap “end of the world” cancelled.
The aim of the concert is to gather the financial resources (25 million CZK) to equip the training centre multifunctional Studeo which lies in Prague in the Institute Jedlička.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, entry is free for children up to 12 years, the sales of tickets is open to Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland has been admitted as twentieth member of this agency, it is the second member of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had begun a close collaboration with the ESA in 1994 and in the years that followed has participated in a number of projects in the agency.
The road to Poland into space has, however, began much earlier.
Before the second world war, the polish fans are working on space flights; they do not always get understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, the conference has Šternfeld. the astronomical observatory in Warsaw, 6 December 1933, during which he detailed ideas from his book, entitled “introduction to space travel.”
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left listeners cold and years later Šternfeld rappela is that only Dr Jan Gadomski'interest in its work.
In 1934, Šternfeld earned in France the price-Robert Esnault Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his book “introduction to space travel.”
The doctor Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) became a great propagateur of astronomy and space travel.
It published hundreds of articles in newspapers and polish wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a propagateur space travel of world renown, his contribution has been particularly rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of cratères of the dark side of the moon.
From 1925 was built in Poland a draisine destined to be equipped with a rocket engine.
It is unfortunately neither the author nor the details of this project.
It is not clear whether the rocket should serve to propel or curb the draisine.
The only information known about the draisine are those of the press of the time.
From 1933, the polish artillery began to devote themselves to the rockets.
The research was carried out by the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with teachers and Mieczyslaw Wolfke Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
The documents held that this research had reached the trial stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the german armed, research is being discontinued.
In 1937, plans a rocket hunting photoélectrique, designed by the engineer Rohoziński, first appeared in the press and the following year was published the book “Rakieta-torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza” of an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
These two projects had intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all the projects to use the technical rockets were conducted by the scientific advisory committee (“provisional Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy”), which was coordinating all the work.
This committee was created in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended his activities.
After the war, other work on the aircraft were published in the polish press, thanks to the polish society astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, it is a question of a society in the number of November 1954 newspaper problem, in which four more detailed articles devoted to aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Mr Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society devoted to space travel
At that time, the projects of artificial satellites had already been launched and it was clear that the area of space research in the future.
At the beginning of the year 1956, society astronautics polish (PTA) déploya efforts to enter the international astronautics Federation (created in 1951) and in the autumn, the PTA in became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became vice-president of the Federation of international travel.
It conserva his office until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the rocket Meteorological RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch occurred on 10 October 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1,800 metres had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
The result was built by an improved version, RM-1A and, during the summer of 1959, test flight of the rocket to two storeys RM-2 were launched in the desert of Bledov.
This rocket had a length of 1.4 metre and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The prototype that should have been capable of carrying out scientific work concrete-RM-34 missiles have a range of up to 14.5 km and serve to observe the wind in altitude.
But in 1963, all the development work was halted.
The rocket Meteor-1 developed during the 1962-1965, installed the first rocket-type RM.
This rocket, designed with two tiers, had a total of 510 cm length and weight of original 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, 1B-and-1C) were developed; they are distinguished by the dimensions of the space for the scientific tools.
The rocket Meteor-1A had an area offering a volume of 0.4 per litre, while in Meteor-1b this volume was $0.34 per litre and Meteor-1C of 0.62 per litre.
The significance of all these types of gear was 37 km.
In the period 1965-1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, the first test flight began in October 1970.
The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a burden worth 10 kg at an altitude of around 60 km.
Later versions were built the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
It has yet to mention the entry of Poland to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee COSPAR two years later.
Under the programme Interkosmos, Poland has also participated in space exploration on the soviet satellites artificial and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimir Remek, the second – non-soviet programme.
The repeal of the law on the work of public utility is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court has repealed the law on the work of public utility.
This decision has raised in the public a heated discussion.
No doubt it is interesting to look at this issue from a broader view.
The economic systems geared towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation are founded on the principle of more economic competition unregulated.
In practical terms, this means that economic entities and national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other.
This is the principle of free trade and the free movement of capital (without limits) private ally unrestrained financial speculation.
The significant differences in the cost of labour (salaries) generate tension on prices.
It is under this term meaning: a producer tries by the import of goods sold cheaply to resist economic competition in “making it more expensive,” the price of competitor, in order to take a greater share of the market and to increase its own profits.
Large-scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: is shifting production abroad, either to buy cheap, either disappear. the result is high unemployment in the countries where prices are high compared to other economies.
Given that the private capital has no responsibility from a social point of view and thereby responsibility toward the unemployment it engenders, the social costs of the state increase necessarily.
This whole situation intensifies the perfect unwillingness of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and to compensate for the social and economic damage caused to the whole of society in this race for profit.
This situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide data concrete statistics.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital in the various economies create a situation in which the governments of different countries are forced to engage in a mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own people in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments are putting their own population at the mercy of private capital without taking account of social collapse.
This is evident mainly in the amendments to the laws in force.
The goal is to force economically on its own population to accept the dictates of the price of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This happened first by a system of economic constraints in cases of long-term unemployment and secondly by restricting the rights of employees in the area of employment legislation.
The result is a growing poverty and deepening differences between the rich and the poor.
In Germany, there are points for years the public distribution of food for the poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work.
There are already millions by the number of these people.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the german economy, it becomes quite aware that employees receive such salaries that the state is forced to pay extra to the bare minimum.
Such a scandal, for example, has been updated in the case of employees working as carers in the federal Parliament.
The economy of almost all the southern countries of the EU generate, without doubt, a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of the society, people are forced to migrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or just stumble along with poverty wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day the private capital to invest in their countries.
Now we have to ask the question: where will the capital?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will rise from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or even a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, a Égyptien or African will continue to work for a fraction of a salary.
This is also about Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media claim to be tired, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that led economy led to an economic disaster.
Private capital fiercely defends the idea that the state should not intervene in the economy by regulatory interventions.
Then we should ask themselves if private capital would not influence and, even, does not drive today, according to its own selfish interests, politics and the state as a whole.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
The proof is that there is an almost all-powerful lobby and present in all states.
This results in a desperate situation erupts in the area of corruption, by granting mutual benefits in the legislation, where everything is reprehensible, but not a criminal offence.
In Germany, the situation is such that, due to the lack of financial resources, the national ministries delegate the draft laws to law firms, closely related to the industry.
These bills are then adopted in the Bundestag.
The entire power comes not from the people, as saying the constitutions of western type, but powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that democracies-oriented liberalism are now quickly face the situation described by Appianos in his book “the crisis of the Roman Empire at the time of Caesar and Pompée”: “the state was long in full decline and functions were attributed by violence.
The blows of bribes, favors obtained illegally, and the stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The bribes and corruption have proliferated without limits and people travelling to the elections with voices already sold” … “honest people does not seek to obtain functions, the result was once the state remained 8 months without consuls” … “we really began to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it should choose a man energetic” … it is true that Appianos Pompée had in mind, but it is Caesar who transformed irreversibly democracy in absolute rule.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the current society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interests of society as a whole.
In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and to assert the interests of society as a whole.
As a result, today as in the past, a decadence without prior elites, with no effort to carry out reforms.
We therefore need to find the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the liberalisation unscrupulous economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
As things stand, we can see the disappearance of these systems to the benefit of liberal democracies as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the elites current completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human lives, the humanitarian and social crises that we are witnessing today and crimes against humanity as we know from history and recent.
The repeal of the law on the work of public utility is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both internationally and domestically, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is systemic.
The solution lies in reforms aimed at social, which will strengthen the capital investment of the state in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society to benefit the state.
Israel: laboratory of chaos.
“Nothing will come out of the violence never and never will,” says Sting in song entitled to fragile whose main refrain is “do not forget how much we are fragile.”
“If my son does not want war, there would not have been any,” said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions are high.
Some are taking the side of Israel, asserting its right to self-defence and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, citing racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and Israel view as a terrorist state.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is a victim, in its recurring waves of killings; after all, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, are born in the present political situation and have not lived through the beginning of the violence.
I would like to offer readers a view “located behind the curtain”, in which mainly benefits the tensions that persist for more than 95 years (from the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small country in the Middle East.
Some of these thoughts are based on historical facts available to the study, others from my own understanding of, or more precisely the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily the story of a struggle for power.
Each time, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these individualities acting independently or if they had their acts to the throne to someone who ran their acts according to previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we live in a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration causing some financial powers could not happen in the course of a single generation.
Among families with an astronomical wealth stands out particularly the Rothschild family, that could be seen as the head of the octopus (I know if these families still have a leader, but I do not exclude).
Little is writing about them.
Of course.
Since the 1990s the 19th century, they have acquired the first press agency World (Reuters) in order to put an end to the establishment of ties between their name and serious criminal acts for which they were involved and who had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, increasing their wealth or both.
They have major stakes in almost most central banks in the world and preparing or waging wars against countries in which they have not yet of such shares (before the invasion of Afghanistan, the number of these countries were 7, after the invasion of Iraq, 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only 4, meanwhile, Russia has placed the Russian Central Bank under the control of the russian government).
Anyone who has tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Bank of America of Rothschild status of Central Bank and began to make during the civil war his own money (government, I hear) and was assassinated in a theatre in 1865.
Jfk began to make clean money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was assassinated in 1963, the MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to initiate proceedings against the EDF for having triggered the economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power globally has led in the years 1859 in 1871 to formulate a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a the Freemasons initiated in the 33rd degree, the highest level.
The first war was designed to eliminate the large state monarchies of Europe, the second should remove colonialism, including british, and the third should reduce the global population between 0.5 and 1 billion people (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (the œcuménisme nothing other than the beginnings of such a solution) and, ultimately, gain an absolute power.
The method used by the clan of families richer spearheaded the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos-the following order chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF intended to avoid repetition not crises as they began in 1907).
Having managed to trigger the first world war by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-hungarian throne Habsburg, they destroyed Tsarist Russia in causing the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended abruptly by a german capitulation without justification economic and military (the war was no longer necessary to the destruction of Czarist Russia) and it was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
Easier for an outbreak of the second world war, bankers have left politicians create a situation of latent conflict: they have one imposed on Germany to enormous war reparations and creates the conditions of a radicalization of the impoverished masses (it then put a sufficiently forceful leader, pointing the finger of blame, offering simple solutions) and, secondly, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong german minority who should play the role (she actually held) to fifth column to put the fire and start a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspira to the creation of a jewish state, preferably in the region of Judea historic with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned above laid the groundwork for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the initial friction with the local population Arab began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The second world war broke out; it is difficult to judge whether Hitler has broken the chains in which international bankers had taken initially; or if all he did was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the foundations of the acceptance of a jewish state in the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way that war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of the second world war, the founding of the State of Israel has lit a conflagration could cause a third world war.
If international bankers come to war, the jewish population is as it was during the second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as the population generally Arab or Muslim Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at international level (it enough to see how people are bitterly divided between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-palestinian conflict, where a wrong creates another wrong according to a circle of violence and where you find the origin of all, the greed of some individuals and their desire to acquire the power on the world?
It is the difference between ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because as home, international bankers do not propose to people in elections that their own candidate.
The present Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a politician fascist-type, loyal toward the international bankers, all in order to start a war with Iran, which could, because of the country's accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc …) expand to become a global conflict and, given that Iran control the Strait of Hormuz through which pass 20% of all the oil world (this corridor shipyard has a breadth of 2 miles) and create a destruction of the global economy.
Under what light now appear the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: “the only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order.”
In their view, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every new born is located at birth a microchip make him be a totally controlled.
“What they require all individuals, large and small, rich and poor, free and slave to bear on the hand or the front a red mark on the railways, so that it can buy or sell those who do not bear the name of this savage beast or the number of his name.
We need to understand: that of common sense into the figures of this savage beast.
This number naming rights and it is six hundred and sixty six.”
The film Argo: when everything goes to the most evil, called Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of demonstrators made up of Islamists took students stormed the US embassy in Tehran and retint 52 diplomats hostage.
They should be released in exchange for the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which supported his regime for decades.
The situation did not offer to the american administration positive outcome, it could not, in fact, abandon the Shah, because it would have severely shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was able to obtain the release of the hostages.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, blow compounded later by the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The diplomats kidnapped were eventually released 444 days later, following the negotiations held by the algerian government.
Their fate inspired the United States a wave of solidarity and an anti-iranian.
The debacle iranian contributed greatly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter with Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections of 1980.
The film Argo, the actor and director Ben Affleck, described an episode of this story, which offered a small victory to America.
Just before she was occupied, six workers échappèrent embassy.
After the turns complicated, they found themselves at the residence of the ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the canadian authorities, the CIA did succeed in getting them out of Iran through a bizarre coverage: they fled the country with canadian passports as members of a camera crew come make repérages for a film set in great spectacle of science fiction.
Combination of Equality
The exfiltration expert Tony Mendez requit collaboration of Hollywood.
In order to make the legend more credible, magasines specialist did state of this film, press conferences were held and a production company to shadow was real offices.
The details of the operation remained a secret, the film based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
The film Affleck is an unusual combination of various kinds.
It is a part of a political thriller designed realistically but also a “caper movie,” the story of a successful coup, a stealth-like, for example, in the trilogy, Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen.
The ambiances occur: sequences of Tehran-style documentary (in the sequences subtitled are presented the iconic photographs of the time of the events and how, thanks to these pictures, these same situations have been recorded in the film, there are no major differences),
Passages more light to Hollywood, treated with irony and a bit of exaggeration,
And then the scenes of the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions with men costumés discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone …
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career so remarkable.
D player ridiculed, he became a respected orchestrator and his game player has continued to make ironic comments.
Argo is his third long-film after the dark police “Gone Baby Gone” (2007) and the thriller “the town” (2010).
It is also the first film that Affleck is not taking place in his home city, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that put its first films above the standard Hollywood.
Affleck is also proof of this sense of the atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran “held” by Canada.
The best scenes of the film takes place in the streets during the reconstruction of facts; the original sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which also suggests the confusion and the unpredictability that occur when suddenly, in a word, is writing a page of history.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect in the fictitious scenes (the wrong camera crew in the bazaar in Tehran).
Too many actions in too many places
The director has had to settle for a subject offering few scenes in the film, thrilling sense of the term.
It is performing well, sometimes it adds some elements to reality here, and the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at the airport in Tehran is ruled out by a telephone call in America and continuing on the runway are quite far-fetched.)
The weakness of Argo lies in its character dissipated, due to the need to show too many things to too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role of cooperators Hollywood, their characters deserve a place more and are not far from the only ones in this case.
The film Affleck lack a bit of dramatic tension, he leaves with a moderate interest, appreciating the achievement and the retro style of the 1970s.
It leads to the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story, in a way, unfinished, and as an illustration the exaggerated the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscients, it does matter.
The rules for inflating balloons, bananas and the circus
The server www. bankovnipoplatky. com, which conducts every year a public inquiry on the bank charges the most absurd, has now decided to launch the contest in regulation or ideas from “the workshop” absurd.
“The fact that the EU is planning, recently adopted a quota of 40 percent of women for the direction of large european companies has been at the root of our decision,” said to the newspaper Právo the organiser of this investigation, Patrik Nacher.
Among the inconsistencies, it already is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify the insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, however, women were an advantage for tariffs on life insurance because they represent, objectively, less risk for insurance companies.
People can say until the end of the year another incredible idea of “the workshop of the EU”.
“The vote will take place before the end of February 2013”, has informed Nacher.
Among the controversial regulations of the EU, for example, the obligation to add components of bio-fuels, which have harmful consequences for the environment, or ban the use of reliable mercury thermometer, only because they contain a relatively low amount of a dangerous substance or the Directive on the size of cages for hens, which led to the increase in the price of eggs.
There has also been criticism of the past against the ban on using the expression “butter chocolate spreads” or the withdrawal of the sale of traditional bulbs.
The bananas must be a size 14 centimetres.
The european administration reacts often under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually held in Brussels by a state or a group of states (and the Czech Republic currently imposes the requests of its banks by threatening to use its veto).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, the origin of the fact that in the Union, bananas must not be a size below 14 cm or present a “abnormal curvature”.
The European Commission is defended by arguing that it was merely harmonise national standards not homogenous which complicate the trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables were relaxed despite the opposition of some states, claiming that the existing directives involve a waste of food.
The first prize will be awarded in this investigation to EU regulation last year that should be on balloons gonflables a warning that children under 8 years should not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU has made reference to a US inquiry that balloons are among the toys, the first cause of death of children by suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years for which is blowing trumpets in the zoo.
Here too, there are suspicions.
The rule on european officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name “Macedonia” and to talk instead about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association “allow turning” consisting of liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky. com has appointed in this investigation, in addition to some nonsense mentioned above, the EU regulation on the volume of reserves of food products on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU has set the maximum amounts for the reserves of food products can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic the day of our membership of the EU.
The Czech Republic dépassa then, for instance, the volumes set for canned risqua, mushrooms and a heavy fine.
The organisers of this investigation found interesting idea of paying money to some countries because they have no access to the sea and the idea of giving a subsidy to ask the granting of subsidies.
These ideas, however, are not from Brussels and Prague.
“Not having sea we handicaps.
We are going to ask the European Union a reimbursement.” and expressed, in the autumn of 2004, the agriculture minister then Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
It argues that, because of our wheat production, and following the purchases “interventionist”, the state was found with full of stocks that we had to then export.
According to palas, the EU should have to pay millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from ports.
Ultimately, the European Commission responded positively to the request and Czech held a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
The subsidies to obtain subsidies have been proposed to the Commons by the Ministry of local development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), they should actually serve to write applications for grants by Brussels.
The EU says: “the bizarre regulations are rare.”
If the regulations are often criticised in the States, according to many experts, the efforts by EU regulatory and improving the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union and in the area of its development, rather than general deserve praise.
More serious is, for example, according to the experts, the problem of the use of EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with the strengthening of european integration, but which have been imposed by the Member States during the budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic should, as other EU countries in Brussels, fighting for the right to use the specific names for these products traditional fight (which it does not always wins) raises strong emotions among the Czechs.
If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the czechs have successfully defended the title “Olomoucké tvarůžky”, in the name of “Tuzemský rum” which dates back home in the 19th century, our producers have had to replace it with the name “Tuzemák.”
Only the products of alcohol of cane sugar, and not out of sugar beet, may carry the name of rum.
In the official list of products made from the EU are today in the company of world-renowned as the Feta cheese or Gorgonzola, massepain of Lübeck or Parma ham and biscuits of Karlovy Vary (“Karlovarské suchary”) of carpes Pohořelice and Třeboň (“Pohořelický has Třeboňský kapr”) and hops of Žatec (“Žatecký chmel”).
The bread of épice of Pardubice (“Pardubický perník”), and the cakes called “Cornets of Hořice” (“hořické trubičky”) can also be proud of their trademark.
People want that I saved the republic, but I am only an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Mr Senator, how is the idea to stand in presidential elections?
This is not to be a senator or president who account for me.
If everything works without problems in our country, I would not be a candidate anywhere.
But I do not support more see as the country is plundered for the last 20 years that the thieves are not in custody and the taxes and the retirement age increase.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that does not feel happy, then I try to offer a solution for that change.
And as I have over 40 years and that I am, independent of any party, I have no other solutions to influence the situation that present the presidential or Senate.
You entered the Senate but you have quickly set en route to the Castle (N. s. T.: chair).
Is it that you do not turn back to the people who elected you?
I have always said that I am launching in the battle for the castle, according to the results of the senatorial elections
Afterwards, I said that if I was elected senator, I come to the presidential elections.
My aim is not the function, it is merely an instrument allowing me to realize my vision.
This is why I need to influence the largest and broadest.
The problem is not just that as a nation we râlons in the bar or in front of the television, but it is also that we are stalling all those who are trying to make the change.
Added to that is the press that scrapping the reputation of people and confuses freedom of speech and freedom of lying.
It has, for example, stated in my speech I soudoie journalists or that I was the adviser Jiří Paroubek.
Turning to your visions.
You began the fight for the castle with as warhorse of the subjects of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and tax declarations retroactive beyond 20 million [CZK].
You need to change the law.
As President, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you solve this problem?
When as a citizen, I have lobbied for the activities of tourist guides are a profession, I have succeeded.
The problem is the politicaillerie: when someone reaches of left or right with a good project, it is deliberately refused and it delays the citizens.
As independent, a member of any party, I have many more opportunities to get the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of power without categorisation and dogma of every party supporters, take what is best for our country and implement it.
You look rather like a man of left or right?
A view of Czech, I have the impression that people would rather put in left.
For me, that is a little to the left or right, this is not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we go forward.
What matters to me is not that people are left or right but to unite people.
I always support any solution contributing to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I act equally impartially against bad ideas.
Is that how you enragez when someone tells you that you are a populist?
But what you said the evidence does not?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you have a certain optimal purpose and vision.
You try to bring you in.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals that I have been applied by the world and recognized experts have spoken.
But without the support of Parliament, you have that slogans.
You do survivrez not long in politics with this.
Do you think that if you are going to see people and their talk, you succeed, for example, to impose liability and criminal material?
I have no other option.
I need to convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to rally them in my camp to impose.
If I was elected president, it is not a problem to broadcast television my request to the chairmen of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
They should then possibly explain why they do not want.
When there is a strong personality who identify abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the president in direct elections, it has been achieved through public pressure.
I confess, bluntly, being an amateur, and not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and my visions.
I have to engage in politics and I am trying to get majority support for my programme.
I try, alone, to make things, and if it does not work, I dwell in six years and I return to the private sector.
It is a bit like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that one person can make a difference, which is why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to present themselves as the Senate elections.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the volume of work.
I have at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová which revealed the fraud with oil.
I presented myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of people did not vote and what did have, for the most part, given their voice to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, there are only two independent.
The people have elected a Senate that will be difficult to impose changes.
Despite everything, I will fight for my vision, for example the election to the direct election of mayors and prefects of regions.
Do you base your own party?
No, not yet, because I do not have the time to check if the past of each potential member is clean and then I do not have the financial means.
I have no money for my presidential campaign, I have that twenty thousand on my account “transparent”.
You have no money?
You talk about tax declarations, what is yours?
I think about 60 million the value of my personal belongings.
I was in Prague a ground 25 million, an apartment to a value of 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth around 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb worth $1 million and a few million in my account.
Incidentally, I have an Aston Martin, because it was a dream boy: I have always liked James Bond, who was drunk in car, galant with women and fought against the evil and abuse.
You drive in Aston Martin, you have a heritage worth 60 million and you have no money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you do not want to invest your own money?
This is not very convincing.
I have not 15 million for this campaign.
I will have to borrow?
I have already invested 2 and a half million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my programme does not generate much interest.
I do not have the obligation to pay this campaign in my pocket.
My expenses are covered by the campaign overall remuneration that I receive as a senator.
But I could not live on, for example, pay school english my son which costs 30 thousand per month.
If my only goal was to make money, I will not be a candidate for election.
You will therefore continue your business activities to live?
Did you not stated that you put down your activities?
But this is not linked to the amount of remuneration.
As I promised, I partly reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy take spring the direction of travel agency.
People would like I am a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But although I live in something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were entrepreneur?
I gagnais and I continue to earn between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were President, I would end my commercial activities.
You will find this interview in the Saturday edition of the newspaper Práva.
The architects of the cabinet MVRDV prove that the real adventures are not just a matter of imagination, if it is enough to contemplate Spijkenisse and the mountain of newly-built £2 pictures
“I find that this building is marrant, it is very futuristic, finally something interesting to see,” said Lisette Verhaig, a broad low-on the side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer programmer in a large company nearby, we said: “yes, it is indeed well, this building.”
But I wonder why we still need today for a library.
Everyone has an iPad, Internet and e-books.
Now, nobody will voluntarily in one of these libraries elderly, no?
Spijkenisse, a city-dormitory towns which is not attractive to the gates of Rotterdam, holds a record quite particular.
The common 80,000 souls showing the rate of education, the weakest of the Netherlands.
In order to restore some neurons in the brain, the city has decided that a few years ago, contributing to the general culture and replicate the seven bridges shadow on the euro notes in the form of cute miniature in small concrete painted.
The success of the offensive cultural remained restricted.
This is how the authorities in the city have realised that there was only one way to take the lead on statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, the office of architects of Rotterdam MVRDV, master of the charts in bold sticks and creator of buildings full of spirit and often cynical, accepted the project with his usual stiff upper lips and appeared in the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a sneer on his face.
And while the members of the jury is still watching, bewildered and shrugging the shoulders, Maas, the brazen, empila its books of choice in order of size into a pyramid, and ended his speech echoed arguments to activists by a common: “dear!”
It is my proposal for the mountain of books from Spijkenisse, or as we say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain of EUR 30 million has gushed.
The edifice is part of a revitalization project will also feature an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and houses mitoyennes for a total of 50 homes.
In early November, the mountain of books has received the second price “Best Library of NL 2012 .”
In addition, the project has been selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
That is how this small village, dull, which until now had nothing more to offer than a post-modern piétonne area and a mayor of a woe staggering, whose facades white to think they harbour a dairy, ascended to a contemporary architectural practice.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now has the first building public cultural history.
The long road to reading
First impression: El Dorado book under glass to cheese.
Certainly, an elevator transports you to the heart of the massive, but the real joy of reading and architecture is open to you when you foulez soil of the building to the discovery of its topography.
The internal entirely made of glass is bright and clear, the soil in dutch bricks and lampposts elegant unequivocally speak the language of municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking at the public benches, dogs and boys and girls who play the ball.
Everywhere, and books, books and more books.
“Normally, the library shelves are along the coast and in the middle is a room large and dark, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal,” explains Willy Maas.
We have completely changed the configuration classic space and open spaces of reading from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain of books has been skilfully constructed: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the club of failures, the Centre for Environment and the technique of building.
A special beauty lies in the black shelves of the library, which are sometimes of lambris, sometimes of balustrades, sometimes the ramps staircase.
A new experience for sight, touch and odorat.
Even the architects and engineers building hardened do not want materials unknown.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, head of the common Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
This is a day we found in a farm Friesian waste ad hoc from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, used for years to the synthetic membrane of a millimetre thick as substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It is cheap and we win over time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then you can throw it.
For the library, the membrane was steamrollered, for the first time in such quantities, sclerosis thick four centimetres.
Because of the heat and pressure, the “Landbouwplastic” (KPL) exchange of colour and turns into a dark material, consistent and resilient, whose smell evokes both a new car and trainers.
At the top of the 105 marches is the summit of the mountain.
After almost 500 metres, coffee literary offers us an impregnable on the city, but also the croquettes Dutch and ficus in pots.
They create an atmosphere, but they all contribute to maintaining the ideal level of moisture in the air of the mountain of literature.
Donations for the new soul
“It is incredible, but despite all the areas of glass, this building is a model in terms of ecology,” assigns Trouborst.
The temperature of the edifice is regulated by geothermal power.
Although the mountain of books is below a line of glass, the sun illuminates that little time inside, even the days of good weather.
The thick wooden beams from across the facade of glass are bull-sun listening, a large part of the shelves.
The mood is very pleasant.
The fully automated blinds can do the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned septique computer programmer, is already risky to enter the new library.
Lisette Verhaig also was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, traditional chinese medicine, even the Boekenberg describes as the “soul” of Spijkenisse finally restored.
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, every citizen has been invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This allowed to fill the gaps in the library, which was still not completely garnie (today, with 70,000 pounds).
The concept is a success.
The shelves are full of all sides.
For the architect Winy Maas, “there is nothing worse than a half-empty library.”
“I believe that our invitation has created some relationship between the individual citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if this is only for the decoration.”
This is as MVRDV has reached the discipline mistress called, in the professional jargon, “the creation of an identity.”
Spijkenisse has written a new page of literary history.
Although it may seem young and poorly educated.
Finally, it is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: “the Germans must play a larger role.”
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of the palestinian state.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany had announced his intention to vote against the Palestinians asked to obtain the status of observer state at the United Nations.
But she then chose abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not agree with what the Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Berlin should be cautious, because it maintains special relations with Israel.
But I also think that it does not support the US position.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained in the vote on the implementation of a no-fly zone.
Finally, NATO implied this measure.
Germany finds it difficult to take a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is currently revising its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy as defined by the Americans and establish a german foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of coherent policy and common within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans have therefore on several fronts.
We expect them to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to.
I think they still find tâtonnent for this role, but are on the path to a foreign policy more “normal”.
A foreign policy, as in France or Britain
That means in practice then the term “normal” foreign policy to the Germans?
It shows the willingness to adopt positions independent from those of the United States and the european partners, including the national issues.
I believe that german foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, so by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The german economic interests are, to some extent, are different from those of the other great powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
These economic interests have influenced the position of Germany towards the Middle East conflict and abstained from the UN vote?
Germany has first to important markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must take care not to offend the public, but also the elites of the arab countries.
It is undoubtedly a crucial element.
However, I did not rate too much importance, because it is not exclusively unilateral relationship.
But that is in any case a determining factor in the german strategic considerations.
Germany night to its relations with the United States in choosing the abstention of important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I believe that the Europeans and Americans understand perfectly the german position.
That is why I think the divide is not as serious as it was in the case of Libya.
Perhaps that Germany will be more respected.
Indeed, Germany has demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests have to be taken into account.
In Europe, the opinions on the palestinian initiative are diverse.
By contrast, the United States announced their veto of a clear voice.
Opinions differ between the United States and the majority of european countries?
There have always been differences because of the domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama administration secretly greater understanding towards the european position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government of course cannot defend his position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so large that they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, you notice that Obama is not too keen on the policy of Netanyahu.
Germany finds it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, with the position of the large european partners?
I think that it will not make things any easier for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans, if there was a coherent european policy and uniform, but today, this is not the case.
So they cannot take place within a broader policy line and must affirm their peculiar position.
That is what they are doing in the current issue of the euro.
In my opinion, Germany to assume a future role of locomotive and push Europe to adopt a european position.
This is not easy for Germany, partly because of relations with Israel.
This question has always been tricky.
But to me, the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a role which marks more independence.
Germany is playing a role of weight on the international stage, Germany wants it just assume a key role?
Or was it always difficulties to take leading roles on?
Germany is still not used, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still struggling to play a more important role.
If you look at, for example, the euro crisis, we notice that whenever Germany decides to weigh more, many feelings antiallemands is heard.
It does not make things any easier for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: they do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
This point of view, Germany is in a far worse position than the United States.
It must deal with neighbours and opinions very varied, and this is not easy.
Today, the United States' influence on european policy is decreasing, but at the moment, the EU does not fill that vacuum, then who is?
The Germans simply play a more important role.
And even if it does not like, even if it is unpleasant and if they are less popular, this is the life!
Stephen Szabo is the deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy of Washington, an institute in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America are analysing all the challenges of the transatlantic community.
Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specialised in german politics, in american foreign policy and transatlantic relations.
“Protection of trademarks in China”: when Puma and Armani become suddenly chinese
Armani and Ralph Lauren Polo trademarks are known throughout the world.
Armani Polo … what is it really?
Behind this lies a trademark officially in China, but that has nothing to do with the original company.
The brand has a protection as the company that bears the name cannot complain.
And even if it could, it is not certain that it would gain.
“It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,” explains Thomas Pattloch, lawyer cabinet Taylor Wessing specialises in violation of property rights in the Far East.
Each week, a new dossier arrives on my desk.
The copycats require only a few extra letters to register their brands.
Thus, instead of Gucci, recorded Lu-Gucci, Prada, and instead of being recorded Prada-Kny.
German companies are also copy legally, as Puma, the sportswear manufacturer.
Pattloch opens a good filing in which the registrations to brands of Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a chinese company has tabled the brand Zegna DF Puma, a designation that the firm has artificially created by removing part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the home of fashion.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of copying and violation of intellectual property.
In the big cities, you find business centres on several floors that sell almost as counterfeits.
The case of Pattloch, however, are different: its clients the task of addressing the fact that the chinese trademark office confers officially to chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of “Bang Mingpai” brand relative.
The term is derived from “Bang Dakuan.”
It is with this term that are designated for women who are married to men rich.
The chinese authorities say have nothing to blame.
“This is bad for business, we must fight against this trend,” requires Pattloch.
“The brand is diluted, the outlier disappears, the damage to reputation are enormous.”
The financial losses and legal costs running into millions for the sectors concerned, especially regarding the flagship products are expensive.
According to the society of analysis of the market, CLSA China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third world market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
However, it is not easy to delete recordings dubious register trademarks and these procedures are expensive.
These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch mentions the trial in which the court has rejected the complaint, because after a long period, criticised the name had become a “market reality.”
Pattloch explains that if the complainant has no chance, it may even be forced to pay money to plagiaire, because it would have damaged its brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle prevails.
Famous cases include elements of graphics.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the manufacturer of machine site Sany, the same company which had to buy the manufacturer Putzmeister concrete pumps.
That is why the Chinese can use a symbol that resembles the star Mercedes.
Geely, Volvo, acquisiteur used before a blue and white logo which reminded BMW. the conflict was settled and Geely had to amend.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost against plagiaires of Hong Kong and Singapore who had shifted from the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the chinese authorities, they are guilty of anything.
The office of brands CTMO Beijing admits, however, have experienced some difficulties in 2010 because of a lack of staff and space.
However, the office would be spent last year of an “emergency situation in the course of the work to a normality restored.”
Thus, the number of procedures opposition untreated have fallen by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 cases of this type have been closed, which represents an increase of 75% compared to the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 procedures remain outstanding in the Office.
Act is expensive
As so often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO has received more than 1.4 million applications received marks, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the agency, it is a record and this means that China is for the tenth consecutive top of the league for the number of new deposits in the world.
It would also for the total number of legal brands of 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office have counted 1.8 billion yuan of law.
In other words, each registration has reported average 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle is costing much more, as illustrated by the case of the family enterprise German Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company is fighting against a chinese plagiaire.
Admittedly, the Germans could get the illegal manufacture of components of vehicle is suspended.
However, the imitateur could maintain its rights on the chinese brand Freudenberg.
“This is our fault, because the names of families cannot be protected in Germany,” explains Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the direction of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The office of brands had therefore rejected the objection of Munichites.
Freudenberg has certainly succeeded in following two bodies, but the other side continues to fight until today.
The vigilance is required
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praises the professionalism of the judges.
However, he adds: “the process is long, bruising and costs us a lot of time and money.”
It is also difficult to assess the internal costs. service archives has even had to review the acts of the last hundred years to give evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed in vain to the other side a “large sum in euros to six figures” to resolve the dispute.
“This is what you see what this means for us,” assigns Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to spill over into Europe.
That would be the case if copycats of this region is assured the exploitation of brands are not protected.
For example, a chinese producer wants to table in Germany on behalf of Freudenberg for a production company of footwear and leather.
The company had long since abandoned this sector, but it could even prevent the submission.
Wentzler adds: “the vigilance is required.”
Pattloch and advising him to german companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, they say, to rely on international law, trademarks, foreigners should instead “register in China is likely to be protected,” said Wentzler.
Otherwise, the costs can be much more important than those of registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay licence fees to the other side to use his own name, as Wentzler explains.
Or, we lose our place on the segment of the market in question.
World Day against AIDS: the rap, sing, help
The choir Imbongi repeat in Heidelberg, and AIDS orphans in Swaziland welcome their arrival.
This is the story of a link that takes more than a distance of 8,733 kilometres.
First, we had the place: the cowboy boots, the trainers, the escarpins for the ladies and mocassins for men seeking the pace in striking the ground foot. very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the voices of singers is growing slowly-low, alto, tenor and soprano, they win, envoûtent and will follow.
Fiete Hopf, the conductor 29 years almost loses his shoes backdrop when he leads the orchestra with gestures of a savage flexibility.
We are on Monday evening, the choir Imbongi repeat a new song in the chamber music of the Institute of medical psychology Heidelberg.
Fifty chanteuses and singers from 23 to 69 years came, the geneticist in medicine to human rights at home.
“Om'Obani” is not an easy piece, every choriste has different words in a language very exotic: zoulou, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in some regions of Swaziland.
Be helped to help
The UNAIDS, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS, estimates that 34 million people around the world are suffering from the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland account 245,000 people infected.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV positive.
180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association “Voices for Africa”.
70 of them attend an establishment of secondary education.
For 15 or 20 euros for less, you can become godfather.
This guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a hot meals daily centre gogo.
Imbongi means “zoulou conteur stories” or even “singer praises.”
No one can speak the language fluently Bantu in this region, but all can sing.
For nearly 10 years, the choir repeat songs in this foreign language she has led Germany to now go to his home region: the South Africa.
Because to 8,733 miles as the crow flies Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni village, which depends on the strength of the german voice choir.
40% of sufferers
The village has about 2,000 residents, some live in small huts of straw or land, and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, because HIV has won their parents.
To Esitjeni, can be seen on a smaller scale what ails Swaziland: the rate of HIV infection in the highest and life expectancy is the lowest in the world, according to UNICEF.
The population accept virtually never male circumcision, a measure which ensures a proven reduction of the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of the population of Swaziland holds the immunodeficiency virus and it is not unusual to die in the middle of the 30.
During a trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had discovered the village. the Imbongis above all have seen many children in the street on which it lacked not only parental care, but also quite simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, school without qualifications, there is simply no prospect.
At the beginning, it was just some people who are committed to personally pay a few euros each year in order to send a child to school and offer him a hot meals per day.
But barely a year later, the choir based “Voices for Africa”, an association which deals since almost professional of AIDS orphans of Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the IST bacterial, with syphilis, chlamydiées and blennorragie (or gonorrhée).
The current IST are HIV, Human Papilloma Virus, herpès génital or hepatitis.
The nits the pubis and remained belong to the IST parasitic.
What are the groups mainly concerned?
The syphilis and blennorragie appear often among men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute, believes that sexual contact between men are at the origin of at least four cases of syphilis in five declared in Germany.
Adult heterosexual infections linked to chlamydiées, trichomonase, candidose (fungal), the blennorragie and Human Papilloma Virus of sexually transmitted diseases are commonplace.
The rate of spread of HIV between heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany; however, some 20% of new HIV infections occur within this group.
Among young people, there is a rate of infections linked to chlamydiées significantly higher than among other population groups.
According to the records, three quarters of all infections involve young people aged 15 to 25 years.
Moreover, in Germany, Human Papilloma Virus is common among young people.
What is the change in the number of infections?
It is not compulsory to declare all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert Koch-Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: the figure is past 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections is decreasing.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of 10% compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a disease sexual?
Infectious diseases can cause boil at the level of genital pain, urinary, losses of white, low-belly pain as well as the appearance of buttons and verrues.
However, they do regularly no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect themselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by infected lubrifiante or close physical contact.
Experts recommend to any person often changing of sexual partners to spend regular examinations.
Most of the IST quickly HIV can be cured and aftermath late can be avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations, but above all the funds that reaped the choristes thanks to their voice through Germany, the means are mounting.
“In all, we have already sent approximately 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,” says Annette Lennartz, President of the Association.
The village, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman sure of itself and which always gets what it wants, manages the money from Germany.
It also ensures that the orphans are well housed, in one of their grandmothers, for example.
The gogos, and called the old women in zoulou, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them receive up to 14 orphans, they offer them a roof and ensure that they go every day to school in their uniforms.
The orphan who has more person is welcomed in a safe place, among Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, like the two cooks prepare meals every day for more than 200 starving children.
In addition, “Voices for Africa” has created a school of styling and allowed the construction of two barns. with the help of the american health PSI, the Association has organized a screening test HIV for many people.
This is not, of course, because even if the disease is visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
“AIDS is a real taboo,” Annette Lennartz explains, “because it is a subject that affects sexuality.”
It is quite strange, coming from a country where the king has 14 wives official.
The last absolute monarch in black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy in place of democracy.
These mores sanctioned by the State, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
Yet we find condoms on every street corner, Annette Lennartz adds, “but almost nobody uses them.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh.”
In order to encourage a little cultural exchange, choristes of Imbongi go together in trip every two or three years in South Africa and telling songs full of nostalgia, courage, confidence and identity that black number of inhabitants of the dark continent still know the time of apartheid.
The bus full of white singing in african language is a sign of recognition as it brings not only good humour and delight, but sometimes too hard a tear to a formidable border guards.
The bus takes the always Esitjeni, where choristes visit their godchildren.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on the map, Esitjeni is well known in the Valley Ezulweni.
“Come on to Esitjeni, you find the light,” say the people there.
And after a trip to 8,733 miles as the crow flies, return to Heidelberg, before these choristes who gets the foot in the room of repeated Bergheimer Straße, we also find the light.
Messenger: NASA discovered the presence of ice on Mercure
The probe Messenger reported evidence of ice on the planet Mercure.
The ice could reach 20 metres thick.
The US space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercure.
Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it contains water frozen, as explained three studies published Thursday in the journal “Science specialist.”
The probe Messenger reported evidence of the existence of a cover of ice in the region of the world permanently immersed in the shadows.
This coverage have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters of up to 20 metres.
The water is probably comets or asteroids may have stung Mercure.
However, nobody made a link between the discovery of water and the assumption of a presence of life on the planet, explains the chief scientist in the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercure can achieve 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help explain how the water and other essential elements to life arrived in other parts of the solar system.

Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope could capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the great riddles of astronomy is the creation of the rings of Saturn.
One theory is that the rings were the remains of a moon of Saturn who disappeared 4.5 billion years without trace.

According to the bland, photographs of galaxies maelstroms can become real works of art.
A photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the amorphous of Trifide in the constellation of Sagittaire, several thousands of light-years away.
The name comes from the Latin word “Trifide trifidus” (shared), divided into three, because three dragged dust luisant divide the heart of the place of birth of stars.
The astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a carambolage cosmic in the constellation of Serpentaire: 400 million light years from Earth, the nuclei of two galaxies in merger rush one to the other, the collision is inevitable.

Scientists believe that he was born shortly after no Big Bang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
Our eyes on the universe: the main telescope
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo will use a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors optical telescopes have continued to swell and thanks to them, it was possible to see still further in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope at Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror image on this had a diameter of five metres.
In Arizona, the United States is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows us to observe the universe through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on La Palma in the Canary Islands, is immense. the mirror alone reached a diameter of 10.4 metres.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been broken up in order to make savings.
The diameter reached all eleven metres.
The downside of the method of construction is that the telescope is set at the level of the vertical angle, which limit the mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope would Texas is also set in the vertical angle.
Its uniqueness lies in its capacity to collection of light.
Despite a relatively small diameter of mirror, this ability to be closer to those of the largest telescope mirrors in the world.
Scientists listening to the universe in search of extra-terrestrial signals to the aid of radiotélescope of Arecibo (Puerto Rico).
This radiotélescope has a diameter of 305 metres.

On the European Southern Observatory (ESO), in the Andes in Chile.
Here lies the Very Large Telescope (“very large telescope”), a facility worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can enlighten the spectrum infrared mode.
The construction of a huge telescope European (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the site of the ESO in Chile.
Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 metres. it will be composed of nearly 1,000 elements of mirrors.
However, the telescope will take photographs before 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, two of the Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea volcano hawaïen of were considered the largest in the world.
They waved two mirrors with a diameter of 10 metres each.
The Keck telescopes to form part of the observatory's Mauna Kea who observed the sky with the Subaru telescope and IRTF.
A new giant telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror reach 30 metres.
This illustration of the admiring.
However, the images of the area the most important we come from the Hubble space telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, we book images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler seeks exoplanètes, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo shows the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The space telescope-James Webb's journey (JWST) will be sent into space early 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
The telescope will be especially for mission to find the light cast by the first stars and galaxies after no Big Bang.
Scientists believe that the south pole of Mercure is home also to the ice.
However, any reliable data on this theory is because Messenger orbit much closer to the North Pole to Mercure.
The data for decades radar indicated the presence of ice on Mercure.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbiter around Mercure, scientists now have the certainty.
Drink daily of butter, and live up to 168 years
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.

In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country, which is still relatively young to 97 years.
The trip in the Talysh Mountains is a romantic échevelé.
In the course of many turning points on the road, the small bus cahote along wooded hills, rivers and modest torrentiels firm.
Everything is green and fertile, you could almost imagine – in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few miles away.
It is here that the caucasian ethnic group in the name of Talysh, about which we know little, if they speak perfectly persian and Azeri and that they have a very great longevity.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town plastronne with its architecture is too aggressive in the soviet era, which is not in keeping with the landscape of picturesque mountain.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 miles, because the road is only one way.
The province has still not taken advantage of the legendary wealth that the country needs for its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist spot.
“Baku became famous in May with the help of Eurovision, and next year there will be here the festival of older people in the world,” explains Fatulayeva.
She is director of the museum in longevity, the only museum in the world.
You can discover life of about eight dozen Talysh region which have over 100 years. Fatulayeva shows us a photo in black and white.
My grandfather, he reached the age of 120 years.
Having even one child to 136 years
But the star of the controversial museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who had 168 years.
There is, however, no birth certificates.
And when you consider that the oldest person had documented 122 years, the age of Müslümov seems more questionable.
“He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973,” says Fatulayeva.
The man will be married three times and there have been 23 children at the age of 136 years, he even designed a girl.
Şirali Müslümov would he misled few decades in calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, gérontologue at the Max-Planck Institute of Rostock has also heard of the great age of Central Asia.
“Surprisingly older people also live in some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” explains Scholz, “in Sardinia, too, there are men who live incredibly old.”
However, it is impossible to establish a scientific proof of the existence of the documents, and that there was no registry of marital status.
Every day, a glass of butter, melted
It is, however, that the people of the region of Lerik often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people have more than 100 years.
So what is the reason for the longevity in the south of the country?
Farid Mugimzadeh tourist guides, the Azeri, explains that the Talysh have special genes.
By contrast, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, believe that it is a question of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the rich meals calories of Talysh, who love meat, bread and milk products and how much daily drink a glass of melted butter, are good for the health.
Or is this the lifestyle of simple preserves the young people to Cengemiran?, a tiny village near the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With its 97 years, it is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest home of wood, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
It is sitting on the ground beside a baratte, it beats the content tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including a son of Mirzayeva and a daughter, who has long since been adults.
Two small children where also in the house.
In the kitchen, preparing tea for the guests served in glasses armadus in typical form of belly.
The teeth of white Mirzayeva are perfectly aligned, and under his scarf hiding long tresses of a blond ploughs his son reveals with pride.
I have always washed my hair with milk, and so it is that I have never lost, and they have retained their color.
“I have never used shampoo,” adds Mirzayeva.
The monthly pension is enough to live
She always ate what comes from its own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
All my life, I have never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then, she speaks of her husband, who was in the army.
The worst moments were after the Second World War.
But everything has improved when the “beloved father” Heydar Aliyev took the lead.
The language of the propaganda surprises in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the father of the nation, a man who has led his country as a dictator, is almost no limits in Azerbaijan
He has been in power until 2003, his son Ilham installed him afterwards.
Nevertheless, the elderly of Azerbaijan does not know the distress.
Mirzayeva receives each month 230 manats (about the same amount in euros) for his retirement, a sum which guarantees a good pace of life in the region.
And perhaps the son long greying of Mirzayeva is right: “the elders enjoy great respect in our culture.”
They are the centre of the great family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
That is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The “human rights” omitted in the constitution
The revolution has surfaced in Cairo.
Rival protests reveal the deep divide in the country.
The draft constitution based on Sharia law is hotly debated.
The egyptian president is not sparing words more emotions.
We need to manage the transition.
“And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God,” he said on state television.
His speech was designed for the entire nation, but especially to Coptic Christians, liberals, Christians and secular Muslims enlightened.
Because all members of the opposition have fractured desperately confused and afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost in apologizing, having temporarily restricted the powers of the constitutional court and broadened its “to save the revolution.”
However, the Egyptians and the world did not really know what to save the engineer of 61 years, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California.
The judiciary will it be overturned?
The 234 articles written in haste by the Constituent Assembly majority islamic 100 people in a tour de force of night fifteen hours are worrying in a way.
As in previous constitutions, the plan provides that the law is based on “the principles of islamic law”.
But that really means the word “principles”?
It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists would use the vague wording and the leeway related legal to enforce a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
In any case, it is that suggests a newly introduced stating that, regarding all matters relating to Sharia law, al-Azhar University must be consulted and establishing the islamic institution is the country's largest and its dazzling appearance on the whole islamic world Sunni.
This, however, does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative machinery, which would lead to the de facto tutelage of judicial power.
Many points in the draft constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the likely continuation of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Mubarak, these courts are employèrent to repress opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The state must also, can be read in the draft, protect “the true nature of the egyptian family” and “promote its morals and values.”
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that the institutions of the state could control the content of the art cinema and literature.
Clearly, it would be simply to censure.
Moreover, no article explicitly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibits offend or denigrating the Prophet Mohammed or his envoys.
By contrast, the article does not define what is offensive or how it should be punished.
Also questionable is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to “offend people.”
Is it enough to paint a caricature of President or tell a joke at the expense of a man of law?
Many items are subject to interpretation in the project that Morsi submits to the vote and who, in his own words, “very soon” will be the subject of a referendum among Egyptians.
“The revolution renait”
The opposition is mobilising for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in an unusual harmony on Tahrir Square in Cairo, vowing to unseat the Sharia before it enters into force.
“The revolution is resurgent and we will win,” launches Hamdin (came third in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei said that the draft constitution is “to throw in the dustbin of history”.
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused the supporters of Morsi to foment a “coup against democracy.”
“If he says the referendum, we will go to his palace and the reverse,” Jasser exclame Said, an opponent.
“We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet expié”, said that the media Egyptians Khaled Ali, a politician and member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges have announced will not want to monitor the referendum, which would lead to its revocation.
“The Koran is our constitution”
For its part, the Muslim Brotherhood, well organised, called for a counter-demonstration not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a large prayer was organised before the University of Cairo.
Headscarved women and the supporters of the Salafis, who participated in large numbers, chanted: “the people demand the application of the law of God.”
“Clean our country!”, calling on Morsi, saying that “the Koran [was] their constitution.”
A fight for sovereignty on the symbolic Tharir Square, where it all began, have quickly created a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, this is what the supporters of Morsi wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that opponents of the draft Constitution, as his supporters have spoken loud and clear.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide at the ballot box in the direction for the country.
The project of Islamists win certainly the majority.
“Human rights are not mentioned only once”
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this constitutional process imposed which was due to run until February and include all the social forces.
This human-rights lawyer for 48 years and chairman of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in the courts under Mubarak.
He did not because he shares their view of the world, but because for him, human rights are indivisible.
This is why it has been beaten up, convicted and imprisoned.
“And now, the end is not even mentioned once in the new constitution,” regret it during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of the powers of the three powers Morsi has discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy and they will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, the president would de facto loses all its powers,” laments Saeda.
However, no democracy can function without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between the different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
It could afford.
A demonstrator on Tharir warns: “you accouchez a monster that it will not be possible to control.”
The rakfisk Norway: is it the fish most odorant world?
The five million people in Norway enjoy some of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
The secret of the success of the country could be linked to the appetite of the premises for a fish extremely odorant?
Take cheese.
Put them in the middle of a pile of clothes soccer wet and dirty.
Wait a week.
And you get the smell of disturbing rakfisk, one of the most popular dishes of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, approximately 3 hours of Oslo.
Snow, the landscape is spectacular – and this smell, ubiquitous, permeates the air.
The rakfisk consists of trout spread too thinly and salt fermented in the water for a period-according to the smell that you want it exhale – which can be up to a year.
When darkness settles and it is cold, the Norwegians congregate in droves to attend a festival which is taking place here in Fagernes, devoted to this incredible culinary speciality.
“You eat, then you thought avalez a glass of aquavit,” explains Havard Halvarsen, local firefighter full time that called “Rakfisk General”, responsible for the management of the festival.
Around us, the people of swallowing small pieces of fish and enfilent a large quantity of drink.
“Some people prefer aquavit on rakfisk”, adds Havard.
The drink kills the smell.
I try a few pieces.
If you can avoid the pass under your nose, this is not bad – it is reminiscent of a sushi who have spent long hours in a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in barriques water jar in the air, then salé in autumn.
Then, during the winter, a time of fermented fish is out-and no doubt with the sense of diminished by alcohol-eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians have been forced to leave their country to find work emigrating, mainly to the United States.
Now, the population is growing rapidly-more than 13% of immigrants, attracted by the full employment, high salaries and a comprehensive health system.
The swedes, their old rivals, whose country was not so long ago that most rich Norway, crossing the border to get work.
The rakfisk is regarded as something important, a vital element, although odorant, past Norway.
This is the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive-a pint of beer or a sandwich you will cost €10 each.
Norway does not often speak of it in the international news, which is not to upset him.
Here, people are not prepared to talk of Anders Breivik, the racist right-wing extremist who killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this killing, they talk about “the incident of July 22 .”
The Norwegians were hard to accept that their country in peaceful, one of their own could commit such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
“Oil is not the single reason for our success,” explains Anna, our barmaids, blonde hair and the eyes of a blue transperçant, the image of the Nordic welfare, with a plate of rakfisk in hand.
We are – how do you say – people cautious.
His English, like that of most of the people who live here, is perfect.
We are silent, we do not like us out.
Norway has managed its oil wealth carefully-all, with the exception of a small percentage of money from the industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries laid money around, over the years that have led to the international financial crisis, Norway has managed to keep its purse tightly.
“As long as we can skiing in winter and make the trek in summer, we are happy,” says Anna.
“Without forgetting the rakfisk”, add in a carefree laugh.
I am standing in the snow and I am queuing to buy any food-I had my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger composed of momentum, a real discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel where I am staying is one of many places where it serves the rakfisk for dinner and where we can vote for the best of them – or perhaps the odorant more of them.
There is a tv where the interviewer, wearing a bow-tie, surrounded by tables of rakfisk.
You would think the Eurovision contest.
“What attracts you gave the best fish, in the mountains Thor-Juergen?”
“This is our points, Havard.”
We hear the laughter and applause.
A man falls to his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or perhaps it is because of the fumes of fish.
The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a difficult start.
While the incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take office in Mexico, Will Grant, of the BBC, is interested in the challenges that lie ahead and the expectations of the people, who are numerous.
Traffic to Mexico is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where the traffic jams are legion in normal times, a barrage of security has been in place since Monday, blocking several key access roads in the capital and causing a real chaos on the roads.
Nevertheless, the goal was not to prevent people from going to their work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching the House.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential sash to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task ahead.
Mexico's economy is doing well, the results must be the outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already claimed the lives of around 60,000 people in six years.
“My government has made the commitment to the mexican people to reduce the violence,” said Mr. Pena Nieto to President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before alongside the US President, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the state of Mexico.
A state very populous and sprawling gripping the capital. on his land favourite, opinions are divided on this new leader.
A man direct
In the joint bucolic del Valle de Bravo, for example, it is etched in the memory of all.
The local to attribute the development of tourism and infrastructure in the joint.
To join the city, you can take a new highways of Mr Pena Nieto, a significant improvement was made on these roads, once bosselées and full of crevasses.
The plates bearing his name are hanging outside of a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
“We are counting on him to implement lasting changes,” said his friend and political ally Olvera Gabriel Hernandez, a member of Congress and the party of Mr Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy, we expect real change that our country desperately needs.
After 81 years unwavering in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The member of Congress Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are a lot of expectations within the party on Enrique Pena Nieto.
It rejects the criticism from opponents who blame the new president of lacking charisma.
This is a man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
This is an excellent statesman and, above all, he knows to listen.
However, this is not always the image that people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known by the name of Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more conspicuous.
Hidden beneath the autoponts motorways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the City are also practical and urban.
Earlier in the year, the military has been called in to fight the drug gangs operating in the districts, and violence against women are particularly serious.
In a disaster zone was found, on the edge of discharge, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico, while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a rate far higher than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez-a place notorious for the number of innocent women who have been killed.
Critics of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, it has failed to stem the problem of murders perpetrated against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to see the reality.
In a house in concrete, typical of this ramshackle neighborhood, Irinea Buendia fight to retain his tears when she shows me pictures of his dead daughter, Mariana Luna for.
The official version of a committed suicide by Mariana in 2010.
However, his family believe she was killed by her partner.
“When I arrived home, it seemed to me that his body had been washed,” recounts the Señora Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and rigidity cadavérique was already taken.
When his mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana dresses the wall, alongside a cross that features the word: justice.
However, that is exactly what the family was denied.
The authorities have treated me as if I was an old commère, a fautrice of disorder, a pleurnicheuse.
They want that we accept what they say and we remain silent.
“But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions,” she said.
When President Pena Nieto will receive his scarf on Saturday, it will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by the crime in Mexico during the last six years, and the new president has promised that he would do his priority during his tenure.
“I hope it will be as good as chairman when he was governor,” said Olvera, Valle del Bravo, a member of Congress.
However, that is exactly what the families of victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning has not complained of mistreatment, say prosecutors.
Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of abuse, including Bradley Manning have been in custody.
The trial is on the detention of Manning in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants to classify the case on the grounds that the kidnapping of Manning is in extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors have tried to show, Friday, that the file against Private Bradley Manning — accused of being behind the biggest leak of confidential information in the history of the american military — has missed many opportunities to complain of abuse he claims to have suffered during his military detention.
During a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, the Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein said that recordings made weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, have revealed any complaint about his treatment.
The counter-interrogation — during a hearing, the defense has presented a petition demanding that the case be dismissed on the grounds that Manning sequestration is in very difficult conditions and was a harsh enough punishment — took place a day after that Manning has demonstrated its desire to kill himself during his detention.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source.
During the hearing Friday, Fein has examined Manning forms that officers had met after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in a military prison in Quantico, where he was subjected to a maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers have asked questions to Manning and have recorded his answers.
When Fein has mentioned the forms, Friday, Manning has acknowledged that the treatment they have reserved its guard was “excellent” and that the treatment he had in the prison was generally “very professional.”
The forms are no complaint for bad treatment, although the officers have directly asked about his treatment prison, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had verbally expressed concerns about some of the problems and that the officers visiting had discussed his concerns and said they will occupy, but they have not recorded the issues raised.
“They have written “no problem” (having addressed the concerns), and so did not mean that I had not raised problems,” said Manning.
The military judge Col. Denise Lind, also asked why Manning was not complained about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special committee which met to discuss the suicidal thoughts that he had expressed by writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to change its status restrictive indicating a “risk of injury.”
The military said they had assigned this restrictive status — a level below the close surveillance for risk of suicide — for his protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted the staff know that I was going well, and I wanted that to be cut this statute … in order to enjoy a better quality of life, from my point of view,” said Manning.
Manning testified Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and its transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison on the basis of the body of the Marine base at Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he had considered suicide when he was in Kuwait and be gone once because of the heat.
He added that the fact of not having been kept abreast of what would happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very frightening.
“My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, in the cage,” said Manning, on Thursday.
I thought I would die in the cage.
Once at Quantico, Manning said he had spent most of his time in a small cell — at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours — without company.
Manning has also added that the only objects he had had a mattress, a blanket, tongs, clothes and his glasses.
He has tried to stay in motion, because sleep or stay extended during the day was against the rules.
Manning also said that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in the eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards did not notice his face when he gets back on the night, they wake up to see his face.
The lawyer of Manning has made a formal complaint to the treatment of Manning in January 2011.
Manning has been placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked questions to Manning on an allegation reported in his testimony Thursday — after having been forced to sleep naked all night in his cell at Quantico, has been forced to stand naked before the guards and other inmates one morning during the appeal.
Manning has testified that at no time, he has been allowed to cover themselves with coverage during the appeal.
During questions to the judge, Friday, Manning said he attributed to his guards that he had to relinquish its coverage that could hide his nudity, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to leave.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked last night, because he tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said to the officer that he could use the elastic of his underpants or its tongs to be injured, but that it had not done so.
That night, Manning has testified that his underwear, his tongs, and his glasses were taken out of his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experience he has experienced during his detention and that it will significantly reduce her sentence if he were convicted in a court martial, a trial that is expected to take place early next year.
The defense has said that Manning intends to plead guilty of crimes less serious and fight for the abandonment of other charges were considered too extreme.
The hearing will resume this weekend, with prosecutors who should argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning has been incarcerated under regulation which governs the detention conditions of all detainees at Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the theft of goods or public documents, collusion with the enemy, resulting in the publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information relating to the national defense.
If all the charges are included, it faces a criminal sentence of life imprisonment.
My american identity crisis-mexico
He said that many have been forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those parties; they remind the Mexicans difficult periods, he said.
Navarrette says that the Mexican-Americans find themselves caught between two worlds.
During a recent trip to Mexico, arriving in the hall, to the customs and immigration, I felt lost.
Signs indicated two paths: one for “Mexicanos” (“Mexicans”), another for “Extranjeros” (“foreign”).
I stayed immobile for several seconds, not knowing what to whip me direct.
I grew up in central California, where I have been called the “Mexican” all my life.
It is a derogatory ethnic, in the same way that my friends in Boston, use when they say “irish”, or my friends in New York when they say “italian”.
Then I became “Mexican-american.”
But, here, it was Mexico.
And, on the land which saw my grandfather, no need to “special or bridge.
I was simply an American.
I speak spanish well enough to manage an interview in one or another language.
But I do not have the vocabulary of an indigenous, and I cannot lose my american accent.
Then I took my american passport and I am heading to the leading “Étrangers.”
I thought at the time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the President Obama, to the White House.
Usually, when the leaders of the two countries meet, their favourite subjects are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans to stay in Mexico rather than risk to the United States.
It wants to join the United States and Canada, and create a Union for trade on the model of the EU, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and embittered.
Most Americans have probably never thought that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to surrender by writing half their territory to the tip of the gun.
But for the Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, not minutes, the memories are everywhere.
Therefore, whenever an official U.S. formula the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear — in the mexican press, and among the elites — complaints about the way the Americans are undermining the sovereignty of their neighbour.
And the children of Montezuma seeking the brawl.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship more difficult is that the country has with the more than 35 million in Mexico-Americans living in the United States.
You want that addresses the issue of bitterness?
There are many.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for which the country cannot offer.
The only reason the large number of ancestors in mexican cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio, at a given moment, in our family tree, someone, perhaps a parent or a grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and has had to go in the North.
And the more often, this person was a profile type — a dark-skinned, poorly educated, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are living the american dream, that we went to good schools and we have good situations, we should never forget that it is the american dream that we live, and not one of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.
We attach to the United States.
Furthermore, we know that part of the elite mexican among the ruling class, we do not like.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them a humiliating defeat and they are facing each other down as if we were individuals of lower strain and not sufficiently disciplined.
Our spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never parties.
And we do not end up stuck on the right side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but as souls lost.
My wife who was born in Guadalajara and legally emigrated to the United States when she was a child, remember that there is friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, because the Mexicans demanding more firmly their identity and the Mexican-Americans are angry.
Although she is a US citizen, it has the feeling of being part of two countries.
Furthermore, many Mexican-Americans I know did not appear to be part of a country or another.
We worship music group the Mexican Los Tigers del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in any of the two.
In Mexico, we see as Americans.
And in the United States, we regard as Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship, as I discovered during my stay, some mexican leaders and part of the intelligentsia want to be closer to the diaspora.
They want the Mexico-Americans working as ambassadors of fortune for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We have to explain to our fellow Americans that Mexico is a beautiful country that we absolutely must visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That will not happen.
There is too much bitterness.
And, if we consider the inequalities in pay, corruption and violence linked to drugs that are pervasive, many of us are not persuaded that it is a fantastic country.
You are going to have to fend for themselves, amigos.
This is normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they have dealt with Mexico a century and a half, they must therefore accept that some Americans in Mexico-they want always the way members of their family have been treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are more “mexican” than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a setback for peace.
Will it ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such hope is vain.
While still the same arguments futile to know which began, dozens of buildings have been reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in flux.
The Arab Spring has everything shatters, and like it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught up by the regional upheaval.
Perhaps that their fight is even more.
However, there is every reason to think that this could help to break the deadlock.
A war which is no winner and no loser
At first sight, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continues, the fighting this week have reinforced the supporters of the force, on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007, targueront have forced the Israelis to abandon, even if Gaza has suffered a kicking.
Having killed some of its leaders and removed the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most impoverished and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel has not managed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals Fatah, the more moderate palestinian faction.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas might say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the arab world is increasingly strong, and Hamas has friends of the rich and powerful.
Turkey, a regional power booming, once the closest muslim ally of Israel, has sided with Hamas; like Qatar, one of the richest states and most dynamic golf.
Hamas members glee and say that the growing Islamist to curve around Israel from Lebanon, in the north, where the Hezbollah militia exerts its domination, via Syria, where the rebels to islamist trend can topple Bashar Assad, and Jordan, where the allies Hamas threaten the king.
And most important, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and most central arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the dictator who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
By contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are banking on more accessible to the public.
In the future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as a player of importance which cannot be ruled out even by America and Israel.
During this time, the hardliners of Israel draw opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been challenged in the box.
The missile interception system called Iron Dome has proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on their two ears – for some time.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many european countries have criticized the Hamas to be the source of the latest wave of violence.
But above all, Israel has thrived, particularly under Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who has totally ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets from Gaza have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared by the suicide attacks, including the separation barrier which encroaches on the West Bank, the main chunk of what could be a palestinian state, and which protects the jewish settlements continue to expand despite their illegal in international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose party likud party has merged with a more hawkish Avigdor Lieberman, the leader of the approach of the election on 22 January, the hook.
Why coddle these indicative Palestinians in giving them a state?
If they ruled the West Bank, do they not launch rockets, as their countrymen have done to Gaza?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and the strike as soon as they leave the head.
Perhaps that hardliners prevail; but it may be that the Arab Spring is changing.
Even if islamists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere like little Israel, their priority is to tackle problems in their own countries.
The defence budget of Israel is more important than its four arab neighbours together.
Start a war with the superpower local does not help the new Arab governments to fix their economies.
Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire which bodes well — and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also look to the future.
With the rest of the Arab world, which is becoming more democratic, deprive the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is doomed to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel-a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The crackdown has already weakened democracy in the jewish state, demographics and exacerbates this problem as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to stop Hamas have a price on the diplomatic level.
The two sides need to be driven by those on the outside.
The answer remains the one advocated by reasonable people that each side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of land by Israel in exchange for security.
A little hope, and in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give the opportunity to those outside of defending this cause.
Egypt, which must now work to stop the flow of arms to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a jewish state in the 1967 borders with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
The arab countries should also be external pressure on Hamas and Fatah to join.
This would contribute more to the creation of a palestinian state as the next proposal of a pseudo-state at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an interest in what Israel agrees to negotiate.
During his first term, he has not presented its own peace plan.
Back at the White House, it seems equally unwilling to establish one.
This is a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is vital for America.
This involves a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The laws for packets of cigarettes neutral came into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of bodies sick cover the dark green packages that are all identical, whatever the brand
The law came into force in Australia is a world first, logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrific pictures of diseased organs and representations of children and babies whose illnesses were caused by smoking parents.
Outside of different photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small print on all packages.
It is the regime the strictest in the world on packaging of tobacco.
The australian federal government has declared that the aim was to deter young people from smoking by removing any representation glamour.
Studies have shown that if people do not have started smoking before the age of 26 years, there are 99% chance that they will start ever.
“Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image,” said the Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies which have shown by example that children associating the crown logo to a princess.”
Although Australia has the lowest rate of smoking in the world and if these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has lobbied against this law.
Tobacco manufacturers have said that to boost trade on the black market, which give easier access to cheaper cigarettes.
“Adverse consequences flow from this legislation,” said Scott McIntyre, British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will sell many more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others have said that this law had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the request, to cigarettes, including silicone to mask the horrible packaging, has greatly increased two months since that british American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco and Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have challenged the law and lost at the High Court of Australia.
Ha said Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting renewal of stock.
For us, business is good.
The only problem, say the experts, is the popularity of social media and the tranche of people targeted by the plan.
After a series of australian law prohibiting advertisements on tv, sponsorship of sport and the requirement for dealers to hide cigarettes, the marketing of tobacco is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Web by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign Web sites to do.
“If you work in the marketing of tobacco and that you have more than a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the key par excellence,” said Becky Freeman, a researcher in public health at the University of Sydney.
Freeman has noticed an increase in contributions of some ordinary citizens in favour of brands on social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We must ask whether it is just a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who has bothered to make a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia has said that the industry focuses on the new regulation in force rather than on marketing.
The industry has gone to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to contest these new legal decisions, these countries have declared the who that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries has significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision should be taken in the year 2013.
Plibersek said that the Government had held discussions with other countries with similar laws on packaging.
Canada was the first country to make mandatory the photos of warning on the packaging in 2001.
Now, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The tougher laws are currently studying in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The photos do not bother me.
I know.
“You take a cigarette and you delegation the package,” said Victor El Hage when buying a package which included a photo of cancers of the mouth.
To be frank, the only reason I will stop, it is my girl.
James Yu, manager of the “King of the Pack tobacconist” in the centre of Sydney, said that the uniformity of packaging made it hard for the overhead bin packages on the shelves.
“First, I needed an hour to unload a parcel, now it takes me four hours,” said Yu.
“The government had to ban them, once and for all, and we said ok, that is good, it stops and you put the key in the door,” he said, lifting his arms.
In a world constantly connected, it may be worth bothering.
I spent five hours in an airport during the period from thanksgiving because our plane had mechanical problems and we have to wait for the arrival of another plane.
Therefore, I have had time to reflect on the subject of boredom.
I am not going to lie.
Spend half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not forgetting the shops of duty-free).
But increasingly, some academics and experts in child development praise of boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us and our children-with Europa from time to time, they say.
This will force the brain to borrow the interesting, or even to feed creativity.
And as we are, for the most part, constantly to several types of screens, we do know the benefits of boredom.
Then we should welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And not.
But I will return.
First of all, like many people, I thought that boredom is a fairly recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, Professor of Greco-roman history at the University of Calgary, in Canada, and the author of “Boredom: a Lively History” (Yale University Press, 2011).
“The problem goes back very far,” he said.
On the walls of Pompeii include graffiti latin evoke the boredom, they date back to the first century.
Then there is the definition of boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood aggregate, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
Having travelled many publications and submitted the idea to a group discussion of approximately 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have defined boredom as an experience that is “trying to do something, but without engaging in an activity satisfactory.”
What differentiates the boredom of apathy, he says, is that the person is not in the process of undertaking a task well as it would like.
With apathy, he says, there is not the appetite to do something.
What is at the heart of the problem, he said, is “the interruption of the process of attention, associated with a low mood and feel that time passes slowly.”
The trouble can strongly resemble a depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if the two may be linked, people who are bored tend to think that the problem is the environment or the world, while the depressed people believe that the problem has them.
Sometimes we think we bored when it is in fact a matter of concentration.
In their study, “the Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of care”, which was published in the journal Psychological Perspectives is “science” in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have highlighted an experience in which the oldest participants listening on cassette, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups have heard, from the room at his side, too high a broadcast tv who had no report, others have just heard the emission of tv, and the third group has not heard the band-its.
Those who have heard the tv to a low noise level said they were more annoyed than the other two groups, they have had difficulty concentrating, but did not know why, and attributed the problem of concentration to boredom.
When you try to concentrate on a difficult task or stakeholder, an interruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark I. Fenske aggregate, a professor of neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
However, when you are doing a boring task, “like watching objects on an assembly line, music can help you not to bore you.”
In fact, he says, we now know that when tortille or griffonne, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are in fact a good way to stay physically more alert.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to learn more watching and retain more information than those who are forced to remain without moving,” said Professor Fenske.
We are all bored one day-late for my flight plane, a user with a voice lacking in sparkle, a film, particularly annoying.
But some people are more prone to boredom than others.
To measure this, researchers have developed a “scale of predisposition to boredom” in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, “among the tasks that I carried out, many of them are repetitive and monotonous,” and “I have so many interests that I do not have time to do everything.”
Using a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to be boring more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need of stimuli many and varied.
But in general, teenagers are quickly blase.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor in individual development and Community at the University of Illinois, has conducted an experiment in which he has contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times per day via a beeper.
It found that 32 percent of teenagers claimed Europa at school and during their duties at home, while 23 percent said Europa when they were not at school.
In contrast, 3 percent of parents have said is boring.
Professor Larson said he did not know if the percentages of boredom of today, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that “adolescence is a time when boredom reached its highest level”, especially because children and teenagers do not have much control on what they want to do.
If I ask my question: boredom is it good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, this can cause people to take physical risks absurd, make bets or abuse of certain substances to pass the time, as studies show.
In contrast, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem for more than two decades.
“The trouble is the way that the brain has found to let you know that you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the N.Y. U.
But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you ennuyez and use that energy to play the guitare and cook, that make you happy.
But if you look at the tv, that make you happy in the short term, but in the long term.
So if your child is bored and you give it an iPad, it is ennuiera more, but it will not have learned to deal with it alone and autorégler, says Professor Fenske.
And “this autorèglement passes from one situation to another,” he says.
Your child learns not only to entertain, it gets more control of himself in other areas.
I do not think we should glorify boredom.
Just as I do not believe we should criticise.
Feel comfortable outside the “constant that generate the activities and the technology is the goal towards which we should strive.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
“We need we bore more often, but boredom arouses acute manic and a desire to be connected to something that makes sense,” he said.
According to him, what the people want, this is a way to disconnect and appreciate the time of arrest.
“In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulés,” he added, “it is difficult to find ways of engaging in something when the noise stops.”
In Colorado, no directive for the new law on marijuana
Anthony Orozco, 19 years, in a university student and football player in Colorado, is indicted for something which will soon become legal in his state: regard the possession of marijuana and a pipe used for smoking.
Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and some friends were aboard a car at Lamar, in the middle of the field, close to the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After that the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco has received a citation to appear for possession of drugs and material used in its consumption-minor crimes, each with a fine of $100 and a date of appearance.
“We are treated like criminals,” said Mr. Orozco.
But is it?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed the vote of Colorado for legalizing the use of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving a low drug use depends more on that instead of the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana were classified.
The police have continued to prosecute adults 21 years or more for minor possession of marijuana, because the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But the prosecutors who are more conservative in the constituencies of Colorado have called to accelerate the business of existing marijuana and continue to prosecute people who possess.
At the same time, several towns in the suburbs of Denver up to the mountains of the West now vote to prevent the opening of shops selling marijuana, approved by the state in their neighborhoods.
“Things are changing so rapidly that I do not know what the future holds,” said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of police in Aurora, Denver.
Regulators in Washington State there are also plenty of questions.
They are in search of directives on how to install a system of permits, allowing them to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell-before the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, like it or not, is ahead of most states in terms of regulation on marijuana, firstly on the use of therapeutic and now with regard to personal use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator,” said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, acknowledges Mr Smith, cannot do more than suggest what works.
“There is no real precedent on which we can build,” he said.
The law in Washington, which is called I-502, takes effect on 6 December, which leaves a gap of a year, during which the system permits will always exist, whereas the possession of marijuana is legal.
Meanwhile, practical questions remain unresolved: how to balance the mandate of the state which ensures adequate access to marijuana licensed and bans the installation of shops selling cannabis in a radius of 30 km around a school, a park, a playground or a crèche.
“There will be no more difficult places that urban areas to install a trade approved sale of cannabis, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman of the centre of legalisation of cannabis, a research group recently formed.
On 21 November, the police chief, Oates, Aurora, has sent an e-mail to its officers, announcing that the “City” US Attorney (representing the public prosecutor) will pursue more people 21 years and who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should stop to charge people for this type of crime “with immediate effect.”
The Chief Oates said that the police will apply the new court decisions that regulate the activity of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the “district” US Attorney (prosecutor), Ken Buck, embodies a vision more strict.
After the vote, he said that his office would continue to deal with cases of possession of marijuana, mainly in order to put pressure on the users that they should kick.
Currently, 119 people are accused of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are the subject of other charges.
“Our office has the obligation to bring proceedings against those who have committed a crime, at the time of the offence, was recognised an infringement,” said Mr Buck.
The reactions have been complicated, even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters have rejected the initiative for the limited use of marijuana.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, is no longer appear adults for possession of small amounts.
The representative of the public prosecutor in the county, Pete Hautzinger, has supported the decision, but has also decided not to classify without following all the affairs of possession of marijuana.
“I have the impression of not waste my time to continue to enforce the law until it changes,” he said.
Although 55 percent of voters in Colorado have supported the measure, provide a legal framework and governmental appropriate personal consumption of marijuana is not easy.
And contradictory reactions that have been observed in various american cities, highlighted the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
“It is a cultural barrier” with representatives of the public prosecutor, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of consumption of marijuana and speaking as spokesman of the local “National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana laws (national organisation for the reform of the laws on marijuana).
“They have spent a good part of their lives to prosecute those who used marijuana, also, are they hard to accept that this is legal,” he said.
As the first states to deal with the limited consumption of marijuana at the same level as that of alcohol, Colorado and Washington state are becoming a case of jurisprudence for the legalisation of drugs.
While advocates and representatives of the state for a new frontier of legalised sales, they are waiting with concern the directives of the federal government, which still sees the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of legalizing marijuana, hope that the Ministry of Justice succumb.
Despite some high-profile arrests of patients under marijuana therapeutic and sellers, the federal government has allowed the shops selling marijuana for therapeutic purposes to exercise in Colorado, Washington and in 16 other states.
If it is true that the police will probably not take down the doors to take small bags of drugs, it is highly likely that it opposes licensed shops selling marijuana for personal use is permitted by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration.
Many cities of Colorado did not wait for federal authorities to act.
Even before the vote, some local authorities have approved moratoriums on the creation of new shops selling marijuana, even if it is only a delay of a year.
Last week, the town of Montrose has obtained a moratorium of 6 months, and should enforce the ban next week.
“We do not want to find ourselves in a situation where a licence is granted to someone and then we end up with a federal problem,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the council.
Our community has voted against the amendment.
We are interested in voting for the community rather than the vote of the state.
A lot of questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I have been bullied and excluded Oxford, because I was a “Tory” (conservative).
It is not just the students of today who are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I can remember, I have always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and my older brother have studied in what was, for me, a prominent place, a sort of Greek University lecture theatre of modern times which stimulates the two pillars of civilisation, free thought and tolerance.
However, two weeks after being installed at Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to make my suitcases, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started to cry.
My friends were puzzled.
The newspaper the Evening Standard has claimed that I had left the university, because I had objected to the fact that students from the first round had sexual relations in the bedroom next to mine.
The author A.N. Wilson said with quirk that I was part after being forced to drink in the cups ébréchées.
The truth was less funny.
I have fled.
Yes, I have fled, because I had been a victim of intimidation and the subject of constant bullying.
Not because of my name rather extreme, or due to the fact that I had a private school.
I have been persecuted for a single reason, and in this cradle of supposedly know, I have been a victim of racist behaviour and barbaric: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was an influential aide to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why mention this today, I hear you say.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of students of centre-right suffers the same type of persecution.
The growing hatred and institutionalised Tory students at Oxford is such that last week, some of them have demanded a protection of their rights as those of gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Chamber of students (JCR) of Corpus Christi College said they were “often isolated, attacked personally and felt unwanted” because of their political views.
They want a representative on the committee of the university for equal opportunities so that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Their situation has not been helped by the recent documentary on BBC Two called “Wonderland: Young, Bright and the Right” (“the Wonderland: young, Intelligents and Right”), dedicated to the policy among students, and painted a graphic picture “tories” as eccentrics and neo-nazi.
We found it was particularly student Joe Cooke, a former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA),” which moves in Rolls-Royce, displaying a complete silver and moves with a cane to head chromée.
In other universities, students say conservatives be treated as scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees.”
Luke Black, 20 years ago, vice-chairman of the “Nottingham University Conservative Association,” said in a newspaper on Sunday that “there is a bias left growing in universities.
People think we are as the Bullingdon Club without even having encountered.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student in history at Corpus Christi, who has proposed a motion for more protection, said that such a climate is “uncomfortable”, and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years, president of OUCA, said that there has been a deterioration of the attitude of the JCR towards people who are centre-right.
“This is an obstacle to the freedom of debates, intellectuals and the welfare of members,” she said.
I was the only one to think so during my first weeks at Oxford.
I came in September 1986, I was then aged 18 years and a paralysing shyness.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was very fierce.
Last year, the university had voted the refusal to grant Margaret Thatcher-a former student-an honorary title, because of the reduction of the funding of higher education.
The atmosphere was charged with vibrations stalinist.
From the first days of the week, when the new students have seen with other teachers, and I had a foretaste of what will happen in the future.
I discovered that the teachers not only attended the sarcasm toward students Tory, but they are taking pleasure.
It was as if the policy on minors strikers, privatisation and the Government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid South Africa was etched in wood from classrooms.
The first ludicrous I encountered was a translation into English of french texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared.
“Miss Wyatt,” said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), “please translate the first paragraph”
I have lost.
Pitt, a small man to face pustuleux, won easily.
“The Thatchéristes refuse to learn french, or are they just stupid?” he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears me burning eyes.
“I suggest you take french classes for your free time, finally, if you are not too busy you make friends”, he launched a truculent tone.
I am back in my room, inconsolable.
At the dinner that evening, I am sitting alone and then I felt a slight tap on my shoulder.
It was a student in second year of studies English, appointed James, who is presented as a member of the OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he said, gently.
I am afraid that it is.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (Conservative) is targeting.
It is already hard enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, it will be even harder for you.
Most of the young Tory claim to be Labour (Labour).
Later, at my local pub, I cravenly tried to hide.
I have insisted on the fact that I did not agree with everything that had said Mrs Thatcher.
This ploy failed.
A student in first year of philosophy, science and economic policies which, ironically, had studied at Eton, said: “Tu es, the daughter of a fascist pig.”
You are contaminated.
Other students have taken up the refrain.
I was corrupted, dirty.
“How the Tories do they love?” asked one of them.
They hit each other, is it not?”
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
I have only able to lead a normal life in Oxford?
I have been forced to meet people who share the same views just after nightfall?
Should I have become Labour and disown my opinions?
The next three years would resemble a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only Tory was openly Professor Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who taught in my university.
He was detested not only because he was a conservative, but also because he was a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
It was almost never there.
He hated this place provincial and trivial, and its accession to the point of view entirely deterministic Marxist-history.
In 1997, he accepted a post as a professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You cannot not be happy here,” he said.
I have begun to shuttle between Oxford and the house of my parents in London, finding refuge with my family and my friends dwellers more open mind.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and I explained to him why.
It was disbelief.
During his studies at Oxford, in the 1940s, all the political points of view were accepted.
“It is the best place in the world,” he said moving pleas.
They do not do it, not in the city of spires dreamers.
Even my friends communists had impeccable manners.
He had tears in their eyes.
Gives them a chance.
I am sure this is to goad.
This would break the heart if you leave Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance has gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, has succumbed to the pressure and has renounced its beliefs.
During a session of tutorials the following week, when another professor of history suggested the more seriously, that I was “an enemy of the people”, I have decided to do so.
Blushed internally of shame, I have agreed to be a victim of the brainwashing of my parents and the old traitai “crazy”.
The respite was short-lived.
It was my father who drove the final nail in my coffin oxfordien.
At that time, he wrote two columns in the press of Murdoch each week.
My door was locked.
I was cowering in my room, and after five minutes, my persecutors have abandoned.
When they are gone, I have done my suitcase and I took the first train to London.
I am never returned.
You can treat wimp pleurnicharde.
But no child of 18 years should be a victim of such intimidation in a school setting.
The tragedy is that it was Oxford, which not only has produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also enjoys an unshakeable reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
“Designer Valentino phoned prefers elegance to the publicity”
In the context of the exhibition “designer Valentino phoned: a Master of Couture”, which opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other customers of the famous italian fashion.
Somerset House, the former home of Elisabeth Ire of England, is the only place in the british capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on designer Valentino phoned Garavani.
The fashion was recognised at the inauguration of “designer Valentino phoned: a Master of Couture”, a prestigious event that brings together more than 130 models of high styling created for his house of fashion over the past 50 years.
“I love this building,” he said with his inimitable italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is “signore” Garavani, but that could not have been written without his famous customers.
Designer Valentino phoned has always been fascinated by the closed world and part of the nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition, open until 3 March, we find an impressive number of private letters and photographs signed by the cream of the aristocracy, since Princess Salimah Aga Khan Education Services until Lord Snowdon, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Designer Valentino phoned describes his personal memories as trophies of his social advancement: fashion of the small town of Voghera, north of Italy, the idol of the international jet-set.
There is nothing wrong with love royalty.
“At least, they will not crush their mégots cigarettes on your magnificent carpets like stars of pop music,” says Fiona Baroness Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we lived both in the Alps and we were good friends.
A guest designer Valentino phoned is spectacular and receives with generosity and grace.
“We will all be adorions guests in his hunting of Gstaad,” explains the ex-wife of “Heini” Thyssen, friend of intimate beauties of the time spent as Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Designer Valentino phoned has always preferred the elegance to the publicity.
Even so, it is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a designer Valentino phoned model
The Argentine, catwalk model Valeria Mazza, has not forgotten the charisma of fashion.
Years ago, after a parade in Spain, in Rome, we went to dinner in her apartment.
We were a dozen people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his spirit in every detail of his apartment in the decoration, the food, the music.
“With him, every guest feel important and appreciated,” recalls the “top model”, which has begun to work with him during the week of the Upper Couture in Paris in 1995.
“It will never happen, because his creations are works of art,” finishing it.
Procession line of nobility
The life of Garavani is not a history of obsessions but love shared.
He loves the people of high and with the most headlines and they love it too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House was converted into a podium glamour of 60 metres wide which proposes swap roles: the visitor takes the place of moons and must go on the podium to admire a “public” dream on the main creations of designer Valentino phoned, as the tailor that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for her marriage to Aristotle Onassis, the suit that was Monica Vitti in “La Notte”, or a wool and fur coat belonging to Empress Farah Diba.
Among the public of moons, names such as Luxembourg, Gloria Sybille von mail-coaches and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario Bulgaria or Sophia Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and fashion in 2006
Many of its customers saying that the first clothes designer Valentino phoned are like first love, “impossible to forget.”
I remember well.
It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a life jacket “gillette” and a jacket of the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
“It is a gift that it had made me,” said Naty Abascal, one of the muses of fashion.
“I prefer to all the others for their femininity, his love of women, and because our sublime beauty,” adds the former Duchess Feira.
I love the colours he uses, they are clever and illuminate the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The Princess and Patricia modeuse della Giovampaola of Arenberg cannot forget, either, the first time that it has been a model designer Valentino phoned.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreams of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his dresses for the evening …
Finally, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first model designer Valentino phoned for a party in the house of my cousin, Prince Eduard of Line.
It was an evening dress in red, with a skirt to flying, a draped bustier and a up their fall.
“It was a dream come true,” said the widow of Rodrigue of Arenberg.
“Designer Valentino phoned is indifferent to fashion, it is obsessed with the timeless,” explains the aristocratic italian who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg retains the robes of evening of fashion with “the utmost care, because a dress in the evening is not just a dress, it is also all memories of that vehicle.”
The “King” of fashion
The grand final of the exposure of Somerset House is the dress of married Marie-Chantal Miller scope during her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 “ragazze” (the fashion item and its seamstresses) to achieve this dress in ivory silk with incrustations of beads, twelve different kinds of lace and a trailing four and a half metres.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, supreme authority of the press, this robe represents an historic high styling of the end of the 20th century, “the return of customers of the high society.”
Obsessed for years by the “knowledge” of the nobility, designer Valentino phoned is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Commandeur, of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the legion of honour, Garavani aggregated all honours that any husband of its customers.
“His sophistication, his calmness, his aspect treated and perfect, I have always jumped in the eyes,” recognizes Arenberg.
The last time I saw it, it was a month ago at a dinner to the Museum of Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
“He was impeccable, the years have no effect on him.”
If it is a princess who said …
The hardest job in the world: the human mules Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health in 70 kilos of sulphur through trails of stone slopes.
There are people for whom the work is hell and others who work literally in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of 400 minors who earn their living on sulphur Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day until the bottom of the crater, where the sulphuric gas from the bowels of the earth is solidifie on contact with the air.
After having reaped large rocks of sulphur, which weigh a total of 70 kilograms, it develops in the two baskets in bamboo that burden on his shoulders through trails slopes.
There are only 250 metres until the high volcano which peaked at 2,386 meters, but carriers exhausted put more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a rate of turtle, bearing the balance and measuring their not not to stumble and fall into the abyss.
They know that one false step could cost them their lives, as happened to a french tourist who took a fatal fall in the Ijen volcano Kawah several years ago.
The miners Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulphur.
Once on top, we find a path between the tourists that the photograph as if they were animals of circus, and painfully heavy baskets, they walk the 3 miles until the balance that a mining company has installed a little below to 1,850 meters.
It is about PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company which operates the volcano since 1960 and, you might say, its employees, to which it pays indonesian 662 rupees (5 cents) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells to 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry since the ore is very present in everyday life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and serves to whitewash the sugar.
“As we move around 70 kilograms, we earn approximately 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip,” explains Anto, which operates in general three trips per day.
All it takes 3 hours and it ends up, but it allows him to win 138,000 rupees (11,50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although this may appear to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, is triple what it gained in the fields.
“The income of minors is very high here, where the harvest coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1,20 euros) per day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” says the carrier who once worked as a builder on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was $75,000 rupees (6,20 euros) per day and the job was not too difficult, but Anto income is close to his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is also indisputable that sulphur: “I have married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have reduced to Java for it to converting to Islam.”
Anto suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, constantly coughing fit and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases.
For 27 years, he spent three of his life to defy the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulphur has already begun to make him pay the bill although it covers his face with a mask and gloves special.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, constantly coughing fit and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases emitted by the volcano.
That is the price he must pay to pursue his dream.
“I am going to work another two years, because I want to open a shop or study spanish or french” promises in an English more than acceptable.
Hurt by life, this young engaging and intelligent could be tourist guide, server or receptionist in a hotel, but, instead, it is the work of a donkey.
It shares a masure timber grubby with other carriers, rose every day for two hours in the morning because the sulphur does not cease to discover the night, when its distinctive blue and yellow colour becomes shines amid the darkness.
Defying the dark, Anto descends into the crater in illuminating with a small lamp set to his helmet, that he has bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers loaded the baskets of sulphur on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its hefty profits, the mining company has not mechanized mining of sulphur to save costs and provides no equipment for carriers who work on their own and are paid to weight.
Moreover, they do not affect either under 30,000 rupees (EUR) mark by camera, in addition to the entry of 15,000 rupees (1,20 euros), that the guards of this natural park charge to tourists who come for photographing the volcano and its human mules.
“This work is done for the animals, not humans,” protest Madrusin corpulent, a bearer of 42 years who works at Ijen Kawah for 30 years, since he left the college.
Capable of making up to 110 kilograms, it ensures that it will not stop work “as long as he can,” because it needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18 years.
I will not take my retirement, I will die here because the volcano is all my life.
Although the sulphur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the tide is turning and trap the miners in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardened that nobody complains to suffer serious illnesses … and of course their usual respiratory problems, arthroses, pain in the knees and shoulders, distorted by the weight of baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, aged 53 years, can only charge 50 kilos.
Each day, his companions and extracting 15 tonnes of sulphur volcano, three lorries transporting the warehouse Tamansari, 18 miles away by a path of goats invaded by weeds.
“I would not take my retirement, I will die here because the volcano is all my life,” says Unainik opening of the mouth, revealing several teeth missing.
The eldest of his five children, aged 30 years, also works as a bearer of sulphur.
Time passes, but the misery continues from generation to generation, one of the most difficult jobs in the world: what do the human mules volcano Kawah ljen.
Singapore research babies to save the economy
The Singapouriens lay the blame for this lack of children on the career, the stress and the cost of access to the property.
“The population of Singapore must develop.”
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, fulfilling our civic duty and give life!
It may seem implausible that these words come from an advertising of pellets mint, but despite this, or perhaps because of it, the video spread like wildfire on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The words come from a group of rap, which uses local references as “going to put a bag in the drawer” to mock the birth rate of Singapore.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hope to draw attention to the problem of fun through advertising.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of the music for the people to fulfil their “national duty.”
It is intended solely to the Internet, we could therefore make it entertaining and fun.
It is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, and we felt that it was an issue that we need to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like perfume launch the phéromones or organise evenings of speed-dating.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they do not necessarily have worked.
So we said the following: what's more creative to solve this problem in a rap song?
1.2 children
The government of Singapore will not take so lightly.
It spends $1,300 per year in policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A measure of the government in favour of marriage and fathers providing up to $15,000 per child, longer maternity leave and distributes profits tax.
But this has had little impact.
Singapore is a city-state rich and high technology of south-east Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national distribution of population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered the renewal rate, it was in 1976.
Why the Singapouriens not have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of policies of marriage and the family division of the national population, says that this is due to a “better education” and “a wider choice of career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond the marriage and the family,” explains it.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of unmarried and delaying marriage and the birth rate, which has led to a drop in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy to increase radically immigration to counter the decline in the population has created a resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, they find Web sites that moves a barely disguised xenophobia against the new immigrants, especially the Chinese who are accused of shooting down wages and not to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as a reason why the party in Singapore last year has experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Irreversible consequences
While the falling birth rate has known effects on economic growth, tax revenues, the health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also has unintended consequences.
The government is trying to prevent the construction of many small houses.
For example, it has started to affect the real estate sector.
The authorities of urban development began to control the number of small apartments, known as the “shoe box”, can be built in certain areas of the city.
These flats have an area of 46 square metres and their sale wins much success.
However, the authorities are concerned about the fact that they can promote a lifestyle of single and discourage developers wanting to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, director of the real estate company El Developers, states that its “boxes” shoes to sell much more quickly than the larger houses.
They are more popular, in the sense that these houses are built much more rapidly than those of larger.
For this reason, it is more profitable for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards provide clearer guidelines for developers, who was previously a spanner in the works if they wish to offer too small in a housing project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the birth rate, in discussions with the Singapouriens who work in the financial district of the centre, it would appear that they do not have much effect.
“People are very stressed out, houses are expensive, like education, that is why people call it later,” says a young framework.
The other people can have children.
“But for me, it is important to have my money and my time,” says another young for 20 years.
Men and women cite their career, the stress and the cost of access to property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children.
Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies are Singapouriens themselves who have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy Spaniard, it is the quality of the private sphere, or “the field of privacy that we can protect any intrusion.”
What is this – which is private for less than 16 years?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Understands the dangers posed by broadcasting on the Internet of events that he does not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriódico asked five young boys, aged between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the web.
In four of the cases, they associate the term “something very personal” on a personal level and “the password and user name” when they have applied to social networks.
“I do not dévoilerai my personal secrets in a post,” says Jorge, ten years ago when he tries to explain the meaning of the term private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it has an account for two years.
“These are secret very secret, my mother can know them but not the whole world,” he says.
On francs, I post images sympas or games.
I discuss it with my friends.
“I do not share one of my photos or someone who is stupid,” he said.
The boy recognises that it is wrong to publish lewd photos, people dénudées, crimes or write comments humiliating or violent.
Jorge ensures that he knows his friends on 35 francs and its nine subscribers on Twitter.
The majority are family.
His mother in part, she knows the password to one of the accounts.
I have opened a twitter account to speak and write tweets interesting.
“I do not know if they will meet the post, I just,” he adds.
“Social networks are fun, I can speak with parents or distant with my friends, so quick,” he said.
He says that he would never accept the request to a person unknown.
It will not trust to someone that he would recommend a foreigner.
The case of José, 14 years ago, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on this last, admits he does not know 20 people included on its list of friends.
“It does not worry me because we have something in common, music, for example,” he says.
According to the boy, nobody has made advances or asked for her address or phone number.
“If they gave me the pressure or demanded, I simply supprimerais my account,” he acknowledges.
José is subscriber to Ask having read a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences that we know today under the name cyberharcèlement are not foreign to the boy.
A friend of a friend of mine has been extorted money from on a social network.
They have threatened and demanded money.
“It has never knew who it was,” assures it.
The victim, according to José, has not closed its account.
“It has only happened in private profile.”
Then he explains a series of manipulation for arranging his account of how safe.
Unlike Jorge, this young posterait photos of knowledge in situations uncomfortable or embarrassing.
Yes, I would do it if I was angry or excited.
“Even if I know that it is the cyberharcèlement”, he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, professor of English and sacked in education and learning, consider that, for children and adolescents, we must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“The Internet has created as a means of seeking information, but with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game has changed,” mentions it.
Porras says that the academic Marc Prensky, who has a master's degree in teaching at Yale University and author of the book “natives and digital immigrants”, uses those words to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives, they are children and young people who are born with the technology.
“We, the digital immigrants who must teach them, while we ourselves to learn,” she said.
It adds that the issue is complex, “because we ask them to have a defined criteria on what should or not to disclose, to publish or saying at an age when they do not have the maturity to do so.”
“We ask them also to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, of having thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences” to add.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach the confidentiality to children and adolescents is using the questions which are sobering.
“Their say not to count for nothing,” she says.
Then, Porras lists a few examples: there are things that you do not raconterais to a foreigner, why do you on the Internet?
Or, as you like it to publish a photo of you as a friend that you have published?
You know what others publish on you?
When you identifies photos of Christmas, requests you to other people permission to identify them?
And also, does the world need to know that you make every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act in line as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
“Outside of the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, this must be the same on social networks,” she says.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and adviser for education, says it is essential that parents read carefully the terms of use of social networks.
By understanding each of the words they have solid foundations to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
“By example, age and what it is allowed to share or publishing,” he said.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remember the children not to talk to strangers.
The summit of the Unasur ended without the Lima Declaration is made public
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) has ended today in Peru without the declaration Lima has been made public, although it has been previously announced and theoretically adopted by the seven trustees present.
Efe has tried repeatedly to access the document signed during the sixth Reunion Ordinaire Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the presidency have said initially that he would be released after the conclusion of the summit, and said that it would publish a moment on the website of the peruvian government.
When they were asked about the text, they have indicated that its content was exposed by the president of Peru, Ollante Humala, during brief statements to the press.
The journalists' access to information about the summit has constantly been limited.
During the day, only the video without his House presidential with the message “private session, audio restricted” was distributed in the press room.
The little information circulating among the journalists have been given by the press officers of some governments Unasur that attending the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The single document leaked during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some disquiet among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media demanding more important news.
Later, the president of Peru has sent an e-mail to the media with the “final statement” of the summit, but it was the speech of President Humala and not the official document which has reached the summit.
Last October, Peru has been the host of the 3rd Summit South America-arab countries (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although it has been asked with body by the press, he had not released the statement also called Declaration of Lima, as had been previously announced.
On the official website of the ASPA, we can check that the document was published in March.
In the two international meetings, the peruvian authorities have tried to put in place systems of transmission is safe for all journalists, but they have limited the maximum obtaining information.
The Summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court in the Hague that settles a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the rendezvous regional and have said they would respect the decision of the ICJ to hear the pleas of both sides in the trial that Lima has instituted against Santiago, which starts Monday in the Hague.
“We respect and leave the verdict which will resolve the disputes that we have today in this international court,” declared President Humala, alongside his chilean counterpart.
“Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country that abides by international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international courts,” added President Piñera by giving a handshake to President Humala, alongside the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they abide by the ICJ took place after that Colombia has denounced the pact this week in Bogota by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of the international court, after a decision on the maritime limits with Nicaragua regarded it as seriously flawed.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Hugo Chávez in Venezuela, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended Unasur for 2011 after the impeachment of former President Fernando Lugo, has not participated in the meeting.
The host, President Ollanta Humala, was instructed to open the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The trustee has read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of 31 projects were set between the south american countries for a total of 17 million dollars of investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the Unasur countries put in place “important steps to achieve the aim of the south american citizenship by the development of agreements on residence permits.”
He informed that action would be put in place to improve the “cooperation in the fight against insecurity and urban against international organized crime, campaigns for better access to medicines, access to the Internet at low prices in the whole of South America, and to assess how effective joint and the risk of natural disasters.”
With Europe in crisis, “economic consolidation (Latin America) should not have a matrix triumphalistic but should help to increase our matrix productive and to see a better future for our people,” concluded the President Humala.
“We have decided to put a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of areas of South America, especially in rural areas and border … between our countries and generating new economic cycles,” said the peruvian President during a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were Peru and were on the routes across its territory, from the coast up in Brazil, and that two were a greater connection with Ecuador, although it has not given further details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation of Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in this country will return within the Union of South American Nations”, of which he is currently excluded.
The need that America remains a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another topic at the summit.
In this sense, the colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, said before the meeting, that he hoped to meet his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to discuss the dispute maritime calmly through a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
“It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,” declared President Santos.
“We will review all these routes, they are not comprehensive, including the treaty with Nicaragua will ask to have a discussion with this country,” he said.
“I hope to be able to say to President Ortega that we will resolve this in the most civilised and friendly as possible,” added President Santos.
The presidents Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City, where they planned to attend the takeover of the new President, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, in the framework of the summit, the bloc's defence ministers meet to approve the plan of action of the year 2013, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defense in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Venezuela, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although that country to be suspended.

“South America needs to learn how to integrate Europe citizenship,” says Rafael Correa.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which “South America, in this case, to take on Europe”.
President Correa, who has participated in the sixth summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, said on state television, tv Péru, the Europeans were “smashing the Second World War” and other conflicts, “but that they were now almost a homeland.”
In this sense, he defended the project to establish a south american citizenship, encouraged by the member countries of the Unasur.
“It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any latin american country, as is already the case for members of the Community Andine, but there are still areas reactionary that we want to belong to the past,” he warned.
In addition, Ecuadorean President showed for the restoration of the Organization of Americans States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon and take into account the signatories of the pact in San Jose on human rights.
Those who bombarded us will never compromise, conversely, the south american, have all signed.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington under the financing of the United States,” he said, referring to political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa ensures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself has not betrayed its principles, but instead it met its “deep democratic values and human rights.”
He concluded that, at the time, “there were suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country, and that his trial will not be respected.”
It criticises the swedish court which has demanded that it be put on its territory to questioning about an alleged sex crime while “own swedish legislation enables us to do by video, which could be for the Embassy of Ecuador in London”.
Correa said that there was a risk that the mental and physical health of Assange is deteriorating.
“I have not spoken to him since he is in the embassy, but the ambassador has informed me that he had a small problem lung, but nothing serious,” said Ecuadorean President.
It is possible that his physical and mental health is deteriorating by the fact of being locked in a small area without power do exercises in the open air.
“This is about the health of anyone,” he concludes.
Correa says that the solution to asylum granted to Assange since June in the ecuadorean embassy in London, which would be a safe-conduct which would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and european judicial authorities and it stresses that it has had discussions in London in order to find a solution to the detention of the WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
“The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and european judicial authorities because the lawyer for Assange, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a series of procedures to various european bodies,” he said.
And he believes that “if Britain granted the safe conduct tomorrow, it would end.”
And if Sweden, as it allows all its legislation and, as it has done in other cases, asked Mr Assange in the embassy of Ecuador in London, or queried via Skype tomorrow, the problem would be solved.
Correa has benefited for reasserting itself as a defender of the freedom of the press and he has stated that it will not tolerate “the mediocrity, bad faith and lies which damage the freedom of expression.”
“The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not politicians malicious or perverse but bad journalists in the pay of greed, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In this light, it is happy that this is not that kind of journalists “neither bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois who dominate in Ecuador” and, instead of putting forward his re-election, “it would increase the revolution to continue the path and draw the right path.”
Correa has also supported the decision to maintain the ban on Paraguay within Unasur, at least until the next elections, arguing that the agency “should be firm and does not tolerate the opportunism and the attempted coup disguised” because, in reality, “this destroys the legitimacy of paraguayan democracy.”
What is more, Ecuadorean President as “perfectly appropriate” the desire of his colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundary between the two countries through the judgment from the International Court in the Hague, which will strengthen maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua.
For the moment, this judgment is not respected.
It is a problem between a country South American and Central American countries.
The conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overtaken by the desire to move forward together.
We must solve them in their entirety to overtake them and move forward.
At the same time, it has said it is confident in the positive resolution of the dispute over maritime borders between Peru and Chile in the same court and he said that “it is good that the America understands the international courts if the two countries agree to accept a judgment so firm that it is.”
In reference to the possibility of its presentation as a candidate for future presidential elections in Ecuador, to run for a third consecutive term, he reported that he saw this possibility “with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult.”
Correa has ensured that, if he loses the primary in February 2013, withdrawing from public life.
On a personal level, I was never interested but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, this poverty socio-economic can be resolved only through the political power.
“My political movement believed that it was me that guaranteed this possible victory but we must accept this responsibility,” he said.
If I gagnais, this would be my last presidential term and I then withdraw from political life.
If we lose, I will.
“It is my decision,” he said.
Correa has also made reference to the new medical treatment of the venezuelan president, Hugo Chávez, to Cuba.
I have to discuss with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that a routine medical treatment was already planned and that he expected the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
“It is not a relapse of the state of health of President Chávez,” he commented.
The Head of State Ecuadorean participated today in Lima in the sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which ended with a call for greater regional integration in order to support the progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are today due to a late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when it was confirmed the result of the test: HIV positive.
“It is as if the sky has fallen on the head,” he says, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make “less embarrassing”, in vain.
The young man has hidden in his family.
He decided to take care of his illness and has started to inform his subject and his stubbornness has been such that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients of the unity of HIV hospital civilian Guadalajara (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubts, little choice of treatment and stigma.
Even then, the director of a clinic of the IMSS avoided him “because he was speechless.”
At that time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, “exhausted” their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in every case, after the first cases reported, “the great victory is today that the survival of a patient began treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same,” said the head of the unity of HIV of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and it takes for reference that this information has been validated in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The infectiologue and expert in HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of the immune system that showed patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those do not consume drugs: up to 30 years for a rate of CD4 200 and up to 50 years for those reaching a rate of 500 CD4.
Put simply, this means that for someone who receive a diagnosis of HIV positive in 25 years, “as long as it remains under control, can live without problems up to 75 years,” explained the scientific questions.
To put this into context, we need to know that the life expectancy of mexican is now 76 years on average.
If it is true that the death rate has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of deaths from AIDS is past 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the annual report from UNAIDS), but it is also true that, since the appearance of AIDS, 60% of patients registered on the national database died.
Nothing in Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and it had 187 deaths until May this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs is universal since 2005.
So why is there still deaths?
I think that the problem is not with the access to treatment.
That is how I see it, which is what happened in our hospital.
Over the past 12 years at least, we have never lacked for drugs, the problem is that patients are very advanced stages because they do not know that they are infected, or they learn in the advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact “nine in ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, it needs to have a greater impact on the overall mortality, make diagnoses more early and, for that, we must offer screening tests on a massive scale, to all those who request it.”
Experts and members of the State Council of AIDS prevention of Jalisco (Coesida) agreed on its proposal, as the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, who has done his screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done and that, despite his young age, he was already infected with AIDS and was suffering from Kaposi sarcome of a cancerous tumour, which is the usual complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some believe that they will die and do not want to know.
“If I will die, it is better that I broke three times per week,” they say, this is not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication.
To this day, his parents know only that it suffers from cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
“I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but I am involved, attention to me and to the other person,” says Fabrizio, who has agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO for help, thanks to his testimony, those who fear today, during the march of the World Day against AIDS.
What do the test, if they took risks, they will know soon if they are HIV-positive and the better, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that they can live like everyone, being responsible.
His message sums up the slogan of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms on the desk
There are many gaps between the health programmes and the ordinary citizen, supports Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest lies in prevention.
In all the places dedicated to this, “we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we gave one or two, now gives us packages of 100, is all very well, but it means that, even today, some do not have access to condoms,” he says.
Among the most vulnerable to the new infections, found adolescents.
The question: “what are you going to do?,” asked with ludicrous and value judgments by social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers do not want to hear, ensures the journalist.
It proposes to redirect this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not only sold in the shops, but as we find them in the distributors of public toilets, and in places that frequent the young.
This is not to encourage promiscuity.
It is not their pay girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio Gonzalez had responded when asked whether there would be a distribution of condoms in its administration.
“This is not how it works, sexuality, the best is to provide condoms for people already sexually active,” he said.
The figures in Jalisco
There are 13,435 case cumulative (12,158 1,317 of AIDS and HIV).
The state is the fourth state in the country by number of new cases and cumulative AIDS cases and 13th for the number of sufferers of HIV.
92% of infections are by sexual, 6% by blood and 2% by post.
It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, since for every case recorded, there are 4 or 5 people that ignore.
Ratified in a judgment call by a United States court ignores the debt restructuring of the group Vitro via a voluntary bankruptcy trade in Mexico, the scenario creates a dangerous precedent for all companies with national ramifications in the neighbouring countries and solvency problems.
It seems, therefore, that the procedures of the survival of companies allowed by the mexican laws are not valid in the country at the spangled banner, opposite view of international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the ruling on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, leaves the mexican companies without a defence against the possibility of embargo their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow the main manufacturer of glass of Mexico before the Supreme Court of the United States based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge of the case indicates that creditors should register in the bankruptcy law in the United States, the court of appeal of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings is bankrupt commercial formalized in Mexico.
The first would be to denounce the cooperation of international procedure in the event of insolvency of transnational companies having a profile.
In fact, the Model United Nations uniformity of International Law trade had been created for this purpose in the American Law Institute as a referee.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the vote intersociétés, recognised in the critical mass to bankruptcy, trade debts incurred by Vitro subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not be obtained.
However, the mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, which the Federal Institute of bankruptcies trade had guarantees the debts.
Furthermore, what is certain is that, since it was the votes of the subsidiaries, in all ways of Vitro creditors who fought against it in the courts of the United States, that is to say the “vulture funds” as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, does not have a majority.
The vote was 45 votes to 37.
A fact omitted by the court of appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he encountered since 2008 without stopping to the serious economic crisis that confronted the United States, passing on the costs to the country.
For the moment, the society of the family González Sada interjettera appeal before the same court of appeal for the vote to take place in its entirety, that is to say, with the five judges, since only three had voted.
The use of insurance required non-prosperity and requires the revision of the trial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The most serious is that the court has ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae (friend of the Court”) in which was detailed the procedure followed by Vitro within the framework of the law on corporate bankruptcy, suggesting that the freeing of agreements signed by the two countries to reach the same level as paragraph 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States.
In addition, he points out that the country has bowed to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, which is to say the rules set out in the event of insolvency, which ensure fairness for debtors and creditors.
Carambolage of two parts: they overwhelm Vitro and they overwhelm the country.

Héctor “Hetin” Reyes “the basketball is all my life”
The globe-trotteur of basketball “Hetin” Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in connection with the ground and, thanks to him, has travelled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of the local basketball as large as that of Héctor “Hetin Reyes.”
The reason is that before a stroke will condemn the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes has been immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, be it as a footballer leagues below, player of the national team basketball, manager and leader of the national team, BSN, with the vaqueros of Bayamón or as president of the Federation of baseball.
“I have brought several hats in the basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was chairman of the BSN, director of the national team and president of the Federation during the 1990s,” recalls Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora home in Bayamón, where it lies with Isabel, his loyal wife for more than 50 years.
“The basketball is all my life.”
Reyes does not exaggerate when he made that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all receiving pictures and memories that remind her itinerary outside standards, show.
Bayamón in the heart
For all his memories, those he loves most are those who recall its passage as a player in the team of vaqueros in the mid-1950s until 1982, having spent 15 years as co-manager and manager of the team.
“This has been my best years, those I have most benefited because I have had the chance to participate in the vaqueros eight championships from 1967, either as a manager, co-manager or leader.
For many years, including the five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
I then withdrawn during the championship in 1981, the year when Jerome Mincy entered the team BSN.
From there, “Cuco” Ortiz, who was a great administrator, has been leading the team,” says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been leader here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: “I have a player strapping for you, it measures two metres.
You want?”
This is how to begin Mincy, one of the best players that had Puerto Rico.
Bartow was then recommended Raymond Gausse, which has been naturalised and which was a better shooters.
I remember saying that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon win a championship, Gausse would help us try to win another.
He welcomes the championship of vaqueros with Gausse, but only at a distance since 1988 it was already the largest manitou Federation.
In that time, he preferred to take advantage of its burdens and Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won for the first time in the United States during the pre-olympic tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived Fourth and where we should have won the bronze medal if the judge Canadian we did not play the last match, said Reyes.
The team of the 1990 World Cup is the best national team that you have a view?
It is one of the best, like that which has beaten the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favourite is the Games Panaméricains Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and we have put a kicking to the team of the United States, which was quite similar to that which won bronze at the World Cup.
This team not only was composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and “Piculín” (Ortiz), there was also the young (Javier) “Toñito” Colón and James Carter, the brothers Francisco and León (Edgar) and Mario “Quijote” Morales, who had not seen the world of 90 because of a knee problem.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it has given us a gold medal and a great joy at the tournament pre-olympic Neuquén in Argentina.
With players like “Canito” Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacement players suspended by the bungled the Games Panaméricains of Mar del Plata, we have won gold against all the forecasts.
What has been the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without doubt, it is about Piculín Ortiz.
Its statistics at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculín.
And this without taking into account its trajectory in different leagues, for which he has played.
That was the best leader portoricain?
It is very difficult to say.
We had a good team of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In the young, I very much like the work that fact Leo Arill.
For you, what is your biggest success within the Russian Federation?
Having been part of the time the most glorious of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the BSN mattered until 17 teams in a season.
You are there to do?
There are things that I wanted to put in place, as the regionalisation of minor categories.
For example, that boys of Pontius play only in their area and face only teams from other parts of the island in the play-offs.
Today, young people travelling and playing too, while this is not strictly necessary.
I have at least given the advantage of qualifications and compulsory courses for the leaders, staff on the ground and the referees.
That makes me happy.
What do you do today?
In general, I listen to music, I watch the clips of my time on YouTube, I take my grandchildren and, from time to time, I attend matches basketball.
And of course, I take the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always at my side.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21 1931, the Forth Worth (Texas), was universally known by the main role of John Ross Ewing, known as J.R., in the television series “Dallas,” in which he embodied a heartless, dangerous and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role of unscrupulous oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series “Dallas” became a symbol of the greed in the 1980s, has died.
He had 81 years.
Hagman, who was returned this year in the role of J. R in a new season of “Dallas,” died Friday evening from complications of cancer, according to a statement from the family sent to the associated Press for Warner Bros., house production of “Dallas.”
“Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, again playing the role ironic that he loved the most,” said the family.
The family of Larry and his friends were with him to Dallas in this holiday of thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who interpreted the role of his wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said her press officer, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and it will greatly miss.
“This was a person of exception and he lived life to substance,” Gray said in a statement.
Doctors had diagnosed with a liver cirrhosis to Larry Hagman in 1992 and he acknowledged having much engrossed for many years.
In 1995, he had detected a malignant tumour in the liver and he underwent a transplant.
Years before “Dallas,” Hagman had been known to television in the role of a type normally in the series “Jinny of my dreams” broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is transformed when he found a genius alluring, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and he brought it home.
He also played in two comedy which remained little time on the airwaves, “the Good Life” (NBC, 1971-72) and “Here We Go Again” (ABC, 1973).
Among his roles in films are well received by the critical roles in “the Group,” “Harry and Tonto” and “Primary Colors.”
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of such a nice way loathsome J.R. that Larry Hagman enjoyed his greatest success.
The dramatic series of CBS on the Ewing clan and their relatives has been broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan “who shot J. r .?”, invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions, in which the character of Hagman is almost murdered, has generated speculation in the world and millions of dollars in betting played.
Thanks to that, among others, the series has reached a record audience for that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers averaged before their screen and “Dallas” the second programme of entertainment, the most watched in the world, after the final episode of “MASH” in 1983, which brought 50 million viewers.
It was the sister-in-law of J.R., Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) which had taken over.
J.R. had put pregnant and had subsequently threatened to accuse prostitution if it does not leave the city, but other people were also reasons for the attack.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable but the smile: a charismatic entrepreneur dishonest and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic interner wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
“I know what it is like funereal action for J. R,” Hagman said in 1988.
We should write “Ci-is the honest citizen J.R. Ewing.”
Here is the only part that he has lost.
Victoria Principal, coprotagoniste of the original series, has mentioned this Friday to Hagman as a man of “immense, both on the screen and in life.”
He is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, to millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each of us, who have had the chance to know and love.
Ten episodes of the new edition of “Dallas” was broadcast a few months with great success on TNT.
The registration of five episodes is already over for the second season, and a sixth is underway, has informed the chain.
For the moment, neither Warner nor the chain TNT have reported on how the death of Hagman in the series.
From Fort Worth, Texas, is the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who was acquainted with the celebrity works classics as “South Pacific” and “Peter Pan.”
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave him the day in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on the scenes of theatres in New York in the early 1950s, then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young décoratrice of internal Swedish Maj Axelsson and he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the californian city of Malibu resident, where many celebrities.
In 2001, he called his memoirs “Hello Darlin”: Tall (and) Absolutely True Tales about My Life” (in french: hello Darlin”: the memoirs of ruthless I R.)
“I have nothing in writing this book that can injure somebody or affect anything,” he told the press at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active campaigner of organ donation and working as a volunteer in a hospital to attend the patients concerned.
“I would advise them, I give them confidence, I have with them when they come to operate and after” recounts it in 1996.
I try to offer some solace, like “Don't be afraid, it will not be easy for some time, but it will go well.”
He has also been activist against tobacco and has participated in several campaigns.
In a reference to the “end of the world” has just begun
Each week, students explore the apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, the zombis, viruses and germs and climate change.
This semester, when Professor religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a lecture on the end of the world, he knew that he was casting an irresistible bait: the end of “high estimate” of the mayan calendar, on 21 December, which refer to many people as evidence of the end of the world is imminent.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what the expected during the following months: Hurricane Sandy disaster, a fiscal abyss that some have dubbed the “own Armageddon of debt” and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christians theorists of the end of time believed that will trigger Armageddon.
“I did not realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic that I have never experienced,” said this week Professor Charmé her students of the Rutgers University-Camden (New Jersey).
If you look at what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and the racontions, it has been a very good period.
And it should be remembered that what is bad is good for those who believe in Armageddon.
And he is not the only professor to give way on the “end of the world” this semester, which will, in theory, the last of history.
At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker exempts the current “Media, Culture and the end of the world.”
Each week, students explore the apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, the zombis, viruses and germs and climate change.
“We analyze it because these ideas proliferate with time,” he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guide some human conduct.
If nuclear weapons fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, the students analyse films with apocalyptic themes and learn how they can be compared with real-life examples.
“I tried to tell my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible,” said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania State, Professor of History of America and his colleague Matthew Restall Solari professeure Amara, a deputy of History of Art and Anthropologie, team to give way, simply entitled “the end of the world.”
“We add “2012” to have the opportunity to give the course again, if the world does not go away,” said Professor Restall.
Despite the “looming disaster”, students should study, create projects and spend their final examinations.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be spent the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not leave the student choice other than to work “until the night of the supposed end of the world,” said Restall.
The courts have proved quite popular.
“It was complete in two hours,” said Restall about his current students at high level, composed of 35 students.
We have received messages by email several weeks before the beginning of the semester, people who asked if there was still room.
The students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“It fascinates me to see what people are able to do for comfort,” says Bridgid Robinson, a student in sociology and religion of 23 years, from Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers University-Camden.
Because fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is just a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a student in psychology and sick bay of 25 years, states have watched all the apocalyptic films.
“I had never heard of one who taught in this area,” he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students surveyed, and still less a professor said, do we believe in the end date of the world of December 21.
“Our first project was the mayan prophecy, and somehow we have discredited,” says Julie zegle, student last year to Temple, aged 21 years and from West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world, it is just a key date on the calendar, said Restall.
But I admit that there is an anxiety linked to apocalypse in western culture, dating back centuries, which makes people respond to changes in their environment in predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a rise of these speculations.
“In other parts of the world, people do not believe in this,” assures it.
It is a majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of the Salle which gives way to the Philippines this year, quickly responded when asked if he knew that we gave here on the “end of the world”.
“The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world,” us-he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall remarked that, over the years, we have talked about the many dates alleged last judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on 21 December, “the people will immediately start thinking about the next date” or to philosophise about the fact that 21 December marks the beginning of a period of 7 years, at the end of which the world will disappear.
The students and teachers take the date lightly.
Several said they believed the Christmas go to “the end of the world.”
“Sometimes I call friends and we rigolons together,” said Samira Ford, student communications in 20 years.
