The lack of snow in the mountains haunts the hotel owners
Scneelose runs Sorgenn not only make the Riesengebirgen residents.
The lack of snow discourages people from the appointment of ski stays in hotels and pensions.
It is still in Giant free room for all winter dates incl. Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are visited often.
The people go through the offers, the prices, but they have since to order mandatory fear.
And if they call us to ask whether it immediately, in our view, this year's Christmas on snow "or" will be Matsch, the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura.
If the New Year's Eve stay in the spin-offs Del mill just after his ideas like that should not have more to do with the appointment.
Who prefers the saving and the quality of the stay in second place, can try to wait a few days.
The spin-offs Del mill hotel owners are now for the Silvestertag mostly only weeks stays.
I believe that they are still for a while will seek to sell it, but we also need they yield, and on shorter hours.
And then the free rooms quickly wane, Jandura estimated.
Free beds in all Winterterminen is always always the travel office Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are interested in the majority of the Christmas week, which is not yet sold.
In our offer is roughly half of the jobs still free.
That is why we have some cheaper Christmas stays prepared for the last moment, the director of the travel agents Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Silvestertag in Giant Mountains, it can also offer Vrchlabi travel, but there are fewer free jobs.
Good sales will also find the first fourteen days in February, the rest of the winter dates will be sold on average.
This year is the interest for the winter stays also negatively affected by the fact that in Giant is still no snow.
The people are waiting to see whether snow.
Nobody wants the end of the year without snow in the mountains.
If the slopes within a week verschneit, will also be sold from the Christmas, says Schiefert.
Vice versa, and somewhat better than in the last year, manages the room in the hotel in Pecpod Snezkou to fill the horizon.
We are around five percent better than in the previous year.
On Silvestertag and Christmas we are only a couple of free room.
There is great interest in the Polish holiday in Janua, and in February will run the business well informed of the director of the best Pec hotels, Karel Rada.
80% for the New Year's Eve in-patient treatment is also the hotel in Central Park Omnia Janske place in Lazne occupied.
Remains at Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne even half the beds.
Pleasantly surprised us in this year of January, for which we currently have around 60% are empty.
A bit is weaker since February, but at the moment, when the snow is certainly an increase in the interest of the placements in the Giant Mountains, the director of the hotels Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
On a greater snow waiting mess of the Giant hotel owners now.
On Thursday it should cool and, if it comes to decline proposals, it should be snow in the mountains.
But it will be a warming informed Jiri Jakubsky from the site of the Czech weather office in Hradec Kralove.
US repetition is the mother of the wisdom.
It is almost funny how Schülerstrebsamkeit Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of the brightest, the strategy in the issue of his predecessor, he repeatedly, even for the stupid.
As he awaited by his Afghanistan ausschwitzte doctrine, it was that he made that on the Kopierpapier from the Bush Szenariovor Iraq abschrieb three years ago.
Not only that he was in the text of several saying "as in Iraq", he has even used the name of the Bush statement from January 2007 as the name of its own declaration: "New onward Way" used without the fence.
He has even three years of the Bush idea - fresh troop contingents in the troubled by the civil war in Iraq - as "irresponsible and send in their conclusions karastrophische decision".
Subsequent months showed, however, that the recommendations of the military outgoing lands in the only way, and was very successful that it is now in the news about Iraq no longer.
The reputation of the Bush was not improved by his successor as objective has a lot of gratitude starting situation hintergelassen, as it was to be expected.
In Afghanistan Barack Obama hopes that the miracle repeats itself.
In order to increase in the number of troops contingent have asked him again the military, especially the supreme commander of the Afghanistan operation General Stanley McCristal, even despite the Subordinat Consultation habits of the zaudernden marksmen from the White House severely criticised.
He asked 40,000 soldiers in order to reverse the situation for the better.
The President postponed three months, but with no better idea, and so he has come the general wenistens about 10,000 soldiers cheated.
From Europe, he has the promise of another 5,000 deals, even if he originally forecast of at least 10,000.
Highly problematic in the rest of the Obama strategy is his project, the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan to withdraw in 18 months, and this process within three years. The whole Obama Doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt about halved the increase in the same effect as the measure in Iraq will bring.
Despite the fratricidal war in recent years is the Iraqi society relatively well structured to honour the values of their leaders.
The Afghan situation is marked by the cons indication - it can rely on a and there will be no agreements.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare for the Afghan security forces, which are accustomed to every day to change their mind.
The political institutions, even if they were founded formally correct, just a veneer of buildings, behind which the patriarchal stem relations will continue to excel.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, particularly because of the confusion of the conditions, the Pakistan and Iran influences even more complex.
The building of a "viable state," the minimalist objective of the whole operation is very unrealistic.
Time horizon of the Obama strategy surprised by his headstrong
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan only continues to deteriorate, and now it is on the verge of the explosion.
To believe that the small soldiers in the war cries about the "early return" from ruptured a miracle, can only create a truly romantic soul, not influenced by facts.
From the political point of view is the date for the withdrawal of the sheer irresponsibility, because the Taliban as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last summit showed that the willingness of Europeans in the combat in Afghanistan, is running out.
Europe's politicians and voters want not explain how the safety of Germany or Italy with the war in the Hindu Kush mountain's country.
Another possible factor, the situation is radically can influence the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increasing sanctions on the Iranians, is not for the United States is a very serious question whether the problem cannot be solved with troops.
This question should be answered in the period in which America after Obama takes the victories of withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Any solution, however, is also a dramatic shift of the Afghan situation.
The only palliative for Barack Obama is the fact that three years until the presidential election, and therefore there is still enough time, so that he can use a different strategy, fallls Totalausfall would prove this.
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs receive no more cash in Prämienboni
The chief executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs in this year to receive no premiums in bonuses.
It has announced that the company to the sharp criticism from their pay practices.
A group of 30 top managers will receive the money rather than equities, but they can sell only in five years.
In addition, the share of the managers in the case, if they are excessively risky.
Goldman Sachs is so in accordance with the agency Reuters at the top of the efforts of the premium bonuses of Wall Street with long-term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street about the continuing is aware of the direction in which it has to be said of the former bankers, Douglas Elliott's society.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs made the target of criticism after it for the first three quarters of this year, nearly $17 billion set aside for Prämienboni.
The total amount of premium bonuses during this Jahra, according to the agency Reuters, despite the today is probably also indicated measure to exceed $20 billion.
The high premiums bonuses in the banking sector are with the onset of the financial crisis in a whole series of country has become the most controversial political issue.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to the bonuses of bankers, the 25,000 pounds in excess of unique with a tax of 50 per cent.
Similar steps are also preparing for France.
In this year of women, the Nobel Prizes won in all disciplines, except in physics.
Five record women have today in Stockholm desKönigs from the hands of Sweden Carl XVI Gustaf this year's Nobel prizes in the categories and for literature.
In addition to the four scientists was under the German writer Herta Müller, the Romanian Abkunft, including.
The Nobel Prize for medicine, two American Biologinnen, Elizabeth Blackburn and Greider Ms Tongue, together with her fellow countryman, Jack Szostak for research in the Chromosonen area.

The last Laureatin granted the Nobel Prize for economics, the American, Elinor Ostrom and their fellow countryman Oliver Williamson for analyses of economic report.
The only specialist category in the earlier this year, no woman received a Nobel Prize was physics.
This price today, the scientist Charles Kao for research in the field of fibre and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl for the CCD chip invention won the basis of Digitalkammeras, fax machines or astronomical Fernrohr.
Each of these winners has the diploma, the Nobelmedaile and certificate on the purchase of the price of money.
The in each category of 10 million Swedish kronor.
If there are several winners in each category is the price of money will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, the most anticipated peace Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
He said in his speech of his appointment recognised the controversial, because it is only at the beginning of his journey, and also at the head of the country, the two wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Minister Janota, considering the resignation. Klaus has invited him in the Burg
President Vaclav Klaus on Friday morning, receives the Finance Minister Eduard Janota, about his continued presence in the government, because he thinks with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form of this by the Assembly was released on Wednesday, disagrees.
It is believed that the budget, and perhaps also the retention of Janota by a member of the cabinet in the themes of the Friday meeting.
The budget will also be criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, as the crisis deepened the public finances.
In addition to the meeting informed of the presidential spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
Regardless of his further loss in its function Janota wants on Monday with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, negotiate.
After the budget law, which now Klaus to sign should receive the Czech Republic with a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
In Parliament on Wednesday, but the Linkspartei proposals for monetary revolution and the money for the Staatsbeamtengehälter, for the maintenance of the social services and direct wages of farmers.
The government has the proposals of the social democracy, that they have hidden increase the budget deficit.
Between the left-wing party, on the one hand, and the government, Klaus and legal party, on the other hand, is therefore a scathing domestic political dispute arose dessentwegen the question mark over the rest of the work of the fishermen official cabinet, on the design of the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget as it was approved by Parliament, the package of austerity measures, virtually wiped out by the government of fishermen in the autumn were enforced, and that after their understanding of the public debt should end.
Klaus, the law on the state budget can sign, but must not, said today in the discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs that the leaders of the "serious problem" that "the unsustainable deficit" of the public finances have neglected, a longer period of time.
In his opinion, there is no such thing as a good solution.
An improvement could only take a strong government, which is still on a broader consensus among the political parties could build.
The ODS leader, Mirek Topolanek, said that the budget grey is full, and the government should weigh their continued existence.
The ODS deputy chairman, Petr Necas, said the CTK that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Grünenpartei apparently no longer works.
Prime Fischer called in the editors of similar words as "strong training contradictions."
The CSSD leader Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the budget deficit is horrifying is that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that exceeds 200 billion kronor.
On Wednesday regarded the CSSD the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was satisfied.
Mandela was in the new film by Clint Eastwood played by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood-Film "Invictus: The Ungeschlagene" of the world shows that much of the country, whose fight and victories, despite some criticisms that the main role of an American actor was invaded.
The story tells of sport, Rassenverhältnissen and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless campaigner against the racist apartheid system of governance in the South African republic, as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, observes in his life history of the American Oscar actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he was asked by the einundneunzigjährigen Mandela, whether he could pose in Eastwood film.
Another meaningful is taking on the role of Damon little.
I said to him: "If I will play, I must take you.
The over the 70-year actors, the price for his role in the Eastwood drama from the box "million dollar baby" had already received, the leader of the Movement for the abolition of slavery, from the closure of the slave owners, has become a fictional President of the United States, and also in a powerful Evan "God", but rarely as someone who is still alive, and for many people is as important as Mandela.
The former südafrikanischeStaatsmann for his active activity at the end of apartheid in the South African Republic of 27 years in prison.
He was in 1990 undfür released in four years, he was president of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Nobel Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "ungeschlagen", and at the same time, it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, in the years 1875 was issued.
The requirement, as he was to speak
The film recounts a true story in the Nelson Mandela of his forces with the captain of the Southern African Rugbyteams, Francois Pienaar, zusammenschloss in order to keep the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people after apartheid rassen still legally and economically divided.
He believes that he can agree people through sport, therefore, he decides the rugby players in the world, the outsiders are too few.
After all, the South African team up in the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to the Mandela history on the movie screen.
He had no objective other than this role to play in this as closely as possible to move closer to the reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, so to speak, as he has.
The actor said that if he and the world politicians would be in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela with him to eat dinner and before his speech behind the scenes.
It was important for him to shake hands with Mandela.
I noticed when I give you the hand schüttele, I accept your energy, it will, and I had the feeling that I know what you feel, he said.
It is important to me, a different person.
Little Damon, in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team in the white players have prevailed.
The actor said that he had six months for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him, as he Pienaar for the first time in his home.
I remember when I think of the door bell rang that he opened up and the first thing I said in my life, François Pienaar was: 'In the film, I see much bigger'.
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors in comparison with their actual models, he has been under the chairmanship of the director Eastwood "Invictus: Ungeschlagen" positive reviews, and we are also talking about prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his evaluation in the following words: "That was a very good story, very good listed film."
In the Filmrezensionen websites on the rottentomatoes.com Invictus, 76% positive evaluations.
Light secret dissolved on Norway: The Russians have tested a missile
Over Norway was a ray effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Defense Ministry has only yesterday admitted that just north of the Norwegian border in an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested.
The launch, however, was not successful and type '' as the Bulava missile, originally called the pride of the Russian army should be, is slowly on the nightmare of Japan and the Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on the ground on the missile test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava is usually not launched at all, or in the air has been damaged.
In the Russian newspapers, one writes about "Bulava" than a "missile, not a fee."
A rocket, which is not flies, but Shining
This already 13th attempt, was at the beginning of normal.
Only at the end of the flight, in turn, technical damage to the missile.
The engine probably exploded in the third rocket stage.
This time, "Bulava" from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij under the water of the White Sea.
This type of missiles allows the firing from the submarine.
It is likely that by an unspecified flying object causing mysterious light on northern routes in the Bulava was "damaged".
In addition, the Norwegians for the first time, no doubt that it is a Russian missile.
The Japan has kept diesesmal, on the other hand, claiming that it is not clear from a failure can speak.
The first two stages of the missile were not enough and the accident was only the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines in the first stage damaged.
Even if no test launch without its faults, keeps the leadership of the Ministry of Defence only six of 13 for unsuccessful.
The almost fünfzigprozentige success, therefore, the Japan meets with optimism and so will continue to be claimed that the "Bulava again fly without problems and even ten Hyperschall Atomsprengköpfe with a total weight of Max. 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov, with 51 years of an annual contract with the CSKA Moscow signed
The legendary defensive players Vjaceslav Fetisov, with 51 years, in turn, in a professional ice hockey match.
The former world champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup -Inhaber helps his team CSKA Moscow in the emergency, and is probably already in Freitagsduel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, of his career with 40 years ago, in 1998, has completed, the office of President of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas wounded, we urgently need another defensive player.
Fetisov has trained regularly and agreed that he will support the team.
We only need to look at some of the rest of the formalities to clarify the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow Club of Sergei Nemcinov.
Now, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player just a game.
I believe that this is a Fetisov, the morality of other players can raise, led Nemcinov players.
If Fetisov back on the ice area, he will AP after the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game.
In the NHL, the legendary striker with fifty-one years Gordie Bowe a whole season played for Hartford and had 15 hits and 26 zuguteschreiben assistance.

Hyundai was the unions after all the overtime will be wiped out.
The management of Nosovice Automobilfabrik Hyundai agreed with the union on the lifting of overtime.
Because often here overtime, the union's willingness to strike on Monday.
The confirmed the spokesman for the car factory Hyundai, Petr Vanek.
The business leadership wants, but with the trade unionists still on a shift in this week on Saturdays.
We must not abandon our manufacturing plan, which is a principle, therefore, on Saturday, 19 December, voluntary overtime from the basic suggested that two working groups would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company's staff, which would work on Saturdays layer, a bonus of 400 CZK has offered.
The get the staff in the event for the middle class on Saturdays from 28 November.
According to the company Vanek has decided that the motivation of the type of staff for the proposed overtime to change.
Either they leave the Übers classes, or they can pay a premium for replacement holidays on 28 December and prolong the Christmas festivities, Vanek.
In addition to all members of the vehicles on Saturdays class money and lunch.
With regard to ensure that the overtime of the immediate and biggest point about demands and complaints of trade unionists were last week, the production has been halted the management yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the lifting of all overtime opted for the month of December, Vanek.

Czech discovery: A substance, which also works in ´ gestählt ´ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists test new connections, the spread of HIV viruses in the body should stop.
The main advantage of improved substance is that he also works with the viruses that are resistant to drugs.
This fact on top against the disadvantage that the link on standard virus variants, not so much as one of the existing medicines.
The disease of AIDS cannot yet be cured.
The patients can the medication compilation but life expectancy and the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
But their income from a whole range of side effects.
Partial suppression of the virus reproduction is also in the development of sg. Resistentviren, against which no medicines are more effectively.
The work of the experts from three institutions of the Academy of Sciences CR, from the VSCHT organisms (technological seminary) Prague and the university in Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the viral resistance.
They have shown that as the Metalokarborane described substances on the protein material, which is responsible for the increase in the number of HIV.
The Metalokarborane are links from Bor, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These links to block the virus reproduction in a different way than all medicines, used today, so they can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, the scientists to new ´ improved ´ links, on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their attachment to the virus protein material were prepared.
The Metalokarborane have a unique three-dimensional structure: Two cages, often from Bor, hydrogen technology and carbon Atomen and by a metal nuclear, in this case cobalt, are linked.
Heinous and maintainable virus
HIV Protease is protein material of HIV, for the life cycle of the virus is essential.
Without the HIV Protease caused by the HIV virus division would not Infektionsvirenpartikel mature.
If we eliminate the HIV Protease, we call the propagation of the virus in the body of the patients, explaining the scientists in the press report by the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR was issued.
In the work in the Scientific newspaper Journal of Medicinal Chemistry was published, describing the scientists throughout the ranks of the links, in which two pairs of cages (see table) by a brief organic chain are linked to alter the then systematically.
Slightly weaker, but reliable
The impact of this series of materials against the HIV Protease wurdne in test tubes, also tested against their steady (resistant) variants of HIV-infected patients have been won.
The impact of the Metalokarborane in the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as the clinical use of medicines, but they do not lose their effect on the Resistentvarianten against the use of medicines often are ineffective.
The unique impact mechanism and its other properties, such as the biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical ways, makes the Metalokarboranen to interesting links for further on the development of effective medicines against HIV applied research, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the laboratory for structural biology of the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry and the Institute for molecular genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute over budget. ODS went to fishermen, the Fights Back
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, used the licensed budget for the next year as "horrifying" and the government of Prime Minister by Jan Fischer, in his view, should consider their continued existence.
The statement of ODS, the Prime Minister described as a "strong" the contradictions.
It is supposedly time for the analysis.
The Deputy ODS leader, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the Staff cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Grünenpartei apparently no longer works.
After Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends, in Parliament is based on the minority, when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether it be in order to remain in office through the Parlamentlinken.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits is diametrically contrary to Necas.
Parliament on Wednesday, the budget for 2010, but with link party amendment proposals for more than 12 billion kronor.
Parliament has the money for public salaries of Community officials, for the maintenance of the social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has the proposals of the social democracy, that they have hidden increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should come with a backlog of 163 billion kronor.
The ODS has left the room before the vote, it is the desire on the part of the government, because the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the provisional budget Frase not clear.
Disappointment and futility
The Finance Minister Eduard Janota, on his frustration and a sense of futility, whereas Premier Jan Fischer has stated that the government of the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota seriously with his resignation would have threatened in the event that the amendment proposals were adopted, the situation would be different.
Under the Czech Television, Janota on Monday after the government business in the Prime Minister.
He has indicated that he thought another remain in office.
Reason to do so is his disappointment on the Verhandugn's budget.
The fishermen for the continuation of the battle with the budget deficit, so in accordance with Necas the Nominanten social democracy (CSSD), the changes in the budget enforced in the government had nothing to do with.
The Prime Minister should also be made clear that he will resign if Parliament will continue to attract deficit to adopt laws, for example, the sick pay and pensions, or the Dienstgesetzesnovelle.
Topolanek: The ODS Oscar-nominated ministers are not doing
It is a matter of the Prime Minister, fishermen and the entire government.
The by the ODS Oscar-nominated ministers have made no mistake, Topolanek in a piece of news from the United States.
It has said that in some of the ministries in deputy function people sit at the top 09, who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that, if fishermen will decide in favour in the fight against the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct, that he is based on the left-wing majority in Parliament is at the moment."
He then allegedly with the support and tolerance of citizens can expect Democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if it will be live, I will look into this matter, said of the Bürgerdemokraten nominated Defense Minister Martin Bartak journalists in Parliament.
Prime fishermen flew in the afternoon at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS came back at the request of the Prime Minister
Necas stressed at the same time that the ODS, probably on Wednesday in the European Parliament would vote against the amended budget if the Prime Minister, the members of the public Democrats explicitly ask that they would allow the adoption of the budget.
We are not as orphans, we are not small children, so he responded to the question of whether the ODS in the political negotiation on the budget by the absence of the leader of the party in Parliament, and in the Czech Republic has not diminished.
I have not noticed that my voice would be lacking.
Even when I took on the mandate, I knew that in the next few months, especially at division of Parliament and the destruction of everything would be positive, reacted Topolanek itself.

The biggest changes include the introduction of the new direct transport route from Milovice after Prague, at the moment, the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem ones.
It is the fifteenth route of suburban transport system Esko, whose opening thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem after Milovice is possible.
The long-distance television in the capital in the target station Prague - the main depot.
The CD SC Pendolino leads more lines of communication between Prague and northeastern and the trains after Sumperk / Jesenik in the time of two hours.
With the Pendolino the passengers since 13 December no longer after Bratislava.
This bill for region ale Isen by 200 million increase in rail.
The rapid trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport receives a total of the railways to reimburse the so-called Liquiditätsverlusts in the next year four billion kronor, gene as this year, the local trains supply the constituencies, they have to pay for a total of eight billion kronor in the next year, with the state zuschießt three billion.
This year, the regional trains 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains, as well as the rapid trains, the railways a ten-year contract newly completed, until now, the Treaty is only for a year.
The railway praises the system, perhaps it is not on the increase in the price of the vast majority of tickets.
It is only to changes in one-day network driving licence system and CD in favourable Internetfahrscheinen Eliska.
For passengers without the customer card is the price of 450 kroner net CD on 600 kroner.
The price Eliska will depend on the deadlock appeared, until now, he was for the travel between any district of cities in the same manner and cost 160 kroner.
Filipino Millitante take more than 50 people, the children were released.
Millitante hijacked today in the south of the Philippines 75 people, including some primary school pupils and their teachers.

Jancura collects criminal proceedings of slander against three head of the CSSD.
The owner of the student Agency, Radim Jancura today, criminal proceedings of slander against three social democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of Südmähren Radko Martinek, from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said in a zwanzigminütige Inteview on radio Journal.
The complaint is connected with the effort of the company, the regional train traffic in some districts.
All regions, but at the end of the day, long-term contracts with the Czech Writers railways was signed.
All three head to pick up and say that we are cherrypicking, we have the offer only on the size, as it was voted with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech railways, because we are the prices of the Czech railways were aware of the last week were completed.
So we are left with nothing else than us to resist.
Because this slander of society student Agency, said Jancura Radio Journal.
At the same time, he said that he is evidence from all counties that their steps in accordance with the European law.

Vaccination against Pneumokokken free of charge and voluntarily
Imfung against Pneumokokken changes from January the usual.
It is a first for the families free of charge and be voluntary.
But already voices report that the duty vaccination would be effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against Pneumokokken culminate.
The pharmaceutical Institute is already implementing the maximum prices of vaccines, the health insurance should pay the price.
The experts are also on the Impfungs procedures in the clear.
The new vaccination
Vaccines free of charge for August children
From January children can be vaccinated against Pneumokokken free of charge on 2 August last year and later were born.
The condition that they have not disturb Impfdosis received.
Anyone with the vaccination in last year, or, in the past has begun, it must also pay weitereWiederholungsimpfung itself.
The first Impfdosis must be made between 3 and 5 living month of the child.
Already last year, a quarter of the families against Pneumokokken vaccinate their children.
The parents paid 1,600 kroner and more for a dose.
For the vaccination of recent children are four doses necessary.
As a whole, the experts estimate that the health insurance for the quantities 300,000 to 450,000 kronor per year.
They save, but in the treatment of the children without vaccination would need.
Until now, the state for all land vaccination of children spent approximately 500,000 per year.
The compulsory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumokokken Mittelohrentzündung, but also cause serious infections including brain skin inflammations and blood poisoning.
By Pneumokokkeninfektionen die with us after investigation in hospitals per year up to 28 children up to the age of 10 years ago.
Outside the Czech Republic, the compulsory vaccination of children against Pneumokokken in about 40 countries.
The vaccination will be duty?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccine could be compulsory in the future.
From January is paid by the insurance and be voluntary.
The compulsory vaccination would be better, mentioned, for example, the head of the citizens Nahlas Association, Kalovsky, Mr Rudolf.
His association already touted in the long run for the Pneumokokken vaccination.
The experts on the international conference at which our group was involved were not very happy that we have voluntary vaccination.
That is not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have succeeded, at least.
I believe that that is the way we must go now, Kalovsky.
The Ministry of Health, but the Impfverfahren against Pneumokokken do not change.
At this moment, we are not at all, said his spokesman Sesen Vlastimil.
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, claim the doctors.
The chairman of the professional society of practical Kinderärzte, Hana Cabrnochova, is that a voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all the children were vaccinated, it could then be on the reduction of reoffending Impfungs number discuss "In a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination as a voluntary was launched," says Cabrnochova, however.
The experts expect that more than 80% of parents against their babies from next year Pneumokokken inoculated.
The vaccination against Pneumokokken ground-breaking is that they should be seen as a first land vaccination of the health insurance is paid by the state and not.
The insurance should spend money for the prevention, in order to save it for further treatment, Cabrnochova make the statement.
The doctors must buy the vaccines themselves.
But it is a concern for the practical Kinderärzte linked to the purchase of vaccinations.
After the original project the vaccines should be bought by the insurance and the doctors them on the same path, as well as other received by the state to them from the vaccines.
Some Members feared, however, that the insurance as "the money from the insurance editor could drive."
That is why the doctors even buy the vaccines and wait until the insurance to pay for them.
According to the estimates the individual practical doctors must invest 40 kroner per month, which is a significant sum.
It will not be easy Cabrnochova says.
And we still
The Islam can be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when the Swiss voters for a ban on building voted for minarets and the concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, a thorough and thoughtful report written about it, whether Muslims in one of the avowedly secular societies can be integrated Europe -- and be integrated.
Some readers will change this new book from admiration for the last work of the author: "Why French love no scarves" (original title: 'Why the French don' t like Headscarves ") (2006), an elegant and densely argumentierenden study of a contentious issue, the country over one and a half decades shared and employed and their effects are still to play.
Bowe recent book offers a more comprehensive and more bold spectrum.
As a good Anthropologe he wants not only to know what the politicians and the media about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the area.
He has months in mosques, schools and institutions, which are now spent 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, Bowen as it is called "Islamic free spaces'.
He is a good listener, it gives debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
There should be a Muslim in a mosque or a Council to marry House (or both)?
Should young Muslims on evolution and gay rights to be wrong?
A Muslim woman to marry a Muslim man?
It is permissible for a Muslim, a soft regulation of banking system in order to use to get a mortgage?
It is this seemingly more down-to-earth matters, he claims, the daily life, in contrast to the political drama, the media.
The author acknowledges a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a well-known names, perhaps with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, born in Switzerland Arabic Muslim scholars and academics.
This new generation tried to open the debate on how it is possible, on the one hand, a good Muslim and, on the other hand, a good citizens in a modern secular society.
They have not all the arguments on their side.
The Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who asked Bowen are often at odds with their Salafi counterpart -- supporters of puristischen Sunni Islam in conjunction with Saudi Arabia -- the today is a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen is of the opinion that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires a give and take on both sides.
It is called into question whether the French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, so passionate the separation of church and state watches) really committed to the pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may have been a harsh treatment as Catholics, Protestants and Jews, which in turn to hear their historic compromise with the secular Republicanism had to make.
He sees something of a 'tightening of the Werteschrauben "as a growing pragmatism.
The Islam can be French? After reading this book, one is inclined to say "yes, but not yet."

Ironically, in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations of the ice on the longest remain.
In his new book "After the ice" (original title "After the ICE") offers Alun Anderson, a former editor of Science magazine "New Scientist," a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a packenden insight into how the future could develop.

Marines were among the 6,000, wreaths laid down in Arlington
The Obergefreite De 'Angello Robinson went seven hours with the bus, around a single wreath at the grave of a soldier, he had never met.
For him and the other marines, the journey from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, the National in Arlington cemetery for under to adorn graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in their footsteps of it.
In a few months, from where we will always be returned, we could be said Robinson on the fallen soldiers.
If we had, I would hope that someone would do the same thing for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning, wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, holder of the manufacturer's funeral wreath Worcester Wreath Company in Har ring tone, Maine, this tradition established in 1992, when he and some others decided, several hundred graves at the cemetery in Arlington to dekorieren.
There is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen to do this trip every year, in various cities along the road to hold events, the people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America (wreaths across America), the event has spread to other states too.
This year, more than 10,000 volunteers laid wreaths on the graves at the cemetery for Arlington in areas at the Pentagon on graves of the National cemetery Fayetteville in Arkansas in Battery Park in New York and at the memory site for the United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation for the second time donated more than 150,000 dollars for purchasing and transportation of wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said that the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, has taken a deceased professional soldier.
While her husband is buried in Arlington, said Hunt, this is its path, which give something back to the sacrifices.
She said that this is a small contribution, and we will be able to support our soldiers and civilians.
It is as if the visit of a family Grabstätte.
Warmer clothes wrapped in bases of the volunteers migrated across vast areas of grass and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers were older graves from the First and Second World Wars and the Vietnam War, since they are not as often as he visited the newer graves, so the organisers.
The mood was cheerfully, children played and couples remained in the hands, while the fresh pine branches on the grey downward pressure on the grave stones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red bow at the upper part was getting.
The section 60 in the vicinity and where mainly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost calm.
The United service organizations applauded 1,000 wreaths at this section to dress up, but the sombre mood of the current wars filled this area.

The U. S. contractors arrested by Cuban authorities.
The Cuban government has a sub-contractor of the US, mobile phones and Notebook computers sold in the country, were arrested, said representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
The contractor, not yet could be identified, working for Development alternative Inc. with headquarters in Bethesda.
The society is working on projects for clients, who, as the US-Behörde for international development and for the World Bank.
Konsularbeamte the interests of the United States in Havana to try to gain access to the prisoner, was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not yet been published after Cuban law, although a Cuban nationals or a foreign visitors for almost everything, under the accusation of "threat" can be arrested.
All the so-called counter-revolutionary activities, the light protests and critical rules, pose a risk to include arrests.
Anti-government graffiti and statements will be viewed as a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community, the popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, the frequently describes how she and her husband pursued and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country for prizes, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor will probably be the tension between the communist government of Castro brother in Cuba and increase the Obama a "slow" approach to improve relations with the island had sought.
The news of the arrest was first Friday night in the New York Times.
The new US policy stresses that the United States will produce a return if the Cuban government to take concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and Notebook in Cuba are legal, even though they are new and coveted products in a country where the average earnings of an Intergovernmental employees $15 per month.
The Cuban government allows ordinary citizens only since this year, the purchase of a mobile phone, but they will be used for the fact of text messages, because a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost a daily wage.
The use of the Internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and in some government departments, such as universities, accessible.
Cubans who want to connect the government, often need to report their names.
Many websites is the access is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American rare.
Most of the few citizens in Cuba is sitting in prison for crimes such as drug smuggling behind bars, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokesman for the interests of representation in Havana.
Berbena said that it could give no further information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity in any other free society - the levy would legally cost of mobile phones in Cuba - is a crime, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, the head of the American section of the group "Human Rights Watch," which recently a harsh report on the freedom in Cuba, with the title of "new Castro," said the same Cuba, an allusion to the investiture by Raul Castro as the leader of the country, the sick older brother Fidel replaced.
Vivanco said that the defendants, very often within a day were arrested, convicted and imprisoned.
He said that any solution would probably be politically, and that the Cuban government is often a negative reaction in the United States, at the very moment when both countries move for more willingness to engage in dialogue with each other.
Pakistani government officials plan to meet men to send to Afghanistan.
The Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday, a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy, aimed at capturing five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan in order to send troops to kill, and said that they hope this case could help an extensive network of terrorist recruiters to uncover the Internet customer after radicalised young men.
Investigators have said that they have an opaque insurgents, known as Saifullah, had sought the men invited to Pakistan after it had tracked them down, because one of them on the Internet video site YouTube favourable comments made to terrorist attacks.
Saifullah after their arrival in Pakistan, the leader of the men and tried to help them, the remote area in Pakistan's Stammesgürtel, the home of Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service, which was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince Al Qaeda leadership said that the men are not part of the CIA conspiracies to infiltration of the terrorist network.
As a result, they were on days in the eastern city of Sargodha, a far cry from the inhospitable mountains in the north-west, which has become a Zufluchtsstätten terrorists.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government officials, due to the sensitivity of the issue, wanted to remain anonymous.
The government officials said that the men were not discouraged and will continue to dissect the right recommendations to obtain access to the Al Qaeda camps, as they received by the Pakistani law enforcement authorities have been arrested.
The case of the five men - which remains in Pakistan are and will be questioned by the FBI unterstreicht - the crucial role of recruiters in the identification of future terrorists and possibly even more important in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the US-Geheimdienst a matter of the utmost urgency, human asset in the space of Al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organisation as guardians, not letting those whose commitment to the holy war not seriously enough, and those who might be spies.
American Möchtegern recruits from A Qaeda went a special examination, said analysts.
Because of their potential access to US objectives and their Propagandawertes but also as they are extremely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, Chief Secretary analysts of Nefa Foundation, with its headquarters in the United States, said that terrorist groups in recent years are much more cautious in this regard, whom they have access to allow for the US secret services are experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to send someone in these groups, what could be better way than the Rekrutierungsmodell to follow, so many already have followed, Kohlmann said.
The model is based is now much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators are calling in Copenhagen climate "Action."
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday and demanded by the negotiators in the city Kongresszentrum Bella more bold action on climate protection.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, whereas the police estimates by roughly 25,000.
The event passed off relatively peacefully, although a handful of masked activists small explosive devices in the vicinity of some government buildings in the inner city burned.
On a day when the United Nations-sponsored Klimaverhandlungen little happened, lost thousands of activists with banners through the city, which in English, "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish, the stated, "The Earth says" enough ".
Some stars joined the protest, for example, the Danish model, the Fotografin Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, the native land of their mother, her realise what the country herzzerreißenden problems as a result of the already perceptible impact of climate change.
This is one of the reasons why I have decided to take on the large march - to use the word to pass and the world leader to appeal to a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
There is no easy task, but they must now be done, and there is no way, beat about the bush.
The police thought the demonstrators on close to get the Bella centre and said that they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either maskiert or Taschenmesser with.
Under Danish law, these actions at demonstrations were banned.
In accordance with a spectator, not to be named because he wanted to be involved in the negotiations on climate change, anonymous demonstrators burned in black clothes several explosive devices in the vicinity of Copenhagen, in the main channels near several ministries.
They cast them in the vicinity of buildings, he said, and added that they began as flares, but only by a handful of large explosions "were followed.
In the interior of the Congress Centre, gathered the people on television screens throughout the afternoon, in order to pursue the demonstration.
But the protest has the awareness of Hauptfunktionäre, like Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator, does not seem to be achieved.
When he was asked whether he thinks that the demonstration of a constructive effect on the international considerations in English, he replied: "That is something I was unaware."
He was continuing in Mandarin and said: "Because the demonstration is a great place, I cannot hear what is happening outside."
He stated that it is from the perspective of the individual on whether the demonstration would help or hurt.
It shows the concentration of broad public and different sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "one can also say that the negotiations or the freedom to disturb other people."
Prüfungsdaten show persistent racial divide
The certificates for mathematics performance last week were welcome good news for the public schools in Washington, D. C.
Although the district of Washington still far behind the schools in the country, the maximum benefits to produce the evidence to show that the fourth and Achtklässler over the past two years faster progress than cities, the Atlanta, Chicago and New York, have made.
But what in the latest figures from the National evaluation of the educational progress (National Assessment of educational Progress - including NAEP) is the stubborn performance gap between African-American and white pupils, both at local and national level.
The average point number of white Viertklässler from Washington, D. C. rose in the last two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), the African-American peer groups, but just three points from 209 to 212.
The output gap rose between 2007 and 2009 in reality by 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African-American Achtklässler remained basically, he fell a statistically negligible point of 245 on 244.
The average score of white pupils was not included in the test data, because the sample size was not big enough.
The picture of a six-year period of time, is not encouraging.
The gap, the white and black Viertklässler fired in 2003, when the first NAEP in this district was covered 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And, while the figure, the children of both groups have achieved during this period, has increased the difference with 58 points now scarcely decreased.
Some educational supporter of last week Distrikts expressed their concern that the results of Schulkanzlerin Michelle A. Rhee and the democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty were celebrated, for the most part of white pupils, the already powerful children, have been driven.
This suggests that the overall appreciation by the treatment of those at the top end of the scale have increased, as problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, board member of D. C. Voice, a nonprofit group for the educational opportunities in Washington, D. C..
I will not for a range of two or three points down, and said the democratic Washington town councillor member, Kwame R. Brown, a daughter in the fourth class of Eaton primary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said that the message of audit point figures is that the middle schools in the city need urgent attention.
Of course we would always see the positive signs, which I respect.
What frightens me, however, is that we are not nearly the time and energy that we would have to commit school for our resources.
Rhee said that the district must continue to find better ways to the needs of the powerful weak pupils.
In this autumn, for instance, some trained teachers, a new reading curriculum, the Wilson reading system, that at the pupils in the upper classes of elementary school and middle school, not the basic skills of reading at the start of their school careers have mastered and significantly behind their peer groups class comrades behind.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum by the nursery until the sixth class games and lifelong real experiences in the foreground was coming under the former senior school inspector Clifford Janey after Washington this curriculum and some of the NAEP progress, the last week were reported.
I believe that we must continue to work on the best measures to allow the pupils benefit under the Federal level, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question whether Rhee can continue to do so, the overall performance of the system to improve and will continue to play the extra money and resources for the powerful weak schools can provide the necessary in order to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, the urban audit examined.
The conventional remedy is its resources and management reforms at the schools, the in the poorest areas of Washington D. C..
The objective could cause political fallout against this important item on the agenda.
The weak point is, of course, as in other urban school inspectors that they tried to get the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we have a system of great schools.
We must strengthen schools in the city neighborhoods, so that all families, irrespective of where they live, you can be sure that their children are an excellent public school education can obtain.
Janey, the school inspector is now in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements on the closure of the output gap is the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, in order to extend to compete with the charter schools.
It must be the school year at nearly 200 days in order to increase the force for change, said Janey with his teachers' union last year to reach an agreement on 185 days per year, which he came as "a milestone" on the way to a major increase in the next treaty.

Graciela Rodriguez, 12, and blinzelt a moment at the sight of white pillars of the brick facades and the smaragdgrünen lawn.
Gracielas parents have hardly been Highschool in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela in silver Spring was recovered and now lives in Riverdale, never set foot in a college campus.
Their attitude and the other Achtklässler the group to explore the Gettysburg, where the teaching costs $38,690 per year, was more a ehrfurchts visit, as an enthusiastic future students.
"Yes, I will soon be here!" Called the Graciela, would like to study medicine as the leader announced that they are now entering the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" She said thoughtfully, as the low professor to student ratio of school reported.
The College in Pennsylvania was the 7th, the children on their three-day Tour visited and now they have the intended message entirely: The question is not whether's College.
The question is, where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States Hispanic immigrants, the Highschool not stopping or as teenagers become pregnant, on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands of the college education that is needed to emerge in the middle class.
In truth is one of five of these "second generation" of Hispanoamerikaner the College -- which is a remarkable achievement, because so many of their parents, though, mainly from Mexico and Central America, in the US, without the Highschool have concluded.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because they are for a generation, which has a huge role in the labor force in the country will play the way forward.
Those who study the powerful children, to say that these often have a natural affinity for school and an inherent drive them for success.
Many of them have parents who give their children to set high targets and to find ways to encourage their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But Beratungsprogramme also play a major role played by Graciela and millions of children as they help to come in college, particularly if these efforts over a long period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents have no experience and skills in the quest for the way to help through the system, it will be a single measure at any time does not solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California at Davis, who hispanoamerikanische students examined.
We need to think about these children for a supportive network of the school by the Highschool available.
The federal programme, which was funded Gracielas College Tour, is a useful example.
It is known as the Gear up - in some hochschalten - and provides more than 300 million dollars per year for local school systems are available to Vorbereitungsprogramme College to launch the begin if low-income students in the middle school and go on until they have completed the Highschool.
In accordance with the US Department of Education, the programme since 1999, more than 10 million pupils, helped by more than 60% in the College.
Iraqi oil ministry includes contracts with foreign oil companies from 10
Despite concerns over violence and political instability, the Iraqi government on Saturday completed auctions in two major oil companies can lead to rebuild his damaged infrastructure.
The 10 contracts with foreign oil companies of the Iraqi oil ministry, suggests that China, Russia, and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry to play for decades by war and economic sanctions is paralyzed.
American companies were simply shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had to participate in the second auction, paid on Friday has begun.
The only company, which has made a requirement has drawn the short straw.
Two American companies have been contracts for versteigerte fields in June.
The thin representatives of American oil multinationals in the opening of the Iraqi oil industry analysts by surprise.
The Iraq has finally after six years of war opened its doors and instead of US Asian and European to give the path, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further bids in Iraq.
Security concerns by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and the political instability were highlighted by the withdrawal of the military's American oil companies have probably been stopped, told analysts, more engaged in Iraq, the third largest proven oil reserves in the world.
Firms were in some cases at a disadvantage because competitors, particularly the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, significantly lower wage costs and more risks, because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies, the contracts with the Ministry managed to complete.
Major US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, with the Iraqi oil ministry and close relations in recent years with technical advice, are empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main actors in two of the paucity of this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has offered contracts for more than any other company and with large packages of contracts for two major fields to go home.
We all know, said the spokesman for the oil ministry, Assam Jihad, that China is on the way, one of the great figures of the global economy and a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company with his fellow bidders can be measured and its obligations will meet with Iraq.
For the requirement levy before the pick of the company, which gave instructions with the fee per barrel of oil were compared, the ministry was prepared to pay the emission of each Felds on the current levels.
Top planner, the Al Qaeda apparently killed in Pakistan.
In an apparent missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan this week is a Top- use planner, Al Qaeda, reported to be killed as representatives of the US Terrorismusbekämpfung on Friday.
This would be, if it would confirm the second deadly attack on a high level of leaders of the terrorist organisation in this autumn.
Saleh al claimed was one of the two Arabs, in accordance with United States sources and Pakistani authorities representatives of the region of a number of missiles to be killed on Tuesday, their vehicle near the town of Miran Shah in the province of North Waziristan met.
Local authorities reported that the missile fired by a type of drones by the CIA in the lawless Stammesgürtel Pakistan is used.
They drove in a white vehicle in the direction of the Afghan border, when the car was taken, said a government representative of a Pakistani civilian intelligence service from Miran Shah by telephone.
Locals suspected of belonging to the militants, ran to the centre and took everything quickly, as the "fully shattered bodies" was left.
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US Terrorismusbekämpfung led an unspecified evidence that claimed the dead.
It was claimed as leading military planners of Al Qaeda, described the operations of terrorist groups outside the region of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was in plots throughout the world, said a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, and on the sensitive nature of the US air strikes on the Pakistani state referred.
If its central role granted, it also included the planning of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He brought strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Qaeda and put them in operational plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American authorities said that claimed quickly in the Al Qaeda's hierarchy and best links with other extremist groups used in the region.
He may not be aware of some Americans, said the second authorities, but this reduces the risk that he is not for us and our allies.
If his death was confirmed, would be claimed the second leading al-Qaeda or Taliban leader who was killed since September, when a similar attack Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area and three other top activists were killed.
The pace of attacks by drones of the CIA since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, one of a nonprofit website, outrageously, by an average of six operations per month to two.
The decline has improved tactics of terrorist groups, which have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability, and at the same time in suspected informers brutally kill, according to the side.
Senior United Nations delegate in Kabul will resign
The leading UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he resign his office in March, which will be a stormy tenure would cease by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN supported the Afghan presidential election has been tarnished.
Eides road outcome, as the Obama has chosen a further 30,000 troops to send to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy has said that he supports the troop increase, but he expressed his concern about the US calendar for the military withdrawal, which is expected to begin in 18 months, other Nato-Regierung may prompt to withdraw its forces.
We need the construction of the Afghan security forces and speed up the right signal to send the Afghans that they can trust of the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be in the long term.
The Norwegian diplomat pushed the United States and other military powers, the number of international civilian workers to increase in the political changeover to help Afghanistan.
The troop increase on the military side needs an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he will not resign his office, but only one in March 2008, his family to grant agreement, only two years in Kabul.
He said that he wanted the notification to UN
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon forward now, so that it was time for a replacement.
What I said, is that it is better to seek a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between the path in my predecessor, and my arrival.
Ban, in accordance with UN officials with the search for a replacement.
The UN officials say that the Swedish Italian Indian Staffan di Mistura, recently led the United Nations mission in Baghdad and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, of the UN has led Friedensoperationen has taken into account.
Eides position in Afghanistan has been put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith had accused him in September, President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has rejected all the allegations, but he also said that the allegations of Galbraith - which was fired, "there is no doubt that the mission have already damaged because a high degree of scepticism about the international interference in the election was".
Eide said that he was the appointment of a senior civilian representative has recommended that the aid measures by the American-led forces in Afghanistan to coordinate their activities.
He also acknowledged that the UN leadership allows his successor, more staff from the United States and other Western countries for the Afghan mission to applaud and said that it would strengthen their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed his disappointment about the restriction of its forces in Afghanistan, and said that the cumbersome UN Einstellungsregelungen have undermined its ability to bring capable people.
The UN rules are so complex that I since May, he said, only one person could stop.
That is disastrous, and cannot be allowed to continue.
Defense Gates: Iran must reckon with additional sanctions.
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon be "significant additional sanctions" imposed on Iran, because it is not in talks on its nuclear plans has participated.
Gates spoke during a 7-tägigen journey through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of approximately 300 soldiers in northern Iraq and played the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran downwards.
In Iran are no good options, he said in response to the question of soldiers on the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things on the soul is, if we have in the past six years have learned something from Iraq, the war Unvorhersagbarkeit own."
The Obama prefers a package of sanctions in recital on the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could affect the Durchschnittsiraner.
He said that a "package of incentives and disincentives" is needed, "in order to convince the Iranian government with nuclear weapons in reality will be less protected because their people," "enormous" under the sanctions will suffer.
On Friday, in a statement from the spokesman for the White House, Robert Gibbs, the American Government of the top European politicians in the warning that Iran, with "credible" consequences if he must reckon with its nuclear programme is not the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes only to be won.
During the talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that he did not want to restrict the talks on its nuclear programme and would resume on an essential part of the state of stocks of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for his medical research reactor would forgo.
The US government has pushed for this type of agreement to build trust between the two parties to build and time for negotiations to win.
Iran does, however, since that time, the negotiations on the interim agreements have to leave -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided about whether they should commit to the United States.
Iran's suspension of the international community in relation to a number of proposals, which they had already agreed in early October, simply, has left, frankly, the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, in a way, as it brought in conjunction with important additional sanctions for Iran has never been, said Gates.
President Obama has 31 Dez. set as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before other options, including the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton called "crippling sanctions", will continue.
In a statement in New York, the Iranian representation at the United Nations, on Thursday condemned what they unfundierte allegations groundless "and" some security councillor of the Iranian nuclear activities called and said that they are ready to put the talks with the United States and five other world powers, "to pursue an appropriate long-term solution."
Gates, the last Friday after Washington should return in the morning, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before he made in the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq's meeting with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish authorities flew representatives in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, in particular in relation to borders, property rights and for the division of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides, the potential for conflict, in order to reduce delays of US-Pläne to prevent the American troops by the end of August by 115 000 at 50,000.
Gates also sought the Kurdish concern about the forthcoming troop withdrawal. The US quoted Gates, Masood Barzani, the president of the Kurdish regional government, said: "We will take your security, your well-being and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you. "
A change of course in the ageing China.
Wang Weijia and her husband, surrounded by propaganda posters, which kept them lecture that "mother earth is too tired to maintain other children" and "A baby is more a grave more."
These lessons, they have learned that, as well as government officials in Shanghai by the low birth rate and the ageing population in this summer, suddenly began to change course and young couples encouraged more than to have a child, her response was immediate and definitive: "In any case".
We already have all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child is nothing, said Wang, 31, a personnel head with a 8-Monate old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, the two generations of notoriously dicklichen, spoiled Einzelkindern, affectionately known as "small emperor", has produced a demographic crisis in the country.
The average birth rate is at 1.8 children per couple, compared to 6 at the time, as these policies in force, like the United Nations
Department for population issues, while the number of the population of 60 years and older by 2020 from 16.7 percent of the population by 2050 to 31.1 per cent rise exponentially. This is much higher than the global average of around 20%.
The imbalance is in rich coastal cities, with educated population, like Shanghai, more.
Last year, 60-Jährige and Senior almost 22 percent of the reported Shanghai residents identified during the birth rate among a child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai Stadtbevölkerungs and family planning Commission has said that couples in the normal reproductive age babies will need to help in the relationship between the ageing population San parts to lower the shortage of manpower to alleviate the future. "
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- though not as rich -- as the industrialised countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual easing
In the country's constitution enshrined in 1978, China's one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial disposal by the ruling Communist Party was introduced until today.
Married couples who oppose this policy, must reckon with huge fines -- up on her triple annual salary in some regions -- and with discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese government representatives have this policy to be attributed to the critical occupation of the country's natural resources could be avoided, whereas human Rechtsvertreter abuses in the enforcement of the policy denounced.
In rural areas, some officials have already pregnant women who were forced to a child abzutreiben.
Many couples also had a gender selective abortion by making an unnatural high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for people gradually weakened its stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they have allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including urban dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and the number of cases in which both husband and wife have been Einzelkinder -- and 2007 has been the tone of many hard slogans curbed.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research at the University of Beijing said that government officials recently discussed even more radical changes, for example, couples to allow two children, in which a Einzelkind partner.
Shanghai was in July for the first Chinese city, an aggressive campaign to promote more birth was launched.
Posters, the family taught, only to have a child almost overnight, have been replaced by directives, which describe in detail for a second child who is challenging and how it can apply the approval.
The city administration has urban employees and volunteers for family planning sent to couples at home and Informationsblätter under the durchzuschieben doors.
They also asked about psychological and financial advice for the available, more than a child.
The response was not encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disappointing response.
Although officials from a rural town in the external areas of Shanghai said that a recovery in the applications from couples to recognize, after the start of the campaign for a second child to notify the urban districts against any change.
In the town of Huinan with a population of 115 000 and still per month, for example, only four or five requests.
Unrequited Shanghai officials say that the 2010 expected number of birth in the city, despite the campaign still around 165,000 will lie -- somewhat higher than in 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committees of the Shanghai Cooperation Caolu community, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want their first to give the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would have liked to have two children, and this is legally permitted.
But they have, as many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance by the government.
Without a social safety net, they say, it would be irresponsible decision.
People in the West, wrongly assessing the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer, his wife in the seventh month is pregnant with their first child.
Yes, one is robbing us the opportunity to have more than a child.
The problem, however, is not simply in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples spend psychological reasons for their reluctance.
Wang, the staff head, said that it would just like a child, because it was a Einzelkind. "We were at the heart of the family and used that each of us has protected.
We are not accustomed to care for others and we want not really. "
Chen Zijian, a 42 years of a translation companies, said it more outspoken.
For parents from the middle class with Doppelkarriere through the birth rate is falling, he said, is about to be successful, and one has to be selfish.
The age group of 20 until 39-year-old today to their parents grew during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment to struggle, and they want to see such a life for themselves in any way, he said.
A single child, he said, is a huge demands on the time of parents.
A mother must do its social life for at least two years.
Then there is the question -- "We must rebuild his home" -- and the life planning -- "If the child is 9 months old, it would already have a bio for the best schools to offer."
Most of his friends are ready, this is a time durchzumachen, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first, which has achieved a higher standard of living, he said.
We do not want to too many sacrifices.
Emission reduction plan for the United Nations' High sketches
Promoted by the UN climate change conference -- until now by wild Poznan and mutual accusations was on Friday -- with the publication of a document, a priority for the next 40 years of an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases, and on the industrial nations in the near future, the greatest burden to bear.
The text of the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases could supply, has experienced both the remaining obstacles, as well as the way forward.
But he was an important step forward in a negotiation, the period since next week, more than 100 leaders from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, which was created by a special working group was formulated silent about the amount of money from the rich countries to poor countries should give short and long term, so that they can deal with the global warming.
He also offers a range of options for the key issues, including how industrial and big emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature should be, the political decision-makers.
The process is a great deal of flexibility, as John Coequyt, senior representatives of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, the six pages of document, has drafted a 180 pages long negotiating text, in the centre, which is the leading climate protection representative of the UN, de Boer, known as "the big picture".
He shows the outline of a possible agreement in the industrialized nations together for their emissions by 2020 by 25% to 45%, compared with the limits of 1990, wanted to reduce their emissions during major developing countries in the same period by 15 to 30% would reduce.
Could together the countries in the emissions by 2050 by 50 to 95%.
The European community has the talks on Friday a boost by their assurance, over the next three years, 3.6 billion dollars per year, in order to help poorer countries to adapt to the effects of climate change - from maestros of floods and droughts by avoiding deforestation.
The Friday, however, expressed the same verbal pyrotechnics, the discussions in the last week had intended.
The American climate Sonderbeauftragte Todd Stern has rejected the binding reductions, the wording of the greenhouse Gasemissionen for industrialized countries, compared with voluntary reductions for major emerging countries, asking if they would not be financed by the industrialized nations.
This train announced that the Obama is a tougher line with China as a representative of the Bush administration, less than two years ago.
The United States will sign an agreement without major emerging countries to stand up and take action star, also appealed that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the cuts by outsiders could be confirmed.
Stern issued an opinion an hour after the declaration of the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei, which meant that the leading American climate Unterhändler either to "mitigate the reason" or "highly irresponsible" of him was that he said earlier in the week that the United States, China is not financially would help to tackle global warming.
The fact that the future economic direction of the major world powers are at stake, both within the industrial nations, as well as between the industrialized nations and emerging countries fissures.
The current fight applies equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to save the planet, with China and the United States for indulging in their respective obligations, while poorer countries argue that the two dozen influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder steps.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers struggle, if the cost of the Bremsung of greenhouse gas emissions should bear, because even affected countries have returned to take aggressive in the countries with very high greenhouse gas levy for their actions to account.
This is a clear example, suggesting a new economic dominance will develop, so Ulate, even as a regional climate change adviser for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries, the effects of climate change are most exposed, said that it will continue at a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen would fight, even though the leading participants to say that the talks in the best case will lead to a political agreement.
The alliance of small island states with 43 members on early Friday morning seitigen 24 presented a draft treaty.
Artur Runge Metzger, the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states' political pressure on the entire political process, "partly because they are now united and action from emerging countries such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that most of the open questions before the arrival of the government leaders must be resolved in order to reach an agreement.
High-level representatives, as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister entstiegen their aircraft and they take rest breaks through the corridors of Bella centers on meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to chart the claims to be negotiated during the next week.
The sheer scale of the assembly -- more than 13,000 people daily in Congress Centre and, gitarrespielende activists hold night shows, where they make a joke about the countries, which they feel betrayed and sell, and contract drafts from hand to hand rather than e-mail -- is already passed a challenge.
The intensity builds just: Almost all of the important ministers are now on Wednesday and 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
We shall proceed to the upper League, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, Vice President for global policy of the organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights.
Britain's first 225 km / h speed train defines the Monday morning feeling new
On Monday morning at 5 p. m., 13 will be a pipe to penetrate the darkness to announce a train up a revolution in transport in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country in its lightning journey from Ashfort, Kent, after London St Pancras 225 km / h and 93 km in 38 minutes.
With Lord Adonis, the transport minister, will then lady Kelly Holmes aboard the first Javelin Pendlerservices from London.
He hopes that the new service Britain finally to an international rail network ankoppeln faster, more reliable trains and the major urban areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland will permit in London.
The neglected province could become vibrant commuter cities, working Anfahrts hours would be radically reduced and the exchange of plane and car on rail if the national carbon missions and reduce congestion on the roads.
In the theory believe the three large parties in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds for the construction of a new national rail network is needed, the inevitable planning battle and fears about environmental damage in the British Hochgeschwindigkeitsgleisen could still apply the brakes.
High speed Two (HS2), a company based in January, the government should present a feasibility study, Lord Adonis, according to the Times the report on 30 December.
This gives a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line, the London with the West Midlands will combine with a margin of five metres in urban areas and in places over, where the impact on the environment are controversial.
In the free site if the plan is the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final stretch.
HS2 is also three options for a larger amount, leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option proposed is a Y-förmige routing, where an individual high-speed line in the West Midlands would lead.
The route would be in or near Birmingham would share a channel and west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another towards the north-east after Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It appears the most effective option," said a rail insider.
After the completion of the travel time would be between London and Edinburgh on 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part of the route, which would be opened before 2025, it would allow the travellers, the route of London Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with just over an hour, to go.
The drafts would offer the advantages of the possibility, with a speed of 400 km / h to drive with the British rail network would be the quickest in Europe.
The first route was planned for 400 metres long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people to be able to travel.
For up to 18 trains per hour could be on the route of London Birmingham in operation.
This in turn would mean that a terminus in London would be needed on the 20,000 passengers per hour could be dealt with.
In the face of the space limitations in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be expanded to include the high-speed network.
Rail experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston this potential.
Lord Adonis will be known whether this plan, in his opinion, should be continued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision until after the parliamentary elections will be taken.
But if he set the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains should begin with the high-speed lines on existing rail routes in the north of Birmingham, making the journey between London and Scotland in more than three hours would be.
This is regarded as a key sticking point, so that a change from the plane on rail can be ensured, a guide for the rail revolution.

An activist, as a protest in Duncan pitch, a hole in the form of a pound mark, after it became known that he talks about three years 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) had demanded.
Last night, when he was asked about the increased mortgage, said Duncan: "That was both the fees Office, as well as following an increase in the value of Legg have been approved."
He added: "There is no debate on fudge and Durchschlängeln or bend the rules, or the like.
Everything is completely transparent and moved strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.

Chad Hummel, legal counsel for the director of the "pianists," has three judges of the Court of Appeal in the second district of California gross errors in the process of negotiating time in 1977.
I call on the spot Straferlass, said M. Hummel, before he added that the behaviour of the timing of the negotiation with the case officer Judge Laurence did band a frightening liess run down. "

Thirty-two years are enough. "

The trend was set up by the publication of better economic indicators than the "have contributed to the market view of the soundness of the recovery of the economy," the analyst loved by Charles Schwab.
In the US, the retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, thus already two consecutive months and far more than expected.

Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Medical Association, gave him as "a man without scruples", the "regularly" before the chamber board will have to account and "anything other than advisable."
After a few days of silence in Dr Stéphane Delajoux on Friday on his lawyer, David Koubbi Me, a statement.
This stated that the intervention would be "perfect" and are fighting operational studies were "normal".
The operation called "no bleeding and therefore requires no Drainage," he added.
In any case, it seems that the tour of the Sängers, whose health problems äufen since last summer, called into question.
It is obvious that it is a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens) is too tight, said Mr Camus.
The party alliance UDF (Union for the French democracy), energetic and urges the party Nouveau Centre, no longer use their Siegel
The party alliance by François Bayrou's party modem is monitored on Friday, has a takeover attempt by the label once by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing formed party, on the part of the chairman of the party Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, reacted angrily and under threat of a judicial persecution, this label asked to use any document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take the UDF Siegel, because he is that François Bayrou is not worthy of this political heritage to defend, after he left the helping hand.
The Defence Minister, whose party is the UMP also wanted this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
The emphasis of his efforts, he had the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now in NC), the right of the property of the brand UDF, because he was the first in 2004 that mark with the Institute National de la propriété industrial "has requested.
However, the business unit of François Bayrou's friends supervised parties Alliance UDF that silence and clearly gave us to understand that they could not expropriate and fixed the ministers and the Members under threat of a judicial persecution of a deadline of this label and no longer use their property rights to transfer the brand.
They have in the past few days, many statements that your political movement would propose to assume the UDF Siegelzu + +, wrote the parties in a coalition of 19 of 24 office members signed a letter, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the party's modem and the Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
They believed well, you have the right to the name of this movement, the centre Nouveau + + + + slogans of today's UDF on their political material and at the start of printed page of your website.
As you know, you have no right to the use of this label, said the secretariat of the UDF and calls for the party NC, "immediately mentioning the name of all the material and UDF (their) website" to remove.
It also demanded by Hervé de Charette, "the property rights of the brand of their legal Anspruchsberechtigen transplant."
If you deny this, we will make a complaint against you, in order to ensure respect for the rule of law and the legitimate rights of the UDF members to defend, warned the undersigned.
In her letter to stress that "UDF" since 1978 and a fully-fledged political movement is a reminder that Morin and his friends "choice" to leave this 2007, in order to create a competing movement, as others have done in 2002, the party "UMP".
The party Nouveau centre, therefore, according to the undersigned, no rights, the UDF Siegel (Union pour la démocratie française).
They continue to remind you that the last congress of the UDF 2007 three-year entry into the party modem and the creation of a secretariat to defend "the material and moral interests" of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing formed movement, has adopted.
What Hervé de Charette, so does the secretariat, "he was at a time when he has requested the brand name for three years, member of the UDF," but the UMP.
He has benefited on scandalous and fraudulent way, by the absence of the deposit of the acronym UDF to carry this for themselves.
You still have to bear in mind that this recklessness is well on its way to turn into a criminal offence, and ironisieren the strategy of NC: "It appears to us, but in the policy, as well as in life würdevoller themselves to make a name, instead of trying to come from the anonymity, by relying on fraudulent way takes a name, it has no legal claims."
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François Marie Banier will be condemned for exploitation of weakness
The Court of Nanterre has decided on Friday, the artist François Marie Banier to judge in order to determine whether he, like the daughter of Milliardärin Liliane Bettencourt claimed that a weak moment of 80-year-old has exploited in order to secure a portion of their assets.

This decision means that there is a process in this case, the saga will be one of the richest families in France is worthy of mother and daughter fetzen and at the same time, the reins of Kosmetikimperiums L'Oréal in their own hands.
However, as well as the 15 Criminal Court ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, jointly by three doctors will be carried out.
The heir and Hauptaktionärin of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially among, during the investigation of the Nanterre Prosecutor before conditions.
The doctors are appointed on Friday before the 10th March 2010 to present a report, in which you clearly indicate whether and to what Liliane Bettencourt times in a state of weakness can be found.
I think that they will undergo these investigations.
I will speak with her, said the lawyer by Mrs Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, after the trial.
As far as the lawyer by Françoise Bettencourt Meyer, Me Olivier Metzner, he is with the decision of the Court very satisfied.
This is an excellent news (...). The opinion will prove that he (Banier) this old lady has manipulated the need to protect one, he confirmed.
Over the past two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt a criminal complaint against François Marie Banier, photographer and All Round artists, and accuses him of the weakness of its mother years have exploited for grants, out of a total of one billion euros, in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings to secure.
In Liliane Bettencourt had always refuted by the photographers to be manipulated by them as a long-time friend.
Although the Court the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt Meyer launched, the complaint should examine Plaidoyers lawyers on Friday led to a large Familiendebakel.
The lawyer by Liliane Bettencourt on three of his Klientin in their solicitor sent letters (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that the husband of Françoise Bettencourt Meyer distrusted.

Since she married Françoise, I have never been able to speak more.
The Prosecutor of Nanterre is, once again, the view that the plaintiff had no right to react, especially because a protector of on-call judge in recent days has rejected their request, a judicial protection proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully capable of the rule of law is not under protection and has no previous mouths.
No one has the right to act on their behalf, "reaffirmed the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie Christine Daubigney.
The court has now decided to make a judgment after the process on the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt Meyer has taken place.
Managers revolution or the end of the Strategic early education?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the large French companies, our fight for the development of the economic intelligence in vain...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of major companies in terms of its staff, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution: It is for the staff to join the best "values", as it was on the Consumer products made by the technicians in the station.
By the customers in the heart of the companies, the marketing revolution of the strategies of the conquest of the markets have been in place... although the authoritarian temptation products separately factors preferences of the customers to impose regularly again!
A demobilisation of staff can lead to a deadly demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much larger phenomenon, notably the employees affected.
This demobilisation is having a negative effect on the development of all intellectual functions of the company, especially on those of R & Eund, which is even more crucial to those of the economic intelligence.
In fact, asks the IU (Intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) "from all parties (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it claims by the staff a use of the instructions from the authoritarian management completely contradict each other.
Why we are calling for an occupational revolution, which would consist of the staff in denMittelpunkt the concerns of the company on an equal footing with customers.
The very conditional benefits of internal polls
The internal polls, as the questionnaire, the Orange has put his salary beneficiaries of this revolution in relation to stimulate the management practice?
I fear, unfortunately not.
- First, because I notice that the entire structure in the face of a new situation after many roundabout at the end of the day, it is concerned primarily to do... what it has always done.
Because the authoritarianism, one of the pathologies, the balance of power in proportion to the importance of his own failures.
And finally, because most of the leaders of a much simpler idea of human behaviour.
Emerged from the large Ingenieurschulen is their interpretation of the psychology of mechanistic.
They play by intellectual comfort the old behavioristische theory, which recently by the American neuroscience progresses, "he said," and unwittingly far-reaching research institutes and was spread by the media.
And therefore it suggests that it is possible that the "leverage" (sic) on the commitment of employees, encouraged to engage in a aktuellein Le Figaro.fr seemed the survey of ipsos executives in a position on a mechanistic control system for the world of today is inappropriate.
The mobilisation to identify factors measure.
Instead, one for the smooth functioning of the modern companies need to corporate revolution of the adoption of a final view of human behavior.
It is, in any thought or practice of management to integrate a fundamental protocol: For wage earners is the commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly seems as a means of a portion of their dreams, their ambition and their projects.
The studies are currently only from the multifunctional analysis of this idea of the motivation of the staff.
These studies have shown that their company on the basis of a prescribed Doxa judge them by their wahrgenommenes picture of the company, to decide what it allows them to achieve their Lebensziele offers.
Thanks to the identification and measuring the mobilisation factors are the leaders of the companies for their "social performance" control and predict wegnehmen and their human resource management back to the right place.
So they create fertile ground for the harmonious development of a robust and effective economic intelligence is favourable.
The Oslo speech: "Just war" Obama praise from the right a
The American rights by Barack Obama on Friday on the eve in Oslo, crafted speech welcomes and was satisfied that the Peace Nobel Prize 2009, the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States has defended.
The Conservatives, the allocation of the prize to Obama on 9 October had mocked, applauded this time of the speech by the president, the example of the former Vizepräsidentschafts candidate in the 2008 elections following Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin said, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the newspaper USA Today and added that they themselves the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war in ihrensoeben published memoirs have raised.
The war is, of course, the last, of which I think that the Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We must stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, the two wars from his predecessor, George W. Bush inherited the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, on Thursday in Oslo, the use of violence to justify a way; his Entscheidungvon nine days to explain 30,000 extra troops to send to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, took the view that the Präsdent in Oslo "very good work".
I found that the speech was really very good, glad cajoled the former president of the House of Representatives, particularly the reference to "the existence of the evil in the world," in the words of Obama's acknowledged.
In some parts of habeich this speech entirely perceived as historic Ginrich said in the radio program "The Takeaway" was consulted.
The previous Members by some as a potential candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012 will be considered, said he was pleased a "president of the left" saw the members of the Nobel Committee reminded that they were "not free and a price for peace could not hand if the use of violence would not exist."
For Michael Gerson, a former scribe of George W. Bush and now editor in the Washington Post, Obama has a "very American speech".
In addition that he represents a "Kosmopolit '', as he always does," he has spoken, "as an American president", as he pointed out that the Europeans, "as in a security bubble, which they created for themselves and for their protection they do not do a lot," Gerson.
Among the few, not convinced rights, the former's UN ambassador, John Bolton, a hawk the Bush era, the speech on the website of National Review Online as "boring, highfalutin and no inspiration."
On the left of the president of the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich worried, as Barack Obama resorting to defend the armed forces.
If the war packaged under the guise of justice, the massacre of the innocents, quite simply, justify, he warns.
The press of moderate left, however, remains a praise on the side of the president.
The Los Angeles Times still believes that the premature Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama's speech, called for a speaker like him for his talent is known as the "Monumental work."
The speech in Oslo "offers a running plan for the management of international decisions against the conflicts, poverty and oppression," the Californian newspaper enthusiastic.
The New York Times believes that Obama "the necessary discourse," and his speech described as "grim and exemplary" at the same time.
Long-distance drivers: Three marathon for an agreement that ensures the supply at Christmas.
After a three-week negotiating marathon, the trade unions in the streets of Association and the TLF - the only employers' organisation remained until the end, on Friday evening to reach an agreement, the strike warrant and the threat of a serious supply bottleneck at Christmas to an end.
In the signing session on Friday evening "welcomed" for the transportation of competent State Secretary Dominique Bussereau, the agreement on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiation was launched.
After a second negotiating night divided the Verhandelnden on early Friday morning in the hope that the agreement on late morning to sign quickly.
Despite the fact that the three employer associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had brought the meeting to leave.
But it has taken more than six hours from the start of the meeting at 11:00 a. m. until the conclusion of the agreement, and only about 18:00 p. m., the agreement was signed.
The conflict was "very much harm companies" and "it was feared that the holidays at the end of the year would affect," Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wages (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages to rise from 8.72 euro on 9.06 euros.
"It is not very much, but we are only once small", as Mr Clos (FO).
The activists are now dependent on the supply centres, no longer to block it.
"There will always be some recalcitrant, it is likely that are not satisfied with the agreement," he added.
The TLF Chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was difficult, "this wage increases in the face of international competition offering."
According to him, the increase in 170 euros a month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wages.
"This agreement is based on the common sense and respect for the employees," maxim Dumont (CFDT), whereas Thierry Douine (CFTC) of a "historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke on this matter, "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for an increase of travel costs by 3%, as well as the right attitude of the overall budget for the road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow it, in particular, the issue of 13 monthly salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the sinking of the burden on the employer in EUR 100 million" subject for an amendment by the government on the bill finances for 2009 was corrected in the night of the Thursday on Friday by the National Assembly passed.
The government calls for a "identical" vote by the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows that the agreement for the first on this organisation affiliated companies, and then in the event of an extension through the labour minister for the entire profession.
This is "in a short space of time" of the case, Bussereau assured.
The opposition of the employer associations can only delay the process.
The federation FNTR lambasted a "fraudulent trade", because the 100 million euros "were the sector to compensate for a part of the carbon tax has already been promised.
The Secretary of State for transportation forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but the goose in the forthcoming Christmas Esser not disgruntling, laments the Unostra.
For the association Otre threatens the agreement "small and medium-sized companies in the sector in the next 12 months to digging a big grave."
Line RER A: Disruptions this weekend, trade unions, with the proposals in the RATP unhappy
The disruptions in the RER A, the largest rapid network in France for the Greater Paris and the île de France, resisted over the weekend, during a meeting on Friday, 2 strike between the unions and the leadership of the RATP Paris passenger transport management (Independent), the strikers with their demands for wage increments to wait.
On this important shopping weekend before Christmas busloads of between 10:00 and 20:00 p. m. no trains. On the central route (between La defence and nation) was just one of the two trains and outside the central route is just one of the four trains ready.
The end of the features of the SNCF was suspended in Préfecture Nanterre, which forced the passengers on flights.
The shopping arcade chain Lafayette gallery every day counts more than 200,000 customers, welcomed the fact that "the RATP trying to peg the big business transport technically."
The RER A line runs through the Paris metropolitan area from West to East.
The section of the RATP connects the sites, Saint Germain en Laye and Nanterre, as well as Boissy Saint Léger and Marne La there.
On Friday wrong about one of the two trains on the rush hour period on schedule, and almost none during the transport poor time.
As Thursday there was no human racket on the platforms, because the inhabitants of the île de France on the situation had stopped.
So early in the morning, the depot of Saint Germain en Laye (Yvelines) was far less run over than usual, particularly because of the lack of high school graduates.
In Boissy Saint Léger (Val de Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineers (29), he would need "one and a half hours before rebelled on time, to get to work."
The SNCF, the assistance of travellers by officials and police forces had planned, pointed out that the depot Saint Lazare had come to no shortages.
The SNCF on the line RER A or in the direction of Cergy Le skin needs the trains came and went on the depot Saint Lazare, at the end of the Metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, once again, the main meetings took place during the strikers, the results have been reviewed the associations after the meeting with the leadership on Friday afternoon were classified as "poor".
The RER business leaders proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for the RER A in all relevant aspects, working hours, professional careers, etc.
But that is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud) they demand a long-overdue pay contract.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP Lohnzuschlags their own proposals in brackets and stressed that the leadership "is unable to resolve a problem during this in the case of long-distance lorry drivers and the SNCF but also possible."
The RATP made it clear that a renewed meeting to "comprehensive examination of the working conditions," was scheduled for Monday.
This shows the associations, too, that the company 'weekly final drivers ignored. "
On the morning of around 150 drivers sought the establishment of a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leadership that hitherto rejected any discussion during the strike, and a meeting to defuse the situation close.
On Tuesday threatened the conflict, after a preliminary announcement of Unsa and Indépendants RER B auzuweiten on the line.
The associations are calling for a wage premium of 120 (Unsa) until EUR 150, 30 of which modulated euros (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). In addition, they complain that the deterioration of working conditions on this stretch of millions of passengers travelling on the day.

Turkish constitutional court resolves pro- Kurdish party on decision, with serious consequences.
The Turkish constitutional court on Friday was the dissolution of the pro-Kurdish main party in the country known; a decision on the immediate angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country, and in Istanbul.
This decision is the work of the government to make enormous efforts, the Kurdish community to stretch out a hand in order for the past 25 years of conflict to an end.
The "party for a democratic society" (DTP) was dissolved because they had become "site for activities for the independence of the state and its indivisible unity detrimental," as the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision to the press.
According to Kiliç is the decision getroffenworden unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes would have been required to impose the dissolution. Moreover, he pointed out that 37 of the leaders of the party, including the chairman Ahmet Türk and the parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, for the duration of five years have been excluded from the political scene.
In addition, the judge announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity, and enjoy the Türk Tugluk, as well as the seizure of goods of the party.
The DTP now has 21 seats in the Parliament (550).
The Parteiführenden spoke before the verdict that the Members of Parliament would leave rather than party of parliamentarians to meet.
The decision followed a year in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish Bundesgerichtes Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya operational procedures. He accused the DTP, the "instructions" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), followed by Ankara and many other countries will be seen as a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party assured us that "no link" to the PKK, but refuses to describe it as a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The verdict of the Constitutional Court funkt the government in the interim, which seeks to accommodate the Kurdish community and a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds to propose the support of the PKK by the Kurdish dry and an end to the conflict.
The leader of the DTP to confirm that a solution to a resurgence of tension in south-east could lead to Anatolia where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan in the last few weeks on clashes with the police.
Since the announcement of the Court gathered thousands of demonstrators outside the premises of the DTP in the millions of city of Diyarbakir in the south-east, mostly populated by Kurds.
The forces of law and order, tear gas grenades and Wasserwerfer, than the demonstrators began, Molotov cocktails and stones.
Also hundreds of people marched in Istanbul.
After the verdict was motivated by the assumption that the decision of the Court "despair" will continue to widen.
"Turkey this (Kurdish, editors that editors) question is not on the basis of the ban to clarify a party," he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, he regretted the decision.
"We oppose as a matter of principle against the closure of the parties.
That does not solve the problems, "Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a Torpedierung democratic opening, which has been promoted by the government," according to the political market observers Ahmet island.
"It can be clearly taken on a reaction from the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday noted the PKK to an attack on the three days before seven soldiers in the north of Turkey died. It was one of the most brutal attacks over the past few months.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered secret city, for Western visitors inaccessible.
Selenograd, one of ten counties in the main city of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union, a tough location for secret defence research.
Today, the town hall with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the Moscow centre, as "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and weapon-making capabilities for micro- and nano electronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives Selenograds contacts with the Frankfurt Science location - Riedberg linked with the university institutes and the firms of Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There have been several mutual visits and on Wednesday now Selenograd Riedberg in Frankfurt and signed a protocol for closer cooperation. "
The Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Rosljak and prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation in Frankfurt, wrote Planungsdezernent Edwin Black.
2010 there will be a representative of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises in the scientific Foschungsschwerpunkts for a seminar after Selenograd travel.
Scientific exchange of
It is a continuous scientific exchanges.
But it is also about economic relations.
The FIZ will enable firms on the growing Russian market.
Vice versa want Russian science firms contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutions and companies.
For example, these include the Moscow Institute for electron technology, the big corporations and Rosssijskaja Sitronics Elektronika.
The municipality in 1958, was a so-called "socialist plan city" for the defence research has been established.
Selenograd (literally translated Grünstadt '') received its name from the forested hill landscape, in which the research facilities are embedded.
Brake Stuttgart,
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 is not set high enough.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply "the new heart of Europe".
Right. S21 is much more than the deep loss of a train station, more than a monströses construction project, the City of Baden-Württemberg country Capital for a decade ago in utter chaos construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 is from the spirit of the 1980s.
Head, the station with tracks in the middle of the city, applied to end at the time as a transport technical fossils of the 19th century, the Bremsklötze as a modern rail transport appeared, as it was once a lot of time, locomotives needed by the back umzuspannen forward.
Profit levels, briefly, go on - such as ´ s.
And that is why the head station disappear: In Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: A transit welfare depot, around at the half-way point of the trans-European rail main route between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - hence the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 will now be tackled really, even though the vision of the 1980s no longer compatible with the reality of the situation.
Even very ambitious planners have realised that he and the Bavarian city is almost unaffordable to implement the deep loss.
Head station, however, no import and welfare problem since the turn of more modern trains with driving vehicles and tax cars at both ends.
However, as well as the Stuttgart 21 ICE construction line after Ulm will now be addressed.
Regional and local politicians have it.
With the railways, partly because the risks of major infrastructure of the Republic of the individual taxpayers and not the state corporation.
Urban housing, the project is still reasonably justified.
It creates new urban area, which, if we are to believe the computergenerierten graphics of the planners - will be equipped with a great deal of Green.
For the transport system S21 rail is harmful.
The transit depot and the route expansion are intended for the movement of the 1980s - typically, brought huge growth.
At the time, there were not the competition from low-cost carriers.
Modern transport policy, but it must first try to strengthen the goods, because the transportation on the rail is considerably more environmentally friendly than by lorries on the road.
But the building line is not due to intense hills for freight trains.
Much worse is that many other Bahnprojekte S21 indirectly affected.
More than six billion euros in Schwäbischen are buried.
That is the official figure.
Experts believe 10 to 15 billion for realistic.
It is clear that in the next decade will be the money to other hubs and Engstellen in the network.
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the Transport Ministry.
One of the most important is the extension of the good 180 kilometres long route across the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, the route in time Lupen pace.
There is an urgent need to be right here on the Tube.
But S21 will act as a brake.
The Rheintal route will become a bottle neck for the international freight transport: In the middle of the heart of Europe.
Government verdict on the Airport is
The provincial government in Wiesbaden Landtag left open whether it against the judgment of the administrative Gerichtshofs (he VGH) on the night ban in review will go.
The CDU / FDP coalition have experts at more than 400 pages, the VGH judgment legally to verify the economy minister said Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel on these days in writing on the grounds that the country in the case of the construction of the planned North West runway at Frankfurt airport to regulate the ban on night flights.

The coalition must decide until 4 January, whether they are directed against the verdict in revision.
The opposition criticized this postponement and permeated the representatives of the government, on a review of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD group leader Torsten Schäfer Gümbel called for the CDU and the FDP to come back to their before the election promises to return a night ban; otherwise, this is a "breach".
It is hellishly difficult if you must keep its word, said Greens leader Tarek Al Wazir in an allusion to the FDP election slogan "We consider word."
Minister Posch rejected the accusation by Gümbel Schäfer, the provincial government is trying to "Rechtsverdreherei and sleight of hand," but still on their night flights.
A precise legal review needed their time.
The coalition did not want to be on the basis of a "quick first impression."
We need a legal certainty Entscheiung, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As they constituted the opposition, are the statements of his group was never on the night ban.
Banks pay back aid
The crisis-ridden US scratching their state shackles.
The Bank of America on Wednesday, the aid from the banking rescue funds TARP, amounting to a total of 45 billion dollars (over 30 billion euros) on a proposal to repay.
And the Citigroup plans after a report by the US channel CNBC to repay the state aid.

The money house, at the height of the financial crisis with the takeover of the investment bank Merrill Lynch verhoben.
The Citigroup wants to free from their liabilities vis-à-vis the state also money on capital market.

Fast election
It was then everything but faster than thought.
Barely two weeks after the ZDF Board of the current editor-in-chief of Santa Claus Brender from the office had forced the station can present a successor.

Two weeks ago, Schacht with his proposal, the treaty with Nicholas Brender for another five years, on the administrative board failed.
Only seven members spoke for Brender, seven voted against him. Brenders dismissal was a heavy defeat for Schacht, a erwart conspicuous, however.
Because the European majority in the Administrative Council has already signaled weeks before the election, Brender not want to confirm in office.
Had organised the resistance against the editor-in-chief of the Hessischen Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument, Brender under the news broadcasts of ZDF lost in ratings, has refused to accept another term of the highly-regarded chief Redakteurs.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests, in which the political influence on the ZDF was castigated.
Last 35 Staatsrechtler had interfered in the debate, the approach to admit chefs as unconstitutional.
Nothing came of it.
The person.
Peter Frey on 4 August 1957 was born in Bing.
He was an undergraduate education policy, and Romanistik.
Then he worked in the Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 moved on ZDF Frey, first of all, the Journal "today.
Subsequent stations: 1988 until 1990, head of the personal officer Redakteurs; 1991 / 92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 heads and moderator of "morning magazine"; until 2001, head of the ZDF foreign policy; since the head of Hauptstadtstudios ZDF.

A withdrawal of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of ZDF, but also Beck.
Brenders prospective successor Peter Frey had the board with a wise move, he recommended by the body immediately after the Brender strongly criticised dismissal.

Study will entrümpelt
Part of success for the students: After a year of educational strikes drew the countries at the end of the Culture on Thursday: At a meeting of Culture Ministers and Hochschulrektoren conference, both sides agreed to the studies to improve conditions for Bachelor and master.
The students in the future should be able to handle their studies.
In detail, they agreed to reduce the audit burdens: In principle, each studies module only with a single examination.
In addition to the workload of students reviewed and "a realistic and acceptable level" to be guaranteed.
Politics and universities also want the recognition of audit services between universities, both inside and outside Germany.
The countries pledged to common structural targets for Bachelor and Masters more flexible.
Different countries arrangements, it should not be beyond.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, Education and uniform vice-chancellors are the saying of better Studierbarkeit in the mouth.
Now, it was the first time with a specific content.
The so-called accreditation Council decided to limit the number of tests partly to drastically reduce rule: "Every module in the rule, with only a review", it says in a 30 pages of paper, the authorisation of courses in part to regulate anew.
With the "significant reduction of the audit burden," said the Akkreditierungsrat chairman Reinhold Grimm, a "trend should be stopped, the Studierbarkeit significantly disrupted."
In addition to the "Studierbarkeit" from now on "the decisive criterion" in the design.
Modules as content are "rigorously checking whether" unnecessary "constricting the students in the choice of
Events would prevent ".
The students' claim to have room for manoeuvre to preserve and promote the own initiative. "
Apply the rules in the approval of new, but also in the review of existing courses.
This must all five years' reakkreditiert "-- which means that it lasts until 2015, until all the studies have been reviewed.
At national level are responsible for ten accreditation agencies, which was set up by the countries of the Council of accreditation.
The culture minister had the countries in October "forcefully" asked the agencies to make sure that the material wealth is not too big and the audit regime is not too strict.
In individual Länder, universities and colleges with the Landesministerien already agreed to take appropriate measures.
Than before, the only country said this Rhineland-Palatinate for the development of the Bologna Process additional funds.
The money from the universities, especially Tutorenprogramme and studies advice and review and Auslandsämter strengthened.
Country and universities want to spend tens of millions of euros.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants a revision of the High Schulgesetzes into Parliament.
This is for the conclusion of a study model only a single audit will be needed.
The study design should be flexible, also is the recognition of performance certificates in other universities and guaranteed access to the master will make it easier.
Until the end of next year everything studies of the country on their Studierbarkeit should be reviewed.
The government and the opposition had once again on Thursday on the studies conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, though, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Bureau of Juso Hochschulgruppen called the shape of education policy in the future should no longer be "behind closed doors" of ministers and high school vice-chancellors are held.
After the educational strikes should now also affected the students as "a word with talk."
The future academic support received by the president of the Hochschulrektorenkonferenz (HRK), Margaret winter cover: "We need the experience of the students," she said Thursday at a meeting with the Culture, with which the HRK on a common reform paper.
The union education and science (GEW), a total of the Bonn agreement does not go far enough: They are asking for a legal claim, each graduates with a Bachelor-Abschlüsse access to a secondary effect, Masters Course.
The other countries must ensure that for today's generation of Bachelor students tomorrow enough Masters jobs with the best possible conditions of studies available, so GEW Vorstandsmitglied Andreas cellar.
The countries must stop considerably more lecturers.
A freer access to the master detailed the culture minister, however, does not.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Appeal in Germany and is nice almost no control... "is the first line of Gedichts of the pie in the sky Söllner Werner, in which the troubling language snatches the arrival experience of dissidents, won the freedom, but at the same time has lost its language area.
The 1951 was born in the Romanian Banat Söllner Werner was first as German and English teachers in Bucharest and later than reading in a child Buchverlag worked in 1982, before he moved to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner has been awarded with various prize in 1993, he was the legendary Poetikvorlesungen at the Goethe University in Frankfurt, and since 2002, it is the head of the Hessischen Literaturforums in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
For außerliterarisches considerable attention he ensured last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, "German literature in Romania in the mirror and Zerrspiegel their Securitateakten".
Visibly confused and embarrassed Söllner read a statement in which he rumänien German writers colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his fellow work as the for the Romanian Securitate secret service.
Together with some of the present Söllner in 1989, the German language price.
The recruitment attempts have started surreptitiously, first in 1971.
I am Söllner concluded, "anyone against intimidation of the Securitate not enough."
The lyricist Söllner Werner is in the Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize tribute to Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary battle with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and, in particular, the community of hail from Romania, German authors shaken by a case of the throes and the decline robes of a political system, which is displayed on monitoring and spying is based.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say so far of knowledge, not only offenders, but also victims.
In his Securitate acts have played a role in Walter, said after the confession Söllners literature scientist Michael Markel for him and pointed to the positive influence of the Walter.
He heard him in all for him herausgehauen "sensitive points," Markel.
It is a moral need to make this comment.
Söllners declaration was in the form and unexpectedly before this audience, as a complete surprise is the commitment of former dissidents and its cooperation with the Romanian secret service.
Germany is a gemütliches reserve for Securitate agents had already been Herta Müller in July, written in the time after their own acts, 914 sides had read.
The interested parties, so we must be suspect, and speculation in some case may well have known the plain name behind the deck name Sorin, Voicu and also masked Walter.
Unlike the intensified since very verfahrenssicheren sighting of the Stasi files is dealing with the legacy of the Securitate monitoring still very diffuse.
A systematic Enlightenment is in the past few years has been hampered and thwarted.
A Birthler authority of National Council for processing the Securitate files (CNSAS) was first set up in 1999, the publishing of the files was slow, but since then.
Only since 2005, there is a law that regulates the management of the acts.
The influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very much documented after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller an interview, in which a former Securitate chief Temesvar dismissive about the Prize laureate.
They have a psychosis, finally, they have only once interrogated.
The scandal of power said quite openly here in the shape of the freedom of expression.
Of course in the case of Söllner link, as so often in connection with the need to blame inevitable questions.
Why only now? Who has damaged the measured response? Zuhörenden on the Söllners commitment gives hope that the continuation of this chapter of the urge for knowledge rather than blame and shame will be determined.
To recover the site of Herta Müller, who has received the Nobel Peace Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
For situation currently Champions League
It felt as if as a smart Außendienstler clothed by a very nice Christmas celebration, a sports articles Goodies manufacturers had distributed, as the new VfB coach Christian Gross in conjunction with an orange intelligence about a quarter of an hour of equipment after midnight in a month, rose ¨ about C-class tyres.
The man with the enormous Glatze because he was still outside chauffieren city.
Otherwise he would have been able to drive themselves - alcohol was not in the game, and bes openly before happiness was the 55-Jährigen as little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow is the work.
Or only right.
In the words of the first three days before Schweizers committed: "We have the respect," Tel final achieved in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1-Erfolgs against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be blinded by the success: It will be a brutally tough fight against the decline."
The "much more important task" on Sunday.
Then it is in Mainz, the royal class performance in the League to repeat of everyday life.
And well again exposed weaknesses in the aftermath of the rapid three gates by Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
The slogan
The respect Tel final leg of the Champions League (Hinspiele 16 / 17 + 23 / 24 February / Rückspiele 9 / 10 + 16 / 17 March) will take place on 18 December in Nyon are chosen by lots as scrutineers.
The joy at the start of the Babbel successor remained so decisively so.
Not only with the supposed saviours of the uncertain Stuttgart professionals in the short time self-confidence, dedication and game gives joy.
I have received the players and I have told them that they are on their strengths, and she was obliged to be bolder, Seelenklempner Gross said just fine recipe for success, but under the therapeutic Babbel had ceased to have any effect.
He has sparked a certain magic, Jens Lehmann Babbel supporters, "if the football is a new impetus, sometimes things happen, you would not have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, after weeks of injury break, thanks to its dynamism straight to the best players in the workplace, has tried this self-same "phenomenon" with the proverbial "wind" and the workings of the new superiors: "He is a man who demands and discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation. "
Under Babbel had it been obvious.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet out of the woods, warns sport Horst Heldt Board
The VfB Stuttgart needs but, above all, constancy.
Like herding Gross, players and managers, the victory against a replacement weakened and jams in defence of the Romanian guests should be careful.
They have also won in Glasgow before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the bad awakening, Khedira has come to bear in mind.
And Sport Board Horst Heldt reminded that, although a season, the other aim has been achieved, but is still far off.
We are not yet on the mountain.
That Heldt in his 40th birthday, even after the first home victory over the past three months after celebrating was general was the fault of the events of the weekend, in the form of the game immediately before the start of television interviews of door guardians of Jens Lehmann fresh lived.
There are decisions that affect others, and not the Jens, Heldt Lehmanns countered the harsh criticism.
Had the bureau accused of weakness shown and the change of coach under pressure pubertierender fans have decided.
Even his free day after games had been withdrawn, wertete Lehmann as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and resentment.
Lehmanns statements were "of pure egotism," keilte Heldt, vowing consequences for the final man.
They are no friends for life, the two forty years.
But, after all, they were with all the other agreed that without the preparatory work was replaced by the team trainer teaching and forceful strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large proportion of the success," said Heldt in unison and Lehmann - and the man with the plastic bag agreed.
The World Cup in the emphasis Fight
Heated duel in Bern: Always provoked challenger Kevin Johnson world champion Vitaly Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after 12 hard rounds of Ukrainians defended his Schwergewichts title after version of the WBC.
The verdict of the judges unanimously fell.
Hamburg - Vitaly Klitschko remains boxing world champion in the emphasis.
The 38-year champion after version of the Association of WBC defeated in the middle of the night in Bern on Saturday, the American Kevin Johnson unanimous points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko, it was the third successful title defence after his comeback in October 2008.
Before the Ukrainians was twice world champion of the associations, WBO and WBC.
It has unfortunately with the con, all expected, not worked.
Klitschko built his record on 39 victories in 41 professional fights, twice he had to surrender on the basis of violations.
Challenger Johnson had 24 fight in the first defeat.
Some 17,000 viewers in the Berne arena 2.02 metres of great Klitschko wanted to take the fight, especially with his left hand to dictate leadership.
The 11 centimetres smaller Johnson before the duel at the end of the Klitschko era, but announced away to keep the proposals of the world champion Klitschko, so that its dangerous rights could bring crucial objective.
A total of passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and sought only on the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his proposals met the world champion but rarely.
He is, after all, only the second Boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, with Klitschko on the full distance of twelve rounds.
The challengers before the fight in the Swiss capital for some turmoil.
He offended Klitschko as "ugly zombie", the "nothing right".
The cradles left the champion then on Friday to provoke a Johnson solar glasses of the nose at hand, "to be able to see his eyes."
The fourth after Klitschkos comeback victory.
Klitschko remained in his fourth fight after his comeback victorious on 11 October 2008.
After nearly four years of the time he had at that time, the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, beaten and "his" WBC belt recovered, he had previously made without a fight.
In this year, he then defeated in his Titelverteidigungen Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba in September and Chris Arreola from the United States.
I voted in this fight only a proposal pie, and I am physically very well in the form, Klitschko had the rapid return in the ring.
His dream, but the unification of all four major title in the family.
Brother Vladimir is a world champion of the associations, WBO and IBF.
The belt of the WBA but the Briton David Haye after this in November Walujew Nikolai to dethrone 2.13 metres.
In the summer of a Haye had previously planned for next September fight against Vitaly Klitschko cancelled.
Supposedly planning its promotion society now in the fight against Klitschko Wembleystadion in London.
Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: Grünen- group leader, Jürgen Trittin, Defense Minister Guttenberg for false information on the Kunduz affair as a liar.
SPD and left by the Chancellor demand Enlightenment.
Hamburg / Berlin - After the recent findings on air attack from Kunduz, the opposition, Defense Minister Karl Theodor on Guttenberg (CSU) a deliberate deception.
The minister for the deadly bombing on two fuel lorries from September "knowingly" said the falsehood, said Grünen- group leader, Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the German ARD news broadcast television news' '.
It is called the widely: He lied.
The warrant for the killing is beneath contempt for the rules of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) has been granted.
That is the substance of the report, the NATO had read Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Friday was revealed that the attack is not just a question of the destruction of the abducted vices, but also about two Taliban leaders specifically to kill them.
In the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein US Luftangriff were requested to NATO investigative report by 142 people have been killed or injured.
Green, SPD and left demanded on Saturday, Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to comment immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing Afghanistan-Politik part of the federal government - and whether chancellor, Bundeswehr and news service this new strategy approved, Jürgen Trittin and Greens called Mrs Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism.
The chancellor did not on concrete operations of the Armed Forces in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday were also doubts about the portrayal of the ministry on the background to the dismissal of Generalinspekteur Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert loud.
According to the mirror, the two Guttenberg properly and fully on the background to the Tanklaster attack.
It had officially said that they had denied the existence of the NATO reports and the minister sensitive details.
From the environment of the two top officials said, however, that the Ministry of Defence even have pointed to a series of reports, including a two-way document to rob the rich Colonel Klein and an area hunters report.
Wichert is now in a letter to clarify the facts reported to have asked the "Frankfurt general Sunday newspaper."
A response he had not received so far, it says.
The Ministry expressed on Saturday not to the allegations and pointed out that the inquiry committee of the Bundestag will clarify the formed next Wednesday.
Worlds dream.
Some people see in police state images and hear voices, the others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mental health and drug rush are becoming increasingly blurred the boundaries between Imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in their sleep, everything is in order.
If we are going to do with closed eyes in our dark rooms, we must Unbound the wildest ideas and Phantasiegebilden.
However, who traumartige conditions in Wachsein seen things and the others do not see or hear in the modern Western world mostly as crazy or addictive drugs, at least as the anoraks.
But such images and voices are not only in mental health or in the drug fever.
Blame our imagination: The same neuronalen processes, which will enable us to design houses, paint pictures or novels to write, sometimes to ensure that the boundaries between dream, madness and reality are becoming increasingly blurred.
Dream unique modified guard mentality in the various forms of conditions can occur even in the best-case scenario we call them visions, in the worst case of madness.
Even if cause and effect may distinguish the vision of the Mystikerin Hildegard of Bing, the Drogenerlebnisse of the New Age Prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamans Entrückungszustände, psychoses and hallucinations but similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions, if the balance of neuronalen messenger substances of the brain - especially dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline, Acetylcholin derailment - and the interaction of various parts of the brain jammed.
Complex hallucinations and wahnhaften thoughts are very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The main power has no power over him
The context of madness and dream, philosophers and doctors since antiquity.
Aristotle realised hallucinations as a form of the dream of waking up in a state of Griesinger Wilhelm, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry 1861, noted a "great similarity of misleading existence with dream conditions," for Sigmund Freud was the dream even "a psychosis, with all the inconsistencies, Wahnbildungen, a kind of deceit."
It is the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. in a comic figure.
Quietschbunt and his body is along.
The main power has no power over him, he is hanging in the bedroom ceiling.
It senses a entry.
Behind him geflügelte vicious figures with extremely red, distorted Fratze, zähnefletschend.
They force him to join him with serious, fierce boots, throw it against the walls that he feels the pain of the whole body.
Noisy, malicious votes roar from walls and radio.
He can no longer tolerate them, the voices that attack and insult him.
Henning T. snaps two cable from the stereo, knotet them into a noose and getting them to a hole in the ceiling.
It is rising on a loudspeaker and establishes the noose around the neck.
Faith it.
Solve the noose.
It should also be a lesson to shout the voices in trommelfellzerfetzendem choir, "Walk in the hospital and leave to heal thyself!"
Today is Henning T. 40 years old, he has seen six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, is the first nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffektive paranoid psychosis, it is also manisch- low, it takes medicines, against the depression, the mania, the schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, for the past three years, he is married.
In the climate, I have seen the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The fantasy images are cruel reality
Around one percent of the population contracts at least once in a lifetime of schizophrenia, in psychiatric hospitals, it is the second biggest illness after the depression.
In an acute psychosis schizophrenic affected mostly can no longer distinguish between the internal and external world, they get trapped in a übererregten state of hallucinations, scale, relationships or paranoia can lead.
This is particularly widespread hearing voices - votes, the existence, or Dialogisieren comment.
Also optical hallucinations are not rare.
The importance of what is trivial can no longer separate disorderly signals to the brain can no longer filter from the awareness is concerned.
As the dream opens the floodgates for the fear a flood of ideas and fantasies, the underlying mentality emerging classes.
The reality is perceived in the climate subjektzentriert, says Professor Thomas Fox, upper doctor of the clinic for Universal psychiatry in Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is located in the middle of the event, everything has a targeted importance to him.
At the same time, he is in a passive role, he will, like the dream of the events overwhelmed and it may not actively shape.
This often schizophrenic feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A realistic comparison is usually not possible, the fantasy images are cruel reality, awakening.
Even in the life of a Hall Uzi nation to have seen
Unlike dream, Fox says, "but the good and spatial structure of the reality that is perceived in the psychosis, basically."
The wahnhaften thoughts and hallucinations were rooted in reality, the Verfremdung of Erlebens will take place at the real framework.
Exactly why our brain unpredictability proposes, researchers are still puzzle.
The host situations in every human being can lead that he loses touch with a short time, says fox.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
It seems a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determinants.
Researchers assume that people with minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronale the brain at an early stage of development will be disrupted by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, for example, explained fox.
But it remain a mystery, as the disruption of the neuronalen system comes first, and not manifest over many years.
Environmental factors play a role, stress or traumatic experiences can be a trigger for psychosis if the line is available.
Halluzinogene drugs can also trigger psychosis, because they interfere in the transmitter system.
If our brain is hot
The nutcases, psychotic suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medicines, in order to get rid of them, others are spending money on drugs, which, according to the Lübecker psychology Professor Erich caste.
Whether fantasy images than pleasant or unpleasant, is often only a question of position.
Caste to collect over the past ten years reports of hallucinations and fantasy phenomena, last year, his results in the book, "The unreal world in our head 'evaluated.
Hallucinations are among the typical side-effects of psychosis, but also by surprising many other diseases.
These include mental disorders, such as Borderline or depression often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, or Alzheimer's disease and Schädelhirntraumata.
Surprisingly hallucinates, under certain conditions, even the brain healthy people.
Hallucinations, so caste, from memory content, which would normally be withheld.
They arise if brain stretches, in which sensory processed, actively discouraged or too little; if our brain is hot, or even if stimulation is missing.
Drugs can trigger this state as well as brain damage or a psychosis.
But also appeal of withdrawal, stress, love grief or other mental Ausnahmezustände.
In recent studies were up to one-third of respondents, at least once in the life of a Hall Uzi nation to have experienced.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and visited the school there.
A normal girl, actually.
If we did not have the images and voices.
In the break it can conclude that a schlaksiger boy with long dark hair it addresses.
If he replies, see the fellow pupils it is surprising - nobody else sees or hears these boys.
They hold the timid girl for a Tagträumerin stop, but Sarah K. is not, it knows it.
It is awake, you can see or hear these boys, just as they have the girls in the bank and alongside.
They can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that they may be the boys.
I am crazy?, they sometimes.
But they know that this boy, and the other fantasy images are real, and then disappear again.
At the phenomena are mostly frightening
The fantasy images are often a burden.
If they are sitting in the class area, it can sometimes not follow the teaching material, because the teachers in their eyes and ears for a new fellow pupils, while he presents for all other visual and visible in the bar of mathematical equations.
At night, the phenomena are mostly frightening.
If her dark room on sleep is far too little and too late in the day, they can often not distinguish whether it is awake or already dreams, whether the pictures that it sees the Fratze or the girl with the bleeding wounds at an average of arms and legs, before their open or closed eyes.
Let me in a calm, the characters cry.
Parents and friends tells you nothing, they would be insane.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
It has insisted last year, the baccalaureate and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since the Internet contact with the psychologists caste, it knows full well that they are not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art from despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffering under appeal withdrawal, he has a while with great likelihood hallucinations, says caste.
I suspect that the brain is then unterbeschäftigt and even for his entertainment.
Sarah K., a Einzelkind, as a little girl fear of other children, often, she played alone.
Their hallucinations started with 13, when they learned that the man they called Papa, since they can think not their biological father.
As visual and audio hallucinations are active in the same Hirnbereiche, the real impressions and noise process, it is affected as Sarah K. difficult to distinguish between fantasy and reality images. "Every experience," says caste, "will take place in the brain, the reality is there.
Hallucinations are also images of the brain can arise, so they are so real. "
Also upgrades night dream images of caste as a form of Hall Uzi nation.
The hallucinations do not differ fundamentally from healthy legend from an acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenic are mentally healthy in the situation, their fantasy images as unreal.
Caste advises his patients, therefore, the hallucinations as a special ability wertzuschätzen.
Border state between the dream and Hall Uzi nation
In our world is very bewusstseinszentrierten imaginary experience unfortunately mostly pathologisiert, says Michael Schmidt Degenhard, a professor in Heidelberg and chief doctor of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy of Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious and painful disease, but it also has positive, creative - madness is also a work of art out of desperation.
Degenhard Schmidt has researched the so-called oneiroide experience in the form of a particular form of the dream of unique changed guard consciousness.
Oneiroide are highly complex and detailed virtual dreams, the experience in real terms, for which he believes in and with the benefit of hindsight, not by the guard can distinguish between state.
The oneiroide mentality state is emerging in trauma through illness or extreme situations, for example, in Polyradikulitis patients, in full awareness of a motor paralysis.
If a person of self- and loss of world is threatened, such as persistent complete movement, it replaces the ability to Sun life-threatening reality through its own imaginary world, which is detached from reality, says Degenhard Schmidt.
A kind of border state between the dream and Hall Uzi nation.
Since the completion of a situation in the reality is not possible, a change in the world, but the real situation in the Imagination compounds.
An intensive form of Sinn Foundation and meaning in a precarious situation that allows people own creative ability, not in a nothing of the mentality of declining loss.
Everything is real, later in the memory
The Neue art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his Oneiroid experiences in his book 'Herzwechsel "as a bailout of the soul.
It is 49 years old, as his consciousness after a heart successful operation with subsequent heart transplants on travel days, while his body on the pediatric ICU is doomed to maintaining.
Claussen appears in one of the world, visiting alien times and places: He is seen as bettlägerigen old man, boarded a Zugsanatoriums, a robot monitors on his health.
He lives in the early part of the something, the drugs among dignitaries from blood.
It is a Greek on the motorcycle in his home country, surft abducted with his hospital bed to grant Nee dolphins in the Alpine and makes a Korean Mafioso.
He goes totally against the events that everything is real, later in the memory.
This internal travel for Claussen differ fundamentally legend of any dream.
Dream is another state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories from mental travel even after years and in minor details about clear.
Even clearer and more than Erlebtes really.
The intensity of this Erlebens goes beyond the horizon of our other lifelong secular experience, says the psychiatrist Degenhard Schmidt.
At the end of the day, Oneiroide show, psychosis, hallucinations and drug rush, how fragile our inner being minted, the external reality in the guards.
Any change in the state mentality, say the psychologist caste, "can lead to a Verformung of what we call reality."
A experience, which may also be enlightening.
The snow fall can be
Burda
Children should the publishing house with 27 years to take
The new publishing head Kallen is an interim solution: In the long term, Hubert Burda wants his company in the hands of his two children, he said the mirror.

The question of whether they are active in the company, is only afterwards.
The question of whether they are able to do so.

With regard to the cases Schickedanz and Schaeffler Burda said that family businesses are not before the sinking are safe: "That was always families who could infect by a capital addiction, quite verspekuliert and thought they could increase the major player in the world.
My strategy was never the case.
He had never had dreams of power in the world, "Burda.
I am not as the political Präzeptor this country combat, as it was, and I am not even in the global player with 'Time' play with these shops are too great.
The promises of FonPeek
Äusserst Peek is limited, a device with which one can only read his e-mails without a chance to be able to see some annexes or surfing the Internet.
It has enjoyed his five minutes of fame than the Time magazine as one of the products of the year chose.
It on the streets to see is unlikely, but the idea in itself is, nevertheless, especially for young people of interest.
In contrast to the Smartphones Peek costs very little and has a very favourable Flat Rate, for example, only half the price of a flat rate of one's iPhone.
After the company has seen the success that there were two new products on the market: One that is intended only for Twitter, the other with a lifelong Gratisservice for data, unlike the Peek, in which a six times higher price to pay.
Fonpeek yesterday in the event of Le Web is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits, as well as his American counterpart, however, there is a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the telephone, around 12 euros per month, roaming for Europe as a whole.
Those with a Smartphone to travel around the world, already know what it means to abandon all the data in order to be able to read his Emails, once one has ridden roughshod over the border or if you are desperately looking for a café with Wifi (or a liaison possibility with Fon).
The idea of roaming with Flatrate is incredibly tempting and it should be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers have separate contracts and prices for foreign visits to offer my experience, but it takes a doctorate in physics and a good glasses, to be able to read the small print.
The repeated criticism from the European Commission in terms of affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe remained almost always unappreciated.
Abroad of their own country, it was always afraid to read his Emails and rightly so.
A small machine as FonPeek (although it is always surprising is that it is the name of Fon, although there is no Wifi / WLAN has this kind of tariffs can offer, means that the telephone providers, slowly but surely, and must start to think differently in various ways to consider how they can use their data network.
Kindle is another good example in its prices is the downloads of books and other questions on the Internet.
Without Treaties and without snags.
It is capable of an Internet-based video equipment, and it is only a single occasion, purchasing, and not month after month.
And that is precisely what I expect of FonPeek one day, a buying opportunity with lifelong access to the Internet as the Peek already in the United States.
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my Emails with the telephone, thank you.
But I expect this because I believe that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system be able to see.
The Fetischfarbe of Michelle
Yellow is, without a doubt, the favourite colour of the American First Lady.
The office of Barack Obama as President of the United States, they appeared in a dress and a cloak of this colour and has the same colour re-elected him in his, without doubt, second most important moment in his life: To accompany the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo peace.
On both occasions, Michelle Obama has taken very similar models: Aside from the fact that it was almost the same colour - a brilliant Grüngelb - was the clothes from three parts - dress, jacket and cover from the same hydrogen, and it was grossförmig something Gesticktes or a neck chain.
It even goes so far as that the first sight seemed that the First Lady of the United States on the model of the Princess of Asturias and decided to follow the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two different clothes, but much in the way of material from which they are made.
In the inauguration, they wore a dress from head and a gemusterten table in Oslo.
The accessories were different: For the first time, green shoes with half high sections and the second time in a änhliches model, but goldfarben.
The hair was different: Every time the hair were on this occasion Haarkranz ambitious than the previous gave them the hair.
75% of the working mothers, because their maternity problems in getting the work.
The discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, especially in the younger women who want to have children.
This result from CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for women through study "fertility and career of women in Spain '.
The survey of 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 years leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working women see their career opportunities on the labour market because of their motherhood is restricted.
The study, frankly, that there are big differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not, and if so, what kind of work.
Those of them, no other activities abroad in the House, only halbtags work or no fixed contract, are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
In contrast to postpone the women with a permanent jobs, particularly in the public sector, the creation of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a firm filling their first child, on average, only 3.7 years after the drawing, a number of 4.1 years for women with solid employment increased the longer needed to achieve their cooperation and drawing and the first child have achieved until much later.
In addition, the type of work in a big influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar on the use of readiness, "says the CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor in the age of women in the marriage and the first child must be taken into account.
According to the poll, the age at the time of the marriage and the first child even higher, the higher the level of education and training.
This difference was also among the women of the same age be identified.
For example, the women in the group between 35 and 49 years, depending on whether they are only the primary school or a higher education, on average, each with 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time mother.
There is also still, depending on their level of education, another difference between the women.
While the women with Hauptschlussabschluss before their first permanent employment marry and get their first child, make it the women with a middle or high school and seek out the precise opposite until a permanent employment and marry later and then get their first child, Delgado.

Over Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegori democratic Christian, he wrote about what he in the blood, not in his mind, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a change poetic sense of humour, without any sense as the knife swords, almost killed him."
Over Graham Greene: "Our man was this woman with a passion which lasted 13 years, so in its ranks, whose meat in the emotions on the grounds of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege, which was in the skies through the medium of corruption."

Over William Faulkner: "He was a peculiar Kauz.
He said sometimes on themselves, that he is the legacy of a heritage owner of the county and other times, he said that he is the son of a Black and a crocodile.
Both dreams persuaded by a certain Gröe. "
Over Louis Ferdinand Céline: This writer adopted the insane cry on a bridge from the personality hinausgeschrieen from Munich, so that its echo until deep into the night of the 20th century on his literary manner. This cobbled stones he made during a visit in which he fled from themselves and with a speech full of violence before the acquired anflehte posterity.

Cowardly aggression.
My 70-year mother was last week by our part of the city in the town of Fuenlabrada, as a group of young people between 15 and 18 years alongside her and our dog herliefen, our dog is a Mischling, we pulled from the animal sanctuary and just six miles, and then a bolt from the blue, they missed him two Fußtritte and injured it difficult.
Our indignation, one can never be in words, because it is incomprehensible to us, where since the Spass in a cheap's aggression against a small and loose animal should be, of course, was carried out in the leash.
In addition to the suffocation San case, a woman who was walking comfortable, as they did these people as a result of the incident wanted to chastise them even feared for their own lives, because if such an incredibly attacked a dog, it will be the same perhaps with a woman, a child, an elderly gentleman or probably even with each, the weaker than it is in itself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet city quarter at five o'clock on an ordinary Tuesday afternoon.
The dog has geheult throughout the day.
We have, of course, situated in a close intelligence unit filed, however, however, we have serious doubts as to whether that anything will bring any prejudice and to prevent right from the start, we would only make it clear that the cowardly Spaniards were criminals.
Our indignation about what led us to this incident.
We cannot understand what is happening in the minds of these young people that they must tread a cheap attack on a useful loose animal fun to find an animal that we love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for the animals and the people stayed.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the Helms
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for road safety (Fesvial) a campaign to promote the hat utility, especially among younger motor cyclists launched today known as both companies.
This initiative is the importance of the hat utility to draw because it is ultimately about the only safeguard, the head injury or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident can prevent.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment in terms of the traffic safety, "far more than just the Entwerfen and importation of products that are increasingly safe with every day," and confirmed that they are also with other actions educational and informative nature will contribute to this goal every day to come a step closer.
This new campaign to promote the utility hat on the motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be' will run in the first phase of posters about 500 motorcycle workshops to distribute the contribution spread to achieve.
At the end of Michelin stressed that the road safety "a constant concern" of the company, and particularly from the reason, since they are as a producer of tyres for two rädige vehicles are obliged to see one of its main objectives of the development of always safer products should be.
The sale of vans is rising again something
After almost two years of the beginning of the car market for Kleintransporter finally shed some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles in November in Spain have been allowed to mean an increase of 12.6% in 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first increase even after 22 consecutive months of decline with company STET International, in accordance with the constructors' association Anfac and the car trading act Ganvam Association before the figures.
These good numbers, however, are currently only with great caution geni to eat, because the other comparison drawn by November 2008, which is a particularly bad Verkausjahr with a drop of 60% on the previous year.
However, we must remember that, apart from the rise in the last month, the overall admissions of the 11 months still 40% below the sales figures for the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles sold in this figure, but we are all vehicles, from which the Kleintransporter market, it is: Descendants of passenger cars, pick ups, small trucks, small vans and light vans / chassis.
Also are still the same storm clouds in the sky, the demand that most members of the passion, because even if some of the vehicles purchased by individuals, the Gross part of the sales to small and medium-sized companies in almost 100% of all cases the purchase by a third financing.
So we need to these restrictions, the result of the zugedrehten Geldhahns of credit institutions are still other factors, including, as with the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In this scenario, and unlike the passenger cars, the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the Plan 2000E little helped.
This plan, however, is not only intended for private individuals, the self-employed and small companies have a right to expect that, if they are a small lorries up to 3.5 tonnes of CO2, not with a 160 grams per kilometre must not exceed deadlock to buy, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
It was again yesterday Ganvam reminds us that it is required by the state, is also a special attention to these small vices and, of course, also on the industrial vehicles (lorries and buses).
The car trading act for the 2010 Association predicts a similar year as the very last year, for which it with a loss of sales of passenger cars and SUVs) by 19%.
The support for Bremsmanövern in critical situations is now duty
As at the time of the ABS anti-lock braking system and how it now with the ESP stability control what happens to the Hilfssysteme on the brakes in emergency cases, a duty equipment in the European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory in all newly registered passenger cars and light small trucks, for the rest of the vehicles has been a transition period until the end of February 2011.
The measures adopted by the European Union has the aim to improve the protection of pedestrians, but they can brake systems because their operation also help to prevent a number of road accidents.
The task of the emergency brake assistants is more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical braking maneuver, the system on the basis of the drivers from the brake strength on the brake pedal acknowledges.
However, this system is not this pressure until the end.
According to a study published by the components manufacturers for the Bosch vehicles has been commissioned to study, a third of drivers involved in an accident before the clashes no longer to enter the brake pedal and half of them had not slowed with full force.
By 1,100 accidents
The brake assistance with maximum force against attacks in the braking system and reduce the brake time and hence the braking distance, a car in braking process back.
According to a study by the EU could each year to 1,100 fatal accidents, where pedestrians will prevent harm to come if all cars with this type of emergency brake assistants would be equipped.
It would be even fewer accidents - it is estimated that every fourth accident could be prevented with injury - as soon as the so-called intelligent braking systems are popular.
Then there is the vehicle equipped with a system (on radar or camera) obstacles and recognises the driver warns, while at the same time, a light pressure on the brakes.
If the driver then reacted to help him in the system, to increase pressure on the brake pedal, if it would be needed.
If the driver does not react to the warning and even if the Toss is inevitable, is already the brake assistant at the maximum pressure on the brakes on this way, the damage as low as possible.
General Motors defers the plan for Opel until January.
While the workforce of Opel plant at Figueruelas (Zaragoza) by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, were informed that the production of the new Meriva in the first week of April will start, probably on 8, according to Mr Ortega, the American car manufacturers indicate that he needs more time to the rescue plan for Opel on the conclusion.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, which wants to ensure that the affected side of their consent to every aspect of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, the first of the workers and the governments of countries where there are stations will be presented to postpone until early 2010.
Dementgegen from GM will be assured that it is in the next few days, a decision on the sale of Saab will take.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government pressure on the American car manufacturer has increased, so that this as soon as possible a decision.
GM is too, with a number of potential new buyers in touch.
One of these buyers could be Geely, which is also keen to buy Volvo, however, I would like to win the option of Dutch manufacturer of Skype Sportwagen by the Russian group Converg backing, increasingly popular support.
If it with any of these buyers should come to an agreement could GM some assets to the Chinese BAIC sell.
The decision by the end of the year, Saab schliessen until then, if it is not sold, will also be maintained.
At the helm of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of its latest and very expensive jewel was used by the engineers the Boxster S as a basis and it really shipped him to make it easier for 80 kilos, and he is now only 1,275 kg to tip the balance.
In order to create such a thing as a first renunciation of the automatic aufklappbare roof, a tent screen roof has been replaced with manual stimulation, alone, it has saved 21 kilometres, thanks to the aluminum doors in this model used as the GT3 "disappear" a further 15; by the exclusion of the air conditioning again 13; it was also the fuel tank from 64 to 54 per litre, have been reduced to save another 7 kilo; with the installation of sporting Bacquet seats once again 12 and with the light 19 customs Felgen again saved five.
You then had even by the renunciation of the Audio system CDR 30 again six kilos less and through the exchange of Türgriffe episodes from fuel by the lack of a kilo.
Although he, too, with the double Kupplungen wheels PDK is available, the test ride in a car with Handgetriebe 6-gängigen, mainly on the smaller Landstrassen from California, on mountain routes, the very kurvig fashion.
During his driver behaviour, one can only give the footnote impeccable.
The reduction of his weight, but it has not geführtdass he is no longer so sure would be on the streets.
It is quite the opposite: Since long we have already is no longer a small and light model of the probegefahren, but also a sense of great security at the graphs, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, capable of his muscles in a low in the time needed to make warm until we give him the orders to curb rasen to recover, and then again everything from his engine to repeat...
He makes everything he says. The car makes everything that we would give him with our hands hint at the wheel, thanks to its governance, the same communicative as well as accurate.
And he makes it with the precision of surgeons.
A Motorsound for all flavours
The sounds of his V6 box with 320 PS (10% more than the Boxster S) is very good and it cannot increase with the '' least-cost sport, as well as through a system that can change the Motorgeräusche, which is already used for the first time in the Panamera.
The streamlining unimaginable wealth is brutal, regardless of whether the foot out or the renewed acceleration.
The Federungen are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the Landstrassen where we went with the Boxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car meisterte the bumps well.
The electronic assistants on the entire route had virtually nothing to do; and that, although in some of these curves, ice in dawn and Rollsplitt in the morning.
In summary we can say that there is an ultra light car is a car, with whom you have an indescribable Fahrs passport, as it otherwise are rare, and it is much more than just a slight improvement of the Boxster SS.
The car in February 2010 will come onto the market and 70,831 Euro cost.
BAG Girl '
The singer mermaids, a friend of Karl storage area is the face of the cosmetics line Coco Cocoon and a Gelegenheitsstarlett dolphins in the fashion meadows of 'maison, it presents its rude face with the same obduracy as their pockets of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl," it is a "Bag Girl."
The Baskonia pays a victory in Israel itself.
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many fancy players in the team from Mr Dusko, an excellent triumph with 82-91 during his visit to the complicated Fuss football field of Maccabi Electra and thus ends up in the first place within his own party after the great appearance of Mirza Teletovic with eight three of the best of his team was (29 in the evaluation).
The team from Vitoria, the important cases of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large dose of use and team work, even though they replace until the bitter end had to wait on their victory.
The great hits from the quality-wine with 16 out of gray rate significantly contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the Blauroten right from the start at the top of the table of advertisements.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already emerged from the quality-wine, one could guess that they are already on the pitch with good reheated Council.
There were ferret and Teletovic, mainly for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter were responsible.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from Álava for a innenseitiges game of Barac decided by Eliyahu and, for example, in his return to the team with pfiff and applause was received by his home to their advantage to develop the break (34-43).
Teletovic began as the best of his team with 13 points, wennn also highlight the "minus six" assessment of cluster liessen already guess that this is not the best evening would be the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, the game despite the clear advantage in the break has not yet decided and the Makkabäer wanted the Vitorianer again remind you that on their pitch not everybody wins, and thanks to the repeatedly attacking 'hand of Elías, "they came into play.
Eidson and Pnini contributed significantly to the "yellow" running the helm (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
The team of Mr, were injured, but everything other than dead, a couple of game trains with accuracy to prepare, in order to get back in the air, and one of them suddenly came from the pistol Teletovic Mirza, with almost three successive three times, and with the support of the ferret Ribas and ensured that the advertisements table again einberuhigender refrain from (54-67) has been reported that the hosts at the end of the third quarter with (57-67) could enhance.
The Alavesen last quarter blossgestellt and ferret and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow them to victory in the first dreissig minutes honestly deserved, straight again.
Nonetheless resigned Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team and tried not to their team by three points from the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although cluster because Fouls off-side was not on the team of Mr, defended well and even though the Israelis nor in the last minute on a repeat (85), the game was already a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in this season.
Violations prevented the gall was offered Unicaja
Unicaja lost vociferously against Olympiacos in Greece and the leadership of the group B of the Euroliga cede to him, and that in a game by the failure on the part of the players from Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the domestic game marked what the Greeks facilitated the victory.
The team from Malaga had no fear of the mood in the hall of the peace and friendship before the opposing team, which may be one of the most of Europe, and a lot of money.
Thanks to their game of the first quarter of the Andalusians start to dream. A aggresive defence and three consecutive times, two of them by Omar Cook and a Guillem Rubio, dazzled by the hosts with 12-18 in the ninth minute.
Olympiacos came from the intensity of the ereins Unicaja surprised, even if the local team with a domestic game between the Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed that the advertisements plaque in the 13th minute 22-20 in their favor indicate that the minute in which there is a action almost to thuggery between the two Americans Beverley and Williams had come and why they were disqualified.
The Greek team finally began to warm and his superiority on both Spielhälften, while the termination of the Englishman, Joel Freeland, owing to a violation and the three self-inflicted mistake by Carlos Jiménez mark in the Unicaja level.
Under their players in the field of Interior and the Lithuanian forward Linas players Kleizas, with his hands, increased their advantage in the 19th minute at 44-32.
A race was impossible.
The third game quarter was marked by many attacks against the team from Olympiacos, despite his 19 losses showed superior and it even managed to the difference in Malaga from shared game with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which, in turn, even the leadership within the group into oscillation.
Unicaja tried to focus on the number of defaults and the departure of the during the game injured Scots Robert Archibald.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja came in the 31 minute thanks to the leadership and the hands of Cook and the use of Lewis 66-57 on some hope.
It was nevertheless actually impossible, because the Olympiacos, attacked as soon as he and his superiority with centimeters within the basket area showed, not to boot.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed in the 37 minute, the basket 81-62 difference to rise and Unicaja was beaten and had to cede the leadership anOlympiacos.

Many thanks!
After the verlockendsten days since last spring, in which the inflation of the assets of the prevailing mood in the markets, is the uncertainty in the markets returned in any case, what is surprising, because this is their natural state, in an environment in which the broker decisions on an inherently uncertain future.
The measures applied to stabilize the markets, it was the debt with the direct purchase of assets to repay the liquidity and indirectly free to leave interest rates to zero, thus the banks claim to buy assets.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets as well as ended, and without their heterodox policy on liquidity in question, start to spread of grit, as the BCE näc before with its annual auction, which will take place next week.
Therefore doubt the investors in the ability of the world economy, the economic recovery without these heterodox and we will be able to maintain it just witnessed a reversal in reducing the risk premiums.
The volatile stock market and the differences in corporate bonuses will rise again, even if they are still far removed from the paramilitary normal amounts they are achieved at the beginning of the year.
The States were forced to nationalize the private risks and the national debt will rise again.
It is now back on quality and the United States, Japan and Germany are the preferred haven of investors, leading to an increase in the differences of the countries in the euro zone in regard to Germany.
Spain has until now hardly affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision downwards on the assessment of Spain.
On the other side is not a degree of uncertainty about the defender of the moral hazard to silence had tried again with the leaders of the world economic policy awareness, for what they had caused, since the devastating effects, including the restriction of loans for the loss of jobs, as they had slowed to a new day of action should have a word of thanks to decide.
However, this is what happened in Dubai, on a tribal war between the Emir, for power in the Emirates and restore the development in Greece was also previously anticipated.
A government, which the government debt fails, elections and a new government on the same hymn sheet.
Prodi made it in Italy after Mr Berlusconi and Mr Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary at the beginning of the year of non-compliance with their foreign payments and thus save a euro member country is no longer fulfil its obligations.
However, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and its citizens in need of aussergewöhnlicchen it in the duty to take the stability of the state funds to maintain.
Yes, we find ourselves as expected an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after a few Ausschweifungen to large sums of money, and it would now within the expected.
In the case of Spain, we must not worry, as long as the differences of public debt at the same pace as the European corporate bonuses.
Should reduce the European differences, and the Spanish dannn it would continue to increase in a special Spanish risk to act.
The Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the wealth of early indicators of a Gross part of the market research institutions forced to bring their scenarios for the recovery and their scenario for 2011 upwards to correct, including the OCDE and the European Commission, again with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy come from all the promises despite warnings of a long life span.
Once again, it would appear that there is an excellent opportunity for the purchase of Spanish stock, although the moment "of caution when driving" is the order of the day.

According to the Chairman of Iberdrola, Spain 50 billion by 2020 Euround further 60 billion from that date to invest in 2030, under the conditions that the current nuclear power stations will continue to remain in operation.
This should not be the case if needed investments in 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola is of the opinion that we no longer in an increase in the energy Erzeugungskapazität should invest in distribution networks and international groupings.
From 2020 will change the issue and we should increase the performance.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities for the carbon dioxide capture and, of course, especially on renewable energy sources.
In this case, it is based on the assumption that 18 MW of more are needed, under the Vorraussetzungnatürlich by other "base energy."
Galán, the view is that the Gesetentwurf for a sustainable economy, which was approved by the government, in line with what his company called for no case wanted to say something about this law, such as incentives for the national coal consumption, which is the exact opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, we clearly in this direction, despite some" individual "it, as the chairman of Iberdrola.
It is, says Galán, we now have the decisions on the investment, even if they are in the long term, should make, because it will need some time and a stable financial framework must be created in attack.

Acciona rivals Hochtief and Bouygues for his first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona fighting for the opening of its first motorway in Australia, a market in which they already as energy and Wasserunternehmen are represented.
The building, at which it is a tunnel of 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1,047 billion euros) will cost.
The French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief are his competitors.
A 2.5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, is the best opportunity for Acciona, in the country as construction companies and motorway operator.
The city administration would have completed the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration for a public-private cooperation (PPP is the English acronym) decided to the project after a by Ernst & Young to advance the business plan, the administration is already in possession of a definitive list of candidates for the construction and management of the toll stations.
In anticipation of the offers in May presented the estimated investment at 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 billion euros), and in the last phase three consortiums, especially from European construction company consisting, compete with each other.
The group with the name of Transcity Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.

Against the team of Acciona, the consortium of Northern Direct, formed from the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for the infrastructure and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and final consortium in the closer election is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn to ACS), which also includes domestic Baulderstone (in possession of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in the public works.
The Australian market for infrastructure promises huge construction work and privatisation, however, there is a barrier to overcome it, because it is only through the purchase of a local construction company entry.
A strategy of the aforementioned companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian credentials, followed, and by the Spanish Baugiganten still needs to be prosecuted.
Even ACS has only on this market through its participation by 30% in Hochtief, the owner of the so-called Leighton, gained entry.

Among other assets, it has already made its largest wind could make parking (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies, which was entrusted with the desalination San situation of Adelaide, with a budget of $700 million to build and to administer.
It is now his intention to these two areas to consolidate and to use these synergies in order to enter the branches of construction and infrastructure.
The underground stretch of the toll by the Office for infrastructure of the city of Brisbane promoted and Northern link (Nordzubringer) hot, the purpose of the Western motorway in Toowong with the bypass route in Kelvin Grove (see map) on a length of 5 kilometres through tunnels to link. It is the great measures to reduce congestion on the streets of Brisbane.
The administration of the city's roadmap provides for the award for summer 2010 and the launch of the construction work in the December next year.
Even if this stretch of the toll for the transport in recent months should open by 2014, the assumption is that the building work will last until 2016.
The tunnel was drafted in 2005.
He has two driving traces in every direction, an electronic toll system and a complex system of air.
The government of Queensland involved with 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) in the financing.
For Hochtief is Brisbane bereitsein grosses business.

The game in the Champions League, Madrid and Barça since the beginning of 476.4 million.
The Champions League in 1992 sichseit its emergence as a source of income for the Fussballclubsentwickelt.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona since 476.4 millions of what they have taken the third and fifth place in the Fuss football clubs, the most money earned in the league.
Leader this list is Manchester United.
Leader this list is Manchester United.
The UEFA Champions League, is not only to win glory. It is also one of the main sources of big clubs.
The League, according to the UEFA to 5,362.5 millions of euros in the 105 teams (from 12 Spanish) in this event since its founding in the season in 1992 / 1993, distributed to participate.
The F.C. Real Madrid and Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The club is in third place in Europe, the most money through its participation has earned and alongside the AC Milan, the only person who has won the trophy three times.
The current Catalan masters and final winners of the former Europacups proves the fifth place in 1992.
The list Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams, which is also the most money through their participation in the past Champoins League revenue.
And, although they have lost against Barça.
On the other hand, Spain, just in third place, the countries by the Champions einehmen money, although there have been more titles than any other (five, in contrast to four bie Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution of
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated money partitioning procedure, which uses the UEFA.
In this financial year does the organisation, whose presidency Michel Platini holds, with revenues from 1,090 million by the Champions League.
This money does the UEFA 413.1 million for fixed payments: Each of the 20 Fuss football clubs in the qualification preliminary round attended (including the Atlético de Madrid) got 2.1 million.
In addition to those who got a participation at 3.8 million, by their very presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game that they denied.
There is also a bonus for profits (800,000 euros) and a draw (400,000 per team). The clubs that have come to respect Tel final, each received three million; the four came into the final quarter of 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million.
The winner deserves 9 million, in contrast to the Second, the 5.2 million.
So gets a Fuss football club at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed income.
Barça, in turn, earned with his victory in the European Super Cup in August 2.5 million.
However, in addition to the variable payments, for the 337.8 million.
This money is proportional to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has allocated 4 jobs.
The mayor last year gets 40% of the allocation of currency, 30% of the second, 20% of the also-ran and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part, depending on the number of games, which they will play in this year's edition, distributed.

The users can involve variables, such as the price for the working hours, prices or rebates and then he can print from the cost estimates and its customers.
AudaTaller, however, is not a tool for evaluation as AudaPlus, but rather a reference list.
Main differences between the two systems is that the dieWerkstatt targeted no estimated working hours.
