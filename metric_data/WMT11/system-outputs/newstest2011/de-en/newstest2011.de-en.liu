What should they do CSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague-found neither breve Voldemort, or the "Konditorei."
The new Council lords of capital from the ranks of the CSSD will obviously certain language barriers to overcome their old neuen colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and in the city of representation at all to understand.
The newspaper Aktuálne.cz, members of the new Council from the CSSD cats--or a little "hold," as they dominate the notorious slang, which in recent years has naturalisations, in which the current coalition partners were in Prague at the helm.
The encoded vocabulary, which elapsed in the era of Mayor Pavel Bém of Prague's political elite was introduced, fact is some of the best-known actors, situations and Causae.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils fall in relation to this new concepts of something in the dark.
At least they say it.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I am rather a newcomer in the Prague policy," responded Lukás Kaucký, the new Council Mr for culture, on the test of the "patent vocabulary."
But also the Council Mr Brezina -- a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, to the term "Golfloch."
"This is the only expression of those that you give me, which I occasionally use."
"I think otherwise not many of slang."
From the vocabulary, which the next leaf Aktuálne.cz in this year's June before the election Congress of the ODS, anyone had published the editorial six terms, especially those that are notoriously associated with the Prague magistrate.
The Social Democrats should the terms' Voldemort, "" biggest Prague Gulf hole " in the Champansky Konditorei, "" Stiernacken, "" betrayal of the capital, "and" verblechen "define.
Three Prague Council lords agreed with the test, the fourth --- Mr Weinert, the future leader of the Prague school system -- first promised his participation in the conversation, then, but not even the sound system.
The fifth Council Mr, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"These things are, and I do not care how the Civic Democrats subsidies--the, I do not judge."
"For me is important, as we understand our programmes," he retaliated.
As has been suggested, would have Lukás Kaucký in the above headline supposedly not recognised that the influential businessman and friend of the ex Oberbürgermeister Bém, Roman Janousek the speech.
The term " Kaucky Voldemort says nothing at all, and the only concept, which he was correct on the Test erriet "the biggest Prague golf hole."
"This is the tunnel," says Blanka Kaucký, added to safety but added: "But I know that more out of the newspaper."
And jokingly: "I will be a language course show us'.
"The Gulf hole" will not only matador Karel Brezina, but also by the Council of owner for the Environment Lukás Plachý right as a tunnel Blanka entziffert.
Both Social Democrats also know, however, for whom the word Voldemort and Lukás Plachý even knows where this figure is to find and also what it means, "in the Konditorei to go."
"I believe, that is, in any Prague catering company to go," is pretty close Plachý to the solution to the problem, if you know that it is the seat of Janouseks firms.
However, in line with Brezina, he claimed, however, this knowledge from the newspaper to cooperate rather than that he would this vocabulary.
The test, judging by the participants, there seems to be under the Social Democrats actually no similar naturalisations slang.
"I have asked my colleagues, but there is obviously something we really not."
"We call upon us by name, and then we also use acronyms or nicknames," says the chairman of the Prague CSSD Petr Hulínský - from his party Hulda " loosely.
"In the school was I Bríza (Birke), but I do not know whether to call my fellow-Members," he tells us, Karel Brezina nicknamed.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálne.cz has tried to work and behold - it.
Mr Weinert Council is for the party of the kind of one's grandfather " or less friendly "old," the representative Miroslav Poche, which before the elections by machinations of the party's sponsorship made by some colleagues' Igrácek " (known Czech Lego figure).
Nicknames are so the only thing that allow the Social Democrats in the Home parteilichen language.
It may not pseudo-trendy Hulínský if it, Hulda 'names, but Deník Aktuálne.cz registered another moniker of the Prague chairman.
His nickname "doctor of Gummiknüppel rights' pseudo-trendy has to do with the fact that Petr has acquired its title Hulínský iuris doctor to the Bratislaver police academy.
The government wants the torture of "witches" and prevent was a brochure case--had
Women in Burkina Faso to be tagged witches, usually some common social features.
They include the older generation, they cannot find work -- for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
If one of these women to Hexe "will", she will be strictly isolated, so that they can be the rest of the village not dangerous.
"Men are affected by this fate quite rare."
"Even young and healthy women, this will save, since they help on the job, and children give birth," an order sister describes the situation in the capital of the West African state Burkina Faso in a Spezialheim by more than 100 women who were expelled from their communities.
The local government now decided against this abnormal "social action".
And, for this reason, a brochure, which the "witch hunt" to stop.
The cause, but a catch.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," warned the newspaper, the standard 'on the dilemma of written clarification.
To be accused of witchcraft, but also in other African countries.
In Ghana, a neighbour of Burkina Faso, was the 27 year-old Ammy Hemmahová of three women and two men tortured to death -- they pass them with hers, flows through Petroleum and burned simple.
This incident reported, including the BBC server.
The perpetrators claimed, however, the matter would have been only a confluence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to your version is oil, which will be used for inflamed ritual Salbungen.
And, after the group tried, "an evil spirit" in the woman's good health ".
The isolation of "witches' support people here regardless of their education.
The standard 'quoted a 42-year old businessman from Burkina Faso: "Fresserinnen human souls are used as a threat today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso at least tried to defuse the witch hunt, the President-in-Office mitgemischt gambianische last year the President himself properly.
"President Yahya Jammeh sparked after the death of his aunt a monstrous witch-hunt, as this alleged share of their death and would now try, including the president himself by black magic kill themselves."
"As many as he called Schamane from the Middle Guinea to aid, which is surrounded by police officers, soldiers and the bodyguard of President detained indiscriminately violent men and women from gambianischen villages and kidnapping on the farm of President in Kanilai brought," led the organisation Amnesty International in their report.
On the farm, the imprisoned people forced to a Absud from plants with potence halluzinogener to drink, eliciting but also bowel and kidney problems.
Two of the people anchored down survived the stay on the farm.
First because of international pressure has been released nearly a thousand prisoners.
One tenant of Bakala: He revives in the oven -- yet pays higher rent
An elderly man untersetzter America--are leaves the clients in the centre of the society RPG Byty of "coal Zdenek Bakala Barons', the largest private owner of rental housing in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a file with three new Miet contracts to three homes: For the home and the homes of his daughters and his son, who is serving a prison sentence.
All three have been increased in the context of the so-called "deregulation" just the rent.
Instead of 3,500 per month rent is the son of these next year for a 2 bedroom apartment with cuisine of the second category 4100 kroner.
"And there is not in the housing cats--or running hot water and heat one to a simple Kohleofen," if he angered the finger at the new lease of the son, whose signing a full power.
"But which, I have signed," says he resigned half and half oppose.
The citizens' association BytyOKD.cz that the new Miet conditions as "illegitimate and immoral," advises the tenants, the new contracts simply not to sign and to wait until December 7, in which she intends to publish a textbook acts as one against such contracts.
But the man only beckons.
"He says this; the other," he has a dark face.
The region is so great, in Ostrava deregulation laboratory '.
After the New Year is paying this deregulation most Miet flats in the Czech Republic before, whose tenants have not market-oriented rent.
Aktuálne.cz decided to visit, therefore, this "laboratory" personal.
The RPG Warteraum in Havírov is one of four in the region Ostrava and nine a. M. on this Tuesday packed full.
Alongside the door, the Bodyguards of a safety agency and a call for their equipment.
"Rent in 2011," stands a specific field breaking on the Touchscreen.
Shortly before the machine spuckt angetippt and a list of registration plate.
We hardly have the ear-tag "157" and already entziffert piepst them on the large display on the cover of Warteraum.
Half a minute later, one of the series.
A little later enters an elderly couple waiting room after the rent to ask, but the onslaught in the waiting room is apparently not the new rent.
Most people are here to the usual to resolve problems -- repair applications, insurance and similar.
In the middle of November high-social-spending fly in the region Ostrava the Kuvert with the new Miet contracts most tenants of a total of 44 000 homes of the portfolio of RPG in the boxes.
The RPG Byty proposes them in the letters a Miet increase of around 15% and 38%.
The specific counter for the new rent in the clients in the centre is opened since 18 November.
"The action is something about a week, which means that this is just the beginning," answer the ladies behind the counter for a moment of hesitation, as the "client" emerging as a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakalas former miners' homes are a sensitive issue.
Before the elections, the Dual-Use Ostrava Parliament Vice-President Lubomír Zaorálek of CSSD this subject fairly loudly, no wonder that today's newspapers are full.
"I want Twenty years of them a new ground."
"Non-budgeting cats--or besch ne. WC glasses they could change," the aforementioned man air.
Until now, the staff, especially pensioners on the counter, to see whether they promised the tenant moderation real gain RPG promises if they need special offers early sign.
The benefit of a half-slave reduced February rent to the other tenants that the new lease until 15 December sign.
Until now, " in Deregulierungsschalter Havírov but all other than overloaded of questions.
"Of the yesterday's 360 clients were only around 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 because here," value the switch Beamtinnen.
RPG seems to offer both on their websites, as well as individual Wandtafel Miet agreements, where it is needed.
Should the Miet parties but not on the new rent, they will be determined by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but as information about the only possible and perfectly legitimate legal approach to understand," says RPG on its Web sites.
"No one goes to court here," says one of the workers from RPG Byty and a man in the street in the heart of their clients are at least partly right.
"I have 13,000 (kronor) pension, I remain 5,000 eating other, where I should take the money for a court dispute hernehmen," he says.
Then the employee but uncertain.
"See."
"Mr Zaorálek tells them about the media, they should not sign and so are the people even diaspora-centered 'to remember them.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic New Year of 2011 and RPG Byty is that the Miet increase an economic necessity.
"The existing level of rent is not enough cats--or maintenance of the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimes, the director of the housing portfolio of society and RPG Byty - particularly the resentful tenants criticise neglect of the housing fund is in the view of the homeowners the main reason for the Miet increase.
While RPG in the years between 2005 and 2010 from the rents earned four billion in the homes was able to invest in the four years from 2011 to 2014, it should be 5.2 billion.
On the broadsheet LCD display on the ceiling on the cushion Sesseln in the waiting room of Havírov appear again and again in a few blue-finned shining information.
"The Miet increases in 2011 by 15% and less worker-centred 31 200 homes, which means more than 90% of the homes of RPG."
"Nowadays, this means a maximum of CZK 7.50 per square metre and month" is to read on the LCD screen.
Only in 400 homes from the portfolio of RPG increased the rent to 38 percent.
"In these cases is to increase extremely low Miet prices of CZK 19.66 per square metre," argues RPG.
In 2600 housing remains the rent in the next year at the same level.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation of the rents not erratic, but gradually within four and eight years ago.
What is more, the company has imposed a further commitment: All revenue from the Miet increase (see graph) wants the company back into the homes, especially in Wärmeersparnisse - in new windows and insulation.
But -- priority this should benefit to those people that the agreements on the Miet increase sign.
The architects saw a -- for office also includes a nursery
The office building Avriopoint in Brno, the new home of the company Arch.Design.
But who would have been a mini nursery expect, with all that includes: Farbenfroh walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the foreign Terrasse.
This nursery is since last year, the staff of Arch.Design available.
The Projektierungs and architecture office Arch.Design, whose Atelier a number of prominent Brünner nuclear-electrical buildings, predicted by the first drafts for the new building Avriopoint with the premises for his company's mini nursery.
Wise in, because most of his 90 staff (domestic) are in Babyboom age and the company is keen to see the architect Projektantinnen and return as quickly as possible to their work.
Together with the opportunity to shorten to work, is the nursery another bonus, which Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social program.
The Bauingenieurin and -architektinnen have it easier, its ambitious professional and child care.
The mini nursery is an original idea of staff (domestic) by Arch.Design, and with the support of the management managed them financial assistance from the European Union and the Department for Work and Social Affairs for their project to win.
The occupational mini nursery is through Operation programme human resources and employment policy from the resources of the European Social Fund and the state budget of the Czech Republic cofinances.
Thanks to this funding (grants of $2, CZK 8 million), the necessary facilities and equipment and be procured for the duration of 2 years is provided for qualified staff and for the operation.
After the under-implementation of funding (2 years) is the society Arch.Design duty Minikindergarten 3 more years at their own expense.
The preparation of this project, a whole year, with the society economy rating in the motion handling energetic support.
The children cares very active qualified personnel -- a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten children can visit without proper age restrictions, though, most of them over three years old.
And since it is a mini nursery, while only 5 children must be present, however, alternating the day on several children mutual.
The nursery company is flexible on the needs of the parents, the children of all employees in relation to the use of child Gartens the same rights - regardless of the company's hierarchy and their respective positions.
Although it is individual education and care, is the programme content in the mini nursery nevertheless comparable with the framework-programme of pre-school education.
The children play here not only, above all, they will offer excellent teaching -- from basic knowledge to preschool teaching, by the way they still learn English.
The classroom is not only with toys and creative games, but also equipped with a computer, where the children are available.
What is more, the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive corporate environment.
The parents at any time can take a look at the children and throw it deletes the stress during delayed more of the children from a distant kindergarten.
The parents therefore use their working hours more productive.
No wonder that emerge here, of course, and loyal relations.
Arch.Design included so under the Czech firms, which is to recruit new staff clear benefits ", which are family-friendly and steady through such programmes of their staff marketing.
A bone House fascinated even after 100 years. If you look at the Interieure of Gaudi of
The roof seems to be like the back of a defining historical Echse, the stairs as the vertebral column of a dinosaur and the balcony seat are on gerissene Fischmäuler.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
Of the local residents got the house with his organic forms nicknamed "bone home."
Organic forms, wild colours, the unusual use of stone, and Kachelsplittern mosaic that just façades reminiscent of and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical characteristics for youth style of Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the House is playing with dream-like lines, zärtlich paints and Textur in nature and living creatures.
First on closer inspection noted that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
In the night, the whole façade even closer, more dramatic and the specific Anleuchtung reinforces the glamour of colours.
The same faster valuable lines and tortuous forms also dominate the interior of the house.
A wave shaped wood copied the window frames, Geländer, Zierelement of doors, even Guckloch and own trade.
The House in the quarter Eixample Batlló on the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia No 43 was said by the reconstruction of a house from the year 1877, the architects Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took over two years and was detailed.
The investor, the wealthy industrialists Josep Batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but in the end, he voted the idea Gaudís in an unusual and cheaper rebuilding.
The Miet House Casa Batlló Antoni Gaudí noted, however, is not alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol together.
At the drawing board, the mere decoration for the representative of the housing Realitäten owner and the use of mosaic of the façade was his idea.
In the design of the facade, however, also worked many other Bildner and artists.
The joint work on the drafts of the Casa Batlló was the start of a fruitful cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí.
So Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís House Casa Milá Güell in the park, which is also other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after his completion, the home of the local inhabitants of his organic forms for the nickname, bone house '.
Others called it the specific Fensteröffnungsmechanismus because of the "yawning home."
It also says that the top of the building is portrayed the sword of the Holy Georg, the patron of Catalonia.
But also further bildhauerische elements symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí noted for the House for the time unique central heating system with ventilation channels and typical chimneys.
Rather bizarre is putting its 45 degrees of bias.
In his creation Gaudí consistently ignored all then building regulations and could not be discouraged by this.
Before the start of construction, although he lifted from the city of the corresponding construction permit a but the claims made by him on the planned reconstruction were so vague that the city fathers two years later in the completion so horrified by the result was that they demanded redress.
The Council lords, among other things, also found that the construction recently with its pillars, even in the public Bürgersteig.
To change, however, there was no longer, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the neighbourhood, Josep Batlló a request for approval of the rental of two highly devolved floors of the House -- and it was granted him promptly.
The House owner even drew in the lower reaches.
In the gallery in the second floor was a Gesellschaftssalon, on the third floor were sleeping rooms and Privatraum of housing.
The ground-floor level was leased to a Juwelier business.
The whole sechsstöckig building is going through a set of stairs, right up to the roof Terrasse.
By the fundamental elements of the reconstruction were all right corner and just lines removed and replaced by gebogen and waved walls.
Gaudí but also worked with a modern approach to the mutual combination of spaces.
The social part is explained by the opening of the Salon doors completely and connect as a larger society convenient plaudern without compromising vertraulicheren talks on a certain intimacy.
The House received by Gaudís restructuring out of a new facade also an unusual roof and two other floors.
Impressively is also Gaudís game with the light, as well as the blue and white glasiert Kachel with which the courtyard is in disguise and the courts of light.
The game of these two colours gives all floors of the House, a high degree of light.
He made it plain to the principle that White the light reflected better than dark colours, which the sunlight to absorb the opposite.
The House Casa Batlló that 2005 in the list of UNESCO world heritage site has been included, can visit today everyone.
In the first floor is made the most geräumig and most beautiful housing available to the public.
The homeowners decided only in the year to this step and this to mark the 150th Geburtstags of the famous creator.
As you stated that this is a very profitable business, retained the surveys in one, they extended to other common ground and the roof spaces, including the Dachterrasse.
The price to visit the construction memorial, however, is no trifling matter, he stands at euro 16.50, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards get 20% reduction.
This amount exceeds the ticket prices to other Gaudí-Bauten in the city.
Who the real atmosphere of the House with his breve Drachentürmchen wants to learn should try to friendship with one of the House residents to close and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right Bettenrost? Women have other than men Wënsch
Not the fine bed framework, but the quality of the deck area -- mattress and make the rusteth good bed.
However, they must be harmonious, adding to the wishes of the specific user.
In the selection of many things to play a role -- the weight, the size, the state of health, not least the sex of Schläfer.
Just as important is also the Interieur in which have distanced mattress and rusteth.
Typical example?
In a weekend house in which not regularly heated, are not Latexmatratzen good, because they need much longer, "hot".
In addition, they are much more difficult than usual Polyurethan-Matratzen.
And -- they should be turned on a regular basis.
If it is not enough in the core Entlüftungskanälchen and will also have to make a plate, congestion increases in humidity, so it is not impossible that itself is under their tape.
In the election, of course, also plays a role, which is used to it.
Anyone who has been a long time abroad, where very high mattress with soft layer, will be hard to get used to a low mattress with hard surface.
"Good all ice hockey players from the NHL returned, have complained to me that they are no longer able to sleep right."
"For their abgeschundenen shoulders, closely and hip they need simply a soft layer of foam Visco (memory Foam -- a Formgedächtnis Polymer)."
"This I recommend including diabetic people under a disorder of the nervous system, and so they are suffering from the" information "from the ligaments and skin can receive bad," says Sylva Hadamcziková, which specialised in padded furniture.
That is why I have many years ago ice hockey players, but also other customers this mattress with foam Visco (memory Foam) worried.
"Today, this is no longer a problem, because such mattress, among other things, to offer the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And it is not necessarily a famous ice hockey player, in order to learn benefits of Visco Schaums value.
This "miracle" actually works quite simple.
The foam optimalisiert his toughness and form in accordance with the heat absorbed, in other words, he is downright schmiegt on warm body.
Nowhere, put it in the night shifts around one does not like after a hard fight.
You sleep easy much better.
The foam viskoelastische also offers protection against Dekubitus (Wundbrand).
In the choice of Matratzengrösse should be to body size still the length of the mature Fussohle, about 21 to 34 inches.
Man as Mrs to 180 cm large, are in need of a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the Schläfer should be at least 90 cm deck range available, so together 180 cm.
In Einzelbett, for example, in single, are appropriate 120 to 140 cm.
For the sake of comfort, and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb for the ideal bed range: "If you on the back, should be enough room for the easy angewinkelt poor," advises credit rating. Helena, the champion of the guild Prokopová Polsterer and Raumausstatter, which for many years the issue of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture presents and devoted to this issue at colleges.
In a double bed needs all its own rusteth and his own mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattress are too high.
Otherwise, there is nothing other than the rusteth in different tune assembling and that is not in any Bettrahmen possible.
Foam Matratzen should at least 14 cm high, mattress with 15 cm skeleton pens, that should account for at least three centimeters in the form of class, and the fine cushion.
"With the hand or sit down with it, the feathers in no case sense," warns Helen Prokopová.
Each mattress makes a specific Rosttyp required.
Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and document as Saeed Siyam zusammengewachst Zwillinge are in the bedroom nothing.
This mattress cannot be met and the reference can wash it is not what we already commonplace.
And since we are in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years of slow to a huge (and clogged sieve).
That is also why reject experts believe sales patter, which in mattress promise a life of up to 25 years, even lifelong guarantee.
Every cause has its ifs and buts.
And that is why a practical advice from the dealers: In mattress of 120 or 140 cm band should be on the health of the salary abziehbaren waschbar, not shy, however, it is recommended, to use a Matratzenschoner that can deduct leave and wash
Even if today in the rule with'aide Rundumreissverschluss Matratzen salaries, so that one after the opening two halves gets (immensely important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger-mesh mattress, above all, alone, often as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath.
They have in bed instead of a firm Rostes plate?
Out of it.
Or a maximum for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
So, too, should they prefer the plate with ventilation holes tag (if any) are already in use and mattress with pen skeleton and 15 cm minimum level with the Taschenfederkern and Feinpolster.
Polyurethan-Matratzen belong on such a basis.
For not verstellbar Lattenrost with 14 to 18 Federleisten (Lamelle) are Latex or Sandwichmatratzen appropriate (possibly also combinations of Latex and Kokos), always pay it rusteth with a greater number of bar, from 28 and more pen Leisten, with hurricane Lenden Lordosenstütze in the area and the ability to regulate the Lattenhärte.
On verstellbar Lamellenroste does not include mattress with pen skeleton, because they do not respond to the ergonomische Verstellung.
In addition to the attitude of the Steife Federleisten will also be specific flexible back Module.
This is a special fortifications of Federleisten, which enables the Federleisten einzudrücken or even to verwinkeln that they will enable the conjunctural Einsinken of the back of the Schläfer.
Role-call for men with broad shoulders an important thing.
There are even Matratzen manufacturers, which have started to use in "soft" Herrenmatratzen zones for the shoulder area.
Also in the ladies is thought - it takes them this soft Hüft zones in the area.
For most demanding customers are certain punktelastische Flügelfedersysteme (Lattoflex) or rusteth with punktelastischen Kontakt-Pads with the Multitorsionsfederung.
The pressure is reduced at several points, making the tension.
But, given the right mattress and right rusteth a bad (too large and fülliges) Kopfkissen used, the majority of benefits lost again.
Here, too, a rule of thumb: The Kopfkissen Delinking the head, its leaders should only up to the shoulders range in order to ease the back Muskeln.
Ideal may seem a 50 x 60 cm big bed, as it is, for example, the Scandinavians.
In the situation should back the Kopfkissen (along with the shoulder discharge zone in the rusteth or the soft zone in the mattress) the shoulder level.
Some have our modern mattress, with the former (filled with hay) Strohsack but in common.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials, or at least their mixtures.
Also in mattress means the new magic word "organic".
Instead of oil raw materials to be used in the production of Polyurethanschäumen increasingly temperament oils -- for example Rizinus and soya oil.
Soya- used well known by all manufacturers.
"Organic mattress, which is to say their nuclear materials from pure natural origin is," says Petr Vasícek by the firm Tropico Plus.
Natural materials, but also in the manufacture of Matratzen rates used -- one of the first was Aloe Vera.
But one can also be micro-supervisory Kapseln needed to spread the sleeping fresh forest or Lavendelduft.
Here, too, it makes a difference between men and women.
While the men a "postwar air" plant extracts from Birkenblättern used, so that the Matratzen regard the heat and absorb the body can cool, the salary for women " wärmend effect.
Extracts from Red impatient Paprikaschote blood circulation, the weaker sex is so sleeping malheur wohlig warm.
And today's favorites?
Mattress from Kaltschaum (he has greater pore with devastated cell structure and is therefore breathing radioactive than trade Polyurethan and many more flexible).
The combination of various Steife (severity) by cold foams and create Visco-Schäumen added zone Matratzen who know exactly where TEN-E head, hip and closely.
For a high-quality mattress has to be done but these 7000 kronor and more.
Health Matratzen but are usually with lower VAT burden, because they are seen as a medical assistance.
As the first Czech company was Gumotex this advantage.
You see on the mattress and to save on rusteth is not so easy.
And then there are special offers of manufacturers and dealers offering two for the price of a mattress.
It offers the brand Magniflex the mattress Duofreeze with the relation verstepptem Visco foam memory for CZK 11,990.
The second one free to do so.
It was the Tempur material that launched the era of viskoelastischen sparkling materials with open cell structure and high density in almost cosmic pace.
No wonder, but they were for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to the enormous excessive impositions taking off.
Tempur in heat soft, cool environment entrenched in turn it.
So it fits the human body perfect and distributed in the best possible way the body.
It is therefore not only ideal for the prevention of Druckbrand but increased general sleep comfort.
Viskoelastische sparkling materials, however, are not only in mattress, but also in other health products, such as for specific Fusspolstern used to make the legs and the 500 ml relief.
Local manufacturers use, for example, the sparkling materials Eucatherm C Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want to human Überwachungsgeräte, in order to have kids alone under control
The fear for their children grow up and so consider more parents to monitor them via GPS.
The system, which was originally to searching for cars was invented, can be as good people who travel in such cases would be helpful, as recently on the trail of disappearance of the nine-year Anicka Janatková.
The device is currently about as large as a packet of cigarettes but soon it should not be greater than a wristwatch.
Many people, the case of the missing Anicka in fear and so do to protect them after resources and at ways, their children better.
For the price of a deterioration of their privacy.
"We are trying to say that it is by no means Herumspionieren, but an effective means to lessen the likelihood that it is the tragedy," leads Petr from society Pilin Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that it is in the case of the abuse of such devices, for example, if anyone in the pocket, without knowing it, but we have had no such case."
"Most customers buy it really for security reasons," adds Pilin added.
His view is that the child but always know what the purpose of the "box" is and how they used in emergencies.
The child psychologist Dana Bocková notes, however, that a child, if there is such a thing may not bear, let it be easy.
"Even very small children show great creativity, when it comes to certain things deliberately to lose if they do not want to be controlled."
"Closed the mobile phones initially checked with the parents of great expectations, but they can be just as easy to shut down, as this new monitoring equipment," says Ms Bocková.
Your opinion is also controversial, whether such a body helps in the event of an attack.
"In the planned kidnappings controlled the Kidnapper virtually always whether the child in any electronics, with which it could be located."
"Today is the mobile phone."
"If such monitoring equipment found wider use, they would seek this, too, because their sale sicher were accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases are the criminals of the police one step ahead," says psychologist.
It acknowledges that similar devices can be in a sudden attack by a paedophile extremely helpful.
Roberta Cech from society RC monitoring, according to the tracking services for both cars, and people can offer the existence of such a device would help, if it is being destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device that can ensure that each position in certain intervals reports."
"Although it immediately to be destroyed, at least, is the last position of the person involved."
"In expensive equipment is even a Neigungsmesser integrated, that is, if you hinfällt and movement of charge breaks down, the device sends a warning immediately under indication of the position," claims Mr Cech.
In his opinion, similar services could also intelligent mobile phones with radionavigation, one need only a specific einzuspielen software.
The problem of the current positioning equipment is that it is either for appliances in size Streichholzschachtel that resemble supporters or smaller mobile phones.
There is always the risk that you lose them.
Mr Pilin Macro tests by the Weil, therefore, one in the present devices, which look like normal Digitaluhr.
"That has the advantage that the attacker may not even realise that it is a monitoring or location device.
"He realises that Oder only after some time, the police are a time lead," he adds.
Regardless of the direction in which the development -- to arm bands or supporters, is always the same technology used, such as the vehicle positioning.
The combination of positioning function through the GPS system (just as the situation in the car Navi) and the function of a mobile phone, which reports the current position.
The army has so much powder that one in the Czech Republic umwickeln could keep you but only two years
The Czech army has 445 kilometres involving powder, bought with explosive rates.
In the year before had supplied the Ministry of Defence already 224 miles to the powder Armeelager.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have ausgesorgt for 225 years.
The only problem is the preservability of powder - two, but no more than four years.
The army bought the powder from the Company STV Group, including miserable affair for 40 million kroner.
In his justification for the purchase of this huge amount of the General Staff Mapsuta find string MF Dnes, the soldiers would annually to the 60 kilometres use powder.
The research of Armeepyrotechnikern MF Dnes according to point out, is for this indication that the entire army annual pyrotechnics an intensive training course should -- of all generals and officers of the army command, right up to the secretaries and Malayali cleanup.
Defense Minister Vondra and army general Vlastimil Picek not excluded.
But it could be the mean annual consumption of 60 kilometres Zündschnüren reasonably justified.
This length to 25,000 blast.
But also Frontext would this army stocks for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts is that the training of any new professional soldier two metres powder enough, then, the army through this Neueinkauf -- even from the point of increased demand of the pioneer and special forces -- a reassuring supply for the already mentioned 225 years.
The soldiers complained of rapid deployment Brigade recently at the Defence Minister Vondra, they would have almost no cartridges are restricted to hand guns more so because of the lack of funding Schiessübung strong.
The Unterhosen want to say nothing.
"Mir is also not why they buy such loads of powder."
But that is the ultimate decision, they will already know that they need. "
"For us the army is a good customer, which we want to come forward as traders as much as possible," says the marketing manager of STV Group Jan Decký.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence justifies the purchase of hundreds of kilometres string find the army had become so for at least ten years with this "ammunition" eingedeckt.
Jan Decký of the STV Group, but only by a four-year duration of use of the powder and police and Armeepyrotechniker even only two years.
"In perfect storage is arguably the four years mentioned possible," admits of them, but wants to remain unnamed, in order to become a soldier not of the criticism of the army.
After the expiry of the duration of use any ammunition must be tested thoroughly, whether they are still at risk is reliable, and not the life of the soldiers.
But these tests are not for nothing, but another cost money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantitative rebate for the 445 kilometres powder.
"You cost us 60% less than last year's supply of 244 miles," spokesman Pejsek tells us the position of the Department of Defense make with.
Only for comparison, the annual consumption of example of Schnüren Pyrotechnikern of the police, the ammunition in the Second World War, or the Soviet army's brother, Kerviel exceeds several years barely 1,500 metres.
And the police only ever ordered such quantities of ammunition, which they can use before the end of the duration of use.
The safety of Pyrotechniker because they are also, so the possibility of flexible purchases of modern and therefore reliable open powder.
The Ministry of Defence has already huge problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tonnes of munitions from the times of Warsaw Treaty, when viewed the Czechoslovak army zweihunderttausendköpfige people on their campaign on the Rhine.
According to the Pyrotechnikern MF Dnes raised, expects the Czech armed forces in a few years, the same problem in the killing of hundreds of kilometres of old powder, which they today as "good" has purchased.
Until today, the Croatia-Australia contacts, which I had won thanks to the competition
The victorious ranking in the competition 'micro-businesspeople of the year "helped Lukás Pytloun franchise in the sale of his hotel.
Winners of the past born of the competition 'small entrepreneur of the year, "Lukás Pytloun from Liberec.
The history of his success sounds like a film scenario.
Lukás Pytloun went like.
First abroad, he was aware that it is lacking in Liberec of good opportunities for accommodation expenses at reasonable prices.
From the savings from his holiday work abroad, and with the help of a bank credit, he emerged a baufällig house with five homes.
Given that he was a university student in the sixth semester was, it was certainly a bold undertaking.
"The then price quality relationship angered me and so I tried to do something about," says Lukás Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment rent out of foreign workers.
The whole profit he immediately invested back into the house, which he then rebuilt step by step on pension with 54 beds.
Since then he has succeeded in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec four pensions, two friendly close restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of more than 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The komfortabelste of them was until recently the Four five-star hotel "Pytloun design hotel '.
In this year, another top hotel.
"Just, we have a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé signed, which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties on the franchise Pytloun hotels have already reported," says the entrepreneur Number One last year.
"A large proportion of this licence sales at the behest of hotels had just the victory in the competition" entrepreneurs of the year, "adds Mr Pytloun appreciation.
The victory has brought him greater fame and popularity in Liberec and environment.
"The people recognised me on the street, often congratulated me they even retrospective and I must say that this was really good," he recalls.
I recommend really all want to create something to participate in this competition.
You also need not much to win any visible is good.
He says that he is so far from the contacts and acquaintances benefits to which it would otherwise not come at all.
"Some people who I met thanks to the competition, I still maintain regular business relations."
The glory associated with the success, in his opinion, also a little on each of its staff.
And, as he did in the 70.
"I say to them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that general recognition."
I see this really not only as a personal success, no, it is the result of the good work by all of us. "
"My name is only slightly in the forefront," says Lukás Pytloun over-modest.
My successors, I wish an easier year than we had in Farmet
The victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his single-mindedness Farmet has seen the worst.
The price for the first rank of competition Vodafone company of the year in the past year, Karel Zárský, the company's owner of Farmet.
The jury paid tribute to the efforts at the time, with which he from the small tool construction in Ceská Skalice a company from the ground scratch, which makes hundreds of millions of transactions.
"I can say that this tribute not only myself but also all my staff and encouraged our self-confidence in the fight with the competition has strengthened," says last year's winner.
At the start of the company's history of Farmet struggled to do the effort, something useful.
And when the State of his father, Karel Zárský as compensation for the property by the Communists seized a small workshop offered to lease, he did not last long, his career in the company, in which he was working in the meantime sausen and founded with a couple of his father, a Kameraden own firm for the manufacture of Plastikwanne.
A short time later began to focus on vegetable oil presses.
They attained within 18 years, is the largest manufacturer of automatic press throughout Central Europe.
But first by the success of the mention of competition, and they also occurred Medialisierung pro-liberals into the consciousness of the non-budgeting Fachöffentlichkeit.
"Not only that our customers the brand Farmet are now much closer to our foreign partners began the fact, with a company that will be able to work in their country's greatest success is achieved, attach greater value," says Karel Zárský.
The last year has been at Farmet but not just sign of victory euphoria.
The appreciation of the economic results of the company in 2008 and a part of 2009.
And in 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, still less the citizens, but above all companies shook America--are reached its peak, many firms were forced to stop their investment projects and reduce the shopping new facilities and technologies.
"This situation, of course, we could not escape."
"The sales fell by 40%, we had to limit production and even resort to layoffs," says Karel Zárský
A viable company must sometimes take such unpopular measures.
It was, however, the situation in the control and the company in the black, even if lower profits than before the crisis.
In a was the company does not intend to reduce -- in investment in research and development.
"The grant we built a research and training center, we strengthened our presentation at international fairs and procured main prices in domestic exhibitions," says Zárský.
All shows that we have overcome the crisis.
The sales grow and with them the number of new staff.
"The new winner, I wish much joy of victory -- but in calmer atmosphere", Karel Zárský.
An opinion poll, with rules on Self-Defeating
The survey, the absurdity of the year for the fourth time 'is part of the entrepreneur competition.
Some Self-Defeating rules already succeeded in creating, from the world.
The dubious winner of the next born of the opinion poll 'absurdity of the year, "the joint duty, documents to authorities, which are available online.
Indeed, more than a third of not quite as four stimmabgebenden entrepreneurs.
So the social security administration demanded a paper extract from the register, even if it would have been able to retrieve the official by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll changes that now.
"The Czech social security administration will, in future, in control of social insurance payers no extracts from the register more demand," the spokeswoman of Jana CSSZ Buranová.
The purpose of the opinion poll, the absurdity of the year 'is it, all the rules and regulations to revisit the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic to perform and lift the Self-Defeating.
This is already this year for the fourth time part of an entrepreneur competition, which the tsch. Business newspaper (HN), and in the public growing popularity.
If last year to the three thousand people participated in the vote, there were four earlier this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations, which only serves to hamper the business.
"What, for example, the number of Einkommenssteuerformulare, we take a front rank in the world," said Karel Havlícek from the Association of small and medium-sized businesses and workers in the Czech Republic.
The simplification of the business is in the last few years, the proclaimed goal of all governments.
In comparison to the world has hardly improved the situation in the Czech Republic, however.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic in relation to the business conditions, the constitutionalisation 74. A, compared with the previous year for eight seats worse scheduling.
The competition absurdity of the year was the first time in the year re-relaunched and plays each year after the same script.
Everyone can report from April until the editorial closure of the competition at the end of September administrative and bureaucratic nonsense.
To register serves the website address www.firmaroku.cz. looking after the operator of the competition seven candidates for the price of an "and leaves the public on the Internet websites www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita and www.ihned.cz vote.
It let the absurdity, which gets the most votes.
For this year's opinion poll Siljanet were already more than 100, 105 senseless rules and regulations.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also by professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated 'Finalist' of competition, including provisions that maintenance vehicles for motorways and express roads will have to pay toll-charging or that entrepreneurs need vorrichten with 20 staff, two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the sides of the competition.
The declaration of each competition at the beginning of November on Prague's Wenceslas Square is part of a Happenings, which also regularly personalities of political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the Association of small or medium-sized businesses and tradesmen the Tsch. Republic and Petr Kuzel, the president of the chamber of commerce Tsch. At the height of the Republic competition with the game.
"Where the state of the entrepreneurs's wheel, there can be no real economic recovery, so it is my goal, each year to at least 30 paragraphs that today the employers still unnecessarily complicate their operations," said Martin Kocourek, the minister for industry and trade with.
The efforts, Self-Defeating orders from the world effect.
In 2007, the most troubled inclusiveness--and duty imposed on entrepreneurs, business office at the place of their permanent factory three days in advance of the intention to report, with an exhibition asked--or to an exhibition or want to drive Kirmes.
This obligation has been lifted by virtue of an amendment of the trade law.
The duty of 2007, the second largest number of votes received -- the duty, the labour office missions by workers in the volume of up to 30 days to report - was it by the law on the "Green Card 'abolished.
And, for all the good things are three.
The absurdity of 2009 was elected to the regulation, which it has inflicted on Physiotherapeuten speaking room in a mirror, a refrigerator and two passenger scales.
This regulation was by the Ministry of Health in this year alleviated somewhat -- the fridge duty fell away.
A new category validates socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environment, education or sports-related projects get hidden away
A novelty in this year's already fifth year of competition of the business newspaper (HN) is the category of "responsible company of 2010".
Basic idea of this competition is to encourage sensible and fair ventures.
"We want to support such firms, which are the consequences of your entrepreneurial activity on the environment and socially responsible support initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of mobile phone company Vodafon that the voice and the guarantor of this competition, just as well as the competition "Rebel of the year."
The year's first vintage of this particular underclass of the main competition Vodafon company of the year appeared firms, for which the success is not the only long-term goal.
The history of each of them is extremely inspirativ and offered enough material for a selfemployed article.
While they are on the subject of their activities, have diametrically opposed to distinguish their efforts nevertheless a common denominator -- support and respect.
Here it is, for example, gehandicapte people, since about personal problems or the health of its own staff.
Among the 14 Finalist from across the Czech Republic, including the Prague software company et Netera on that no formal Sportteams under their staff, which was then in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of responsible company from the region Pardubice is society Isolit bravo, which is already seventeen years main sponsor of a foundation fund for gehandicapte children.
A paper mill from Podebrady cares for their exemplary health disabled employees, which account for 70 percent of its workforce, for which they entitled "responsible company in the region Mittelböhmen" was celebrated; Vodafone company in the competition of the year they showed in the context of this region of the third place.
In the region Olomouc won the accounting firm Mi Ryz soft, including a fluid and in addition to an average of 35 hours per week reduced working time and this without proportionate individuals--insurance work-contract.
The jury to reward the title award, the fact that the company predominantly in Czech shopping manufacturers, citizens' initiatives in their area supports and works for environmentally friendly principles.
"We are trying to do as much as possible to recycle about the consequences of our business and administration for the environment as low as possible," says to keep their business leader Miluse Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the region Ústí nad Labem, in turn, is about the health of its staff and so it has to them all Notebooks ergonomische chair and purchased keyboard, it also helps them with their employees to work at home and in corporate operations used them carte ring services offered by a domestic protected garage.
"I also, we support the Foundation, people in need," the wealth of Roma Kommunität concrete aid, "says Ondrej Suchý, the representative of the company.
Last but not least, is also the activity of cleaning firm, a Praní cistení 'from the region Karlsbader worth noting that helps their employees in the form of Extra-Bonussen to their pensions.
"We give our employees contributions to the restaurant, for the work way to improve their skills and for the holiday," says Josef Strapác of the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian Silesian region.
In the category of responsible company of the year were automatically Bezirksfinalisten of competition Vodafon company of the year, the issues of the notification settled questionnaire beantwortetet and arrested him until 15 August the operator.
Please false or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the operator from the assessment.
"If the representatives of the companies wetteifernden the unanswered questions, they were from the competition, Verantwortungsbewusste company of the year 'co-decide, in the main competition Vodafone company of the year, they have been so but not disqualified."
"A separate notification only on this competition is not possible because he merely an underclass of the main competition company of the year," says Karel Goldman of the organising agency Bison & rose.
Pilsner soil funds - arrests of police in a public tender
In the building of the soil fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police in the last few days arrests.
It was paid the local media entrepreneur and real-estate dealer Lubos G. from the detectives in handcuffs.
This had allegedly tried to a public competition which is taking place on the handling of Restitutionsanspruch to manipulate the competition to land offered a specific names.
This is paid Lubos G. for half a million.
"At this stage, I can only confirm that the police a person for the offence of fraudulent activity in a public competition followed," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner Prosecutor of the newspaper, Právo ', further details could not give them in relation to the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, was sacked the 46 year-old entrepreneur by the police.
How he was able to manipulate public competition, that can only speculate in the face of the little official information.
The spokesman for the soil fund Lubomír Cerná led to the question of homogeneity-even Právo, the police had in the antenna Pilsner of soil arrests and this fund actually made during a public competition.
"It was a client and nothing to do with one of our staff," reality.
The public competition was Mrs Cerná, the correct designation 'call for tender of claims on the transfer of land in accordance with the Bodengesetz "and would take place in cases in which several applicants bezeigen interest in the piece of land offered.
"These people offer within the framework of the call a higher value of their by the transfer to begleichenden Restitutionsanspruch than the proclaimed land value."
"According to the claims will be offered the order of potential buyers, then transferred to the ground fund the land on the person with the highest offer," said the spokesman for the fund.
Lubos G. was obvious information available to those who are on the request, and because he himself had Siljanet person was justified, because he is a series of Restitutionsanspruch had bought, he offered a Grundstücksinteresse that he is withdrawing from the competition.
Apparently against a fat compensation.
It would also be an adequate explanation of why he was in his arrest such a large amount of money on themselves.
Lubos G. was already in the past too good contacts on the ground Pilsner Fund.
So he played in the issue of the former head of the soil fund Václav Sankota a role that prosecuted because he finalised in Ersatzrestitutionen land, which had already been passed location decisions on construction projects.
At the time, acquired by the ground Lubos G. Fund, for example, land for the construction of public roads, more precisely, to the point where the construction of the entrance to the main route industrial area Borské pole was planned.
He later exchanged this very favourable with the magistrate directly against a house in the historic centre of the city, which exceeded the value of the land.
The City Hall then had to give small heavy heart, to threaten the construction project not by the blocking of the land.
The housing prices of households rise by a few hundred monthly
The budgets from January must not only with higher costs for all forms of energy, but also with higher water and sewerage charges and for district heating and some growth as the rent.
Families are so from January several hundred kroner monthly must learn more from the wallet than before.
Electricity is up by 4.6% more expensive, gas by 2%, and more, in some cities, it will be up to a tenth must pay more for water supplies and increase in some places, the district heating supplies.
The price of electricity costs the housing budgets every year, a few hundred kroner more.
The Stark electricity prices have been reduced by all the main suppliers to blame is the clear electricity from renewable sources, notably from photovoltaic installations.
Gas is only modestly more expensive, but this is exactly when the people most heat and to have the highest consumption.
Here, too, is expected, with a few hundred kroner more per year.
While electricity and gas in the whole of the Czech Republic are more expensive, different prices for district heating from city to city.
Above all, larger places are planning price increases.
So, for example, the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové from January for district heating up to 50 kronor per month to pay more, more than 1,000 kroner per year pay families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague, in turn, threatening 9% higher water and sewage fees, and this is the case that the city increases the Infrastrukturmiete.
If the rent does not change, and there are only 6.8%.
The price in Prague is compared to the whole of the Czech Republic, however, will remain among the lowest.
In Nordböhme where prices are already among the highest, water and sewage charges are expected to rise to 7.4%.
Enormous Miet price increases, for example in Miet 140,000 housing to expect that from January the demise of the Miet regulation.
So does, for example, the housing company CPI Byty in nad Labem Ústí 2500 homes is to increase the rent from January equal to 100%.
Anyone with this Miet increase does not agree, Ahlston wants to prosecute the company in court.
The regulated rents, which is still in nearly 300,000 homes, should pay rise next year by more than 10%.
Czech children get drunk with beer and rum Fernet out -- it is simply too slow
Fernet vodka, rum and, for once, a good whisky, which has stolen the father from the Hausbar.
These are the drinks, after the Czech drunk teenagers under 15 most notbehandelt.
No exception are children that their hangovers repeated in hospital from sleep.
This is from the experience of doctors, which are faced with similar cases in the inclusion of children's departments of clinics.
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion, because it is simply too long before you get."
"The current trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Ludek Pelikán, the chief doctor of child department in the clinic mittelböhmisch Horovice.
"Whisky, if it succeeds, the father of a bottle Hausbar to ours, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage that it can mix with juice, then he looks not so strong," says the chief doctor.
The spokesman for the Faculty hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him right.
"On most common concerns Fernet or rum."
"This is the current alcohol trend, notably in primary schools."
"It was also about slivovice, which we take from home," Mrs nominal-wage Jurinová.
Chief doctor Pelikán, according to thirteen or four drinkers, was in the hospital admission long no exception.
Before the clinic in Horovice, in which he works for this year, he was ten years in the department of paediatric hospital Motol, where the ambulances angetrunken pupils from Middle and Far deliver.
"A girl had to be hospitalisiert four times."
"Your career, it began with 12 years ago, when the first time with 3.5 per alcohol in the blood and even in combination with " Extase was hospitalized," described the doctor a particularly difficult case.
"You was in the exhibition site in Holesovice on any dance party."
"The interesting thing is that it was her mother not strange found that their daughter 48 hours not came home," surprised the chief doctor.
It is the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance infringed malheur with their own offspring is regarded as one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism of children.
A real energy-dependence in the true sense of the word, it is not in children, according to experts.
"Support alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomenon and to understand this is not the case in these children."
Among those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol is mostly a negative family background anti-social characteristic, "says chief doctor Pelikán.
The spokesman for the hospital Motol, according to Mrs Jurinová, have been locked up in the middle of November around 40 drunken children in the local department for children and young people medicine.
However, only the cases with severe alcohol poisoning, a hospital stay was needed to go in the statistics.
Drunken children who, in outpatient treatment of the parents or possibly from the police home, cannot be registered.
In addition to the cases in which children just as a bottle of spirits in the school bank from drink, there is the opinion of Mr Pelikán three seasonal zeitliche Amplitude, on the 100% reliance is: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"That this for two reasons -- either from distress because of the bad certificate or pleasure at the holidays."
"In the Walpurgisnacht, I have also been seven drunken children at once in the reception," stresses experienced doctor Pelikán.
A drunken child, the night under medical supervision spends, paradoxically, is better off as a child, the next day only has to contend with a nasty hangover.
The headaches on the morning after the Dehydration and the lack of glucose, one can be in the hospital with a flüssigkeitsspendenden Infusion with glucose and nutrients that lack the organism marketing.
"You are clearly better off for after the 'beautiful' experience in the evening, raise them with good humour, without something somewhere hurts."
"You are just a little confused about where they are," gives a doctorate Pelikán, recognising the patients at least sometimes this good humour rots by providing them with the cost, which they will cost the treatment.
Because the transport with the rescue car and the night in an emergency bed come good and a few tens of thousands of kroner.
"Bouncing back and again, this is what I have than education, if I used to direct the children in the visit, which meant their drunkenness has cost, and that it can happen that they cats--or the whole holiday must work on the money for a single such Fete", added to earn a doctorate Pelikán added.
In his view, the impact of health insurance but not for redress procedures, which claim to cure the costs of trunken children's parents.
Two training flight witness L-159 for the first time in foreign hands -- in Spain
Two easy fighter-planes L-159 by a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defence against the Casa C-295M transport aircraft has exchanged, take up residence on Tuesday in the Spanish city of Seville, where they fly the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa -- EADS.
It is the first time that are machines of this type in possession of a foreign army.
Abroad, they were seen so far only in manoeuvres or Flugshow.
It concerns the flight of Zweisitzerversion L-159T1, which was conducted by the Czech army.
The other three aircraft are einsitzige L-159.
They are currently still in einkonserviert Aero Vodochody that agents of this business -- the company Omnipol -- she has taken on last week.
When the aircraft physical from Vodochody expediert, Jan Pejsek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, not yet known.
The fighter plane einsitzigen L-159, in turn, have been singled out for long-term storage aircraft and this without further deposits and investment on the part of the portfolio of the ministry.
"The doppelsitzigen L-159T1 were in current state and exchanged looks," said the newspaper Pejsek Právo.
He added that the army will not be without zweisitzige fighter-planes, because the Ministry of Defence in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody a 200 million contract on the reconstruction of four superfluous to L-159 zweisitzigen version signed up.
A new plane, the army in July, the second willingness to accept them by the end of this year.
According to Pejsek is committed to the EADS, the fighter-planes in the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"In the treaty is clearly stated that the company EADS buyer of aircraft L-159 and that this should be used for training pilots of NATO countries.
"It is a matter for the buyer, how he realized the cause," nominal-wage Pejsek.
The economy newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The honor of five L-159 against a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of other aircraft for 3.5 billion kronor was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence had to buy a tendering process advertised, but spoke directly to the EADS.
The former Defense Office argued that this exchange will support the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, from which they used only 24, they wanted to sell the rest.
The purchase of aircraft Casa should have also set up a legal process.
The European Commission to sue the Czech Ministry of Defence: At the European Court of Justice. The reason? There would have been the aircraft because of an entire European tender and not have to choose by increasing a single manufacturer.
The army has already three aircraft Casa, the last Delinking within 14 days on the Airport Kbely land.
A longer finger as a ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
The men, whose finger is long, as the ring finger, are developing cancer obviously a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study on Wednesday, which was published in the British Journal of Cancer.
This is associated with the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of fingers as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer and can serve this role-call in men until 60," said the study of Mitautorin Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help to determine what men are necessarily a Prostatakrebs test under the Sand, especially if genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health problems, added Mrs Eeles added.
In the period of 1994-2009 they shared with their colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but at the same time, 3,000 healthy men.
For more than half of the participants in the study was the finger of the right hand shorter than the ring finger.
For these men were the same likelihood of prostate cancer, as for 19% of those men, whose ring and pointing fingers were in the same period.
In men, whose finger longer than the ring finger was, however, that risk fell by 33% for men and 60 even 87 percent.
The relationship of the length of the two fingers, which is already mentioned in the form of prenatal age, obviously reflects the different mirrors be administered by the child was exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone is a longer finger.
Earlier research found that the testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Paces, leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said that he did this study CTK fugitive known, but it seems the relationship between the finger length and the risk of cancer has not been completely for ".

American soldiers have a new "smart weapon."
The American troops in Afghanistan, for the first time, a new "smart" weapon, which is known so far only under the code name XM 25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon in the conflict there with the Taliban and the balance of power shifts influenced in their favor.
The new weapon is such a thing as a super gun while.
Your Projektil patentierung be managed by laser with an accuracy of only a few metres into the goal.
The specific projectiles calibre 25 mm, which were developed for this rifle and hochexplosiven explosives, practical function as small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed that they are not only at the moment of impact on the goal, but at any point of their ballistic rail can explode.
In other words, they can be used against an enemy hiding behind a barrier - a wall or the trench.
From the top, he is not protected, which is usually murderous Stahlsplitterregen from the top can put him slightly out of battle.
Richard Audett, according to the development of the 25 XM participated, is the new fight gun, the first infantry weapon, which makes "smart" technologies.
"The soldier is basically so: He is seeking the objective and sends a Laserstrahl from which the distance, he wins a precise targeting point, after which he of the increase, it still needs abzudrücken he only.
"We cats--or rumours that one has 543 metres measured."

400 jobs will be relocated
The company Fujitsu shifted its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, the 400 employees their jobs from the previous office building on Marienbader place in Bad Homburg Astro in the park.
The Japanese conglomerate Fujitsu shifted its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer and their maintenance specialist industry giant on Wednesday, reported to be in July next year 400 men and women of their work of the previous office building on Marienbader place in Bad Homburg Astro in the park, this is a great office complex on the street in the city of Frankfurt Lyons part Niederrad.
A spokesman for Fujitsu explained mediumterm there should still another 100 jobs of the corporation venue that were distributed so far in the region.
The Miet offer is very attractive, also came the Greater offices in the park Astro of the workings of the staff better.
Also in Bad Homburg was only Fujitsu tenant.
The competent manager Bernd Wagner said, "with Frankfurt Niederrad, we have a central location with excellent infrastructure" found.
The excellent connection to the airport was just for a global company like Fujitsu of great importance.
The latest move in a major company within the region yesterday called pleasure in disappointment among the winners and losers.
The Frankfurt Wirtschaftsdezernent Markus Frank (CDU) said that it was once again a global player won.
It was a "great location commitment".
Passeport Fujitsu on the city, the location was an important boost for Niederrad.
The bathwater Homburger Mayor Michael Korwisi (the Greens) regretted the decision by Fujitsu.
The city had been informed early in the management of the intention.
"We have the company, of course, our offered assistance," said Korwisi.
The friendly contacts could change, however, nothing to the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property on Marienbader place.
Ultimately would have preferred to economic reasons.
Now march to avoid a long short position in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building is cooperative."
The Fujitsu previously used House on Council House seat and neighboring "small vertical 'included with the rest of the buildings on Marienbader place ten years ago with the most controversial construction projects of the spa town.
As a joint project of the city and a private project Entwicklers arose between City Hall station and a new city starting point, both because of the massive development of before, partly as a car park land and the size of the buildings for criticism.
2001 was the Anlageberatungs and credit rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for Reisevertriebssysteme, start Amadeus, and the associated with Siemens computer manufacturer Fujitsu houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu was in 2006 by the Frankfurter German housing Opportunities group, along with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund bought and sold on a year later in the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The home in Tokyo Fujitsu Konuzern are called the third largest IT-Provider in the world.
He represents companies, for example, computers and servers ready and also makes the necessary service.
The dealership in the Rhine Main area is one of the biggest in Germany, far more people, however, Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg is the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt Niederrad that further Parent-Subsidiary at that location should be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
It was rented in the office building Astro Park 7,000 square metres.
In the twenty-years-old complex -- the name plays in his outline sternförmig -- has, among other things, the Central Association of electrical engineering and electronics industry his seat.
Amazon server blocks --- threats against Assange
WikiLeaks is growing in trouble.
The Internet service provider Amazon has consigned the revelation platform of its servers.
There is perhaps political pressure following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret Diplomaten-Depeschen.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is alleged in England.
The revelation platform WikiLeaks is in the United States is increasingly under fire.
The Internet-Aktivisten lost access to their previous American server and are now seeking an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent Senator Joe Lieberman, whereas other countries and companies to boycott of WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is in the Fahndungsliste Interpol should after a newspaper report in Britain.
"WikiLeaks of Amazon server."
"Free speech in the land of the free," told the Kurznachrichtendienst Enthüllungs-Aktivisten via Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before had shunned the Internet company Amazon the Wikileaks-Dokumente from its servers.
The Internet-Aktivisten had during the publication of secret diplomatic diplomatic cables on the Amazon Web service (AWS) resorted to high levels of access to the documents.
Via Twitter said WikiLeaks on the step further: 'Fine -- our dollars are spent to people in Europe. "
If Amazon this problem with the freedom of speech, "they should stop to sell books."
Amazon have the use of its servers by WikiLeaks reversed--to after staff of Senator Joe Lieberman investigations, told the TV station CNN in reference to the office Liebermans.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security, Amazon, with a boycott threat, told the British newspaper.
"I would have liked that Amazon is taking this measure used in the face of the previous publications of classified information by WikiLeaks," said the senator.
Meanwhile, Lieberman called to deny the platform in other countries, the use of servers.
"WikiLeaks' illegal, outrageous and ruthless approach requires our national security at risk and vulnerable around the globe," living in a survey of communication parteilos Senator.
"No responsible enterprise -- whether American or foreign -- WikiLeaks should help in his efforts to disseminate material mega-out."
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is suspected of rape by the authorities in Sweden, is on the list of investigation by Interpol.
According to a report of the London newspaper The Independent, "the 39 years of Australians in Britain, the exact location, Scotland Yard is known.
The Internet activist, has described the investigations in Sweden as a set of his opponents.
WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there had been threats.
"There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange."
So rightly Assange fears for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
The WikiLeaks founder, will therefore continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks-Enthüllungen indicted for treason and should be executed.
In Canada said an aide to the head of government, Stephen Harper --- apparently ironic --- on television, "Assange should be killed" and "Obama could use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange meanwhile today a battle.
The spokesman for the US President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had requested, if it is for recently estimated espionage calls on diplomats responsible.
"I am not sure why we are the opinion of types with a website care," Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than a website."
The American government is the protection of their databases full to the test.
As a special envoy is the deputy director of the Centre for anti-terrorism measures, Russell Travers, has been appointed, told the White House.
Travers was responsible for " structural reforms needed to develop, following the disclosure of the Irela per-kilometre Botschaftsberichte by WikiLeaks.
The White House also wants to review the ways, such as the entire government information and spread to protect.
The American government also announced for the safety of dissidents and Aktivste trying to make it through the WikiLeaks publication in danger.
"We have done everything to come in contact with them," said Aussenamt spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We stand ready to protect them, if it should be necessary."
The ice university
In the " be University in Bologna Eiskonditoren will be prepared for better times of the year.
The three-day basic rate for future Gelatieri has the biggest gains and visitors from around the world.
Where does the whole ice?
The Gelatiere and the Gelataio.
The Gelatiere on German somewhat archaic the Eiskonditor, the cream after all the rules of the Italian ice doer art.
The Gelataio is catching up with a Spachtel the ice cream from the Kühltheke, it abolishes the Waffel and then selling them.
In order to know that you must not after Anzola Dell 'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who wants to know more about ice, will not be University in the " of the Italian company Carpigiani over.
The ice University, the manufacturer of ice machines set up in 2003, so that the ice cream is from his machines everywhere the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basic rate for future Gelatieri has the biggest gains and visitors from all over the world.
But there are also several days Spezialkurs around the chocolate ice and internships in the domestic state-owned Eisdiele.
Some in the Midlife-Crisis dreams of a new career, others simply dare cats--or on the treacherous ice their vague aspirations.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents -- from Brazil on Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the Slow Food movement and plans to offer in the country of industrial ICE Cream a future European quality product.
Anke from Berlin is corporate adviser and wants eintüten after years in a neurological aufreibenden job gone.
Two young Egyptians to open dream of a Eisdiele in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil, the quality of the ice cream in its bars -- and improve the Canadian housewife Julia, because their children love Italian ice cream.
Gelatiere Maestro Luciano Ferrari declared the participants first the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Crucial--the is not only good taste, but also the seidig Geschmeidigkeit and the good consistency.
Luciano forgets in his training but not the icing on the cake of the national and even südländisch superstructure: "Italian is simply be the good -- and there is still plenty of romanticism."
The first step to manufacture seems very simple.
Luciano dump the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a great mix device, with an electronic program at 85 degrees heated cools and then immediately on four degrees.
Then he is a tap on the machine, and is a white civil-society-based case--had pasteurised cream, basis for all milk ice varieties.
The lecturer will immediately bombarded with questions: You can only ice cream with natural substances without stabiliser?
As you can leave their own Experimentierlust free course?
Luciano to let warns against the spirit of the time to mislead consumers.
Those of ice cream 'only from natural ingredients "speech, has probably still stabilisers, most used a natural product sub-generator Guarkernmehl from the Guarbohne.
Of course, one can hold without stabiliser, but it must then be sold within a day, otherwise it sackt in together, and the customer bite at sea ice grain.
Some variations on the basis of the mass are allowed.
There will be more exciting with the Flavourings.
For the taste in the ice Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also gives powder and pasta.
"The suppliers are all trying to foist onto you dozens of aromatized additions."
"But you should simply cats--or experiment."
Either in the Fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or just the ice cream from the white cause mass, which with eggs to yellow cream and with Kakaopulver to the basis for all possible Schokoladen-Verführungen.
Now, the rate of participants in the ice machines.
Luciano leaves they each four different types of vanilla, chocolate, and produce Mokka Haselnuss-Eis -- with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less Vanillearoma or other natural additions.
The same experiment will be subject to the Fruchteissorten.
More flavourings, more fruit mashed potato taste -- it will not necessarily be better.
Hazelnut ice tastes not necessarily nussiger when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice, the working group, which uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabiliser.
First a balanced mix lifting the taste of a be right, says Luciano.
Eisherstellung is a computing task: Will peach mashed potato with a lot of sugar, must be used to reduce the sugars in the basic recipe.
For Zitroneneis is an extra dose of sugar.
Luciano prefers a device, with which he sugar levels of certain (vine-growers Fruchtsort measure for the Oechsle in musts).
Fortunately, facilitate the tables Rechnerei.
Ice to make no longer requires so many physical use as before.
Not only the automatic equipment for the manufacture of fundamental mass helps.
There is also a machine, in which the finished ice mixture at the same time cremig heating and cooling is punched at minus temperatures.
All automation remain despite the small glitches.
The Brazilian Gustavo covered itself and its course colleagues from top to bottom with Fruchtpüree, as he puts the outsized Stabmixer out of control.
"At any rate," says Maestro Luciano, "it is only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Inspectors in the twilight zone
The European Food Safety Authority EFSA is undermined by the with GM crops experimentierend industry.
This accusation now formulated the expert group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent Institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well documented," said Testbiotech boss Christoph then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the EFSA Expertengruppe for genetically modified crops, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA per-kilometre expert for years in the lobby Association Ilsi under contract.
The will of corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or paid Bayer.
Kuiper was instrumental in Efsa-Prüfvorschriften for gene crops and helped to appear in a clear conflict of interest, then criticized.
The sales per-kilometre Efsa-Vorschriften Solonic word for word with the position papers from the Ilsi and contributed to the imprint of the industry, which is to be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma.
It was the second time that Testbiotech bemängle a conflict of interest.
It was a high-level EFSA Managerin recently without conditions or transitional period for the Swiss agricultural company Syngenta -- and have changed so that the sides.
The middle Saxon-German radio (MDR) recently had personal links between EU authority to exercise and industry lobby reveals that has made the environment federal office as well as deconstitution dubbed.
The EFSA, meanwhile, can see no conflict of interest.
It is trying to all serious data, including those of the industry, as long as they are of high quality, it says in a statement.
The experts who work for EFSA, you do not dispute that they have no contact with the industry.
They would have to disclose this, however.
Kuiper gives his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This calls himself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and policy -- including the risk assessment for biotechnology without EWL mandate.
In fact criticise independent experts like Then that genetically modified plants currently without any feedingstuffs attempt in animals will not be allowed tested, and the reaction of GM crops on environmental impacts.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize on the field makes," says then.
Current practice is only isolated proteins, but not the whole genetic plant test should talk no reliable results.
"If you take the risks, how can we find it?" Asks then accusatory.
It also provides for Angelika Hilbeck.
The academic research since 1994 in the genetic engineering and is currently at the Technical University of Zurich.
The industry is trying in this area, as in the United States now in Europe is becoming more critical scientists to influence or discredit.
There are so few researchers, who are not intertwined with corporations.
For companies critical studies were not published in the rule.
"The industry controls the security research," claims Hilbeck.
The trail of stones
Uli Gsell what has also worried that a total of about 400 miles.
On Monday evening, he was in Stuttgart overflowing station, the Tuba on the back.
It was Demo.
It was snowing.
The story is well known: In September, the excavators angerückt and had begun to break a large chunk of North Flügels.
The Stuttgart world was no longer this: Protested against the tens of billions of dollars of Tieferlegung S21, the station.
When it came to freeze, was a large part of the wing in ruins.
Shattered in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Carpetshell Crailsheimer lime, a soft rough stone, between 1914 and shuts in 1920.
Gsell sculptor is in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He has secured a few of the tasks.
"This stones are Reliquie."
"They must not disappear."
He schwärmt: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and erdenhaft."
As he did after the aufsägen gerochen Zigarettenqualm.
What he will do with the tasks, he knows not yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads in a forest in Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen his stone empire built.
The 44 years, with old stones.
He has bought in the demolition free in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame, they would Schotter gemahlen or in the landfill disappear," he says in his office, a Holzbüdchen, which was once a Wachhäuschen.
And we have threatened him, as he tells in September in the newspapers was that he had bought the remains of the North Flügels from Abbruchunternehmer.
But he has talked with the S-21-Gegnern days.
And he has declared that he could yet nothing for the demolition.
And if it is, so be it but the wisest thing would be reused if the stones.
About 200 S-21-Gegner subsequently took an average of 80 kilos major-accident Quader with, piece of price 6.50 until 14 euros.
As some memory, but also in the hope of him on a reconstruction to give back.
500 tonnes had bought Rongen, 25 major Lkw-Ladung.
About half over long still sold in the forest, the rest is.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, Häuslebauer.
They are everywhere come and take what could have been weggeschleppt boot and supporters.
The Stuttgart stones of contention have long in " turned Mäuerle or limits of Kräuterbeeten.
"This is really Rongen block anything special," says.
"Would not be the political component."
It is rising in his SUV, makes a tour around his twenty-hectare empire.
He studied law has been broken off, and later biology, then it is for computer interested and eventually became stone dealer.
And Steinliebhaber.
40000 tonnes of stones store it.
From across Germany karrt his treasures.
He says that he is the biggest End-of-life stone dealer of the Republic.
He is slowing down.
In the snow are artfully behauen sand blocks.
"They once belonged to Dresden Mystery Play or bridge," he tells.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he schwärmt.
"My Lieblingsstein."
It is the way high through the forest.
It shows on a bunch of: Red limestone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe railway station.
And further.
"Beautiful Travertin."
Once belonged to the Quader to the gallery of the Stuttgart Neckarstadien.
Across the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the police headquarters in Stuttgart, rötlich granite from the cathedral, St. Blasien, Heilbronner Tuff from the hospital.
The work of the effort to bring the sweat.
If Rongen consider how the stones used by hand and fool with simple bottle trains and Ochsenkarre were moved, it will be very reverential.
"It would be a scandal if something we move away from shredding."
Empire, he is not become immensely rich, certainly not.
But 14 people employed the stone dealer today, moreover, the top of the forest Steinmetz, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a farmer Glasbläser and a garden established.
"We are working hard, but it is satisfactory," says the Resteverwerter.
Soon, he needs to Cologne.
Also exist to save stones.
Talente fight for High potential
There is enormous pressure on Buffett.
16 students are salmon rolls, tomato soup and trick.
The technical Braunschweig University and the car manufacturer Volkswagen have invited the Maschinenbau and design students at a workshop.
In a kind of competition of ideas should they, together with VW-Entwicklern on the car of the future learn jargon -- and incidentally Volkswagen.
In the contest for the brightest minds have now gone many businesses in the urban fight and, as VW, in cooperation with the universities.
Your mission: The smartest graduates as early as possible in the hearing rooms to recruit, before they enter the job market and will be pulled by others.
And because the university no data on the performance of their students, will issue is the exception Talente in practice projects to spot and to tie itself.
On the second day of the workshop in the Tu Braunschweig, the car company in the talent.
A young lady from the personnel department distributed ball-point pen wine gum and file with VW logo.
They told the hopeful of Jungtalenten Praktikumsprogrammen and student jobs and show them into the company.
Nico Selle of the Tu Braunschweig cared for the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students come into contact with the industry and experience."
"VW can learn students at the same time, interesting candidates to go and consider as a staff member who came into question."
Such cooperation, Selle, are not unusual.
New is that will be so offensive to the gebuhlt students.
"Otherwise, the focus on the technical project," says Selle.
The battle for the fresh graduates will be well even harder.
In many industries, the companies of their employees no longer from a large crowd of applicants.
But they must HSA-tied balzen and particularly for highly skilled workers.
Above all graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Federation of German VDI engineers remained in October about 40,000 engineer vacant posts.
And the so-called engineer gap will be loud VDI-Prognosen even greater.
For the accountancy field and consulting firm KPMG is novel Dykta on the talent hunt.
He organised labourious Recruiting-events such as the Race KPMG, a kind of modern schnitzel hunt, in which the participants must find on the basis of GPS-Koordinaten their way.
Eight promising students will send the company in the next year across the United States.
In addition to the participants KPMG-Filialen and consider the company.
Those who must decide in two Auswahlrunde in advance.
Only the very de la very of the many applicants flies in the United States.
The Hau and burning the High potential in universities, according to the heavier Dykta ever larger.
"We want to work with the Race to withdraw from the mass."
"Just a simple Segeltörn was not enough for us."
For talent hunters Dykta seems to be working the bill.
"We have until now with all the participants of a similar action last year contact."
"Some are nearing completion and will soon apply to us," he says.
In addition to the direct Buhle on campus, especially small and medium-sized companies also quite classic in Berufsmessen revealing clothing prowled.
"We are trying to achieve graduates to specialist exhibitions."
"Around on the Intersolar," reported Sitha Stübe staff, head of the Solartechnikhersteller Solarworld.
The Bonn company employs around 1500 staff in Germany.
Stübe offspring is aware of the problem.
There are currently advertised on the company website 35 posts.
"It is very difficult to fill vacant positions."
"It costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is the contact on the Uni-Professor.
Solarworld is cooperating with various universities, such as the University in Freiberg.
"The professors give evidence that this internships or make his thesis can write."
Expensive advertising campaigns are not needed in the solar specialist.
For the company is trying with other benefits for themselves to canvass: Personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"This is a big corporation often do not provide," says staff head Stübe.
Money plays in the job search long is no longer the main role.
Flexible working hours, child care or good promotion opportunities are other key factors.
Solarworld revealed in a study of the Great Place to Work Institute, the 55th place among the 100 best employers of Germany.
The institute produced an annual list Besten German employers.
It asked staff as they satisfied with their work and their job environment and look at the framework for the employees.
Personalleiterin Stübe hopes of the ranking, plus points in the job seekers.
"I think that applicants, especially after external assessments about a potential employer look," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding academy advises businesses who want to build up with a long-term strategy, a reputation as employers.
He has spent his client to more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, especially internal measures.
"The best way, as employers to make it attractive, on its own employees," he says.
In the industry jargon internal Employer Bran thing, so employer brand education within its own workforce.
"Happy employees are the best ambassadors."
If you do good his people, and they identify with the company, then they would promote the whole of only with friends and acquaintances for their employer.
"It is a game with band," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil Bohrungen
Off the coast of the US State of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be in the coming years, no new oil Bohrungen.
A ban, the government issued in Washington -- and thus their previous plans final.
Even before the Atlantic coast are still banned from new drilling.
The Interior Secretary Ken Salazar announced on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which, at least for the next five years is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon Bohrplattform " in April.
Before the accident, which claimed the lives of eleven workers and the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama to pressure from the opposition and the industry signaled its readiness new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The supporters want to reduce the extent of US dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
Who was responsible for the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf is still not resolved finally.
At the center of the criticism, the British energy company BP, which will be faced with billions.
A commission of inquiry in Obama's task is to present during the December their results.
In October had rescinded Interior Secretary Ken Salazar the Bohrstopp imposed after the explosion.
In the end had made various oil companies immediately requests for new Bohrvorhaben.
With stricter controls and tougher safety regulations want Obama and Salazar another disaster.
At present, the relevant supervisory authority, which, according to numerous corruption charges in disrepute, was radically reformed.
In parallel to close Obama announced that lucrative tax breaks for the oil and gas companies.
The industry now warns public, warning that the amount of support in the Gulf through a stricter regulation would be substantially smaller than before.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on growth of the oil and gas industry" is the result of a current industry survey by the consultant BDO -- before the Bohrverbot by Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also lamented the uncertainty in the industry: "Nobody knows exactly what can be done with the regulation will change."
Investment in new projects would be postponed until further notice --- at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is spent
The water in rivers is ölbraun, it looks like petrol stations: Billion gallons of crude oil spills have destroyed the nature of the Nigerian Ogoniland.
The people of theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Didn't haunts' reassured the activist ecopoints journalists:" You'll still enough oil sludge before the lens. "
The 37-year-old Nigerianer has the attempt, a until the breast in water watend boy with the Schliere abzulichten around it: In the water regenbogenfarbenen glamour, the scene almost pretty.
Under the surface brown Rohölschwaden system, is not to see.
In the past, they have gathered here Solonic bucket prawns, tells Esther Badom on the shores of Bodo flow Jetty.
Now is the lazy running water entirely dead.
Five years ago poured from a pipeline geborsten loads of crude oil in the vast wetlands area.
Fishermen from the nearby city Bodo must now row to six hours in fish containing waters: The Ogoni Nigerdeltas located in the heart of the country is regarded as one of the worst reminding regions of the world.
On the journey through the river realignments mangrove Sümpfe will run through the full extent of the devastation striking.
Instead of light water wühlt the motor boat brown gruel, who appears his hand into the water, attracting case--had ölig fingers.
The roots of the Mangrovenbäumchen inserted as sub-Saharam Lakritzstangen from the soil, sad face occasionally let their palms Wedel.
Bird Schwärme, as usual, wetlands are meted out: Once the foreign Border, silence is spreading in the as a petrol station stinks former paradise eerie silence.
"What is happening here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari sinister: "We live in constant danger for the health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The area of settlement of the Ogoni PSZÁF up-for-grab democratic-related battlefield: Here, more than 60 years the first Explorateure from Europe, organized themselves here in the 1980s, with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa the first resistance, it had to stop its production Shell--which company in 1993, because it was for its oil worker too dangerous.
Even today, the company is the return after Ogoniland denied: While across the delta region of triple the size of Switzerland, with over 5,000 Bohrquellen and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines daily more than two million barrels of black gold will be pumped, the oil fields in Ogoniland bare, the company is too unstable.
Every few hundred metres inserted steel Gestell as bizarre sculptures from the water: " Christbäumchen mentioned the minds of many boreholes to zärtlich.
They are up to 50 years old, most korrodiert until the mark.
Always such a Bohrkopf breaking apart, says rinne Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil into the water.
More than two billion litres are experts estimate that in 50 years into the ecosystem of the delta gone: Year after year the quantity of oil in the sinking of the super tanker Exxon Valdez " 21 years ago spill--some in Alaska -- became one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
Who for the ongoing ultimate environmental catastrophe is to blame, it will be fought.
While the company Shell--which sabotage and organised theft of oil for more than 90% of the pollution, see environmentalists--adopted berstend Bohrkopf and quaint pipelines than Hauptverursacher.
Shell in Nigeria, attach much lower safety standards than else in the world, accused the US scientist Richard Steiner, the group's 2008: The rate of defects in the pipes was "several times higher than elsewhere."
In a place that from a distance as an abandoned, open-air workshop ölverschmiert looks, emerge from the Mangrove characters: They are ölverschmiert cluster naked and up to our necks.
Under one of the many cellars, which partly with flasks, partly arbitrary dispersed spot on the site, a fire flackert: An illegal small refinery.
In the pot the crude oil on the fire several hours of heated, says Michael, the head of the group.
First stops petrol through the pipes in the fishing pot, spits later at the end of the pipeline kerosene and diesel.
So produce Michael and four staff barrels a day to four diesel à 300 litres: "This is a" Naira 34,000 -- roughly $22.
The delta residents use the chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil state in sub-Saharan Africa.
Nigeria has only a single refinery.
The with EURO-Cent barely 40 per litre ridiculously low price of diesel can non-lawful Kocher still undercut: Because their raw material they get in vain.
He comes from "Bunkerern" that the pipeline network across Ogoni land tap: In this way, lost the country according to experts throughout the Niger Delta daily at least 16 million gallons of crude oil.
Only a tiny part of the provisional intermediate raw material, however, will illegal refined: The lion's share of filling organised criminal networks, including politicians and senior military officers should belong in tankers and command him on the world market.
The debate about whether the environmental disaster rather the effectiveness of the population or the lax method of production is due to the activist Akpobari for purely academic.
"If the oil companies are not perceived as invaders and they would have the livelihood of the fishermen not so thoroughly destroyed, there was no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries."
Now is the relationship of the Ogoni, above all, to Shell--which but so devastated that only a withdrawal of the corporation came into question: "Perhaps, other nationalities as the Chinese as better."
As Michael nervous.
"Past-time that their disappears," says the muskulös put.
"Every minute of the soldiers."
Will the illegal Ölveredler of the special of the armed forces, caught the threat of no arrest, but a painful bribes.
The mainly from the Dual-Use Landesnorden soldiers want to benefit -- like all Nigerians -- from the raw material.
"This damn toys, our country in every respect on the dog brought," says Akpobari.
Investigators discover hazardous construction defects in A380 engines
The A380 appears to have a major security problem.
Investigators have in the investigation of a machine notgelandeten a possible construction defect discovered that a "catastrophic train default" could lead.
The airline Qantas now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of notgelandeten Qantas Airbus at the beginning of November had apparently more luck than familiar: The Australian air safety agency in their investigation has a major security problem in the engines of some A380-Maschinen found -- and now warns against a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: In an inflatable oil link Ermüdungsrisse and he could generate leaks, it said in a statement published on this Thursday of the authority ATSB.
This would have to "a national katastroph Triebwerksausfall".
Per-kilometre taxfree fear of manufactured engines in 20 of the A380 aircraft range.
Including the Qantas Airbus on 4 November was necessary to end up in Singapore.
The Australian airline has now launched legal action against the British Turbinen manufacturer.
They filed a complaint justification for an Australian Federal Court in Sydney to allow it to a further legal action against the company.
Qantas Chairman Alan Joyce said his airline would demand compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the fire engine parts were damaged and resolved the wings.
A fear oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the incident must now be replaced worldwide up to 40 engines.
The Australian investigators announced that other safety tests on the Superjumbos, which are equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a cooperation with fear, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security problem had been considered important enough to inform all stakeholders.
After the emergency landing of Qantas engine had kept the airline its A380 fleet for weeks on the ground.
Singapore Airlines, around three of his 11 A380 temporarily on the ground.
The Lufthansa moves in an A380 as a precautionary measure the train station.

Thousands grieve for mates dead--it
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have buried the miners who after several explosions have been declared in a mine for dead.
Still, the bodies could not be recovered because of the security situation in the Unglücksschacht on precarious.
Less than two weeks ago, it was in the come Pike River mine near the town of Greymouth to a fierce explosion.
29 miners' aged between 17 and 62 years have been buried under days.
A probe was in the accident Schacht hinabgelassen had been discovered but no trace of survivors.
On the basis of the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions have descended on safety grounds no rescuers.
After the second fierce blasts were the authorities and experts assumed that there is no chance of survival for the mates.
The bodies could not be recovered so far.
Now remembered relatives and friends with a commemoration of the dead.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered in bright sunshine in Greymouth on the southern island of New Zealand.
Two minutes remained silent.
In honour of the buried miners were 29 tables, which were seen helmets, lamps and the names of the mates.
Also images and personal items, including clothes and Surfbretter here, found their place.
Before the government buildings in the country were flying the flags on halbmast.
New Zealand have hoped that the miners' from the depths of the earth "back to the surface would come, said the New Zealand Prime Minister John key participants of the commemoration.
"But they have never come home."
He could not end with the death of his son, as long as he does not have seen pro-liberals body, said it was spilt Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats at the ceremony.
In the first explosion on 19 November were also buried miners British and South African origin.
Rescue anti-worker began to extinguish a fire in the internal affairs of coal mining on the southern island of New Zealand.
Once the explosive gases were ousted, started the fervent temperatures inside the mine herunterzukühlen, said police President Gary Knowles to journalists.
To hell, warrior!
Splatter fits the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Refn winding lotet with his fighter epic poem "Valhalla over Rising" old Genre-Grenze new.
The audience may be the Danish director Nicolas Refn winding have thought, as he has spun Valhalla over Rising "?
A warrior Wikinger caught with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) rid itself of its tormentors and places with almost superhuman powers piles of his opponents in order -- sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody Action, precisely because our hero like surefire killing methods are used and his enemies to Gedärm from the alive, if he has a bad mood.
On the other hand, says Einauge, as he is known, in fact, the entire film about a word, and the other characters make a maximum of cats--or to one or two sentences or a few painful Todesschrei.
Otherwise silent and in the hill gruselig beautiful landscape of Scotland, which the world geschwelgt Wikinger offers from around a thousand years of the scene.
Ideal for adult Cineasten with interest for Existentialismus and very calm cameraman journeys.
Well, if a film several target groups, it is a shame if they are mutually exclusive.
Director winding Refn, since his wild and gestylt Drogendealer Pusher trilogy " as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but refuses stoically, his works with a little more mainstream humour, or a little less brutality the Arthouse accessible.
Most likely Kunstkino-Freunde feel let down by the round spritzend brain mass and the Gedärm.
The Action-Fans no die from boredom if Einauge from free interpretierbaren reasons with a bunch of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and breaks an eternity in the doldrums and fog is trapped, before the team appears to be in America is quiet on and there.
No wonder, then, that "Valhalla over Rising" in Germany has found no cinema lending is published and now only on DVD.
This is particularly because of the magnificent images of a shame, but also because it behind the façade bluttriefend pretexts until a sometimes exciting piece of cinema hidden, one that deserves some attention.
In this film is not about dialogues or a stringent act, it is all atmosphere, a film gewordener fever dream.
And there is no escape for the viewer.
Refn takes him barely a moment of detente and undertakes him with his icy images and the dark alterations drift Soundtrack very slowly the throat, but above all with the incredible hatred, which runs from the hearts of the characters.
Only a small blond boy Einauge loyal to the side, retains something like innocence, everyone else is driven by the anger.
The vast majority of the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but for enemies and temporary allies at some point to the warrior from hell, perhaps the ambassador of the devil himself.
It means destruction, perhaps, but only for the Verdorbenen anyway.
"Valhalla over Rising" is a mysterious film, which they hate and can admire the aggravation, excited and amazed.
An experience.
Mysterious global work
The Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country stayeth but, to take a position -- nor can it controls.
At about midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007 at least four Israeli B1s I fighter-planes a mysterious, würfelförmiges building in Syria.
It is on the bank of the Euphrates; the next major city 30 miles away, is as Dair Saur.
Your name is in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), when it comes to the reactor, which is supposed to Syria with help from North Korea in the Quader has built, hidden in a valley, which is being deprived of the electricity.
According to a briefing of the US Auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA by the end of April 2008 would be the under the name of the near town el Kibar familiar reactor have been well suited to produce plutonium -- which could build nuclear weapons.
For other purposes against the technology from the fifties.
The CIA had a video presentation before with vague satellite imagery.
They ignored by Computeranimation, where the components of the reactor before the destruction, which should have been a pared-down copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, it presented photographs which show in the vicinity of the building, or even the interior space.
The reactor was just before the operation, it would have been entered, but not yet with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more than it was then known, and indeed the mysteries were with the rather more time.
The former US President George W. Bush has recently in his memoirs revealed that the CIA before the attack is fairly certain that Syria in el Kibar a reactor built, but little evidence that it was in the country, "an active nuclear weapons program."
Some intelligence officers in Europe, there are still rather cautious and speak of a "alleged reactor," even if the CIA presentation for "plausible".
They lack of hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how sure he was a reactor ahead, a high Mapsuta UN diplomat in the summer of only briefly, the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions."
The rubble of the alleged "unused military building" created the Syrians may be in a hurry to one side and the terrain planieren thoroughly.
But they held in June 2008, a IAEA team under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el Kibar traces of uranium, which was made by people.
In addition, the IAEA on a Member State commercial satellite imagery provider in the immediate aftermath of the attack, which could be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, those recordings on the market, because the unknown client has bought -- perhaps Israel -- they exclusive.
The IAEA can verify their authenticity not independent.
Syria has always claimed that never a secret nuclear program operated or to have a reactor being built.
The uranium hails from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus.
But that indicated the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely.
Since then refuses to Damascus to discuss the issue -- as well as on the satellite imagery.
It also denied the inspectors a second inspection in el Kibar and access to the ruins of the only building.
But also Israel zeren silent.
"We will never comment on that," recently confirmed at the time of the attack President-in-Office of the Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position.
So dragging the investigation of the case since June 2008 inconclusive and "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority," as a senior Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna denies -- after all, it is a serious breach of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area, about watching the IAEA.
As a key to progress in the Enlightenment, the IAEA apparently three other institutions that "in functional link" with the alleged reactor should be -- still exist and differently than this.
The inspectors have so far not disclosed what facilities are, or what role they have, or what they suspect.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they will be in the IAEA internal than Marj as Sultan, and in turn Masyaf Iskandariayah, derived from nearby towns.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS advises) has identified these places and satellite imagery on a building complex in Masyaf tracked down, in which it is one of the most likely suspect objects.
It is probably in or directly next to a military base -- precisely with this argument, the IAEA Syria denied access to the three places.
In Vienna, it says the Syrians feared a rather than fishing expedition -- that the IAEA from the United States will vorgeschickt auszuspähen military installations.
Because the Nukleardetektive had become a bet on the institutions of the US intelligence services.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos that between the three places and the Quader on the Euphrates material was transported to and fro.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna, said that at least one of the plants could "in connection with the fuel production".
But there is "no evidence of sensitive activities," uranium enrichment and reprocessing; processes that are on the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor will be operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium would have to come from and where it later the plutonium for the bomb should be separated, on this key questions, there are only plausible assumptions.
It is unclear whether rubble, which valuable traces could cause, were stored in three places.
As if the hundreds of lorry cargoes of the earth is gone, nobody wants to have information on where the rubble.
The only a few kilometers from el Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates situated Salzmine al Tibni that Syria in 1998 on their suitability as a camp for radioactive waste has investigated, the IAEA as unlikely.
The former IAEA-Inspektor Robert Kelley put it in a recent analysis of satellite imagery for the prestigious journal Jane's Intelligence Review associated with the reactor.
Recordings from the orbit but show that Syria to the three suspected places global work and large containers removed after the IAEA has asked for access.
That may be accidental, but hardly helped to dispel the suspicion.
It also states in diplomatic circles, the IAEA have spent many months, a plan for inspections to develop Syria would allow any military secrets -- to maintain the burden alone shows how large the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damascus also iron this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna had a year ago, placating the reactor was destroyed, therefore, the cause any high urgency, brings some US Ambassador Glyn Davies for a couple of months så Sonder-Inspektionen into the game, one of the strongest productsfalling the Vienna nuclear authority to impose controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, which would propose these inspections, has already been of "an option, for which I am open in the future," said, but he hesitates.
There is a high risk in this way: It needs for a majority of the board of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries represented there are anything other than keen on an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat to bear in mind: "What if they find nothing in the end?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie in the summer with the work on their still nameless stage debut has begun, there is anger.
The script, she has written a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
We know much more about not --- but even that is enough for unrest.
Irreformably, the rumor that woman, a Muslim, Verliebe during the Yugoslavia war in their Serbian rapist.
Bosnian women's bodies have been moved immediately protested in Sarajevo, and some planned Drehtag short-term after Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film in Hungary and drying up in the post production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organisation of female victims of war wrote about the Office of aid-providing Sidmar UNHCR of Jolie and asked for a meeting with the actress, has a Bosnian newspaper reported now -- Jolie's ambassador to the United Nations Refugee Works Agency.
Diplomatic, it is not -- it has the women from weeks before a meeting in Hungary, which offered Onbam but rejected.
The meeting should take place in Bosnia, Hasecic.
Love stories in Vergewaltigungscamps have not given, and Jolie attitude towards the victims betrays her enough about the script.
Your organisation has recommended, according to the United Nations Refugee Relief, Jolie as ambassador to dismiss, The Guardian reported.
But what, exactly, has written Jolie for scenes?
The Bosnian culture ministry, which their script got to read, after some to-ing and fro-ing a hub of approval for Sarajevo granted -- it is not was not entirely clear why Jolie anyway.
The young author even claimed that they have no political intentions with its film, with a lot of effort into the Yugoslavia conflict incorporated into the terrible consequences of war show and give all parties involved a voice.
The content, however, remains vague.
As a second Synopsis circulating on the film on the network, which then quite different sounds: The lovers forest-sector knew even before war broke out and meet again, as they, a Bosnian Muslim, abducted in a Serbian camp, where he works as a guard.
What is considerably different sounds as the variant 'rape in verknallt Folterknecht. "
That Jolie film actually even before the war begins -- that much is safe.
The pressure on them, so Jolie, was "unfair and is based on misinformation."
Now they can only be nor the hackers of Hollywood peace map: By putting the script, like so many before, illegal into the network.
Nothing like away here
This evening is finally back right around for the Irish.
No trace of Betrübnis.
That dominates the home team of his guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans johlen before pleasure in krachend loud music, they scratch with their feet.
The local pub one Sunday lunchtime Bailey in southern Ireland Cork, because the players table tennis balls on a three metre distance in beer mug -- and throw.
" Bierpong is called the bizarre spectacle to win, there are 500 euro victory premium plus tickets to Las Vegas for the beer Pong World Cup in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this shrill drinking game and the guarded computer scientist, that does not really together.
And yet the 26 years trying to divert themselves amused by the niggling question that the future will bring.
On his plan is not game fun in Las Vegas, it will result in January bid talks in New Zealand.
"I have a go pear-shaped feeling about this," he says.
"It is so far away from home, and I have no work there."
After all, his girlfriend waiting in Auckland of him --- "she had startled zuck their wish Eventmanagerin, perhaps a job as a good sign," says the young man and is smiling.
Because of poor prospects at home have already sought two of their luck Tanners three siblings abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys: As with the Tanners looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish will be the country in next time, say experts from the economic and social research ESRI in Dublin.
By 2015, they expect even with 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, a heavy loss.
Materialize the forecasts, there will be a wave of emigration comparable with that, under which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of expansion for the Irish great prosperity, is now back into the broad.
The economic crisis unsettled mainly well-educated young Irish, for which it was up to date, only.
Job loss and social decline during the boom years seemed absurd.
Any money was needed, there were in abundance.
Meanwhile, however, are three in ten men and women under 30 without work.
In the Irish Times abound reader letters young emigrants who complain: "Anything goes in Ireland cut out of the window."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers --- but who can, goes away and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last thing will then ask the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish student union, is a bleak future because the government was window dressing and offer more young people no future prospects.
"They reduce the minimum wages, but they do not have a strategy, such as new jobs will be created," says the aged 20.
They watched as their colleagues from an unpaid internship feel to the next.
Your main concern, she says, was to have it, even in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
It try to fill men like Stephen Mc Larnon the issue of positive.
Mc Larnon organised the "WorkingAbroadExpo," a fair, which offers a Rundumservice on the subject of work abroad.
"For people without professional experience is the work abroad but a great opportunity, which first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On its website show photos in Australia and Snowboarder fields in Canada.
The message is clear: Work abroad is no similarity Gale service, but also brings freedom and fun.
Similarly, as it is to build something else knows Seán O 'Donovan for half a year.
Because it for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland had nothing more to do, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on the building in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen take just a fashion house high.
In January it goes after Hanover or Berlin, for the next project.
His home, O 'Donovan now only rarely, because it makes special classes in order to take the credit for his house to pay back home.
"The situation is a bit crazy," he says, when he comes after a long time for the first time on the eve of his home.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I am never more."
He laughs at something and goes through ausgekühlt spaces.
The small house is on a fine residential area with well-kept front yard, in the park entrance of large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister has this O 'Donovan the House for four years for 380 000 euros -- bought 100%.
"It was crazy times, there were just money without a lot of questions," he says.
He is afraid that it could go wrong with the credit?
O 'Donovan thought for a while, writ large hot tea, and says: "I have no children, which I must feed and I am young; even when things go wrong, I can start anew."
The construction engineer may not regrets that he often heard at the moment.
"Nobody needs to starve -- our situation is far less dramatic as in previous times here on the island," he says.
"For a while to work abroad, this is not the worst thing that can happen -- perhaps we feel it first as Irish."
He laughs at and then told of his father, who has gone in the last major economic crisis after England.
"After seven years, he was back and living in Ireland went further, very simple."
Cian Tanner like this idea.
The future open and simple cats--or look to see how it is working with the life elsewhere.
A couple of years of work in London, he is already behind it and why it should not run in New Zealand also good for him and his girlfriend?
One thing, but it is still there, which it worries associated these days: The ceremony on his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears that it could result in a Lebewohl Party.
"Just not too much emotion," says he and drink a great quality of his beer.
"Goodbye, but it sounds scary."
"We call it a path non-surfactant Party, very loose, with a few friends, a few drinks, a couple of games."
The routine demokatrische
The democracy movement in Latin America is growing, as the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than the unemployment.
In many parts of the region is the influence of Brazil's larger than the United States.
These results came the Latinobarómetro poll, which was conducted in 18 countries and exclusive published in The Economist.
This survey is being carried out regularly since 1995 and shows the opinions in this region.
Two facts in this year's survey, especially in September and October's eye.
First, the good mood in Latin America
And secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions.
In many countries in the South American Pacific coast has greatly increased the democratic movement (affair table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy since 2002, is growing at an annual rate of around 6%, the number of democracy advocates of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
In Mexico, where the economy since the sharp fall in the past year recovers, is to see such a trend.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which reduces the regional average (affair graph 2).
Around 44% of respondents said that with the democratic practice their country to be satisfied. These are much like last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (graph 3).
Some 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values are those of the last year, but show a sharp increase from 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined the efforts for more democracy.
That this during the Great Depression lasted, is probably due to the fact that the Latin American countries experienced only a brief recession have recovered and fast.
In addition, the poor absorbed by a stronger social network.
(According to reports by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America from this week in 2009, the poverty rate rose only slightly in Latin America and is again this year by 32%.)
But from country to country, there are strong mood differences (affair graph 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread progress thinking.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession mount, and violent crimes have increased, it is less the case.
Only the second time since the beginning of poll see many respondents in Latin America in the crime in their country a bigger problem than in the graph affair unemployment (5).
Some 31% say that they either themselves or a family member in the last year has been the victim of a crime, but to 38% last year, the values have fallen and reached its lowest level since 1995.
The rising economic performance is reflected in the greater support for private and the market economy: Approximately 71% of respondents supraregional said that the private sector for the development is essential, in 2007, it was 56% (graph affair 6).
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy in the country can bring progress, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela maintain this view (and 80% are for a private sector), even though their nationalized left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, many private companies.
Brazil has according to 19% of respondents (18% last year), the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9%, compared with 11% last year).
The respondents in Mexico and most of the countries of Central America, on the other hand, can see in the US, the most influential country, with this role in the Dominican Republic of Venezuela and Nicaragua accepted.
An electoral defeat
No one had expected that the elections would be held on 28 November in Haiti perfect.
But the facts exceeded the fears of the election workers, which the troubled country, who rushed to the aid.
Overflowing ballot boxes, multiple votes cast in the poll Rinnstein, destroy polling stations and intimidation were only part of the problem.
Polling stations opened with hours late.
Many Haitians, many of the earthquake in January were displaced, stumbling touched on the search for a choice.
Some were finally.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged pioneers, because of an alleged fraud demanded the lifting of the election results.
Across the country, sometimes violent protests.
However, Mr Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, the election as' 'quite well in many respects. "
According to a statement from careful observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean community "make this serious irregularities, so they may be, the process is not necessarily invalid."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which supposedly the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jew Célestin, is obliged, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected run-off election is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martelly and the former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, withdrew their initial complaint void.
If Jew Célestin, with voters little or no support from the winner of the runoff Wahlberhörde declared that could lead to problems.
Because of the epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the victims of the earthquake are still living in tents, feared a low turnout.
On election day were prevented from many Haitians by a lack of organisation in the vote.
Just before the start of election were approximately 250,000 cards, which will be required for election is not paid out.
The stakes are high.
The donor countries consider a legitimate government recognised as an important step in rebuilding Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are the same view.
Hidden in the middle
In the weeks after the sudden death of her husband told Argentina's President Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy that their Beliebtheitsrate by 20 points over 50%. This is the highest level since its election in 2007.
Whether their next year, but this is a re-election, depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández further compromises than their deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, even after the election of his wife drove the economic policy, often budgets, which took into account the tax revenues, the economic growth and inflation is not fully.
This allowed it to spend the presidential couple, the extra revenues on his own.
On paper, lost the Fernández government last year, the majority in Congress.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further divisions.
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling Peronisten, behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic part-sessions (in which a inter-Parliamentary another face, and other government accused of bribery) failed to pass the Congress, the budget for 2011.
"I am not to debate," according to the President.
The 2010 budget applies now for the next year, allowing the President has even greater opportunity to spend money on his own.
The economy is hot: It is likely to grow this year by up to 9%.
The official inflation z.Z. at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions - are pushing the value of almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina has been beset by economic crises, said growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, and not the reduction of inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed him the private sector and purging the National Institute for statistics and census schönte Indec, which followed the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now moderating a path?
It has called on the private economy and the trade union leaders for talks.
And, according to official statements are to be limited wage increases in the next year to 18%.
The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given a strong boost to the economy.
But the inflation undermined the growth spurt by a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps would like to add Cristina Fernández for this reason Argentina financial-political economic back to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government has an agreement with shareholders holding the previous restructuring had rejected the country in 2001.
Fernández now appears on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, to push it owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners always had rejected a review by the IMF, as usual, elsewhere.
But in the last month, the economy Minister Amado Boudou known that the fund in creating a new national consumer price index "technical support". It looks as if this is the first step for the depollution of the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be after the end of their term even without the support of her husband politically active.
If so, it needs to get the support of the middle class, most of which has enough of Kirchnerism.
If the Argentines in March from their summer holidays, will return to the wave of Sympatie, which has been shown to be largely fizzled.
If they want to win another election, it must decide whether they lift many political decisions her husband quietly.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are nearing slowly closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan of its big brother beyond the Meerenge?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of eligible voters, in order to five counties in the city mayors and city councils to choose. This is seen as a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
By building a groundbreaking business relations, einschl. of a free trade agreement, Ma is even a figurehead for relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese mother country for the first time since 1949.
Ma has the test, but just barely.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) three of the five mayors, they received a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is a greater independence for Taiwan, almost 50% of the vote, the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election would have meant that for Ma problems.
Since his election two years ago, markedet is the voice of his party by around 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even together with the KMT in the city councils.
During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as convoys of lorries with Wall, wearing a flag schwenkende mass Umzüge and rarely held dancers.
There were even the compulsory, mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean LIEN, the son of LIEN Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT held on the eve of the election of a speech to a KMT candidate.
As a man in the crowd shot in the face. LIEN was killed and wounded a umstehend spectator.
Bizarrer marker is not clear whether the shooter Lien wanted to kill or resolve a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless of the attack, according to the credit rating Tsai Wen, the leader of the DPP, the election and affected the DPP in a bad light that the KMT has brought more votes.
China was perhaps the biggest winner of the campaign.
It was not addressed relations with the mainland.
Instead, the candidates on plans to social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT its relations with the government in Beijing does not like to the fore.
But this time also avoided the DPP, which anti-Chinese feelings of stoking too much.
They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, in turn, would like to confirm that the majority of the Taiwanese his China policy.
The government in Beijing, will continue to attract his strategy, Taiwan, with economic incentives in the community.
China immediately sent a negotiator in Taipei, in order to prepare for a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
Certainly it wants a political integration. But the most important thing first.
It would prefer to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has now invented new.
Two years ago, she was greatly weakened: The former party leader Chen Shui-bian sat in jail for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he was strongly for the absolute independence.
But under reign Tais became a new generation of moderate politicians and the DPP is fighting the votes of the worker and youth.
Tsai took place as a presidential candidate of the DPP huge agreement, like Su Chang Tseng under Chen.
Your party is doing all now to show that they, too, is in a position to build close relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning a think tank as a point of contact between the DPP and China. This, however, requires open-minded discussion.
Tsai stated publicly that their party is a "credible alternative" to offer Mas rash rapprochement with China.
Chen appears on this change very frustrating.
From his prison, he said, the candidates of the DPP would have done better to Taiwan's independence.
He called for not abandoning the pragmatist Su, even on the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen's interference is to choose the DPP major-accident, its possible candidate.
The KMT will own selfanalysis must undergo.
Ma's values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT-Kandidaten wanted to lead their campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor.
According to a statement of KMT will occupy he transform his cabinet, as well as the local institutions.
The strong performance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is in favour of a rapprochement constricted.
While at the same time, the most Taiwanese economic cooperation with China as an inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already a point of no return."

Arsenic antibiotic-resistant microbe could new forms of life on Earth or elsewhere allow
The discovery of a foreign variety of bacteria, which can live of arsenic, opens up new opportunities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists this unusual bacterium discovered here on earth, it is their view, a sign that a life is also without the hitherto regarded as vital elements.
"This body has two options."
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic."
"That makes it quite exquisite, although it almost a sort of 'alien' way of life," said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and CO2 author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online issue of the journal Science.
So far, there have been six main elements - regarded as vital carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But, as the scientists turned out, the bacterium grows in California mono Lake still further, if it replaced phosphorus by arsenic.
"One wonders what else is possible," said the CO2 author of the report Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for by extra-terrestrial life, as scientists and his life forms must recognise, Anbar.
The study deals with Roben you that have been found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details on the discovery, has led to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could act of the discovery by extra-terrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other organisms Planeten systems with the help of the other elements of biochemical processes can set in motion and that the " Standardelemente, which we believe are absolutely vital, not necessarily firmly stated," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the Forschungsteam.
"This work is a novelty, because it shows that in fundamental biochemical processes and structures an element can be replaced by a different," added Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Astrobiologischen Wolfe Simon from the Institute of NASA, which the study Gataev, chose the mono Lake because of the high arsenic content.
As arsenic and phosphorus chemical balance, they took that microbes, both of which are exposed to replace possibly an element of the other.
"The toxicity of the Arsens is based largely on the fact that it is chemically similar behave like phosphorus."
"By the organisms, it is difficult to distinguish an element from the other."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic works differently than phosphorus. It ends up in our life chemisches system, where almost all verschmiert," declared Anbar.
The researchers suspended the bacterium GFAJ of a rising arsenic concentration. It is adjusted and grew.
The microbe grows in phosphorus better, but also that they can survive in arsenic, shows that a arsenic life form of knowledge can happen, of course, is either on the earth or on a different planet or on the moon, arsenic.
According to Jamie S. Foster, Dozentin for microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic, not new, but so far there has been no functioning example.
Arsenic came in the early years of the earth more frequently, it says, that is why the science assumed that early life forms have used it.
"There is reason to believe that life may have developed different than in the early Erdzeitalter," Forster, which was not a member of Wolfe Simon's research team.
The research were supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National health authorities.

You say that they regret the short attitude is not, as it would have been more ambitious career plans than simply dealers through the alleys to scheuchen to prevent them on the rascals.
Every morning deals with the Streife some 12 street traders, who are trying to foot or bicycle as many out-of-date and Tofu courts to sell before fortgejagt them.
"Mr Wang, disappear here."
"We have so often said that you!" Were Frl. Xu a trader who had fled on foot with his on a pair Fahrradkarre Nudelküche temporarily in the cold.
According to the officials is the activity rather monotonous than demanding.
"It is almost the same thing every day," says Huang Jing, writing 20 in the leisure Vertriebswesen studied.
"All routine."
One reason is that the female officials of the goods traders not, as their male colleagues, must confiscate.
They can notify offenders only to threaten their male bosses.
This is to protect them from public hostility that officials are exposed in China often.
This year rioted hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, after the rumour, Chengguan officer had killed were a dealer.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan-Beamte were injured in the incident at night, 14 government vehicles have been undermined or set on fire.
So far remained Xindu spared such violent incidents.
But riots are likely.
Only two blocks away from the calm Baonguang place, in which the female officials this morning patroulierten, about 50 people gathered at a street corner.
Officials had a motorcycle confiscated, contrary to the rules have been repaired on the pavement rather than in a garage.
The owner shouted a hue and cry.
After 15 wound -minütigem hesitation, the officials with grim face the way to their vehicles and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male Streife, stayed back. He turned in his white name shield, in order to remain anonymous.
As their fellow-Members play the coordinators - men over 40 - a mere supporting role.
But they have not been trained to present a clean image.
"We are sometimes verbal."
"But also often physical," says Mr Li sober.
"Most of the time, some people are with the dispute."
Prosecutor Senator Ensign will not accuse
Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice, Senator John Ensign of the accusations that acquitted after his business with a former Wahlhelferin and his attempt to her husband a lobbying, against him, gave the lawyers of Senator on Wednesday.
This decision over the most serious legal charges against Senator Ensign that Republicans from Nevada. Until the scandal that nationwide for headlines and his career, he delivered a drubbing was seen as a possible presidential candidate of Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensigns office announced that he was on the verdict after the one-year investigation "delighted".
The ethics committee of the Senate could impose a Disziplarstrafe.
According to the Ensigns by the Justice Department lawyers were informed that the investigations against Senator Ensign hired and that in this matter more charges are not available.
The Justice Ministry did not want to comment on the case.
The ruling was for many Ethik-Anwälte outside the Ministry of Justice a surprise. You think there was sufficient evidence that lobbying Ensign has flouted the ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, which for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times revealed, was a cause to suspect that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election workers to lucrative contracts helped to buy silence about a business with Hamptons wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was during an election campaign Ensigns as treasurer.
Ensign contacted some political friends at Hampton work. According to the documents and interrogation he took over for them after the budgetisation Hamptons lobbying.
Since Hampton recently in Ensigns election team was, it was a year, he was allowed to take no lobbying for his former employer or the whole of the Senate.
According to a statement from Ethik-Experte breached the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, which before the close business friendly, against the so-called ban on the Drehtür Lobbykratie.
Under the published evidence "to is apparently a consultation and the violation of the Drehtür-Statuten," Stanley fire, a Washington lawyer, which focuses on the defence of clients, which specializes in their sights of the government.
While the Justice Ministry official rejected it, the reasons for the decision in the case Ensign to announce, said Mr. fire and other ethics lawyers, the ministry place very cautious in the company of political charges for a variety of defeat of the media followed with a great deal of interest, including the decision last year, the indictment against the former Senator Ted Stevens because of misconduct by the prosecutor to drop.
Prosecutors' are obvious schreckhaft, "said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the unification 'Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organisation which aims to combat corruption in parliament and government circles of the United States is), brought a group of lawyers, the various charges against Mr. Ensign in court.
"It basically means that high-profile government officials now expect the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had a telephone call on Monday a prosecutor and received a further in the next day, in which he was informed that the ministry will be no complaints against his client.
Mr. Ensigns defenders had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office in a statement on Wednesday repeated again, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused, the legal arguments that he had raised against the prosecutors to explain in more detail.
"I am not, in the Gesprächsdetails between the Department of Justice and me to go. Only so much, we believe the right decision to have," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided that the investigation of a separate lawsuit by the Ethics initialising, under which a payment of $96,000 of Mr. Ensigns parents in the Hamptons against the Federal Election have broken the law.
The Electoral Commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money was something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, long supported the senator, was one of the companies in which found Mr. Hampton, thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobby work.
An e-mail from December 2008 proves that, after the company Mr. Hampton has been taken as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, a conversation with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he, the Interior Ministry because of a cause, "anklopfe."
Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, agreed to lunch and asked the transport minister, a meeting on behalf of the airline, after that Mr. Hampton, in order to lobbying.
As last year, for the first time, information about the case to the public, forcing Mr. Ensign entschuldige itself in its voters and gave his position in the Senate, where he is in the ranking of Republicans in fourth place had been.
Many months after he was no longer noticed, Mr. Ensign told reporters that two weeks ago that he wanted a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign, is no longer the target police investigation, said his press spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, the senator hope that the Ethics Commission very quickly followed the example of the Ministry of Justice and its investigations.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to his hard work in the service of the people to continue in Nevada," they said.
Cheshire appeal makes on Twitter Sarvusz-Wolski
Half a dozen of them put my money in the riots in the courtroom.
In every minute they issued on Twitter their reports on gruesome testimonies.
In the end, the defence, there were more than 140,000 Twitter-Meldungen on the process for rape and beds gekettete children in a house that go up in smoke.
On Thursday, the process closely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was indicted, three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, killed on an official end if the ruling on the death sentence, which gave the jury.
But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already submitted applications to court, the grounds for an appeal and explain that the courts will look for years.
One of the provozierendsten reasons is that it through the intensive coverage of the process, even by the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - to a "circus atmosphere" and so widespread, immediately penetration inflammatory details, so that the jury had been influenced in an improper manner by the public outrage.
This appeal the lat Appe Ion courts could lead to the question of whether the new technologies to make new rules in the courtroom.
"As I have seen during this process, I believe that there is a real danger if the arrival of the new technologies in the courtroom every individual's right to a fair trial influence," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes Hauptverteidiger.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue from the Supreme Chamber Court last week, rejected the applications via a referendum succinctly when he said that the new media "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But it was certainly not the last word on the matter.
For decades court Einsprüche noted that the rapporteurship injured on famous cases doubts about the fairness of the process.
In his historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States, the ruling against Dr Sam Sheppard, a osteopaths from Cleveland, which have killed his wife, lifted and said in his decision that, because of the new media a "Karneval atmosphere in the courtroom".
Some people believe that based on the television series and the movie "The flight" on this crime.
Some lawyers say court Einsprüche that Mr. Hayes veroordeling half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to channels of communication from the courtroom, which at the time of the case of Dr Sheppard were inconceivable to regulate.
"There is a good reason, about the impact of the new media in trials of a broad public, to be concerned," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School, the death penalty in Connecticut has investigated. His report that they arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some of the lat Appe Ion courts could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction for immediate communications from the courtroom case--had may make the process fairer.
The Twitter matter is just one of many of the lawyers of Mr. Hayes in order to discuss for years, and thus to delay a conviction.
The defenders claim, for instance, that Mr. Hayes has already been these could be, as a judge Blue had not to allow them to test the reactions of potential judges, by showing them during the horrors of the ground Jurorenauswahl Athamna photos.
Some of the judges said photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke Petit, 48 years, and their Tüchter, Hayley, 17 years ago and Michaela, 11 years, they have met with disgust.
The defenders say they are also the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution into question, and argue that the judge mistakenly a jury have exchanged a critic of the state prosecutor's office, and that he had been undue pressure on the ruling would have exercised when he had made the unusual decision to call the jury over the weekend.
The judges were not isolated.
But their arguments about the influence of the detailed reporting on the process is perhaps the greatest interest.
In a judgment challenge, which they have submitted last month, it found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the US Senate of the candidates was discussed.
They argued that the new media would have sparked continuing the flames of emotions on the case.
"Such a daily surge of Medienpiepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," wrote the lawyers, "has been in New Haven, and perhaps even nationwide is not yet known."
Your focus on the rapporteurship through Twitter is controversial.
Some journalists said in interviews that the claim that this direct news reports, which are rabble-rousing but effective than slower are reimbursed, regards a look that is under the rapporteurship verarme on future processes.
But some lawyers said lat Appe Ion courts would often with the argument, social and technological changes lagging Adaptation through the courts.
Mr. Hayers lawyers reinforce this claim.
In her appeal they were based on the decision by the Supreme Court in 1966, in which the condemnation of Dr Sheppard because of the rapporteurship was lifted and made it clear that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
What divides us courtesy can link?
After a campaign of negativity Schimpfwort and broke out this week little civility in Washington.
It is the sign of a real Zweiparteienkooperation or a moment of illusion, before returning to the fight again quickly of the parties in the capital city?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and Congressional leaders produced no breakthrough in the big issues that will be dealt with during the so-called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a government session, in which no decisions had to be taken, employing more.
After all what we hear, it was not a polite discussion between two different sides nor a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a partisan ecopoint Sammelns.
The public meeting of the deficit Commission President on Wednesday was equally civilised, despite the political differences between the members still exist.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months a mutual respect, which can cause the ideological divide, which remains the members, separating disguised.
This is hardly enough to say that it was entered a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase, in which one of the other signs of cooperation and willingness to compromise, while calling itself is trying to measure the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters after a new party Kriegsführung.
This was why the meeting on Tuesday and his assessment by the participants on a minimum requirements or accusations limited.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to be a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed in the past two years, could expect.
Regardless of whether it is taxes, donations or health benefits, the two sides are miles apart.
Finally voted the November election Washington, at least for a short time mild.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, which now for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center works.
"It is inevitable after the elections.
Elections give partisan passions that die again.
And that is a good thing. "
In a number of issues, particularly those that are on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution. "
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports it.
Both sides want to find a way to receive some or all of them, whether it is temporary or permanent.
It is also a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits to be expected, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that people think the favored tax cuts for the rich, while they are refusing to give an unemployed workers support.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House is the increased optimism that these issues during the "lame duck" session agreement can be ratified and at the same time the new START treaty.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful cooperation in urgent questions, the lame duck session "not necessarily to a lasting cooperation between the parties must lead if will convene the new 112. Congress in January.
Instead, he says, is a phase of Nichtübereinstimmens more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that have to be done are done, this will turn Short-run psychology in confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - that courtesy to true cooperation.
"I see much of what is happening from today until 2012, when Vorkampf, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this, many with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and to do with the Teeparty-Wählern, which were their education.
How worried the Republican leaders also may be that they too high poker, they know that they need to seek their promises, government spending and reduce the health reform to be repealed.
This party lines are already in the first reactions on the recommendations of the deficit Commission, which has a tax reform and the raising of taxes, as well as raising the retirement age and that sinks of government spending.
The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, so very pressed the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need within the Commission 14 of the 18 votes with its plan to official recommendation and to make it very struggle to come only in the vicinity of this figure.
The greatest resistance will take place in the elected representatives of the body, as in financial matters today at least, little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston says two stages of the battle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first battle will be next year in the form of party Zusammenstössen place until Obama Republicans in the state budget, taxes and the health system challenge, then followed by a period larger-mesh zweiparteilicher cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proved that, despite the current partisanship of the election, the majority of Americans are still hopes that the two parties are working together.
If confrontation in a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties need to look carefully at the public reaction.
Whoever the losers will be sentenced to change tack and have to find a compromise.
In fact, it may be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization today are larger than in the middle of the 1990s, and they seem a larger ideological divide between Obama and the Kongress-Republikanern than at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
While at the same time, the activists of both parties in 2010 as a prelude to a much broader consequence of 2012 election.
So it may be that the courtesy of this week will be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will be on both sides much more effort, a common denominator in the issues that divide the two still.
Durchgesickertes US document portrayed as a port of corruption Moscow
The control of the city is in the hands of the " kleptocracy and they have a part of the bribes and protection money, which they einsammelt in the Kremlin. As reported in February, the American Embassy in Russia in a memo.
Both police and the State blackmail high protection money to make their expensive standard of living in Moscow, so it is claimed.
They collect money not only of legitimate business, but also by organised criminal gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as "vertical of authority" - takes its part of the money that the head ends.
The memo, which is under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle was sent to Washington, was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on its website.
The memo edited were based on sources, whose names.
It was written, while still Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov was, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was in October by President Dmitry Medvedev fired, but there is little evidence that would have been cleared up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, a well-known construction company has, over the years have repeatedly rejected accusations of corruption, and he has won numerous libel actions against such allegations.
In September, he declared a Russian television station, when he was asked after a documentary that suggests that he was corrupt: "It is crazy, it is filthy, it is dirty."
A huge number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. Surveys have shown that.
But it is unusual, as in the report of the ambassador, individuals are known, and it is unheard of that happening through a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct link of the government of Moscow with the crime has meant that some of them as" upset "and to conclude that the government is more like a Kleptokrat acts as a government," the memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a" kryshna " (a concept from the world of criminals / the mafia, which literally means" roof "or protection), which is on the police, the State Security Service (FSB), the Supervisory Authority (MVD) and the public prosecutor's office, as well as covered by the whole of the Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a dreilagige structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is paramount."
"The FSB, and the MVD Militsya are on the second stage."
"Least follow the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors at the bottom."
"This is an incompetent system, in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap, because the city is offering no help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB money from the largest firms and cashed in which the police arrested small business people.
A source, it means, "said that Moscow's business owner to understand that it is best protection from the MVD and FSB (and not by organised crime), because they are not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law."
"This is why the protection by criminal gangs are no longer so ask how former."
The memo noted that, while the collection of the money is comprehensive, protecting themselves very modest not; even those who pay, sometimes to be arrested.
Those who do not pay, find their business very quickly close before - because of a pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times to fight corruption, but at the same time has said that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who, with with suitcases full of money, which is likely to go in the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of When, a panel of Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But he is part of the bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class, because a political class in Russia no longer exist."
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, estimates by voting, costing the corruption Russia more than $300 billion per year.
The country is ranked 154 a recent study on global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organisation Transparence International (countries of "the least corrupt" to "the most corrupt ').
The disclosure of the American embassy Memos, which happened at night after Moscow time, with security displeasure within the Russian government, although, as Luzhkov for the mistakes of Moscow, it can be blamed for the Kremlin also could be a way to claim that we deal with the problems.
In an interview with Larry King on CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks data transmission could be a fake and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats have called him BATman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we would not have expected that this happened with such arrogance with such pressure and so unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge veterans to confrontation with the past forced
In a weak, betoniert class room with dirty and abblätternd walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School to the man who put him in the subsequent Europe--shared, Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everybody loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader, and he has worked for its people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years.
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the" Schlachter, remains the commander in this remote former Khmer Rouge Hochburg in north-west Cambodia's popular, where he hospitals and bridges built, the infrastructure has developed always live and where thousands of former soldiers.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrender to the government, will be challenged longtime supporters in Anlong Veng.
In April allowed a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum for the victims of the public confrontation with the people who have supported once the regime.
In June, the government issued a school book, which for the first time children tells the story of former soldiers of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a community of the UN tribunal and Cambodia, for the first time, a former member of the Khmer Rouge, than the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, sentenced to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, the anxiety among the Khmer Rouge veteran Alnlong Vengs, complicated their efforts at reconciliation and reintegration into society in Cambodia.
"There are still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Youk Chhang, head of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that researches the regime.
"For them was the life under the Khmer Rouge glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides even families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, review or hunger.
As the Vietnamese invaded in 1979 and the Pol Pot Ied government, fled the remnants of the regime and its military on the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
They spread here until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered, unrest.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary the guerrilla war from its base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, nominal-wage Ta Mok took the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid 1990s, when a peace agreement promoted by the UN in 1993 to the first democratic elections in the country, began nominal-wage large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters, the government überzulaufen belonging to the nominal-wage Kapitulationen of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Khieu Samphan Nuan Chea and 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not yielded, was arrested in 1999 by government forces in the Dangrek Mountains.
He died in 2006, waited prison in Phnom Penh, where he found on the process.
As their benefactors they no longer shielded, fled the majority of former Khmer Rouge fighters in the grinding poverty of rural Cambodia and many maintained the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even if a few elite of Khmer Rouge officials when their local government posts reserved, because they set down their guns, ordinary soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have only a few of the surrender benefits," said Sok Leang by the Center for justice and reconciliation, the throughout Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng, holds public forums.
"They are anchored in the super-fantastic agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55, who is in 1974 as a teenager of Rhmer Rouge supported, fought in the jungle to Anlang Veng before he retired in 1998, in order to hold a life as a poor rice farmer.
"The life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"TA Mok everyone has something to eat."
"But now is the life difficult, because we have to worry about ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns.
At the beginning of next year, the court to try to Khieu Samphan, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary and his wife and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to court.
The mission of the court, the old leaders, and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities to condemn, but it is not said whether it will follow on these four cases further action.
It has done little to assuage the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation, on In Chaem, 64 years focused during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s district leader in the province Manteay Meanchey.
In 2007, it had representatives of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia told they have the construction of a dam Trapeang Thma chair, a project with thousands of forced labour probably died.
On a hot night came In Chaem of the work in the fields to their wooden house on a dirty street outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun long shadow on the desiccated grass raised to discuss In Chaem rejected it, about their past during the Khmer Rouge.
The court should call them, so they would refuse to go, they said.
"Cambodia live in peace and stability," they said.
"There was no more persecution, this would be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who in 1878 of the Khmer Rouge has fled, also has repeatedly warned that the situation is uncertain, would be the court more suspects on trial, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and the past buried," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Youk Chhang from the Documentation Centre.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer-Zeiten it means of broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to this broken parts to put together so that everyone can understand."
The centre created the first government-licensed school book about the Khmer Rouge, the 75 seitige 'history of the Democratic Cambodia. "
It issued the book in June in Anlong Veng appended to the history books for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
How often in Cambodia know young people in Anlong Veng little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book students helps to understand an important part of its history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought home with the book to read.
"My family rejected many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious, because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court."
Such a resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school books and the court to gain influence, "he said.
Still, the Khmer Rouge is a powerful attraction.
High in the mountains Dangrek leads one of Strauch überwucherter and with plastic waste verdreckter path to a black soot Rechteck, covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body had been burned here after his death in 1998 with a Reifenhaufen.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years, a mobile phone Verkäuferin on the roadside, said that she does not know had been burned a lot about the man, here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here to take him to pray," they said.
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday and later in the day they wanted to Pol Pot's final resting place, where they will get a bush ripe bananas - in the hope that it will bring their luck.
Belarus is not agree to continue to accumulate weapons-grade uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to global security of nuclear material, the government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that it no longer will gather highly enriched uranium, which is a critical part of nuclear weapons.
The deal was in a joint statement after a meeting of the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the security summit announced.
The US government had for years sought to convince Belarus, not more highly enriched uranium to collect and seemed to have achieved a hurdle last spring.
But the US government officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements with Bailers have been taken to remove about 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research center.
That paved the stage for the agreement on Wednesday, the rest of the material to be removed, according to an official employee who, because of the sensitivity of the issue remains anonymous, roughly £500.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of Obama's "nuclear security summit of 47 nations' in April, which had to be excluded Bailers.
And it was obvious good enough to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet republic of the next Summit in 2012.
"I was really enthusiastic about the fact that they have a seat on the nuclear security summit (from 2012)."
"It shows me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of Global Security Partnership, a group promoting nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important step" of Bailers.
Obama promised to secure in Prague in April 2009, within four years of all vulnerable nuclear materials.
Since then, the US government six countries, helped her highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuklearem Sicherheitsgipfel weissrussisch President Alexander Lukashenko has declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How highly enriched uranium reserve - hundreds of kilos, which fundamentally weapons is capable of, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... We will make this a dirty bombs and we will sell it to anybody."
"We use it only for research purposes, that is all."
Bailers neared a few months ago, however, the United States, as it indicate interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first round of the uranium of Belarus in October, was particularly complicated, because the material was easily irradiated, officials say.
It was in a Spezialzug loaded with more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, say officials.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the officials by plane.
The US government pays for this effort $14 million, with a large part of the money in the Belarusian research with low-enriched uranium, which can be used not for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely cautious coordinated and to build up confidence" that the agreement, which was signed by President Clinton, led, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy, which operates in the global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Nichtweiterzugebende studies estimates that Bailers this year at least 88 pounds waffenfähhigen uranium and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus, according to the joint agreement his camp until 2012.
The relations between Belarus and the US have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But the statement on Wednesday suggests a possible rapprochement.
"The progress of this global security issues welcome heissend, the United States of America and Bailers known, an increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus, a central issue in the improvement in bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
No objections from the Spanish government against CIA
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaida-Gefangenen on Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as a telegram of the ambassador of U.S.A. in Madrid.
That reflect the by WikiLeaks enhüllten and the daily newspaper El País " (cable) transfer documents. It adds that the former deputy leader María Teresa Fernández de la Vega called for the Spanish government should be informed," in order to show that foreign aircraft that fly across Spain, adequately monitored.

Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and lost 9 PSC
With the results of 28 November could the PP in the cities, Lérida Tarragona and play an important role in Barcelona.
After the significant votes and Members' increase in the last regional elections, the PP their eye already on the parliamentary elections - or not. Your expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes, which this party achieved in this election, is usually twice as high as those in the elections in Catalonia.
So, the Catalan People's Party 610,473 votes in the parliamentary election of 2008, during this paragraph, in the regional elections in 2006 only 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC 384,091 votes.
If this rising trend - a result of the diversion of vote share of the PSC and the capture of the electorate of the PP - should continue, analysts predict the PP that, in the parliamentary elections, the PPC from 8 to 12 members of Congress could rise, while also CiU four (it now has 10) and before the PSC at least 9 (25) would lose.
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party would lose a Member of the ERC - currently has three - while their ICV Papayannakis before could hold or a.
The election calendar should be maintained, however, is the next date with the local elections in May 2011. Then, too, can the People's Party (PP), the sole to tip the balance in the socialist dominance to put a stop, in four provincial capitals, and with their majority in the City Council, an emblematic of the city councils with the biggest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC the towns of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists neither a majority to make their traditional allies and ICV (ERC) can count will lose.
After the Republican debacle, it is not unreasonable that this party of their representation in the town councillor emblematic in which they should reach 5% of the votes, will lose.
The PP recorded an increase in their share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could be the decisive force in Barcelona, and Lérida Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that the main role to play in Tarragonas turnaround, where they had ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, along with the PP.
Ispir Lérida lies the PP just 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
In other important places, such as Castelldefels Reus Badalona, or to the People's Party a significant increase.
At present, the PP in 34 municipalities of Catalonia, and aims to represent the formation of lists in so many places as possible.
The Catalan cell would get Al Qaeda thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three further in Thailand
The seven of the police officers of the intelligence unit of the police arrested emblematic Pakistanis and the Nigerians formed the of Thailand, the different cell dschihadistische managed Al Qaeda group, including the Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and " Laschkar e-Taiba (let) - last was author of attacks in Mumbai, which 2008 106 deaths - supplied with passports.
The Spanish Interior Minister denies this research is of great importance, which so far is that he can rest assured, with the "operation Kampai" is the counterfeiting apparatus Al Qaidas weaken the world " and " thus their ability. "
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell has been active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were broadcast in Thailand, where these counterfeit and then to the groups, from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda, sent so that could exceed their "fighters" criminal charge the limits of European and other Western countries.
The discovered cell is not the only one of the jihadist network, which has been active in Europe and, therefore, except the Thai Untersuchungsorgan other European police units in the investigation. It is not impossible that, in the field of the EU in the next few days to similar attacks such as this last Tuesday was carried out in Barcelona, will come from.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis, Junaid Humayun Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Malik Asghar, Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerians Babatunde Agunbiade) was arrested in Thailand another when the Pakistanis have been arrested Muhammad and turbot Athar Zeeshan Ehsan turbot and the Thailänder Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They had led by Bangkok from Spain and other European countries gelassene cell.
The Catalan network - a part of it was destroyed in 2009 - stole especially tourists passports in accordance with the requirements of the so-called "international Islamic front".
This means that the documents on behalf of men aged 25 to 45 years and still be issued several years had to be valid; they were no Visastempel.
In Untersuchungskreisen stresses that, until now, no links between the detainees in Catalonia and the attack in Mumbai, although the author of this attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba" was one of the recipient groups of Spain and subsequently mega-out in Thailand fake passports.
But it should be remembered that a few days before the attack in Catalonia from through a money transfer company several thousand dollars had been sent in the purchase of pre-paid cards for mobile phones' invest 'which were later by the members of the "command," which the lives of 106 people put a stop, were used.
The police have seized a comprehensive documentation.
PP demands of a postponement of the tax agreement
The chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez Camacho, yesterday took the opportunity to Artur Mas personal their conditions in support of his inauguration as Prime Minister of the present stretch. This is no different from the even during the election campaign, and can be made with the primacy of the economic recovery and the absence of regionalist Unabhängigkeitsabenteuern, as a finance agreement, which involves the leader at the height of his mandate will propose group.
The chairman of the Catalan People's Party, with the safety of Artur Mas, which awarded the 18 MEPs, which they won last Sunday - a paragraph, which is more than sufficient, in order to feel indissociable. Because the candidate of the Civil regionalist party CiU relies on contains at least one of the opposition parties during the vote, when he took office.
The future alliances, which the regionalists at the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Congress intend to depend on a possible Entente with the PP. Measurement of the talks, which at the time with the rest of the party leaders, however, turn to Catalonia.
As far as the leader of the PPC, demanding that the support of the inauguration of "all discourse, which the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and an agreement on the Finanzausgleich between the state and the autonomous region - like the Basque Country - and the leader of a referendum CiU even subject to be aired at the back.

The owners of the old house were made easier in Olot do not rule out the possibility that their Carers on eleven elderly people killed
The leaders of the La Altenpflegeheims Caritat in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference in which they found that the damage the criminal acts Joan Vila Dilmés - the Carers, who during his work at least 11 old people, for which he was responsible had killed - had caused the establishment.
The head of the elderly house were made easier, Joan Sala, accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada to court and announced, "La Caritat would like the responsible (for the deaths) accused," but "the right and our liability force us to the process and the civil liability".
The establishment must not only a social standing loss because they accept the criminal acts of Carers was established in time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the families of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé acknowledged that the first crime in August 2009, and that he was murdered on ever since.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the elderly house were made easier - as he speculated that no doctor personally examined the dead, but were administered the formalities because of their age and diseases by telephone.
The head of La Caritat einte flatly deny this point and said that "lack of action keinerzeit the reason for the incidents could have been."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that it "in the legal dispute no evidence for negligent acts of another person as the suspect."
The cause of death as "angel" Getaufte acknowledged the day before 11 murders and declared that the first crime perpetrated on 29 August 2009 and one and a half months later, the second old lady murdered.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime, in which he had mass-medicated a mixture of various tranquillisers.
The head of La Caritat declared that the access of staff to the drugs is difficult to control.
The insulin injections and the Beruhigungsmittelcocktail suspended the Carers in six of the nine crimes committed to free the patients with the death of their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory tests are to be seen whether Vila lying and for his first victims, in fact, a less cruel death or whether he chose this inside from brannte by providing them with Bleichlauge administer, as he put it, according to the confession in three women had done, he after, between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat listens to the statements of Carers no faith, not even as the number of confessed murders, which could be more. This attitude is justified that Vila widely-divergent Hækkerup had made in court, and that it makes no sense to change its approach after eight successful murders suddenly.
They say that it is for this reason, and to clarify the reach of these incidents of justice.
Kowtow to the European Central Bank (ECB).
Investors reacted sharply yesterday on the threat of the ECB President Trichet warned, "the markets should not underestimate our capacity to respond."
The risk premia of the euro Peripheri countries increased dramatically, and the shares of European banks by more than 5%.

The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market, who, in which he has recovered to collapse, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear.
A month ago today called for the European Central Bank on us, our Liquiditätmsassnahmen to reverse that the ECB tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably still a number of times in the future, a must backtrack.
The Federal Bank called for ending the plan to buy government debt, as they are ineffective, and the lifting of all exceptional temporary Liquiditätsmassnahmen. It should be retained only a week's permanent access.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures' 'at least until March and extended the quarterly contracts with unlimited access to the Quartalsende to provide liquidity until at least June.
We also expect that the programme to buy bonds will continue to spend and steering a signal.
If the managed expectations are not met, will be the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday back and if halstarrig insistence that we withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As with the ECB meeting in May, in which the Bank confirmed, the purchase of public debt is not to be taken into account, and then the markets collapsed, tomorrow could be repeated this story.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, it showed the teeth and on Wednesday said they provoked, bought a lot, making it a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday was the auction of one-year state permits in Portugal rather weak.
The state asset management were only 500 million to 5.28%, compared with $750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.

Although Ireland has lost its credibility completely after the problem with the stress tests had not realised in July, the figures within the framework of the rescue plan acceptable, and help to reduce the uncertainty.
However, the government next Tuesday, the parliamentary approval for his new budget. Because they still do not have sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.

The dual effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market has appreciated 4.5%, twice as many as the rest of the European stock markets.
Compared to February was the reaction of the government and the Bank of Spain quickly and convincing, and we will benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a crucial auction of a three-year bond, which benefit from the Trichet effect. That is why we on a strong demand, which will remove any doubt about our ability to swap.
For Spain would be applying for aid plan a self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity, which we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are very expensive and access to the markets were closed.
Our strategy, however, should the Navruz Caesar's wife: "Now is not only the existence, but also the licence."

The product Red Bull triumphs in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
The cars are being improved with a software in real time.
Since 2004, the product Red Bull in the world of Formula 1 racing to infiltrate its history in this distinguished universe of the speed of surprises and successes.
Initially, the newcomer nobody paid attention and despite his background rising sharply during the last Saisons continued in the final sprint last November, all on the victory of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso.
Without the skills of the German pilot and world Sebastian Vettel up or the performance of the strength of the engine of Renault to lower want is the "secret weapon" that the corporation Siemens in the hands of the product Red Bull, and thus a winning team created, has become a legend.
In reality is a powerful software to simulate processes, which the German company 2007 purposes, which did not have to do with Autorennen on the market.
This term as PLM technology programme was for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and precise instruments are used.
The goal is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it really is built, in order to avoid mistakes and unnecessary costs.
PLM, the development of the cameras of Canon, which aircraft relieved by Sukhoi and the most famous commercial vehicles from Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial unit of Siemens, said that with the use of this software in Formula 1 - the product Red Bull factory "in a few hours, almost in real time," the changes and improvements in the race and the tests, design and can carry out.
Soot worm contends that racing houses in 1992 in the average ten technicians, who worked in a season were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements.
In Red Bulls team are now 180 highly qualified young people employed. With highcapacity computer system they lead analyses and all possible changes to the racing car.
The Siemens manager said that the PLM software is capable of all elements of the racing cars of the product Red Bull to analyse and to improve, with the exception of the engine, which explains Renault exclusively responsible.
The materials, fuel, the Aero dynamics and Sicherheitselemente be changed.
The changes, thanks to advanced production facilities and Hightech-Autoklaven in less than 24 hours of the virtual reality of the simulator in the reality.
The only border, which is set this crazy technical perfect, $40 million, which may be a formula 1 - a 'race for his team in a season.
The product Red Bull has its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of his racing cars in a 50 kilometres away from London ground.
There are two buildings in which are fenced visits, particularly from journalists - strong.
Everything that happens is Top Secret.
The workforce includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls true formula 1 - no doubt hero is the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources, which the Energy drink manufacturer in the services of his participation in the race tracks, hide is further protagonists, whose support invaluable and whose fame nil.
The technological leader of the station, Steve Nevey, stressed that one in five years ago still could say that the progress in R & D for racing cars with 50% have helped the pilots and were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values changed. The technology is 85% of success, while the contribution of pilots is estimated at 15%.
Nevey recognizes that Vettel and Webber never-fulfilled can be replaced by computer, because they are not "voraussagbare gladiators."

Sabadell wants his rival in three years, one million customers' steal '
The executive board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that in 2001, a tough year for the banks, but first rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it provides for a collapse of the Zinsspannen, which the banks attempt offset by increases in the fees and the prices of loans.
Sabadell expected in three years, one million private customers' - even to existing specialist.
Sabadell has found its way to exploit the next three years, and so in a very complicated economic environment to survive.
The bank will introduce a new 2011 threeyearly Leitplan.
The aim is not only to survive without public aid from the FROB, but also the market share of about 1 million private customers - 700 000, if the customer leaves, the bank will lose -. This is the great challenge facing this bank, because until now it has their business After-Sales more attention than their private customers.
This year, they create 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Your market share in private customers is 3.5%, while the business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of business plan 2011-2013 is the increase in productivity, in other words, reducing costs Austerität. The challenges it faces, the bank will present them together with statement.
Only a few banks dare in these difficult times to publish targets and, as a result of the financial crisis are in disarray worldwide all the plans for the banks.
Sabadell this year will their four years guiding plan Optima. That was initially designed for three years, but as a result of the state of the market, it was extended by a year of operation.
The clients, the savings banks, are the main aim of the bank.
In an organized by the APIE breakfast Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with great reach".
The manager assumes, Spain came only "slow" out of the crisis.
Moreover, it would be "very difficult" in two or three years' work to create "- essential for the survival of the banks.
Even if he assumes that the war of liabilities - which the interest margins punished - will wane, will raise risk premia, the banks and savings banks for their emissions of the preservation of liquidity to pay as compensation for loss of profit margins already on the price paid for loans.
"The issues of liquidity and funding are structural in nature and they will put pressure on the loans."
"We have not told the tap, but the Zinsdifferenziale are very high," Guardiola.
Banesto was already on Thursday ordering in their network Filial from the award of long-term loans and to limit to increase Zinsdifferenziale (cf Cinco Díaz of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also acknowledged that the banks followed the moment Stategie, "to increase the fees," but "within a competitive framework".
Structural-fund Sabadells plan is based on an organic growth, even if it does not rule the group, as always, corporate transactions.
Not for nothing he assures that in Spain 'larger companies are necessary. "
"In the coming year will change anything," he assured.
He stressed that the need for capital poverty-focussed "huge increase" and does not exclude the possibility that some Spanish financial institutions will slide in red.
He is of the opinion that the FROB could replace in Cape återflöde Tita Stockungen the money market.
After he assured that Sabadell is also a temporary closure of the markets could survive, he refutes the argument of some bankers, which already predict a new liquidity crisis.
He emphasized that nothing can be in circulation, but unlike the incidents in June, you could make short-term funding on repo transactions intercept and thus the crisis.
Ceca includes a second merger wave of savings banks from
The Director General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday, dismissed the possibility that a merger wave of savings banks could come and stressed the speed with which will be restructured the industry.

On the other hand, assured the Director General of the Spanish savings cash Railways (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, this second round would not take place.
"I believe that the majority of mergers has been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the group Banca Cívica cannot be regarded as the second round, it was about adjustments."
"The biggest part is over. It may be that we instead of siebzehen 13 or 14, but all important processes are already completed. They were of Banco de España, all of which looks strong, has supported controlled."
In one of the Association of the business leader and manager Aragoniens (ADEA) organized breakfast Olavarrieta nominal-wage that the concentration process "as quickly as possible, and that we must be satisfied with the timely running, which in the past, not now, in the context of the business plans with Banco de España has been set," he said.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 millions of assets and 17 with the 75 500 million is a historic incomparably process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62% and they are now much more of what we have met the Basel agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta declared that "there were a number unabgebrachter opinions about the slow pace of the process, the Unseriösität and absurdity" exposed, because "Banco de España warned us on time to complete before the end of the year."
The Director General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain is one of the rigorous financial systems of Europe and perhaps' 'of the world, and added that those who do this "anzweifeltenn without deeper knowledge" did.
The manager said that we are in the current economic recovery "no concerns" about the situation of financial institutions and the savings banks, that a "very significant" concentration process, which have come through "as quickly as possible," will be taken.
He reminded that the Spanish banks the stress tests, which the ECB in July, insisted very well.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has argued for keeping the euro, but at the same time set conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tension on the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero new adaptation, starting with tax rebates for small and micro-entities, the regulation of work agencies or the lifting of the 426 euro support for the unemployed, which no unemployment benefit, referring to the privatisation of 49 per cent of AENA, the management of the Barajas airport and El Prat and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, supports the deputy leader, Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González, the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel, which have herausbeschwört as the head of the current crisis.
How are we to understand these events?
It was anticipate that Merkel's position is no fault of their public work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
It adopted Germany a radically new perspective to shape our future, which is at odds with the maintenance of the ancient traditions of the bulk of its partners.
In the face of resistance in Europe is beginning to be spekuliern in Germany on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south should leave the euro area.
The second: The reintroduction of the German mark - although this rather poverty-focussed science fiction sounds - supported by a large part of the public opinion, around 50% of the population.
The third parties: A transformation of the euro under German proposals. This means: More macroeconomic control; strict financial management; punishment of countries that the cross premisses; möglichere Solonic the default of certain countries, and the extension of the cost of potential adjustments to the private sector.
The German position is clear, and for some time. That is why there is now no excuses.
First, in 2009, as both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government is a constitutional reform from the English in order to prevent this from 2016.
It was the first sign of the polarisation between what Germany was necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign, the Central European country than Merkel postponed the decision to the rescue of Greece painful.
It was then that strong criticism, but the fact is that the political consensus were in Germany, the public and published opinion absolutely against a bailout of Greece.
Finally, Merkel in the last October days again with a clear position. It calls for a reform of the European Union agreement to the rescue of a country and at the same time to allow the private lenders to implement a part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as they embarked on the Irish crisis and all of the following.
But its proposal, although slightly sweetened, was adopted. In the next few months, we will be in the reform of the European Union, which these measures from 2013 to participate.
Germany has a red line, which it does not to exceed.
It says everything that, even if now unpopular measures must be taken - will no longer be as of this date of the old workings of the euro.
2013 will be the year of birth of a new currency zone, in which the perpetrators against countries hard will be punished, this could be forced to declare itself insolvent must take and, in this case, the private sector a part of the cost.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard growth rate, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
The other alternative on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments based as it from Spain in boom times, is simply unacceptable.
The offer is clear.
And we would do poorly to understand it.
It is not just a matter of runterzufahren the deficit by 2013 to three per cent.
The demands are much tougher.
And the worst thing we could do in these conditions, is to cheat ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence converted into more rest.
And the opportunities that are available to us, will use until spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has understood it that way, and his double announcement (which promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures of yesterday) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis, in order to create their own house, their way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not seem that would change that.
Among the options considered is that we walked away with a few serious countries euro area, not exclude
In this case, Germany could still have said that it had warned us.
Sport and rule circumvention
Tricks like Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show to circumvent the inventiveness, but not the will, a sanction.
The alleged of two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) has instigated exclusion in the game of 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League meant that much ink has been spilled about whether it is a unsporting act or not acted and whether any two players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
It is widely known, lost the two players a couple of minutes to go (their team had already clearly won) time and played several foul, so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and as the Real Madrid his group would be the two players the prescribed sanction at the next league match against Auxerre when it comes to meet and so without cards in the next stage of the game.
After all, the Disziplinarkommitee of UEFA, the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different sums of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football.
It is so widespread that they are part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this sport followed rules.
Part of the arisen debate about the case is presented to the fact that a team of the club Real Madrid (which in his anthem Edelmut and honour claims and on other occasions his players for similar incidents had punished) in the protagonist, and on the proportion by Mourinho, an episode has added more on his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate about whether this is not explicitly banned by the statutes behaviour is contrary to the principles of the sport, that is, whether this is a rule anti-gypsyism circumvention. In fact, this approach to the statutes of sport, but seem to circumvent its meaning.
In this matter should be investigated the sport spirit ailment.
The sporting spirit defends the physical integrity of the antagonists, an aspect of this action was not at risk, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the perpetrators against players an unjustified benefit from the Gegenteam. That did not happen either.
The paradox of the act of the players of the Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally under false game or rule bypass, bypassing the rule was not taken secretly in order to avoid sanctions, but it should be so long as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee.
The players waited and took the sanction happily.
Another question is what kind of took advantage of the offenders from the deliberate foul.
It should be stressed that the rival either in a worse position was still benefits for the game played erheischt, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue to play with few players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not use these players.
The benefit is evident in the fact that the players the next phase of the Champions League game without cards that their participation in a future game could threaten to start.
But it is a long-term, up to a certain extent uncertain advantage, because the team eventually could leave. Moreover the players with this approach a sanction and go in the second cycle on cards in which they have left for Kartenanhäufung with a card less than in the first cycle.
So it is not clear whether it really is an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices are not directed against the spirit of sport, including strategic decisions, in order to learn the rules a maximum benefits.
In this case, the players wanted no sanction to supervent (that is, in fact, a clear case of rule circumvention), they wanted more when they choose this.
They made a strategic decision without a penalty to evade or flee before her.
Although the border between inventiveness and regulatory environment blurred, I believe, is that it is a matter of a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: Because of two independent jams ginge rallies and because of the nature of the Regelübertragung provoked.
The damage to the principles of sport by these actions have caused, is less ethical than aesthetic.
Offer offensive on the After-Sales fishing for Gruppen-Weihnachtsabendessen in Barcelona.
The dictatorship of the calendar fall this year an avalanche of reservations on the days of 16 and 17 December.
The employees paid for celebrations are spreading. They do not want to more than 20 to 30 euros.
As the Turrón and the Christmas lottery exists in the run-up Gruppenabendessen again, which the hotel and leisure industry emblematic oxygen. But as a result of the economic crisis solve them a price offensive to the customer segment, which represents the mass of consensus: Almost all want to between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, confirm the consent of entrepreneurs and associations.
So that the accounting or a little more complicated, the calendar (New Year's Eve falls on a Friday) all orders in the week of 13 December dropped, with the result of an avalanche of reservations of dinner in two Spitzentager (16 and 17) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have ended the Gruppenabendessen for budgetary reasons.
In order not to dispense with this tradition, must pay for many workers this from their own pockets.
As the economic recovery is still, it will be knockdown prices, confirmed the chairman of the catering body of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the umbrella organisation dares will take until now not to predict how the holidays in this month.

The business is among those good, "the quality at good prices, with a good service to offer," he adds, and calls to remind us that the customers will be needed in times of crisis, which is why prices by 25 euro hardest.
In a recent poll in various central restaurants turns out that the evening of 17 December the providers to collapse.
The group Soteras says that the demands for this Friday, with the intention of less than 30 euros, would spend boom. The group has its food with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros in the economic situation.
In another leading group Andilana that 16 restaurants in the city of maintains (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and other), the oddity of the calendar early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have done the impossible for the previous year prices with food for every taste of 19.95 until 30 euros to maintain," he says.
In Alleanza Grup that El Mussol, Attic, Qu Qu and a total of 23 establishments, you lose sight of the optimism is not after since the second quarter revenues are good, albeit in a few days ago looked forward will be focused prospects for the Christmas season.
Sources of the group of companies point out that the 18th a überaktiver day with friends groups that Christmas Vorfeiern will be.
Among the six Gruppenmenüs was a Christmas menu for 30 euros or more than price ever-thicker charts. The impression is that customers are willing, 10% more than in the previous year and spending in exchange for more details, such as Cava.
In some of the companies you see green shoots sprouting, which is why the employees will be invited back. This gives the impression that the Gruppenessen are back in the recovery.
For its part, the umbrella organisation Fecasarm (with mergers as the Kneipen, restaurant and leisure Association of Barcelona), familiar ViceChair, Enric Gomà to the end of the tunnel and noted that the overall right "loud" reservations, although the customers' a maximum scrape together. "
The fun at the celebration was not, however, pays no matter who has fallen.
The Pakistani nuclear programme is causing great concern in the United States
Islamabad, nuclear weapons "faster than any other country."
Revelations of WikiLeaks rolls--confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The Internet portal WikiLeaks revealed the content of the correspondence between the North American embassy in Pakistan and the US Treasury Department confirmed the enormous concerns of Pakistan's nuclear program Washington worries.
On the edge of the informative and hefty details that the documents on the content of the talks and the thinking of the I-accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, these reveal that the cooperation between the two countries in terms of nuclear safety not strengthened, but on the contrary, " is declining, and that the unstable Asian country more nuclear weapons "to a Rhytmus faster than any other country".
In particular, the nature of Pakistan's nuclear programme - that the weapons are put together, but its individual parts stored in a possible attack to make it more difficult for its destruction - Washington cause sleepless nights.
The following risks include the Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities in the area attacked by the Taliban, probably the Verstreuung of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material."
The large number of people who, in the nuclear arsenals and the Raketenprogramm implies, is not only by the United States, but also by Russia as excessive and reason caution.
"If Pakistan devout staff to take care of the nuclear plants employ; because of the low level of educational and cultural extremist organisations have more opportunities for people who are involved in nuclear and missile programmes to launch reklutieren," said the expert Yuri Korolev by Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New to the of Julian Assanges Internetportal documentation reveals that the cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in terms of nuclear proliferation and slows the rate of increase in Pakistan's nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the message that the communication with Pakistan as "frustrating" describes, said: "There are often no transparency; on assistance we receive no answers or they will be rejected."
In another communication confirmed Peter Lavoy, officials of the state secret service for South Asia, "despite the economic disaster Pakistan nuclear weapons as quickly as any other country produces."
The Ambassador Patterson asked Washington during a visit to the top army leader, General Ashfaq Kayani, which leaders' 'that "Pakistan's army its tacit support terrorist groups initialising."
In the hunt for the WikiLeaks chief
Obama appoints a highly responsible for the anti-terrorism fight to prevent new revelations.
Interpol has a red warning to prosecute and discover of Assange.
Everything associated with WikiLeaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, hydrocarbons, is a complicated maze, in which the matters only difficult.
Yesterday Interpol a "red warning" to "locating and persecution" of Assange.
However, it is not a traditional warrant for the arrest.
In addition, it is not new, it comes from the 20 November.
It also has nothing to do with the recent revelation of more than four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the allegations of sexual abuse, which the Australians must face in Sweden.
It also assured the lawyer of the founder of WikiLeaks, Mark Stephens, "the police knew where and how they contact with Mr Assange to take."
Already on 20, the international police authority with headquarters in Lyon (France) at the request of Sweden ordering from, but they were given until yesterday after receiving the power by the Swedish authorities are not known.
As is the case. The 188 Interpol-Länder depend, Assange to identify and access, "provisionally arrest and extradite him."
Although Interpol the arrest of a warning of a red taxfree individual can order not many member countries, according to the Organization of the red warning as a licence for a Arrestierung - which of the national police must be carried out - especially if it on a bilateral extradition treaty, as is the case of Sweden and England is, presumably, where Assange.
The action while simultaneously Assanges lawyers who gesten published a letter in which they informed that the 39 year-old founder of WikiLeaks is prepared to answer the questions by video conference of the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange the exit from Sweden and requested by the prosecutor, which with the sagenumwoben Lavrentiy Beria Pavlovich, security chief of Stalin, in comparison, received the permission.
"It is a hunting, not as a legal persecution," will be charged in the letter.
While the world is looking for him, and his mother of Australia from the presumption of her son, Assange has pledged to an unknown location, but not silent.
On Monday he gave the head of the magazine Time via Skype from a vague place from an interview. In the conversation, he asked for the resignation of the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proved that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats, UN and spy on them against international agreement signed by the United States, it would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, condemned the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd."
"I am not sure why we value on the opinion of a guy with a website should set," he told the station CNN.
Obama himself has a high level of responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight, Rusell Travers, with the new preventionary Anti-fraud Enthüllungen documents.
The attempt by the spokesman for the Präsidenden Barack Obama, Assange little attention, announcing stands in contrast to the opinions, the conservative politicians and commentators in these days.
The Congressman Peter King, from January chaired the national Sicherheitskommitee of the House of Representatives will lead, the State Department to investigate the possibility, WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "in order to seize and any money to support them, or a contribution to pursue."
Tom Flanagan, adviser to the Canadian President Stephen Harper, was still further, and he had to his statement, Assange "murdered" revoked.
"Obama would have to turn it into a target, and not a manned flight or so what use."
Who is not apologized, was Mike Huckabee, baptistischer Minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it always was, in which the government information leaked, he is guilty of treason and everything is no execution is too mild eiine penalty," he told the station Fox.
Search Puigcercós with a nod to the Carod acknowledged Nahestehenden peace in the ERC
The Republican leader allows the party a secret vote on its continuance in office.
Huguet proposes a pluralistic government and the end of the General Assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for umpteenth time of an internal turmoil in the ranks of the loss of 11 Members and half of the electorate rudderless ERC from the way to go.
The party chairman is aware that his resignation threat the Nahestehende of former party leader Josep Lluís Carod acknowledged Rovira is not enough, but he also knows that the influence of the sector today is weakening as her mentor itself, and not the same headaches will spread, like other former tendencies.
Therefore tried the leader of Esquerra with a nod to the new critics to win, what his position until the next municipal elections would be.
For the start of heralded yesterday that could answer the over 200 regional council members of ERC about his secret to remain in office.
With ballot papers, not with superior hand.
If the Carodisten Präsidenen wanted to miss a fine, they could do this without need to fear reprisals.
Indeed, would like to avoid the head of both the impression of division and subjugation under his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would with half of the votes plus a not confirmed, and he added without any indication of percent values, a result "in the Bulgarian style" would not be good.
The Carod acknowledged by the President-in-Office Nahestehenden call for more than just the party of his office. An inadequate gesture, since Puigcercós controls the supreme body of conferences.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to further by rättvist Tritten poor--lies agreed with the board an action plan from now until May.
That they expect, in drafting the document on strategic reorientation that the leadership on 18 the Council will present for the vote to be able to participate.
Your intention is for Puigcercós stepped. In return, this promise that the US Congress in the autumn 2011, as far as the party top already for a fact.
The leader of the ERC is of the opinion that the " Polyphonie damage the stability and he wants to create a once and for all, the organisation in the situation, their dirty linen behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article, which the President-in-Office Conseller Josep Huguet in his blog signed, symptomatic.
Given what an ideologist Puigcercós is considered the holder of Innovació it for a fact that the party leader "in exchange for various objectives" will be based.
He was five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the board, so that at least 90 percent of the party members adovocates that means the inclusion of new faces from Carods environment.
The second could be the great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC should the General Assembly principle as a functioning at last.
So he verfechtet a reform of the statutes, which would make it possible to hold the conferences with elected delegates.
By the end of the General Assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - is Puigcercós' team, which has been in the last two conferences, fought like mad.
Indeed, the bebend assembly of 2008, the party leadership with the review of the General Assembly principle at a congress, which deals with the reform of the statutes Anti-fraud should deal.
This date is still out, as was the internal Aufruhe infogle of recent years tackling this issue is not advisable.
Now, without which critical sectors could be on the lookout, the time has come for this matter to reinstate always and wind up for.

He is of the opinion that the holder of the federal government expressions such as those in his discourse in Auditorio Nacional could make, because in this country, there was no mouths ban and even less a censorship.

With literature the finger in the wound
The second round of 'enthusiasm for the language' was a walk, in which the participants for the narrative made strong
"The with the sex in the language I do understand, but... the finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" Asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, which is the second round of Los place more de la lengua 'should open a cycle, which the Spanish-speaking literature and celebrated on this occasion the subtitle her question used (at another event was the round table sex in the language, they explained).
The finger in the wound... "brings us in trouble," spit the Argentine Schriftstellein sweet, contrary to the audience, mainly from young people who made on the international book fair in Guadalajara (film) in order to assist those of his Marisol Shultz attend round table, attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text, which they devoted Celorio Gonzalo, and then Shultz as a great narrative marked. Luisa told in first person and were the originator, which is on the search is to know what a "wound," and from doctor to doctor, of which it receives no answer, but evidence for the vade-mecum their narrative.
The leaves Infektologen they convinced: "Patience is not my strength, maybe that is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating rapprochement with the Traumatologen, who in the middle of the swing and stole the breath, but said that wound was no scientific concept enthült the psychoanalyst's mill the secret: "The wound is the real question, the symbolic is the scar."
The main figure of the narrative sighs relieved and includes that they "from the wound only learned that this is truly open and does not exist." But it is convinced that the desire to mix the language and their trap.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguaner Sergio Ramírez asked a delightful narrative, which he called " praise of invention, and in which the finger in the wound not mentioned, but is discovered.
With allusions to the magical realism he tells of a famous Zauberin, which struck the clouds, widely travelled men brought back or of a girl lost virtue restored. The narrative made a U-turn and reported of America, the great novel, which it from the beginning of his own Chronist was missing, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticised the abundance of the Eroberen told stories.
"Cervantes, all of us (the writers) invited to mock the sham witness, who presented as a true stories appeared, but in a different way would be the history of America have never been told - with imagination, which even the sense of shame lost."
However, stresses that "it is the nutcases and liars, which is best things present", and there are nearing reality and lie to each other, where we no longer know which side to the narrative, where the fictitious literature reached the summit.
He calls it, in fact, the Cervantes' 'tradition.
"We have inherited from him, what will be told."
As Mayra Montero was covered in the series, and praised the writer of the variety of interpretations, on which the invitation of the film on the round table 'nerve' had contributed.
The Kubanerin and dedicated their contribution of the great Puertorikanerin wound of social violence, which affects their country - Latin America - as a result of the fighting for the drug trade.
"I think that good literature, good versemongering, good songs a tacit, not deliberate commitment included," she told after they had highlighted that literature communication and force that is between the author and the readers like a chemical reaction " build.
The evening, the Spanish poet Luis García, whose contribution Montero also "this finger of committed writer in the wound hevorhob" of the writer.
He said that in a fast-moving world the intellectual habits and the control of the consciousness of dogmatism amount, and will be forgotten, "that behind every confirmation of a small no, and that behind every denial of a small yes."
"In possession of our idea and the reality, we have to moderate: And moderate often means that the nerve to trouble, and those who are much more comfortable feel if it in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in fixed ideas without nuances, and also the powerful to trouble, who prefer the world in Black and White said he divide and invited to rediscover the spirit of the letter.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks at three defeats in Endgame back, he took on the sidelines and experienced in his career, but three times he played crucial games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey are also at the final two different from their respective trainers styles set against, and their meeting marked by differences is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks at three defeats in Endgame back, he took on the sidelines and experienced in his career, but he has had three crucial games, and so far, he is good, why this opportunity of particular importance for him.
The Argentine, with the coin on the second hyped champion, he is a step behind the victors retarded and amazingly, he dealt with the same team following successive endgame.
The santistische strategist reached the first end game as coach Torneo Apertura 2002's' 'than del Morelia in the driving seat, with whom he had against Toluca 4-2 with a major defeat; learned later, at the' 'Clausura in 2003, he reached the crucial duel, which he lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', in which she played against Los Diablos Rubén, had a setback, because the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 Spielminute undecided, but the penalty kick he came forward with 3-1 and got two possibilities, joining its title, but ultimately missed three of his players of the 11 steps and turned the game into a 4-3.
Rubén already had two with the endgame Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival, lost. He would therefore not yet again be pursued by the accident and free themselves from the evil sorcerer, for the first time a title to celebrate, although he confirmed that itself is the most important thing for him to the game.
"I would like to be champion, I would like to break no statistics, it is for a club, for my affection, which I indulge me and, therefore, the title to me, but what happened before, is the most important thing," commented on the tax man, as one questioned him about the lost endgame.
The last end game is still strong stayed with him, he assured, to have learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can learn from this is that, until the referee not the end to act, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared to the line, the players, for the last time we were with two metres euro-11 already prepared, and I believe that this is a lesson until the game is not over, there is no cause for celebration."
To know that this series by penalty shootout could be decided not to worry, because he trusts his players: "You never want to the penalty shootout, one would arrive in the regular game time to complete, but sometimes, there is no alternative and one must be prepared in the previous Tour, we were prepared, but unfortunately we had the fate of a bad game, sometimes as a result of nervousness or the fierce enedeavor, the title already in the hands, it left us with something for this endgame, and we hope that this time it will not come to this."
It is in Romanso power, not only second champion and for the first time to the glory, which cost the titles.

450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro Quebec approved by mutual agreement project planning firms 450 million dollars in contracts for the hydroelectric power project Eastmain A-Sarcelle Rupert.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium, consisting of the firms BPR, Groupe SM Axor Dessau, and the most important part of the project, that led to a total of $295 million without tender.
This consortium, known as the 'Énergie gérance "was 2004 as sub-consequence of the decision by the private sector Hydro Quebec, their responsibility, this important hydroelectric project to the tune of $5 billion dollars to hand, educated.
At the beginning of 2005 win the consortium Énergie gérance " the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois is resorting to Unternehmenskonsortien a serious ethical problem which precipitated the risk of Wettbewerbsverdrändung, as well as a price increase.
"This is a new way of a stitch-up and discredited the competition."
"That means that rather than fix games instead of secret way now in open form by results," said yesterday Sylvain Simard, a member of the PQ, at the press conference.
In the early morning Simard had the issue before the National Assembly raised, because it seems to be served him hard to understand how the public's interest in this way.
Resource Gastinger Nathalie Normandeau afternoon had reacted by vehemently denied that it had acted in this treaty is a stitch-up.
"I remain faithful to my line," she lashed out, confirmed that the PQ was "dishonest" and "their lack of rigour."
She said that it was "the minimum" that the PQ entschuldige.
The model of the consortium is a global standard practice.
It is usually at a time of such temporary alliance, which two or more companies allowed their expertise in a bid to a tender for a complex project.
The project, "" Eastmain has a high level of complexity about his work Ausmasses.
The construction process is underway and should be set up by 2012.
However, was awarded the contract without a competition was able to take place; it had already given negotiations.
In addition, the model of the consortium in Quebec, with relatively simple projects no longer an exception.
As the newspaper Le Devoir "noted last week, it is in the area of Bauingenieur and advisory services of the consortium model applied the subject of government investigations.
A brief overflying the register Quebecer Community-scale allows, more than 200 consortia to name, some of which seem to be constant lengthiness.
In this way, for example, the company Dessau is working in partnership with the majority of their core competitors, which Cima +, SNC Lavalin Génivar, or even Roche and Tecsult count, together.
Any link, and there have been several dozen, leads to a and this legal entity, namely in Dessau.
What the consortium " Énergie gérance, Gastinger Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Baie James a particular labor is subject to dynamic and that this fact Hydro Quebec since the 1970s in a particular way Court recognised".
Réal Laporte, the big employer of Société d 'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement that the nose has to be on the fact that the treaty was approved on the project pipeline after agreement.
"If you a tender and makes it just a few applicants, will your prices soar."
"You have two options: Either you take the people on this Mart and tell you: It will be a satisfactory agreement on a good price."
"The idea, however, is that it is not the price is crucial, but the expertise of the people," confirmed Laporte.
This is the consortium "Énergie gérance" approved contract is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50 000 of the Parti Québécois erhalten dollars.
The contracts were approved either by the Hydro Quebec, and the SEBJ for the project Eastmain A-Sarcelle Rupert.
After the review was the newspaper Le Devoir "more than 100 Ingenieurs and consultant contracts, the companies or their branches, including, in particular, Ressourcenlabors between 2002 and March 2010 granted.
SNC Lavalin had 22 contracts to be accelerated, 16, had received Génivar Tecsult 14 and 10 Dessau, without their participation in this "Énergie gérance counting".
All of these agreements have been negotiated.
They amount in total to $449 783 344, including the contract with "Énergie gérance" about $564 295 131.
Sylvain Simard had indicated that the four firms that form the consortium (BPR, Groupe Dessau, SM and Axor) of the "Parti libéral du Québec, well known."
Neyts-Uyttebroeck Normandeau had suggested the PQ is equally associated with the firms that they "finance" before they clarified that it was about their leaders.
Barometer verantworungsbewussten consumption -- the "green" label is not inspire confidence
Green, but clearly sceptical.
The Quebecer consumer has little confidence at the centre of the sustainable growth, but nor the brands or marked the eco labels, which are designed to control his election.
A pity, even though it is in a media-oriented universe swimming, where it of information in favour of a responsible consumption with: The barometer responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to mourn, a deficiency, which is putting the brakes on his commitment displayed, as the first reading, which was held yesterday.
Although the use of the so-called socially-balanced products in 2010, seem to have pushed the Quebecer yet those who try to sell it to pay a little credit.
Two-thirds of the population Quebecer is, in fact, the environmental commitment of the firms to believe, just as the green corporate advertising, reveals that the responsible Consumer Centre of the University of Sherbrooke sophisticated instrument.
Another record: Half of the consumers doubts the trustworthiness of official, adding to the alleged fair products certificates, but also the credibility of the products and brands, which is as environmentally conscious, declare the barometer.
After the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on the subject of only 14.6% of the population Quebecer seriously.
The information about responsible consumption appears, however, important to the stimulation of this consumer segment, which is currently buoyed by nearly a third of the Quebecer consumers.
In fact, dampen empty and dubious nature of the information the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the higher price of the products of the second, identified by the barometer brake.
In addition, a third of the stated Quebecer performance of green products and services, which they have to do is to distrust.
According to a different communication already had about half of the consumers in 2010 changed their habits and predominantly one or more of the brand products changed in order to provide it with conviction.
According to the barometer, they were 61% of purchases in their neighbourhood traders preferred beneficiary and the purchase of food grown in their region.
Green and responsible -- the index of environmental consumption this year had a 64 of the maximum value of 100 -- the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to present a King of recycling, which is trying to be in the environment to reduce traces left behind by he cares about animal welfare.
But the social and environmental consciousness seems nevertheless just before his car, so the barometer: Just 28% of Quebecer have indicated, in 2010, or the use of public transport Mitfahrzentrale preferred to have to demonstrate its environmental interest.
Walking and cycling have also been of 39.1% of participants of this comprehensive behaviour poll results, which supports the stereotypes.
Bond for the takeover of eXcentris
The government Quebecer, which the Société Angus, as well as the company was asked to put parallèle, financially to takeover of the cinema complex eXcentris, agreed with a cooperation agreement, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer society Angus, as well as the company parallèle, which is a donation of seven million dollars from Kultusministerium for the adoption of the Daniel Langlois cinema complex eXcentris belonging to the tabloid Saint special pension had hoped to put them back its real cineastischen function to entrust sufficient--so had apparently not what they do.
The government has accepted that, in this case, however, on their own terms.
Instead of the expected donation offers the government Quebecer rather a bond in lower than the initial hoped-for level, which is a viable solution too favourable conditions could launch, at least according to the state from the scaremongers entnehmbaren sources.
A first action plan, as well as a question after 12.8 million last spring from Quebec had already been rejected the request petitioners has fallen since the overall again.
A proposal, along with an action plan have already been the President of the "Société de Développement of entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, Gastinger St Pierre, who chairs the files eXcentris.
Several days ago he sent her a final technical report.
The counter-proposal from the cabinet was sent to the SODEC, however, on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus have now to answer until 31 December, at this time.
In any case appears to be the premise of Staatsspende really was pushed to the side.
We should remember that the owner Quebecer Community cinemas and cinema complexes against a direct state investment in support of the takeover of eXcentris had revolted by the argument made the Culture Minister did not provide financial aid for Immobilienprojekt there that he not other cinemas.
Several other market participants in the segment, however, by contrast, substantial economic aid.
Cinema leader Daniel Langlois, following the self-financed construction of the cinema over ten years under great difficulty the car reindeer cinema in the space of his Kinokomplexes presented by the exception could justify from the public purse.
The lack of cinemas that independent films, is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his clientele.
The Société Angus, as well as the company parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top, control, for its part, a privately financed Campagne, by which it is a total of $700 000 hoping to boost employment.
Since the spring of 2009 continued only a single screen for continuing to show films in eXcentris: Le parallèle.
The aim of the future purchasers, it is that three of the movie theatres on 27 February next year with a demonstration of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois' Des hommes et of dieux 'opening.
Christian Yaccarini but has the newspaper Le Devoir "not removed, and it ignores what he and his group of the revised downwards proposals, which has been done to them.
The secret of komplexgeschüttelten lifted Canada.
The new American diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks spread, reveal the secret about what the United Nations under the inferiority complex of the Canadians against the Americans regard; they place but with the same blow the feeling of superiority last known to Canada.
Consequently, the American diplomats surprised that the Canadian voters at the ballot is not the Canadian American relations in the sense, and they believe that the visit by President Obama to impose the Conservative government would have helped to their budget of 2009.
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which have been widespread public yesterday, still offer more juicy details as the very substantial content, which has the absence of one.
A previous link on 22 September 2008, in other words, in the period in which the federal Wahlkampage in full swing was being reported on the point of the United Nations to the of their political leaders to discuss operations.
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, used in Ottawa, American ambassador.
Mr Wilkins offers different explanation of this situation.
"One of the Canadians almost inherent inferiority complex prompted the Canadian Population-ageing possibly, political leaders are much more likely to do so, on domestic issues of life, as the United States in this election passing the buck (as in the 1988 campaign on the free trade)," he describes.
The United Nations, so he concludes, is "the proverbial Goliath of this election: Omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk from him."
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" even less, since the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logischer way," as he assessed, "if the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party to drive a kind of essential relationship, which the voters at the ballot box as a key factor in the sense."
The other expression of this sense of importance in the reads on 22 January 2009 of Terry Breese, business winner in Ottawa, sent communication, which is to prepare President Barack Obama on his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help the continuation of the government in a vote of confidence on the federal budget in early February, in Canada, his first deficit after more than a decade, which will be known as a result of Belebungsprogrammes in the $30 to $40 billion has been created," Breese.
He had nowhere mentioned that the government of the parliamentary session before Christmas had to be postponed, in order to prevent the parliament of the coalition were overthrown and Population-ageing as the continued existence of opposition parties on the quality of the proposed recovery plan would impact.
Another, from January 2008 and on the part of the previous Ambasador draftsperson Wilkins agreed communication Washington of becoming increasingly negative image that the spread of CBC broadcast, dramatic sets of the United States.
The ambassador is worried about broadcasts as Border, little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which a few subtle allusions to Maher Arar, which can see 'no-fly lists ruse "or contributions for the purpose of Muskelprotz carried out by the CIA interrogation.
Yet another communication detailed how Hillary Clinton remarked in their French counterparts, Bernard Kouchner in their first bilateral meeting asked whether Europe is prepared to include certain prisoners from Guantanamo Bay.
Mr Kounser Delinking the question to answer yes, but on the basis of an individual "case-by-case 'decision.
Àm at the end of the meeting, as described, 'the Secretary of State, he has a paper in terms of Omar Khadr handed a 15-year Muslims Canadian origin. "
"The Secretary of State has promised to the files retabling durchzusehen."
Finally, we realise that heated passions on the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close aide, cofinanced on CBC had declared that the person responsible for this massive Ixtoc " should be killed.
He had told here to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global plan to renew the lighting
The UN has yesterday in Cancun, a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries in terms of achieving a reduction of greenhouse gas (CFCs) proposed, which almost a third of the additional reduction, which must be implemented in order to stabilise the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan adopted its position in the step of concrete large-scale projects that the UN in Cancun, hopes to implement to compensate for the absence of compelling reduction commitments from developed countries.
After yesterday's plan would put the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) because of the lighting on Earth CFC's cast be avoided if the weissglühend pears, which has a monopoly of 50 to 70% of the market, by fluoreszierend or, better still, by diodes (led) would be replaced.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust emissions of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen, last year the large gas emitters like the United States, China, Europe, and others, including Canada, voluntary reduction plans, which the global FCKW-Emission should downsized from 53 to 49 GT Gt.
From this review, it would still 5 Gt withdraw from now until 2020 climate increase of 2 degrees Celsius to stabilise, in order to prevent this spiralling out of control.
In the white glühenden pears built 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the rest of the 5% to produce the light.
With the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reduced energy consumption by 75%, with the new LED bulbs reduced in this energy demand double again.
The compact fluorescent pear, on average, between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those that the manufacturer Philips this week on the market -- that society has, by the way UNO-Studie -- have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white pear glühende, a suggestion of savings of Auswechselung plan, which is intended to be used in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that novel iese incandescent light bulbs, very little heat, they can work with a rule resistance.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent pear reserves, because they contain mercury and that it must therefore as hazardous waste dump, which in developing countries is not always possible, except producers are an adoption unappointed available.
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, however, not the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but rather the coal-fired power plants that emit far more mercury in order to produce from the white glühenden pears wasted electricity.
In the United States alone meet this coal-fired power stations 25 000 tonnes of mercury annually.
The report lays out in detail the profits that every country would generate thanks to this international programme.
Indonesia would such a billion dollars annually in buying electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2 saved, that means would cost an equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power stations, whose edification Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast expected excited the announcement of the results of the vote
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediately" publication of the results of the presidential election in the Ivory Coast immediately after the deadline.

About 40 minutes before the expiry deadline, the president of the cei on television, confirmed that the Commission "with the work would" continue to announce the results.
On Wednesday are often calls from all over the world, the cei may finally be the name of the winner of the second round of elections under the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and Alassane Ouattara pro-liberals Opponent.
The Gbagbo camp does, however, with the cancellation of "fraudulent" votes in the north by the Constitutional Council, which by the ex Rebellenlager of Forces Nouvelles (FN) during the abortive coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N 'Guessan, head of the presidential campaign of Ivory Coast, confirmed that the from the FN practised manoeuvres to intimidation of voters in the north of the country, the President's supporters had deterred, to go to the election.
The whole election could be cancelled if the complaints lodged by Gbagbo will be taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
The Gbagbo-Kontrahenten, however, are now more of the view that the Supreme Court of the country is not neutral because it by Paul Yao N 'Dré, a political closely associated with Gbagbo is headed.
Alassane Ouattara, the man of the north of any link to the Ex-Rebell denies that he has the delay in the announcement of the election results as "unacceptable" and asked for Gbagbo to respect, even if he is not gone so far as to claim the victory.
His Bündnisparter state, Gbagbo blockiere the publication of the results, because he knew that he had lost; and a complaint before the Constitutional Court re-table, after the Electoral Commission have prevented to publish the findings seie illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday were for the culmination of the association and reconciliation process of a country, which for years was divided into two parts.
The United Nations had on Wednesday, the leaders of the Ivory Coast warned that it could be kept in the case of possible riots responsible for these.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first round of elections on 31 October with 38% of the vote against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, which the public support for the former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) enjoyed, as the front-runner.

Business Clotilde Reiss: The Elysée Palace exaggerates its mediating role for Syria
In the space of more than six months, from July 2009 until May 2010, considered the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French, a researcher in Iran as "spy" was recorded, the French public in breath, placed the diplomacy in alert and accentuate the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this under the eyes of Sarvusz-Wolski diplomats from the United States.
The by WikiLeaks and from the newspaper Le Monde looked at American documents give some background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée Americans had declared his strategy, which went so far as this advice for dealing with their own crisis of "hostage-taking" in Iran (a small group of Wanderer).
They show how the French leaders tried to Washington to convince them that the liberation of the young French woman not the release of Majid Kakavand, one in France and held by the American justice because of trade with materials in the Iranian Nuklearprogrammes wanted Iranians to Gegeleistung.
Finally, they are putting the way in which the French Bureauof the media to the end, has tried to manipulate the idea credible, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad have a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, played in a harsh light.
In fact, he had done nothing in that respect.
A on 12 August 2009 in Paris redigiertes diplomatic telegram entitled "Iran: French comments on the way of dealing with hostage taking."
François Richier, Elysée adviser -- with respect to be maintained in the company of Mr Paoli, director of the Quai d 'Orsay in North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They told her French method.
They advised Americans to do everything in their own forcibly nationals, who were forcibly detained in Iran.
"Power noise," she said, 'voice loud and clear, "without letting the words" Grundmenschenrechte, "" innocence, "" immediate release "in the media.
This is necessary in order to the Iranian regime in embarrassment, which respects very sensitive to its image.
"Glee running this all the more so, since you ask the Iranians, not to do '.
Because "silence solves nothing," over the discussion about testing on inconspicuous way, the Iranians are "master in Ausweichmanövern."
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners "a familiar, Iranian tactic": "Hostage-taking for political blackmail".
He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss from the prison (which should be reached on August 16, on the day that they are in the French embassy retreats) called "the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians' (230 000 euros bail).
And he state that the Elysée antizipiere further hijackings, a phenomenon that will exacerbate ".
The Iranians could "in the near future, another of the approximately 1 800 French citizens arrest, living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is 12 days has been released from prison, is being held, however, still in Iran.
An information was floated: The Iranians Majid Kakavand, whose extradition to the United States because of illegal trade in sensitive electronics materials to Iran, has been released after decision of a judge in Paris from prison.
The American message is, like many other observers, questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the programme for the nuclear material, is the release of Majid Khakavand a bad news.
France has a horse trading in purchasing?
The liberation of the Iranians against the party of the French woman?
During a meeting with retabling Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September François Richier assured that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the decision of the judges', but have also tried to aufzulehnen against it.
"It has an active exchange between the French Bureau and the French Justice Minister Michèle Alliot-Marie given" (currently), but "the French government can make the judicial decision not to change," he says.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand still under " strict supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Elysée adviser elects a telephone number, back, then informed the American diplomat, the Iranians' was currently chaired by the Iranian embassy buildings in Paris. "
During the custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran will encourage the Elysée his efforts, not through pronouncements and organized by the media "flight testing" believe that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential intermediary role."
The Americans are watching this activity not without irony and noted that the fruit of manipulation, as several articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram on 25 August 2009 datierendes invoked "the media lightning of the French authorities'.
What is so many " expression of thanks to Mr Assad, wonders the Paris message.
"Despite their statements of praise quasi-unanimity price give the French authorities privately that they have only a vague idea about what the Syrians have actually done."
The document also deals with the reasons which led the Elysée to decline this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "aims to Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria to confirm," he analysed.
A policy launched in 2008, which at the time "of numerous critic votes in France and abroad was perceived as a premature and undeserved."
"The Syrian role aufbauschend" Paris "Syria is trying to remember what we can achieve laud by a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also, "discord between Syria and Iran to sow."
The American Embassy knows this good source.
On 11 August François Richier entrusted to them: "Of course we do not know whether the Syrians whatever."
"But we have despite all thanks to them."
"This should at least confusion among the Iranians' cause.
Clotilde Reiss returns on 16 May 2010 after France.
Nicolas Sarkozy receiving in the Elysée.
In a statement he thanks the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the release of our fellow countryman."

"We are of the opinion that this law is necessary for their health and to ensure their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, entrusted with this bill ministerial envoy of the French press agency Agence France Press.
The per-kilometre Online-Games again after 6 a. M. accessible.
The manufacturer companies would have a year for a long time to prepare for the application of the law, so he refined.
The government fasser as well, the manufacturers to ask daily for accessing these Games time limit those young people face, whose parents ask, added the official added.
He will also those people who wish to Gratisprogramme available, which will make it possible to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and the newspapers regularly by various events associated with intensive use of the Internet.

2018-2022: The FIFA World Cup names the host country
In a frenzy on corruption suspicions names the FIFA's executive committee on Thursday the host countries of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, a highly political election, in which the Rangeln threaten to push for influence, as well as the lobbying the technical criteria in the background.
One thing is certain: The 2018 edition of the King discipline of the FIFA is in Europe, their traditional stronghold, held (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, the Netherlands).
The edition 2022 will then be somewhat exotic; the International Football Association hopes, after the premiere on the African continent in 2010 new territories (Qatar, Australia) for themselves to win, or its branch in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea) to follow.
The list of people who belong to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch head of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) is the degree of economic and political use of the World Cup.
The machinations behind the scenes are threatening to hold until the last minute.
Difficult otherwise, a hierarchy of candidates.
Following the evaluation report by FIFA, offer the English, Spanish, Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts besseren arguments than those of its competitors.
But these considerations will be of the 22 members of the era of the election Exekutifkommitees not so important.
The Sunday Times, which in reaching the suspension of two members of the Exekutifkommitees (Amos Adamu and Reynald Temarii) at the start of the revelations, would have been equally good opportunities for their own country, cradle of football, can ruin that only one time the world championship was allowed to wear, namely in 1966.
The BBC had the breedingground again on Monday, giving it a own broadcast, which had three influential members of the Kommitees, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou under fire.
Reason enough to upset the FIFA and the English leaders in embarrassment, which primarily had operated with David Cameron in the last few weeks, an intensive lobbying.
The head of government hopes for a new edition of his predecessor, Tony Blair EU-OPS Schachzug, which had achieved a year in 2005 for the organization of the London Olympics in 2012.
This intensive use would be enough to shore up the image of England before the Kommitee?
Nothing is less safe, because the duo Spain, Portugal, there is no shortage of assets, with its already finished stadiums, his expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, the Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial downsides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about solvency of Spain and Portugal, the chances of Russia, which, despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport) on the weighty Outsider is rising.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided to take the suggestion in the English press Bezichtigung of "an unfair competition in the run-up to the vote" on the part of the Kommitee denounced members.
"One bewirft them with dirt, you try to compromise," Putin lashed out.
For 2022 seem to be the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, the logical favorites.
First economic world power, seat of the FIFA major sponsors, the country seems a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have set separate a very nice project.
But this new nominations seem premature for two countries, which the competitions co-organised kûdoka in 2002.
Another threat: The FIFA long-awaited approval of the World Cup 2026 for China, which will allow the Asian opportunities to 2022 lapses.
With Australia and Qatar, with the appearance futuristic stadiums, all had followed the FIFA its expansion into new areas, but these two countries a greater risk because certainty.
Australia might as well as Japan and South Korea under the of the European countries akquittierten weakness of television rights (because of the time shift), the delicate sensitivities of the FIFA.
Second mandate: The Offenkundigkeit
De Gaulle was really truncated.
Mitterrand had to believe that he stutze.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac was not the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than that.
A mandate in the Elysée calls on the next.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the Offenkundigkeit is the side of the mystery of the presidential function connotation, not good to face.
We must therefore pretend that the doubt was henceforth.
In a sense, as in the other.
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac, a third mandate is not excluded, without even to believe in it.
On 15 November assured to take Nicolas Sarkozy in serious tone, his decision "sometime in the fall of 2011."
He on Tuesday evening in the Elysée before the UMP Parlamentariern the prospect of "two credentials" suggested, widespread, then, a few Fieberhaftigkeit.
It was the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The president could simply remind you that the constitutional obstacle of 2008, the number of five-year terms to just two.
He made a statement that no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentions the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You are still at worst seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
On a new in May 2010: "Does not believe that I am not on the stage after nachdenke."
His words of yesteryear not make it more as candidate than the previous day; but no less.
They should cause comments, then from a double reason.
The acceleration of the Wettlaufes candidacy with the PS on one side.
But it is not the inclusion of the competition with Ségolène Royal, Nicolas Sarkozy, so desperate to reveal themselves.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidate in 2012, which many members of the early, admonishing the PS as an approved to challenge.
The bad polls on the other side.
For the first time the voters would the rights of a candidacy of François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to a survey of the BVA 'Express) prefer.
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP," responded immediately and cautious in the context of the Prime Minister.
"If he was a defeat as possible, he would be no candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin shares with.
"He will always believe to be able to win," corrected Alain Juppé, who has resigned with the Offenkundigkeit.
Euro: The ECB is forced to maintain their acquisitions of government paper
The last meeting of the ECB Governing Council last year should provide an opportunity to present possibilities, as it emerges from the crisis, or at least the authority of a large number of unconventional measures of monetary policy to announce that the end of the year to come to a close.
The crisis of European government debt, the Central Bank in Frankfurt can certainly afford, even today, more than tense situation on the European bond markets to ambitions, not cause their worsening.
The political costs would be far too high.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde had yesterday during a press conference held by the ECB, active role in favour of the resolution of the state budget debt welcomes.
It has not dared to say whether they believe, the central bank can do more, for example, by boosting its programme of the ECB purchases of government bonds.
"I reserve my reasons for my European trading partners (...)."
Jean-Claude Trichet, ECB president, the previous day in Brussels during his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament not very introspective talk about his project, but rather simply to point out that the programme of asset purchases of government paper on the secondary market "progress" and that we will be in the Assembly on Thursday "will be, how will the decisions."
Only certainty: The ECB will make its main interest rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, doubled the bond purchases of Treasury chamber of the ECB last week to about 1.35 billion euros.
And according to leaks of some traders yesterday they should have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government securities.
As a whole, have made the central banks of the Eurosystem since May 2010 purchases of $67 billion euros.
Under the dealers, the anticipation of scripts ongrowers of purchasing rate not in doubt (see page 29).
The economists expect no more remarkable shift.
If the bond purchases of more than three months already disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB, will last for the full reserves on the amount of money freigiebige kind to create, and over a period of a week of up to three months.
The People's farmers are already prepared to extend this measure still for a couple of months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB's programme on essential nature will change."
"Otherwise it would be running the risk of new tensions in the short term," according to provoke thought Michael Schubert, Public host of Commerzbank.
"A for the course of the first quarter of 2011, progressive exit seems more likely," Norbert, for its part, anticipating Bräms Povoaçao host at SCA meetings.
Oppenheim.
In the field of its intervention in the market of the national debt "if the ECB such a purchase volume of bonds aufrechthalten that the sluggish market crowded," adds Norbert Bräms added.
In light of the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the markets of the national debt in the euro zone is to maintain the central bank had no choice but to their presence on the market.
"You must at any cost to the Steller of the lack of investors on the market and so act rashly on the enthusiasm of the weakest states paid returns to prevent ", an important yesterday Obligationen holder.
Because if interest rates on the high-altitude flight, the states would be even more stopped to reduce its debt to stabilise or even.
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
The Berlusconi government is for cover in Italy.
After a weekly start worrying for Italy has relaxed the situation yesterday with the decline of the Eckzinsen over 10 years.
A return to the elusive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the economy minister had the region chairmen Giulio Tremonti, the situation as' 'and unentzifferbar qualify him with a' 'unvorhersagbaren weekend expect to hear what the person was denied by immediately, however.
On Tuesday, at any rate, would have the gap with the German interest rates his record of 210 basis points, and the prices of contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy raised per-kilometre on 263 points, what a certain Kopflosigkeit in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had in his Council of Ministers pointed out that the discrepancy lies in Spain to the German interest rates by 400 basis points.
His right hand, Gianni, but then had a "serious concern" from the "market turbulence" and a possible risk of infection from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, not as Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that, like Portugal, Italy," says Irwin Stelzer, Public host at the Hudson Institute.
In other words, his problem is the Absenz of economic growth and the attendant, schwindsüchtig tax receipts, which the state in danger, it can no longer cover financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
Future will be an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and by 1.4% in 2012... although the expected in the Senate is estimated to examine this budget with 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, as calculated the EU Commission, the budget deficit in the next year or 4.3% of GDP (contrary to the predicted by the governments of 3.9%) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the turmoil for a new budget collective that after the holidays could be used to a $7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says auditor Olli Rehn.
On the hour Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The very foundations of Italy's economy is in order and his accounts are regulated, we have to do it again for a long time," assured Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, which at the IMF is entrusted with Italy.
"In the moment, there are no problems, either in the short term, even in the long term, because of Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, or A. R.) lower than Stabilisationsfortschritte demanded by other countries," observed Pier Carlo, head of the farmer Padoan population of the OECD.
The question remains after the political Unstetigkeit.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi is a censure motion of the Chamber of Deputies, face as a result of which the preferred elections could be organised at the end of March.
It is therefore a less favourable term for a decision on a serious crisis before.
Europeans think about the development of Antikrisenmassnahmen after
Christine Lagarde, it had just yesterday, in the context of a press conference in Paris, explicitly stated: "I believe that the country was still on Sunday afternoon, as well as the evening shown: The Europeans, clearly, are ready and committed to their currency, as well as its currency area to defend '.
Although entirely relative - the siphoning-off yesterday recorded in the interest of the European government bonds was obvious grist to the mills of governments and of the ECB.
From a normalisation start, but can be not yet the speech.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it was the debt note of Portugal, arguably the most effective target of speculators nowadays, lower.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which is weighing heavily on the banking systems," the opinion of the people farmers of Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, especially as "the political time passes much more slowly than the market".
The European countries, which both the gap and the danger, which is well aware of the need to step up the discussions aimed at strengthening the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal discussions between the most directly affected finance ministers and their counterparts in the broader sense of the G20 is progressing well.
And it also in terms of the meetings of Eurogroupe and ECOFIN early next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The plan is the fate of the unconventional measures for the backing of the countries of the euro zone in the crosshairs of markets (see below).
What the EU Stability Fund, has its executive director Klaus Regling said on Tuesday in Singapour his Asia tour, started to inform investors in the Far East on the developments on the crisis in Europe.
If goal of his visit not explicitly is seeking, he certainly this to the ground.
The first part of the ÅU Werpapierausgaben stability fund is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official US representative of the agency entrusted to Reuters, the United States backed a possible rise in the additional, direct engagement of the IMF mobilized funds.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first set, send to assume, for its part, structural reforms, particularly in the field of work Marktorganisation.
Reforms to the austerity measures should be added, however, show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid a different path, as they have done in Greece and Ireland.
Both the one, and the other is at any price to avoid international assistance to ask before they set their own Budgetkorrektive and essential structural reforms have decided that they back breeds confidence.
The European investors, in turn, will discuss on the options available to speed up the process of normalisation of the markets of government bonds.
Axel Weber, who is on 24 November in transit in Paris, the first had the idea that if the 750 produced by Europe and the International Monetary Fund mobilized billion euros not enough, it would not hesitate to resort to the Union, once again in their own pockets.
The economists of Barclays Capital, in terms of market of European government debt in the foreground, judging by the player, an extension of around 100 billion euros would be enough, "preferably" in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
This means exists: The European mechanism dotierter financial stabilisation, which currently stands at euro 60 billion.
An advisory board, all of which has an opportunity to be closely examined in the European capitals.
Especially if the spark market conditions.

Métro Grand Paris: First financial vignettes
Since the debate about the modernisation of the transport economy on the Ile de France in full swing, it rains billion.
At least in the discussions.
Recall, in particular, the 23 billion for the metro Grand Paris in memory, which is being built by the Société du Grand Paris.
For the construction of the start of the SGP MEPs, the state capital has called a $4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the amount of money, which would allow the SGP MEPs then to give to the markets in a part of the Finanzsumme on her Zweifachen.
Today, it has finally come to first projections.
The addition of the 2010 budget, this morning by see the financial Commission of the National Assembly, contains the planned measures to secure the first part of that money.
There are two ways: The creation of a special tax to Erschliessund and higher taxation of offices at the boredom de France.
The former, one person's Article 15 of the draft law, "is in favour of public service station Société du Grand Paris."
This is quantified: "The product of this tax amounts to EUR 117 million per year."
Zweitere is a reorganization of the existing business taxation: "In order to modernise the resulting from their product and to increase this increase Société du Grand Paris to entrust."
How much it would bring?
A mystery.
This sum is not quantified in the text.
From the 4 billion is far away.
"It states that the fiscal resources for the euro 4 billion of capital allocation added, which will be paid by the state and the Société du Grand Paris to the project to be done," according to the explanatory statement.
In the SGP MEPs will take place this system is not offensive.
"For the moment in which one recorded revenue (both of which taxes, that R.), can you explain the paper over three years and then cover first from the 4 billion of talent,."
"This is noted in the budget and gradually withdraw."
The SGP MEPs estimates that in 2013, which will be started to take note of 4 billion for the budget in 2014.
This measure, whose 4 billion promised long will still be able to seek, runs the risk of causing a right-wing, parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
The vengeful hacker and inspired spies.
The WikiLeaks business has a dual significance.
On one side, she is as obvious scandal, turning a scandal, which only a scandal in Sinner hypocrisy is governed by the Beziehunge between states, the public and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level of, and is a foretaste of the future dominated by regression.
But we are going in the right order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that everyone is made up of a secret service produced Act (of any nation) exclusively from newspaper Ausschnitten.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual habits Berlusconi's charge nothing more than what one for months in any case in any old Journal --Taiwan was to read (except those whose owner Berlusconi is), and the terrifying Gaddafi's profile karikaturierte Kabarettkünstlern already offered for a long time material for their sketch.
The rule, after which the secret dossiers only from already known news must insist, is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go into a library, which esotherischen publications, you will see that every station (on the grail, the mystery of Rennes le Chateau, or the Templer Rosenkreuzler) exakte repeats what was written already in previous works.
This is not alone, therefore, that the author occult texts no research (still wants to publish, therefore, that he did not know where news about the failure to find Existierende), but because those who are the Okkultismus, nothing other than what they already know have already learnt and confirmed what they are.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
As the secret files.
The informant is bad, and grow moldy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise whatever he could, for example, editor in Libération), which is just as true recognises what he considers.
The Top Secret information about Mr Berlusconi, who is the American Embassy in Rome had sent the Staatsdezernat, were the same as those who had already published Newsweek with the week.
So why was made such a fuss about the revelations of these files?
On one side is this what any educated person already knows, and that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then the heads of government can call each other or a plane, in order to meet for dinner -- have lost their diplomatic role and have turned, with the exception of some small representativity tasks in espionage centres.
Any viewer of investigation movies knows this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that we should act to ignore this.
Still, the fact that it violates public to repeat the task of hypocrisy and serves to send the American diplomacy in a bad light.
In second place: The idea that a business-as-usual hacker the secret mysteries of the world's most powerful country can tap, carries a major blow to the prestige of Staatsdezernats.
In addition, the scandal less the victims as the "executioners' in trouble.
But we have to pay the profound nature of what happened.
Former to Orwell's time, it was all power as a pool of Big Brother, who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy since then have a completely right, where you can highlight any movement, thanks to the phone can check each transaction made, visited the hotel, the elected motorway and so on; the people would be the total victim of the eye of the power.
But if we would result in mind, which expires today that even the secret Krypta of power is no longer the control of a Hackers escape, so, the control by unilateral target-orientated and to be suspended zirkelförmig.
The power controlled every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker -- as one of the avenger by citizen - can bring the secrets of power in experience.
How can a power that is not in a position to maintain its own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be unveiled); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi's or Merkel's basically free from a secret Geheimis is, as it does the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks reveal that the secrets of Hillary Clinton empty-worded secrets, means to deprive them of any power.
WikiLeaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wronged, but against Clinton and Obama.
What are the consequences of this injury to be inflicted on such an enormous power?
It is obvious that the states in future reserved for any more information will be online -- that would amount to a on the street corner angeklebt form.
But it is also clear that with the current technologies in vain is to be hoped, confidential reports on telephone secret.
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a head of state in a plane fortbewegt has contacted and one of his colleagues.
How could be operated in future private and only for some ears certain relations?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment for science fiction and romanhaft sounds, but I feel compelled to give me the present government agents in secret way inspired in uncontrollable Marschroute moving, its communications than anywhere else in the mere memory with leading, and beyond the few written information they received in the footwear (masked.
The information would only copy in closed drawers stored: Basically had the espionage attempt by Watergate little success, as WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology today as a cancer progresses, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telecommunications Count had revolutionized communications, reconstructed the Internet with a Telegrafen (telephone) wire.
The (analogue) video had the film scientists enables a film band for gang auszukundschaften by from behind forward spulen and all the secrets of Monday could drop, while the (numerical) CDs nothing other than today, from chapter to chapter to jump in Makroportionen.
With the high-speed trains, we have been travelling within three hours from Rome to Milan, while this requires by plane, including of switching three-and-a-half hours.
It is therefore not exceptional that policy and communications technology on car and horse.
A final observation.
In earlier times tried to understand what the press for secrets were forged between the messages.
Currently there are the messages that confidential information demand of the press.
Climate: As France its financial promises of talking
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to comply with the quickly resolved financing promises ("fast start" or premature funding to investigate), which were carried out by the developing countries.
And are already revealed the rough French vulnerable to blandishments.
With the Copenhagen Treaty have the developing countries pledged $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has 7.2 billion euros over three years, promised to France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU has all its partners from the fact their commitment to the Fast-Start-Finanzierungen getreuer approach to convince: Detailed report their Member States, press conference, large, Nebenevents Broschüren distribution.
The operation transparency is remarkable and precisely for their actual value estimated: The developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries made the same on the same level of precision.
The EU, announced in 2010 2.2 billion euros to what they have released on the right path to Respektbezollung their commitment of $7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you are looking into detail, things are a little more complicated.
This money should be according to the Copenhagen Treaty 'new and additional "to ensure that an additional use has been tabled, without the benefit to the detriment of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what the "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission proposed a euro-harmonisation, have blocked certain Member States, including France, the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark, which he considered best.
The European Commission has, for example, as a benchmark for those of 2009 commentators: The international funding will be retained, and is in the context of the financing start-ups "almost" over three years, 150 million of them.
Other countries have elected similar benchmarks, either in terms of year, or about conditions at the level of public development aid.
In return, France was of the opinion that the funding of 'new projects "of 2010 are" new and additional ".
In other words, there is no benchmarks in the spending of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
Specifically, the total amount of French support for developing countries remain stable (or even decline) -- France is to keep his commitment to the "new and additional funding."
Another key factor is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is still no rule, and everyone chooses its computing mode.
Some, such as France, 1 Ministers borrowed as equivalent to 1 donated Eurofederalist.
Obviously, this is only acceptable: The effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often tied to the emission control projects, which are based on technology actually) can be justified, it is deceptive, the euro to present it as the equivalent of a donated euro pervade... should also only the cost of the loan for the country as Kapitalgeber commitment are counted (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing else in the sense than the following thought: "Respect" his commitment from 420 million euros by 91.5% loan (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% accorded) 36.1 million euros) -- see the EU document to see for yourselves.
France is the only EU agriculture that loan engaged in large measure.
Germany is calling for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands, or Slovakia (among others) their commitments to 100% with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union 1 Eurofederalist to fulfil their obligations, France has just 10 cents and understands including a comparable use.
More beautiful hocus-pocus!
All in all, France operates in his fast start funding with a double fraud: A part with a Weiterentwicklkung of the action on the period and partly with the reality of the financial commitment.
France, manage to believe that it 420 million "new and additional" million, in line with its promises and has spent supplemented--and economises EUR 36.1 million.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as it seems likely that it was Bercy, which has carried out the arbitrage) could be a double negative effect,; even (why the other internally within the Member States with the giving away, but if there is enough to lend?), and then in the negotiations, as misled the developing countries is not complete...
The chapter of premature funding only a small issue in a relatively short time compared to the entirety of discussions about the climate.
But it may be too much of the drop in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
We hope that this is not the case.
As always, it is essential to learn its lesson from this first year premature funding.
In the first place could France a change in his recording kind for the years 2011 and 2012, and in the spirit of the respect for his obligations and equilibrium-restoring justice with the other countries of the European Union.
But especially France could the discussions on the subject of a dispute of long-term financing to bring forward (another crucial issue discussed and at the moment): You can escape the issue of " Verrechenbarkeit or of the charge kind of its loans.
France could alter its position as is advanced in terms of disputes, as it on other things.
The hope is based, will arrive on the new environmental Gastinger Kosciusko-Morizet, the next week in Cancun.
A surprising announcement on the fast start of France and his vision of "Verrechenbarkeit" and the use of loans would inherently increase international confidence base, which is necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - of children taken pesticides
A child of 10 years adopted on the day 81 of various chemicals, so this Wednesday from the Association of Générations futures (former movement to protect the rights and the respect of future generations) published study.
The association, which explains that their results "given the low number of samples analysed no statistical significant value, but the problem Illustrationscharakter treated under-sell", had between July and September, usually within four, from a ten-year-old child around on the meals food consumed plus a Zwischenmahlzeit in supermarkets in Oise and Paris bought.
