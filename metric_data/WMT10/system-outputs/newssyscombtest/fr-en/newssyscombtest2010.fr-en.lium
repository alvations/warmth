The shortage of snow in the mountains tracasse hoteliers
The runways deserted do not pose a problem that operators of remonte-pentes.
Lack of snow discourages people to book their stays in skiing in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is still possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of hits on our site.
The users roam the offers, asking prices but dare not commit to set aside for the moment.
And if they call us, they want immediately if there is snow or mud at Christmas, "said Martin Jandura, operator of the information portal Spindl.Info.
If you want to spend the New Year of his dreams for Špindlerův Mlýn, better not too shy away from pre-book.
If one gives priority to the economies and that the quality of accommodation only comes second, then we can try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers of Špindler do not suggest for the moment that stays of a week for the New Year.
I think they will try one more time to put them, but they cèderont themselves and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will rapidly diminish, "said Jandura.
The Ingtours of the tourism- agency Vrchlabí also proposes yet beds of free for all periods of winter.
The week of Christmas we most interested for the moment, it is not completely sold.
He remains free, say, half the rooms in our offer.
That is why we have already prepared some last-minute Christmas stays cheaper, "said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The agency Vrchlabí tourism may also propose the New Year at Krkonoše, but there are fewer free seats.
The first fourteen days of February go well, the remaining winter stays were selling moderately.
This year, the interest for stays of winter has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People expect it to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the runways overlap during the Christmas week, also will be complete, "believes Schiefert.
Conversely, the occupation of the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
It was an improvement of almost five percent.
We still have some last places for the New Year as for Christmas.
There is great interest during the holidays in January and February of Polish sells well too, "informs Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The hotel Omnia near the central parking Jánské Lázně is also full eighty percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of hospital beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent City Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already sixty percent occupancy at present.
February is a bit lower for the moment, but as soon as the snow will fall, interest for stays in the Krkonoše grows certainly said the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The hoteliers of Krkonoše, however, should not expect more snow.
Thursday, he will be fresher and if there are any precipitation, they should be neigeuses in the mountains.
But thereafter, the weather should warm up, informed Jiří Jakubský of the Hradec station in the Czech hydrométéorologique Institute.
United States: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It became comical even, hard effort with which Barack Obama, president at the reputation of wise, reproduced the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan issue, which he regarded himself as quite simple.
When he eventually let sweat its doctrine if eagerly awaited, he proved he had recopiée with carbon paper since the Iraqi scenario Bush three years ago.
Not content to use in the text itself several times the phrase "as in Iraq," he has not hesitated, more importantly, to use the title of Bush's speech of January 2007 as title of his own speech: "A new way forward"
At the same time, he has personally criticized the idea of Bush to send new reinforcements in an Iraq that is consumed by civil war as "irresponsible and a decision catastrophic in its consequences."
The following month, however, have shown that the strategy of Bush, who came from recommendations of the commanders of countryside, was the only possible and likely success to such an extent that the newspapers today do not speak of any of Iraq.
This has not enhanced the reputation of Bush, however, objectively speaking, it was left to his successor a final situation much more favourable than anyone could hope.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen
These are new commanders campaigns who requested an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, Gen. Stanley McCristal, who has even harshly criticized the reluctance of the White House despite the habits of subordination.
He claimed 40,000 troops in order to make the situation more favourable.
The president has hesitated for three months but in the absence of a better option, at least he had cheated General 10,000 soldiers.
He has managed to root out the promise of additional 5,000 from Europe, even if it were about 10,000 at the outset.
This brings the most problems throughout the strategy of Obama seems to be his intention to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan within 18 months and finish this whole process within three years. All the doctrine of Obama raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that an increase of half will bring the same fruits that progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is fairly well organized and its leaders to honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation characterized by the exact opposite - we cannot count on anyone and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to change overnight leader depending on what suits them.
Political institutions, although based officially, will remain just window-dressing behind which will proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is particularly complex balancing the interests of various ethnic groups given the lack of clarity about the reports, which are further complicated by the Iranian and Pakistani influences.
Even the founding of a "state quick to act," which is the basic aim of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of the strategy of Obama makes perplexed by his determination.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has been getting worse and it is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a heart purely romantic and outside reality can be confident that small soldiers sent in the tumult of the war for their "speedy return home" will bring it a miracle.
From a political point of view, define a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban regard as the indirect admission of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit has shown that the desire of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving towards the negative.
The European politicians do or do not want to explain to their constituents why security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable to alter fundamentally the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and that the enhanced penalties have no effect on Iran, the Americans will face the very difficult issue a resolution of the problem by the use of military force.
It will respond by example at a time when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Each solution of this type will, however, a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only rustine for Obama is the fact that there are still three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for it is working on a new strategy, where it would be a total fiasco.
The leaders of the bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive bonuses in cash
Employees high-ranking leaders of the US bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced in response to heavy criticism over its pay practices.
The group of 30 senior leaders will receive shares instead of money, they cannot resell within five years.
Shares may be withdrawn at the leaders in cases where they would take too many risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs and is leading the effort to link payments with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I suppose that Wall Street is well aware of the general sense that we must take, said the former investment banker Douglas Elliott of society JPMorgan
The concern lies in the details, he added.
The bank Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after being set aside almost $17 billion for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will probably 20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, large bonuses in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced Wednesday that it planned to earmark a single tax of fifty percent bankers' bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women have won Nobel prizes in all areas except physics
These are five women, a record number, who received in Stockholm today at the hands of the king of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave the Nobel Prize in the technical disciplines and literature.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer Herta Müller of Romanian origin.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider received with their compatriot Jack Szostak the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to the US with the Israeli Ada Jonath Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for having clarified the structure and function of ribosomes
The last winner received the Nobel Prize for Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with his countryman Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only discipline technique that had no winner this year was physics.
The award was presented today at scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibres avecWillard Boyle and George Smith for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently at the base of all digital cameras, fax or glasses astronomical.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel medal and certificate granting the financial reward.
It reached 10 million Swedish kronor in each category. (approximately 1.1 million euros)
If one of them has several winners, they share the reward them.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been released this afternoon in Oslo in Norway to US President Barack Obama.
He, in his speech, acknowledged the controversial nature of his award since it was not until the beginning of his journey and he is also at the helm of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In the discharge of its policy he added that in certain situations the war is essential for peace, even if the price is high.
The Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the Chateau
The President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning, the Finance Minister Eduard Janota, who weighs his stay in the government because of his disagreement with the state budget for next year as it has been passed by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also Janota's position in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their meeting on Friday.
Klaus also criticised the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which further deepening the crisis in public finances.
This is the presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat who informed the meeting.
Janota wants then discuss its function Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the legislation on the budget, which will be submitted for signature by Klaus is a deficit of $163 billion kroner that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies has approved Wednesday the proposals of the left about money transfers and increased payments of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government accused the Social Democrats' proposals because they would increase indirectly the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and right on the other hand, disagreement which calls into question the future of the cabinet of Fischer, who had been trained by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics argue that the budget, as it was voted by MPs, removes the package of cost-saving measures passed by the Government of Fischer and that it should curb the indebtedness of the state.
Klaus, who can ratify the law on the state budget but that nothing obliges, said today at a breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs, that politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "irréfrénable disability" of public finances.
Now there is, according to him, no solution favorable.
Only a strong government could bring about an improvement, if he could rely on a broader consensus among political parties, according to the president.
The chairman of the ODS Mirek Topolánek has indicated that the budget is staggering and that the government should call into question the future existence.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas ČTK said that the idea of a cabinet administrative supported by the ČSSD, the ODS and the Greens doesn manifestly more.
In his response, Prime Minister Fischer described such words of "drastic" verdicts.
The head of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted against Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is amazing and it will exceed 200 billion kroner.
On Wednesday, the ČSSD has already qualified success the ratification of the state budget for the next year.
The Popular Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in the Clint Eastwood's new film
Despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans say that the new Hollywood film Invictus - Invaincu will outline the world a lot of things about the country, its struggles and victories.
History speaks of sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, U.S. actor rewarded at the Oscars, embodies the film on the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the apartheid racist regime in South Africa and first black president.
Freeman said that it is a Mandela aged and ninety-one years who asked him to embody in the film.
Matt Damon plays an important role.
I told him: "If I have to embody, I should be able to see you personally..
The actor aged 72 years who has been rewarded for an award for his role in the tragedy Milion Dollar Baby of Clint Eastwood located in the middle of boxing, for example, has embodied the leader of a movement against slavery, slave himself become a fictional US president, even God in the film "Evan Almighty but never someone alive and so important to so many people that is Mandela.
The ex-homme of State of South Africa was jailed 27 years for his hard work in favour of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became chairman of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning unbeaten and it is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team Francois to unify the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country resteencore and always divided racially and economically after apartheid.
He is persuaded to unite his people through sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outcasts in the world ranking.
The Springbok team will eventually grow in World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years to bring the history of Mandela on the big screen.
I had no other purpose if not play this role in order to bring the most from the reality, "said Freeman.
The biggest challenge for me it was, of course, talk like him
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, dinner with him, of being behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I give you my hand, I recover your energy, it is transmitted and I had the impression of how you feel, "he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a National Rugby team in which there was a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh environment of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I come to the door of the house, he opened and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was: 'I look a lot bigger in the movie ".
Despite the differences between the actual actors and models Invictus, under the leadership of the filmmaker Eastwood received positive opinions and there is even talk of ambitions for the Oscars.
The film critic Todd McCarthy of Daily Variety summed up his assessment in these words: "This is a very good story, a film very well done."
In the evaluations of films on the site rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive feedback.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is resolved: a Russian rocket testing
It has been observed a luminous phenomenon strange of unknown origin over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence has acknowledged that yesterday have tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from the Norwegian border.
The launch has still been a failure, and the type of missile "Bulava" which was originally scheduled to be the pride of the Russian army is gradually becoming a nightmare Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His presence repeated during testing of the rocket has not had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Most of the time, or Bulava has not disappeared, or it was damaged in full flight.
The Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as "the missile which do not steal"
A missile which do not steal but which shines
This 13th test took place early normally.
It was not until the end of the flight that there was new damage on the apparatus.
This is clearly the engine of the third stage of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" has disappeared from the nuclear-powered submarine Dmitrij Donskij which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be precisely set on fire in a boat in motion and submerged
That is why the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object specifically has likely been a "Bulava" defective.
Moreover, the Norwegians have not doubted for a moment that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot speak in complete failure.
The first two floors of the rocket have resisted and damage was confined to the third.
In the previous cases, the drivers have experienced failures on the first floor.
Although none of the test launches only happened without hitches, the leadership of the Ministry of Defence considers that only six out of thirteen have been failures.
This success rate of almost 50 percent therefore fills general optimism and they therefore argue still that one day "Bulava" fly without problems and that she will win even ten nuclear cores hypersoniques a total weight of 1,15 tonnes.
The legendary 51-year-old Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow
The legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetissov arises again in a professional match in 51 years.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and holder of the Stanley Cup will help his team of CSKA Moscow in need and will make its entry probablementdéjà during Friday's game against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career to 40 years in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After the injury of Denis Kuliash we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov is regularly and agrees to help the team.
We must still resolve some details on the form, "said the coach of the club Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It was not clear whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will do only one match.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mental other players, said Nyemtchinov.
According to AP, in the case of his back on the ice, Fetissov becomes the Russian professional hockey player the oldest.
In the NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played an entire season for Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the quintet famous Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among those with the most success.
Under the colours of the Soviet Union he won twice the gold at the Olympic Games, seven league titles in the world, he has triumphed at the Canada Cup and World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he récoltait the tributes also in NHL where twice he held the Stanley Cup.
It has been a member since 2001 of the Hall of Fame hockey.
Hyundai has listened to the unions and supersedes all overtime
The leadership of the Hyundai plant Nošovice has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of overtime frequent that unions have declared a state of emergency strike Monday.
The spokesman Petr Vaněk of the plant Hyundai confirmed.
The management, however, wants to get agreement yet with the unions on a Saturday worked again this year.
We cannot renounce our production plan, it is essential, that is why overtime volunteers have been proposed on Saturday, 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, Vaněk said.
The site Sedmička.cz said that the company has proposed a bonus 400 Czech koruny employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will be awarded also has a posteriori for the day worked on 28 November.
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change the way to motivate its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for hours, or they may pose a replacement leave on 28 December and extend their year-end holidays aindiqué Vaněk.
In addition to this all employees present Saturday will receive compensation for the costs of transport and for their lunch.
Given the fact that overtime were the most urgent issue and the hottest in the comments and the demands of the unions as employees who have spontaneously ceased production last week, management took the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, employees at the automotive plant were forced to work almost daily two overtime in addition to their eight hours.
The unions intend to cancel the state of strike after signing the agreement.
The following negotiations between management at the automotive plant and unions ought to take place Friday afternoon.
The union leader Petr Kuchař said Wednesday that they were ready to stop the state to strike if agreement on their claims and signing of a joint document.
The situation in the factory culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of incessant overtime.
They also protested against poor conditions in salary and alleged hazing.
The leadership is defending. with the fact that employees had to work as a supplement to meet the requirements auto production.
In announcing the strike Monday, unions have also asked that employees who ceased production are not subject to any sanction.
The unions are asking the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want this year compensation of 5,000 kroner (approximately) €209 for them.
The Nošovice Hyundai car plant currently employs 2,000 people.
She started series production last year in November.
She has produced about 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech Discovery: a substance which operates on the HIV virus also "endurants"
A team of German and Czech scientists test new combinations that can slow the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed an immunity to the drugs.
The reality is, in some cases, the upper hand on the fact that the combination is not as intensively on the common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at the moment.
You can nonetheless dramatically extend the lives of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
Consumption is, however, a number of side effects.
Moreover, the suppression of this proliferation has to effect the development of so-called resistant viruses on which medicines have no effect.
The experts' work of three institutions, the National Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way for a way to cope with the resistance to the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalocarboranes affect the protein responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are an assembly of boron, carbon, hydrogen and cobalt.
This combination is blocking the development of the virus in a different way of all drugs used until now and that is why they could overcome the resistance problem.
The work of researchers leads them to discover new substances "improved", on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their routes on the protein from the virus.
The metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two cages in multiple walls are formed by atoms of hydrogen and boron, carbon and connected by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A virus traitor and resilient.
The HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus which is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of HIV protease caused by HIV there would be no mature birth of infectious particles of the virus.
If you stop HIV protease, we stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, say researchers in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the National Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their study published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic link, which is then systematically amended.
A little smaller but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on the HIV protease has been tested in tubes as well as on its resistant variants, obtained from patients infected with HIV.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as on the clinical medicine, however he continued unabated on the resistant versions against which current drugs are often ineffective.
The metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and their other properties as their biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications are therefore to consider more interesting combinations to move towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, "says Pavlína Řezáčová, director of the structural biology laboratory of the institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and molecular genetics institute of the National Academy of Sciences.
Dispute around the budget. The ODS is attacking Fischer, who defends
The president of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), Mirek Topolánek has described as "staggering" the budget ratified for the following year and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should call into question its existence.
The prime minister called the remarks of the ODS of drastic verdict.
He said take time to analyze.
The spokesman of the ODS Petr Nečas said that the idea of a cabinet administrative supported by the ČSSD, the ODS and the Green Party didn manifestly more.
According to Nečas, the head of the government should decide whether ilprend in the Chamber of Deputies support on the minority who cares to combat the growing deficit, or if he cares to stay in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas has warned that the positions of the ODS and Social Democrats over the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, but with the proposed amendments to the tune of 12 billion kroner included by the left.
The House has increased the money for the salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's grievance against the proposals of the Social Democrats was the fact that they rose indirectly the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should run a deficit of $163 billion kroner.
The ODS has left the chamber before the vote, obedient to the wishes of the government that a budget as amended is a variant less bad than an interim budget.
Deception and uselessness
The Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of worthlessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still consider the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office in the case of ratification of the proposed amendments, the situation might be different.
According to the Czech Television Janota took meeting Monday with Prime Minister after its passage through the government:
He said at the same time he wondered whether he would stay in office.
His disappointment at the negotiations on the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to combat the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, which have imposed changes in the budget, have no place in government.
The Prime Minister should also make clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other laws increasing the deficit such as those affecting the insurance, pensions, or the reform of the law on services.
Topolánek: ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
This is the case of the head of the government Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing harmful, said in a statement Topolánek textual since the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some departments profess TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas said that if Fischer decides to give his resignation in the face of conducting a fight against the amount of the deficit of public finances, "it is entirely logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority which is currently in the House."
That said, it should not expect the support and tolerance of Democrats.
I have not thought about it and once it will be on the agenda when I shall devote, said since the House to journalists, the Defence Minister Martin Barták, elected government precisely by Democrats.
The Prime Minister Fischer is flying in the afternoon for a discussion of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS has backtracked at the request of the prime minister.
Nečas stressed at the same time that the ODS probably would have voted on Wednesday against the budget amended if he had not specifically asked Members Democrats to allow the budget vote.
We don't have the feeling of being orphaned, it is not small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not suffered criticism from the chairman of the Party in the House or in the country during the negotiation of the budget.
I haven't noticed that my vote would have been lacking.
I knew already when I renounced my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a bolchévisation of the House and the destruction of everything there was positive, reacted Topolánek in person.
According to the new schedules from the ČD there will be fewer trains for the same charges.
Czech Railways will eliminate or limit on 13 December some express trains regional or less responsible and instead would increase some others.
The total coverage of transport will fall on the day of entry into force of new schedules of two percent compared to today.
Most of the charges will not change, including the basic rates and the reduced rate.
These are for example the inhabitants of the Ostrava region who have more routes to the capital, the Railways will add a rowing pendolino.
On the contrary, an expressway will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be less fast trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, the direct line Letohrad Prague - will be dramatically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decline in transportation is the region of Hradec Králové eight percent in total, however Prague and its environs can rejoice an increase.
Two night trains on the line Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice are also cancelled and the movement of some express trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice is reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the greatest change, you can see the introduction of a new direct line of Milovice in Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice must change at Lysá nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of the commuter system Esko, whose opening is possible thanks to the completion of electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The lines distant towards the capital will have their final destination at the main railway station nádraží Hlavní Praha (Prague).
The HC ČD will introduce more lines between Prague and Ostrava and Pendolino trains bound for Šumperk / Jeseník will depart by every two hours.
Travelers can no longer take the Pendolino until Bratislava on 13 December.
The bill this year for regional railways: 200 million kroner extra.
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the Railways next year in all four billion kroner to settle losses visible, or the same amount as this year. The regional trains are ordered by the regions who will pay for their by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will be up to almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
Railways have newly signed a contract for ten years, until now, the length was still a year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they have not resorted to a price increase of the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will affect only tickets a day ČD Net and the eLiška Internet tickets at reduced prices.
For travelers without a map of reduction, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 kronor.
The price of eLiška newly-issued will depend on the distance travelled, whereas previously it was valid between cities from one region to the choice and was at a single rate of 160 kronor.
The Filipino rebels still hold more than 50 people, children have been released
The rebels have kidnapped today 75 people in the southern Philippines, including some students of a primary school and their teachers.
It is the AFP Agency who informed, but who spoke at the origin of 65 hostages only.
The 17 children were freed after eight hours, as one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels have used the hostages as human shields during their fleeing from police.
Negotiators premises are trying now to find an agreement for the release of remaining hostages.
According to the AFP Agency, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CCrP).
According to the AFP Agency, police initially pursued the kidnappers following violence caused during a settling of accounts between two family clans.
Martial law was declared in the province of Maguindanao in the southern Philippines because of a recent massacre during which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November linked to the elections to the administration of Governor there avait30 journalists.
The governor of the southern Philippine province was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the Ampatuan influential lineage.
The island Mindanao also includes Muslim separatists assets.
They have however renewed peace talks with the Philippine government Tuesday.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman a.k.a Mandela
The new Hollywood film of Clint Eastwood arrives in US cinemas in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus: Neporažený), and narrae part of the life of former South African president Nelson Mandela.
The role of the fighter against apartheid globally known returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody.
The second male role of the legendary champion South African rugby has been attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in cinemas, returns of critics and the public are heard.
Nelson Mandela
For its full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on 18 June 1918 in Mvezu in South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for freedom of spirit, in 1993 he then received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside de Klerk.
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great expectations since he arrived at a time when on the one hand South Africa is in full preparations for the World Cup, and secondly because the media are stirred by disturbing news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of people on the part of the black majority to power.
According to AP, reactions to the new film are for the moment rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations towards the main roles where "pavanent" of Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is nevertheless, using his own words, proud of the film.
I dreamt of this role many years and I am well prepared.
I also repeatedly personally met Nelson Mandela to power - as they say - recover his energy, "he said during the official first film in Los Angeles.
I think it is a good thing if we had the opportunity to remember via the film personality and the message from Mandela.
This is the story of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every individual "he added.
Porter the jersey of national rugby team
The film based on the history of the novel by British writer John Carlin the title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the room that gave his creation to the people portrayed the South African defender of human rights during his presidency.
Morgan Freeman is trying during the movie to pick up two racial groups of a population long divided and even that Nelson Mandela in 1995 it between wearing the jersey of the national team of South Africa on the lawn of the World Cup, which South Africa won then.
To be shown on the lawn in jersey, which is regarded in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been a long standing ovation fourteen years ago mainly white public and has been recognized by the white populations.
Hopefully the football championship will unite people again into one nation, said the rugby player Chester Williams, who was in 1995 the only "black" of the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the South Africa tense situation will improve.
The white South Africans, however, are sceptical as recently said in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a fan of rugby who fled to Britain.
The tournament begins on 11 June 2010.
A processor worth tens of millions of kronor in flames in the area of Louny
A fire has engulfed in the morning a processor of the Čeps company's distribution center near the municipality of Výškov na Lounsku.
According to Lukáš Marvan, spokesman for the firefighters of Ústí, there are six units that operate on the fire.
They had originally let the processor is consumer, but they revised their opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, a short-circuit internal processor.
Nobody was injured, and according to the spokesman for the company Pavla Mandátova the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the whole of transmission.
The damage is estimated at tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure will be known once the fire extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the processor destroyed must be replaced by a nine.
She added that in 10 years of activity, the company Čeps has experienced anything similar, and that the incidents are isolated.
The electricity supplies were not interrupted, said the spokesman for the company ČEZ for Northern Bohemia Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova, the functioning of homes, government and industry has not been influenced by the fire station of transformation.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator on the Czech territory sets of transmission and power lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
He maintains, renovating and develops 39 posts of distribution with 67 transformers transferring electricity since sets sets transportation routes and distribution lines with a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jančura will sue for defamation against three prefects to the ČSSD
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, will file today a complaint for libel against three prefects Social Democrats.
And specifically against Michal Hašek region of southern Moravia, against Radko Martínka region of Pardubice and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesařík.
Jančura indicated in Dvacet minut of Radiožurnál.
The complaint is linked to the attempt by the company to exploit regional railways in some regions.
All regions have eventually sign long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three were attacking us and say we are doing fine mouths, while it has only made an offer for what they wanted to themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the price of Czech Railways which were signed last week.
So we have to defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for slander on society Student Agency, said Jančura to the Radiožurnál.
Similarly, he said he had evidence that no region has proceeded in accordance with European law.
We are preparing for that a complaint to the European Commission.
Hašek considers that the complaint of Mr. Jančura is a continuation of his media spectacle that serves as his free publicity for his company and for him personally.
I am of course prepared to defend my name and the name of my region and I urge other prefects to do the same.
I suppose that this will be an opportunity to show clearly that it is precisely Mr. Jančura who manipulates public opinion and uses arguments false and misleading about the regional rail transport, "says Hašek
Jančura has already informed last week that it will invest a few million kroner in an advertisement that mentioned the steps unfavourable regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he will interrupt the campaign after Christmas and it intends to resume after the New Year.
He said that the campaign will target corruption in the broadest sense.
Jančura began his campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways operate rail links for an order of about 150 billion kronor, without issuing an invitation to tender.
According to Jančura, a way to act is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions Jančura has even led to threats of a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if one does not cease, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I don't know who he is but I will not say his name, said Jančura today to Radiožurnál.
Vaccination against pneumococcal is free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococcal reversed the old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Some voices already, saying that a compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcal peak.
The pharmaceutical institute for vaccines already defines the maximum prices that will pay the insurance.
The experts also see clear in the process of vaccination.
A new vaccination.
Vaccines free for children of August.
Since January, children born last year starting on 2 August can be vaccinated for free against pneumococcal.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If you started vaccination last year or earlier, you must pay yourself the following vaccinations.
The first dose of vaccine must be administered between the third and the fifth month of the child.
Last year already a quarter of families has voluntarily vaccinated children against pneumococcal.
Yet parents paid 1,600 crowns even more for a dose.
Vaccination of younger requires four doses.
Experts estimate that each year the insurance spend 300 to 450 000 kroons in doses of vaccine.
They save however on medical care that unvaccinated children require.
So far the state spent approximately 500,000 kronor per year for any vaccination of children.
Vaccination repaid was introduced with the "Janota package."
Pneumococcal bacteria are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including inflammation of the meninges and blood poisoning.
According to surveys in hospitals, there are even 28 deaths of children under 10 years caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced vaccination repaid.
Vaccination will be mandatory?
There is advice on an eventual vaccination requirement in the future.
From January, it must be resolved by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský said that a compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
His association has long promoted the pneumococcal vaccination.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the experts were not really satisfied with the fact that we have a vaccination optional.
It is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased to be able to impose at least this.
I think it is a direction that we must now follow Kalovský said.
But the health ministry doesn't change the process of pneumococcal vaccination.
We do not envisage for the moment, his spokesman said Vlastimil Sršeň.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, say doctors.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Société specialised paediatricians, acknowledges that a vaccine based on the volontariata its shortcomings.
If all children were vaccinated, we could consider a reduction of renewals vaccinations "In the situation where the vaccine is such a sum I understand the decision making voluntary vaccination," said Cabrnochová.
The experts predict that by next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will vaccinate their infants.
Vaccination against pneumococcal also marks a rupture of the fact that it is the first vaccination of children, which is funded by insurance and not the rule.
Cabrnochová explained that insurance should free up funds for prevention, they would save and on possible future medical care.
Doctors will buy their products themselves
This is tied to the concerns of pediatricians practitioners, which relate to the purchase of vaccines.
The original intent was to buy vaccines by insurance, physicians receiving in the same way as other products of vaccine provided by the state.
Some Members feared, however, that this would allow insurance companies to deduct the amounts "of health insurance."
Thus, doctors will buy the products and wait for insurers reimburse them.
According to estimates, pediatricians to individually invest nearly 40 000 kroons per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
Also them and we
Islam can be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be lured by this new book, fans of the author's latest book, "Why the French don't like the headscarf" (2006), a study elegant and well documented on an issue that has divided and troubled the country for 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
The latest book by Mr. Bowen presents a fabric far broader and more ambitious.
Bon anthropologist, it would not only know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes in France this now provide queM. Muslim spaces Bozen called "5m-6m" for the Muslims.
He knows very well listen to and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on issues that concern them most.
A Muslim should marry in a mosque or at the town hall (or both)?
The evolution and gay rights should be taught to young Muslims?
A Muslim woman can marry a non-Muslim?
A Muslim can use a banking system based on interests to obtain a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than political dramas concern to the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, a Muslim Arab born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate until the end.
Lesconservateurs do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts lawyers of a purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia that these days, constitute a small portion of Muslims in Europe.
M Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and secularism of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can be obtained only with the efforts of each side.
He wondered how the French politicians (and the intellectual elite guardian if virulent secularism) are genuinely committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims have not been spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, he detects a "narrowness of core values."
Islam can be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The most dismal view of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other place on the planet.
The ice-cream who composed is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipments and new fisheries sail in open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a thin layer of ice," Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the symbol of the far north, the polar bear.
Connaisseur political history and complicated whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who were their evidence in chasing the polar bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then courageous aspiring to 14-year-olds who had to fight just the tip of his mousquet, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young cubs, captured while they were swimming alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a show celebrates gathered 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still generally a millionth of the surface necessary for an adult in liberté. climate is rarely mentioned: a polar bear living in Singapore became green because of algae that grew in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and is often on the threat posed by hunters on the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, in America and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada, where hunters by helicopter motoski in Indian and Inuit use of powerful fusilsd' assault to oust their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two nations of hunting that ice will be the longest.
In his new book, "After the ice," Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear summary and frightening Arctic science and a fascinating glimpse of what may be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither the atmosphéristes nor oceanographers cannot tell exactly the speed of change.
This is not for lack of trying.
In late 19th and early 20th, travel pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen gave the first report on the melting of the icecap.
The submarines in the Cold War were then mapped changes in sous-celle-ci terrain.
The surveillance satellites and probes placed on icebergs are of great help, but the bulk of the work is done by men hardened, having camped out in the cold.
Mr Anderson look at the world extraordinary and tiny system dependent on the Arctic ice, formed by the nets of brackish water pressed by freezing.
But the bear mentioned above the microscopic marvels contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of summer ice, scheduled between 2013 and 2050.
"In recent months, this may be our turn"
Some Marines, among the 6,000 people who have laid wreaths on the graves in Arlington
The De' ﬁrst-class Angello Robinson, 19 years, has made a journey of seven hours by bus to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier that he had never met.
For him and for other Marines who have made the trip to Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina to the Cemetery Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was devoted to salute the men and women who, one day, were in their places.
In recent months, where we will be sent, we will be in their place, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If this happened to me, I would like someone to do the same thing for me, so I just try to show respect.
It was one of 6,000 volunteers to be gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans, in different sections of the cemetery in Arlington Ceremony.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others have decided to decorate hundreds of graves in the cemetery in Arlington Ceremony.
Now, to continue a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife Karen, are each year the trip, stopping in different cities on their way to organize the commemorations in honour of the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcester have also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America (Some wreaths across America), which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers have placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves of Arlington cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the cemetery Fayetteville National Cemetery enArkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City and on the site of the memorial to the victims of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the foundation Walmart Foundation gave more than $150,000 to buy and carry the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she had made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a career soldier died.
While her husband is not buried at Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed.
It is a small gesture that can make the civilians to support our troops, "she said.
It is like visiting a family tomb.
Emmitouflée in several layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked between lawns and hills tracts of the cemetery.
Volunteers have chosen ancient tombs, dating from the First and Second World War and the Vietnam War, because they are not as often visited the new graves, organizers said.
The mood was optimism, while children played and couples stood by the hand, bringing the fresh pine wreaths on the graves grey.
Each krona round had a dark green color, with a small red butterfly knot on the top.
Nearby, loomed silence on Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations has given 1,000 kroner to decorate the section but the somber mood of current wars emplissait the area.
Individuals were crying without hiding, others praying and families and friends have argued in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in stone while others looked to see small black and white maps, thrown open in the wetland for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers in tears on the grave of her son.
It is part of Zanesfield, Ohio and led to eight hours to come and collect on the tomb of Sergeant Marine GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in battle in July.
Nobody should ever forget thanks to what we're free... my son has paid for it, "she said.
"Long after I've gone, I want someone remembered."
An American citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested an American citizen who distributed mobile phones and laptop computers in the country, said the services of the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana trying to gain access to the inmate who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested under the pretext of being "dangerous".
All activities, including protests revolutionary so-called moderate and critical writing, entail the risk of arrest.
The anti-gouvernementaux graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a community of bloggers increasingly large, conducted by Yoani Sánchez, popular commentator who writes often about how are and her husband were followed and harassed by agents of the government.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards but the authorities have always been denied.
The detention of an American citizen may increase tensions between the brothers' communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration pursues a "soft" approach to improve relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times, Friday evening.
The new US policy insists that the Cuban government advance by concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and create more space for the opposition, so that the United States to reciprocate.
Mobile phones and laptops are permitted to Cuba, although this is of desired new and consumer-goods in a country or the average salary of an employee is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for SMS or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a day's salary.
On the island, Internet use is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as some government buildings, such as universities.
The Cubans wishing to connect often must provide their name to the government.
Access to some Web sites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few American jailed in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, press officer with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any open society, would be allowed -- distribute free mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas Program Director of the group Human Rights Watch, who recently published a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba," referring to the installation of Raul Castro as leader of the country to replace Fidel, his ailing older brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, past on trial and jailed the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, at a time when both countries begin to initiate a better dialogue.
The Pakistani authorities prevented a plot to send troops to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities have spotted an organization supposed to prepare a plot to send five men of Northern Virginia in Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, saying they hoped that this case would disassemble an extensive network of terrorist recruiters in écument Internet searching for young men radicalized.
Investigators said they hunted a hidden insurgente personality, known as Saifullah who invited these men in Pakistan after having discovered when one of them commented approving the waves terrorists on the Internet video site YouTube.
Once in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help reach the remote area of the tribal belt of Pakistan, home of al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the Pakistani intelligence service who was informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince commanders of al-Qaida that these men were not involved in the plot by the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the mountains banned from northeast become a haven for terrorism.
They have been considered undercover agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities said that the men were identified and they tried always to obtain the necessary authorizations for entry into the camps of al-Qaeda when they were arrested by the forces of Pakistani law.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and who are being interrogated by the FBI -- insist on the crucial role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and perhaps more importantly, in the determination of people who give confidence.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US secret services had priority to infiltrate men in al-Qaeda.
Recruiters of the organization play the role of firewalls, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may be spies.
According to analysts, the potential American recruits are being studied closely by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and propagandaire of their value.
However Evan Kohlmann, an expert of the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that the terrorist groups must also do more attention in recent years in the choice of people they accept because the US secret services have become experts as regards their recruitment methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than follow his recruitment model that many other people have already undergone? said Kohlmann.
The model is one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen called an "action" for climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants marched in the streets here Saturday, calling for greater action on climate change on the part of negotiators working in the Palace of Congresses Bella Convention Center in the city.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000 people, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
The event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked militants has lit a few explosives near a set of government buildings in downtown area.
On this day where little has happened during the discussions on climate sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists marched through the city, clutching placards in English saying, 'There is no planet B "and one in Spanish, stating" The Earth said she has had enough. "
Several celebrities have joined the protests, including the top Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travel to the homeland of his mother, Peru, has opened our eyes to the wrenching problems facing the country due to the impact of climate change are already happening. "
That is one reason why I decided to join the march -- to get the word out and to launch an appeal to the leaders of the world to take decisions that are fair, ambitious and involved, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police prevented the protestors from coming too close to the centre Bella and said that it had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing masks and / or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
Police prevented the protestors from coming too close to the centre Bella and said that it had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing masks and / or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passer-by who requested anonymity because of his involvement in the discussions on the climate, the activists who wore masks and black clothes, have lit several explosives near the main canal of Copenhagen, which is surrounded by some departments.
They launched near the buildings, he said, adding that they were firstly rockets, followed later by "a few big explosions."
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people gathered around television screens to follow the march, throughout the afternoon.
But it appears that the demonstrators have failed to awaken the conscience of key authorities such as Su Wei, China's representative for climate change.
When asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English: "In fact, it is something that I hadn't conscience.
He then continued in Mandarin, saying "The event is important, I cannot hear what happens outside."
He noted that the march could be harmful or helpful according to the outlook.
It shows the interest of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or that they interfere with the freedom of others."
The results of tests revealed persistent differences between races
The federal report last week on the results in mathematics has brought good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the District is still far behind the leading institutions, the report shows that the Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are in much greater progress in the past two years that in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of the progress of education) is the persistent gap between the results of African-Americans and whites, in terms both locally and nationally.
The average scores of white children Grade 4 (cm1) WashingtonD.C. increased over the last two years, 262 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their classmates Afro-américaines rose by only three points, 209 to 212.
The gap of success has actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-American in Grade 8 (4th) generally remains steady, falling only one point, 245 244.
The average score for whites was not included in the results of the tests because the sample was not large enough.
The overview over a period of six years is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in a class of Grade 4 (cm1), when the first District NAEP report was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved by children in both groups have increased over this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District have expressed concern that rising celebrated by the Director of group educational institutions Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were propelled by the white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we have raised the aggregate considering the elements at the top of the ladder, which is problematic and troublesome, said Jeff Smith, Director of DC Voice, a non-profit group that defends equality in education in the District.
I don't jumps of joy for one or two points earned, said Kwame R. Brown (related Democrat), member of the D.C. Council and whose daughter is in Grade 4, Eaton Elementary (elementary school).
Often critical of the management style of Rhee, Brown said that the message of test results is that the middle schools (colleges) of the city desperately need attention.
Really, you always see the positive signs and I respect that.
But what is scary is that we do not spend enough time and energy to our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee said the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at schoolchildren in grades late cycle elementary and early college who have not built the foundations of reading earlier in their schooling and who are quite late compared to peers.
Every day, the Mathematics curriculum for the classes of (maternal) Kindergarten to Grade 6 (6th) focuses on the games and real life experiences, as they have been put in place in the District by the former superintendent Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I simply believe that we must continue to work to provide better responses to these students of lower-tiered in the class, said Rhee.
Others believe that the NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less successful in order to reduce the gap.
That is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a trainer of education at the University of Berkeley in California who is studying the results of tests of cities.
The conventional political solution is to spend your resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
So this targeting may be political repercussions that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like other Superintendant schools, she is trying to use the middle class whites and blacks.
Our focus is to ensure the development of a system of good schools.
We must strengthen our schools districts so that all families, regardless of where they originate, are assured that their children can obtain an excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendant schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the keys to reduce the gap in achievement étaitla duration of the traditional public school, today to 180 days in the District of Washington, to compete with the Charter schools.
We must obtain approximately 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with the union of its teachers last year for 185 days, he considers a "starting point" for an increase in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise for the future
The bus was arrested in Gettysburg College with a long whistling.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years, descends and cligne a moment of eyes at the sight of white columns brick facades and verdoyantes lawns.
Parents of Graciela had only been able to finish the school, àEl Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
So when she and other students in Grade 8 (4) of the group have explored Gettysburg where tuition fees are $38 690 per year, his attitude was less that of a new student impressed that enthusiastic.
Super That's where I'll study! exclaimed Graciela wishing to study medicine, while the guide the heading toward the entrance to the building of science.
songeuse Youpi, really? "she says, when he indicated the low ratio law professor - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that were visiting children during their three-day voyage of discovery, and now they have fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to the university:
The question is where.
Although this question is still largely to the large number of American children born to parents Hispanic migrants who have left the school where became parents during adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to enjoy university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, a "Hispanic" second generation "on cinqpoursuit his studies at the Lycée -- a significant success considering that so many of their immigrant parents, most from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without having completed high school.
Their success is important, say the researchers, they pave the way for future generations who will play an important role in the workforce of the country.
Researchers studying the battants say that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
There are also those whose parents set lofty goals for their children and who find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach the university -- in particular, whether its efforts are regular and long term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, does not help, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who has studied the American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that has funded the visit universities of Graciela is a good example.
Known as the GEAR UP (prépares you), it provides more than $300 million per year on systems of local schools to organize the university preparation programs that begin when students from low income families are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of years of school.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering university, according to the US Department of Education.
The Department of Iraqi oil gets agreements with foreign oil companies 10
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auctions, which ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign-owned oil companies suggest that the oil companies of China, Russia and Europe are poised to play a major role in the rehabilitation of the oil industry of Iraq, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
The American companies are left with an interest in only two of 10 fields auctioned.
Seven American companies had paid to attend the second auction that began Friday.
The only one who had set an auction has lost.
Two US companies have obtained contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, are of Asian and European companies that are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the forum Iraq Oil Forum, a site for information on the Internet.
It will take a long time before another offer being made in Iraq.
Concerns over security, corroborated by massive coordinated bombing, Tuesday, and political instability while the US military troops withdrew have hampered the US oil companies, preventing them from entering more forcefully in Iraq, which has the third largest reserve of crude oil in the world, say analysts.
The American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, especially the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, including labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they had not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the department.
The largest US companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong links with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and gave him their technical advice, were left empty-handed.
The Russian companies, Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the state, has more enchéri on contracts that other companies and exited with major holdings in contracts for two major areas.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, "said Assam Jihad, spokesman for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that Chinese society will be on an equal footing with its competitors and will carry out its commitments in Iraq.
The pré-sélectionnées companies to submit auction have made offers which were then compared to the tariff per barrel that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qaeda was killed in Pakistan
It seems that a US missile strike, which hit along the border with Afghanistan has killed one of the organizers of the operations of al-Qaeda, this week, U.S. authorities said Friday of the counter-espionage.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack against a terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected to have been killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities have said that the missiles had been fired by a pilotless aircraft of the type used by the CIA inside Pakistan's anarchic tribal border.
They were driving a white car, moving towards the Afghan border, where the car was hit, said a member of the secret services Pakistani civilians, speaking by telephone from Miran Shah.
Representatives of the authority said that local activists suspects rushed on the spot and were quickly confiscated what remained of "body completely torn apart."
It was totally impossible to local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but both U.S. counterterrorism officials have yielded unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of the Responsible organizers military operations ran the al-Qaeda terrorist group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Her role was to organize conspiracies in the world, said one of the authorities who requested anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its centrality, this included probably conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe.
It followed the instructions of strategic leaders of al-Qaida and has translated into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the U.S. authority said that Somali had grown rapidly in the ranks of al-Qaida' s and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It is perhaps not known to the general American public, but this does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second important figure of al-Qaeda or the second leader Taliban killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks carried out by CIA drones has declined since the summer, about six transactions per month to two, according to the figures by the Long War Journal, a Web site tempered by a non-profit group.
This decline could be due to improved tactics terrorist groups who have risen to reduce their vulnerability while killing also ruthlessly informants suspected, says the site.
The UN envoy to Kabul withdrew
The UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous tenure marred by allegations of corruption spread during the presidential elections backed by the United Nations.
The departure of Eide comes as the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the increase, but he has expressed his concern about the timetable for a withdrawal of US troops would begin within 18 months and that would require other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, "said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials helping the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase should be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he does not resigned but simply that it will honour the commitment it had made to his family in March, will spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows he has time to find a replacement.
I simply said that it was better to begin to look for my replacement, said Eide.
When I came here, there had been a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to the representatives of the United Nations, Ban has already begun to seek a replacement.
The representatives argue that the name of Staffan di Mistura was quoted; it is a Italo-Suisse citizen who recently chaired a U.N. mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guehenno, a Frenchman who had previously led the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations.
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan has been put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, was accused in September, to promote President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and to conceal the evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has denied these allegations, but he said that the accusations of Galbraith -- who was thanked -- "have harmed the mission because there was already a good dose of scepticism as regards the international observation éléctions".
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the rescue of US forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN officials responsible for they allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries that it is assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that it would give them more confidence about how their money is spent.
Eide has expressed his frustration about the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy UN hiring regulations hampered its ability to bring new talent.
The UN rules are such that I could not recruit a single person since May, he said.
It is catastrophic and it cannot last.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world's major powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on the nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking before an audience of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a week-long visit in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, has dédramatisé the possibility of military action against the Islamic republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a question from a soldier on the possibility of such an outcome. ¨
One of the things that I weighs more, is that if I learned one thing in Iraq over the past six years, it is the unpredictability inherent in the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that would target the military and political elite in Iran, but Gates indicated that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians in the street.
He said that "a set of incentives and punishments" may be necessary to persuade the Iranian government that it would in fact be worse security with nuclear weapons "because" his people would suffer enormously 'of these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the administration has joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face consequences "probable" if it does not back its nuclear program in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran continues to say he wants to develop its nuclear experience only in a peaceful purposes.
In the Geneva talks on October 1, he indicated that he would resume dialogue on reducing its nuclear program and agreed to abandon an important part of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed such an agreement, medium build confidence on both sides and win time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to be remote attempts agree - partly, say experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, I think, the raidissement of Iran facing some of the proposals of the international community to which they had in fact given their agreement in early October, has pushed the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese to join what they had not envisaged, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals before it turns to other options, including the continuation of what the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has once called 'increased sanctions. "
In a statement made Thursday in New York, the Mission of Iran to the United Nations has denounced what it called "baseless allegations" of some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and said she was willing to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to obtain a satisfactory solution in the long term."
Gates, who was scheduled to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, before flying to the oil rich region of Kurdish derencontrer to the Responsible troops to Kirkuk, Irbil and Kurdish.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly regarding borders, property rights and revenue sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the conflict potential in order to avoid any delays of US plans to reduce the number of American troops to 115,000 to 50,000 before the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm the anxiety of Kurds concerning the withdrawal pending. The US authorities have quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq."
We will not let you down. "
In China, a change of direction aging
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by lecturing – the propaganda poster "The mother earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "A baby increasingly, it is a tomb in more".
They have so far learned the lesson that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the lack of birth rates in their city and the ageing of the population, have radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their response has been instantaneous and firm: ever.
We have already given all our time and energy to a single child.
There is no second, said Wang, 31, Director of Human Resources and who has a 8-month son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating unique notoriously Two-generation children with good cheeks and spoiled, dubbed the "little emperors", a crisis of the population threatens the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and over will explode, 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This figure is well above the overall average of approximately 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in the rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission of Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning) has said that fertile couples to have babies in order "to help reduce the proportion of the aging population and to prevent a lack of manpower in the future."
Shanghai is on the verge of becoming "too old - but not as rich, however - that developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual mitigation
Written in the country's constitution in 1978, the Chinese one-child policy is to this day, without doubt, the most controversial requirement introduced by the Communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay huge fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and suffer discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have attributed to the police on duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while the human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority have forced women pregnant with a second child to have abortions.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high ratio boys - girls.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they have paid more exceptions to the rule -- including for residents of cities, members of ethnic minorities, and cases in which the man and woman are already children unique -- and in 2007, they have softened much of their slogans hard.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research (Institut de recherche sur la population), at Peking University, said that the authorities of the central government has recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child have been replaced by copies of regulations detailing who has the right to have a second child and how to apply for authorization.
The city government has dispatched officials of family planning and volunteers to meet couples at their home and slip leaflets under their door.
He has also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response was disappointing.
Answer disappointing
Although officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for records of couples seeking a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000 people, for example, receives only four to five requests per month.
Officials in Shanghai, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is always planned to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Family Planning Committee in the municipality of Shanghai, Caolu said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want more children.
They want to fill their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and they are legally entitled.
But like many Chinese, they have only minimum health insurance and life assurance given by the government.
Without a social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
The West mistakenly see that the one-child policy is an issue of rights, "said Yang, an engineer in construction, whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
It is true we steals the chance of having more than one child.
But the problem is not only the law.
It is money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their reluctance.
Wang, Head of Human Resources, said she only wanted to a single child because she was one herself. "We were the centre of the family and had the habit that everybody cares."
We don't have the habit of taking care of someone else and we do not really care for others. "
Chen Zijian, 42 years and owner of a translation company puts it more bluntly.
For couples working at two, middle class, which depress the birth rate, he says, he must be selfish pourbien succeed.
People of 20 or 30 years have grown up seeing their parents struggle in the early days of China capitalist and don't want themselves this lifestyle, "he says.
Even one child time-consuming of his parents, he says.
A mother must abandon at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the problems of space -- "You must change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child has only nine months, you must write his CV to secure a place in the best tongue."
Most of his friends are willing to that experience again, said Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to enjoy a higher standard of living, "he says.
We do not want too many sacrifices.
The Group of the United Nations has projects plans for reducing emissions
The climate conference, sponsored by the United Nations -- characterized so far by mutual recriminations and disorganized assignments -- is back under the spotlight Friday, due to the publication of a document outlining the ambitious cuts in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations supporting most of the burden in the coming time.
The text, which could provide the foundation for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, said the remaining obstacles, as it has illuminated the path to take.
But he was seen as an important step forward in the negotiations that lack of time, with more than 100 leaders from all over the world arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Drafted by a special working group of the United Nations, the text did not say how rich countries would donate to the poor to withstand global warming, short and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how the developed economies and emerging economies news could reduce their production of carbon and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature increase that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It gives greater flexibility in the process, said John Coequyt, Representative àWashington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a negotiating text of 180 pages to concentrate on what was described by the Secretary-General executive on the UN climate change, Yvo de Boer, as "the complete picture."
It shows the guidelines of a possible agreement in which industrial nations collectively cut their emissions by 2020, from 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries, during the same period, minimize their 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union has also revived negotiations Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion per year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, US Representative to the climate negotiations has rejected any discussion forcing the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, in comparison with the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not financed by developed countries.
This change is a signal that the Obama administration becomes harder to China that the Bush administration has been two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of major developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text doesn't enough to ensure that the reductions could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments one hour after the Chinese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, He Yafei has said that the US chief negotiator, lacked "common sense", was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier in the week that the United States did not help financially China to combat global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of major world powers involved, flaws appeared both within the Third World and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more concerned with the rescue of individual economies that saving the planet, with China and the U.S. are querellant on their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the two dozen of the most influential countries ignore scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said he was not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even if vulnerable countries became more aggressive in their attempt to make the major emitters accountable for their actions.
It is really a game in which has developed a new economic hegemony, said Ulate, who is also adviser on climate to Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change have said they would continue to put pressure to obtain a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say that negotiations will lead to a minimum, a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States which brings together 43 members, has drafted a proposal for a Treaty of 24 pages, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of the CRCM unit of the European Commission, said that the action of small island states has "put political pressure on the entire political process," in part by what they are now unified and they call on emerging economies such as China and India, to act.
The debates have become a matter of urgency, while delegates focused on the fact that they should solve most problems pending before the heads of governments come to an agreement.
Some high-level officials such as the Indian Environmental Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Deputy Minister Chinese are descended from their plane and rushed into the building of the Bella Center to attend meetings in camera and conferences of information, in order to make claims to be studied during the following week.
The real image of the rally -- during which 13,000 people enter and leave the Palais des Congrès each day -- activists guitar players are nightly performances mocking the country which they believe will betray and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by emails -- constitutes a real challenge.
The intensity is only grow: almost all key Ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the big boys, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global politics of Conservation International.
The heavyweights arrive.
In Britain, the first train to 225 km / h will redefine Monday Syndrome
A 5h13, Monday morning, a whistle percera night to report the departure of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 225 km / h, when he filera from Ashford in Kent to London St Pancras, covering the 93-like km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Minister, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first commuter train Javelin outside London.
He hoped that the new service will allow Britain to join an international network of fast trains and reliable and large conurbations linking North, Midlands and Scotland in London.
Small holes lost become thriving cities to the suburbs, the business travel times are shorter and the passage of the plane and the car in the train will reduce national emissions of carbon while reducing congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adherent to this project.
But the ten billion pounds necessary to construct a new rail network, the battle inevitably planning and fears of environmental hazards threaten to delay the high-speed lines in Britain.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January for the government to conduct a feasibility report, will make his report to Lord Adonis 30 December.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where environmental impact studies may be controversial.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres from the final itinerary.
It is also expected that HS2 offers three options for a high-speed network larger, moving northward.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are put forward in a configuration in Y why a high-speed line will go up to the West Midlands.
The line will separate into two at or near Birmingham, with a branch of the Pennines westbound àManchester and Scotland and another towards the northeast, towards Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line through Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best option for performance 'said a professional rail.
When this is complete, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part, which will not open before 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a trip of an hour now.
The proposals will allow the train to travel 400km / h, making the British network the fastest in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains to 400-meter in length and can carry 1,100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a line London - Birmingham.
A terminal can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
Given the constraints of space, it is anticipated that an existing station will be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Experts from the rail industry say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he feels that the project should be put in place, but public consultations longer and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will be built part by part.
The trains will be firstly forced to roll out high-speed lines on existing track north of Birmingham, retaining travel times between London and Scotland in excess of three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure a transition from planes to trains, constituting a reference point for the revolution of the railways.
Taxpayers repaying the loan of £75,000 for the orangerie of Tory
Alan Duncan, chief Tory member of parliament, made payable to the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year to repay the cost of a orangerie he has built in his house in his constituency.
The head of the party who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were "maintained", has increased its loan of £75,000 to build an extension in oak at his second home in Rutland.
He had been allowed to pay the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The authorities of Commons received complaints at the time and have not been interviewed by Sir Thomas Legg, which conducts a review of members' expenses. Last night, Mr Duncan said that complaints could not be "clearer or simpler."
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland - Melton.
The nearby homes were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The main floor contains a kitchen, a lounge and a dining room, but the fees office said that Mr Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a porch at home, outlining his plans as a orangeraie.
The neighbours describe as a "porch for fun."
It has not been asked Mr. Duncan to give an explanation for the borrowing increase during a recent investigation made by the Committee of the Commons standards and privileges, concerning its provisions for pre-solicitation loans.
The Committee has cleared last month of all charges of non-compliance with the rules, after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan has changed the legal certainty of borrowing of £271.406 London his property to the house in his constituency he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents released this week show that Mr Duncan claimed about £1,400 per month of interest loan until March last year.
In April, its demands have increased by more than 1,800 GBP per month.
The interest rate on the loan RBS of Mr Duncan has not been changed at that time, suggesting that all the increases were designed to finance the loan of £75,000.
The standard variable interest rates RBS rose from 7,94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, without moving since then.
The last publication of Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim £1,250 in May.
Mr Duncan lost his post as Head of the shadow cabinet in September, after an undercover journalist was allegedly filmed saying that members of parliament were to survive "on budget" after the expenses scandal.
"In fact, it is now national, you must live" on budget "and you are treated as" the m... e "
He said: "I spent my money on my garden and I asked a small party, based on what was correct.
and I could ask damn well, but I didn't do that. "
The member of parliament, a millionaire from his former position as a trader in oil, has begun to explain its spending in May, after it emerged he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before agreeing with the fees office that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist has dug a hole in the form of £in the lawn of Mr Duncan to protest after it was revealed that he had claimed £4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing, last night, Mr Duncan said: "It was for improvements capitals, approved at the time by the fees office then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem of evasion or development or use of rules or anything.
It was quite clear in the rules, authorised, etc.
This could not be clearer or simpler. "
Faithful, come all see the Advent calendar of Brighton
The Brighton beach cabins have found a new way of promotion for the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, a church group that promotes alternative spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for each day of December, using as theme songs of Noel.
The event began on 1 December, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cab, 5.30 p.m. to 6.30, each day, with blocks and the hot wine served free of charge.
The songs of Noel chosen to date include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas," for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, an assistant marketing TV of Hove, unpaid is a priest of the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion is closer to the people in a post-chrétienté society.
"As a church, why do we expect that people come in an old building strange? It seems to me that the Church should get closer to the people and celebrate more exciting.
"The idea of the Advent calendar of the cabin of beach came just after a conversation with some friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is a place where creative and heartfelt and we try to experiment and to represent it through spirituality. "
Late payments: anger of prison guards, planned actions
The unions for prison guards called Friday for a "general mobilization" to demand the payment by the end of year holidays of bonuses and overtime which payment was postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-pénitentiaire (2nd union of supervisors) has asked the personnel who will not be in service of protest Tuesday morning before prisons and "block," to "denounce the theft of their due."
The CGT-pénitentiaire (3rd union of the profession) calls on them to "meet in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong turnout" as "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December "overtime, bonuses nights, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of supervisors, the prison autonomous Federal Union (Ufap / Unsa), "calls for a general mobilization (...) to trace the discontent and anger".
The Directorate of Prisons and the Department of Justice explained that overtime have increased significantly in 2009 and have not all been budgeted, but ensure that the leftovers will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Michele Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of supervisors guaranteeing that payment would be made next month.
I know the efforts made by the staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, wrote Justice Minister in the mail.
I asked the leadership of the prison administration to implement without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation arising out of a wrong assessment of the number of overtime does not recur in the future, "said Mrs Alliot-Marie.
The pay in December will be lean, except for the personal leadership benefiting from the famous bonuses of functions and objectives, deplored the Ufap / Unsa, for whom "the budgetary constraints have good backs."
It is a pure scandal, has outraged the inter-regional union FO Marseille, in announcing its decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings and summonses."
The staff will not work on their Sundays and holidays if those of October are not regularised in December, idem for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when increasing our duties and our missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare take on taxpayers staff, believes the CGT-pénitentiaire of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of which are less badly off than others.
But anyway the account is not, found the secretary general of the Ufap, Jean-Francois Forget.
For Christmas, Obama said offer of "tips more owls" than those it receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is preparing to spend his first Christmas with family in the White House, told the "papesse" of the small screen Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple rule on gifts: "I give tips more owls than I am."
In the framework of a special programme to be broadcast Sunday night on ABC television, the president and his wife Michelle offer an overview of how they intend to celebrate the holiday season in their new and prestigious remains.
Even Bo, the small four-legged companion of the family will be the party.
The Santa Claus Bo also likes, "said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would" naturally "a gift, according to excerpts of the broadcast released in advance.
And Michelle Obama has registered in false claims against her husband about the quality of the gifts he receives: "Definitely not, I told you've offered nice gifts last year," she taquiné the president.
Absolutely, he was forced to concede before responding with humor pointing the finger at the string of pearl of the First Lady: "Who gave you that?".
During this one-hour programme, casual atmosphere, with the famous moderator who has been a staunch support of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife were also remembered their gifts favourites as children.
Barack Obama has raised a bicycle to ten speeds, but also a balloon basketball that his Kenyan father he has rarely seen offered him at Christmas.
I remember the time I met my father came to see us for Christmas and where he gave me a ball of basketball, the president said.
Only much later in my life that I realized that it was he who had given me the ball.
The First Lady was remembered somber-looking doll of his house.
I don't really know how to organize a house so I had aligned all furniture against the wall, rather than arranged around the fireplace, but I loved this little house dolls, said Michelle Obama.

The first day of the competition where the combinations are allowed for the last time saw only three world records beaten while it awaited a flurry.

A regret for Bousquet, who lorgnait on the world record in the 50m free, which he owns the trademark in large pool (20.94).
On one of the two distances queens of swimming, the 50m free, it is the Frenchman 28 years which was imposed in 20 sec 53 in a final where 10 swimmers took the start against eight usually a first at the international level.
Bousquet edged the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russia's Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but has not succeeded in lowering the world mark (20.30) as he had envisaged.
We can always dream better and in this case, I said that if the world record was within my reach, I'd try.
Like Bousquet, almost all of the swimmers were wearing in polyurethane suits, which will be banned from 1 January.
At the root of 238-kilometer world records since February 2008, these combinations complete their epic in Istanbul, which had hosted the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of combinations has not used this time to Germany's Paul Biedermann, double world champion in large pool this summer in Rome, world records in the key.

I am not given substance on this race.
I knew I couldn't this time beat a world record but I managed to defend my title and I accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, "said Biedermann.

Trying to start abortive Zelaya of Honduras to Mexico
Mexico ruled Thursday that the conditions were not ripe for the transfer on its territory of the deposed president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied a safe-conduct by the coup government.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation into the night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities of achieving this transfer are not fulfilled, said the Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
When he arrived Wednesday in El Salvador to restore Mr Zelaya, the Mexican government plane is returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate of Migration.
The coup government wanted to oblige Mr Zelaya to "resign" and to seek political asylum abroad to give him a safe-conduct.
But the deposed president refused, because he wanted to travel to Mexico as a sitting head of state guest.
The coup government "has been a new failure in that I renounce my charge... they wanted me to resign," said Thursday Mr Zelaya radio Globo, on which he frequently speaks since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here 10 years here I have my guitar, added by playing a few agreements the deposed president, refuge at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican Embassy has presented us with a request of safe-conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it contains no asylum application, said Wednesday the interior minister of the rebel government, Oscar Raul Matute, HRN Honduran radio.
I do not claim asylum in any country, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview with the Qatar-based Telesur, headquartered in Caracas.
A possible departure of Honduras will do as president of the Honduran people, he said.
Rumours of departure of Mr Zelaya had mobilized Wednesday supporters of the deposed president, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the soldiers have tightened their siege.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, has criticized the position of the coup government.
This demonstrates the marginal nature of this government to international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who was closer to the socialist president Hugo Chavez, was ousted on June 28, the day when he had organized a popular consultation to prepare his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, military and Congress.
After living in exile in Costa Rica, he returned by surprise on 21 September and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested to answer for the crime of "high treason" whose accuses justice, according to the coup government.
The rebel president Roberto Micheletti has managed to hold a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial ballot recognized by the United States but disputed by Latin American countries like Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted overwhelmingly against the return of Mr Zelaya to power until his term ends on January 27.

USA: the lawyer for Polanski claims again the dropping of charges
Counsel for the franco-polonais filmmaker Roman Polanski has claimed again Thursday in Los Angeles, California, western United States), the dismissal of charges against his client, currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a matter of morality more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer for the director of the "pianist," denounced before three judges of the Court of Appeals for the Second District of California serious procedural errors at the time, in 1977.
I called for the dropping of charges here and now, said Mr. Hummel, adding that the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was shiver."
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- died since -- would be discussed, before rendering its sentence, with a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison -- what constitutes a serious lack of procedure.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, who is wanted and desired), in the words of the prosecutor, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally said in late September having "lied" to the author of the documentary.
In the event the court refuses to drop the charges, Mr. Hummel has demanded a trial, which would allow him to present evidence of his arguments.
The prosecution has meanwhile reiterated the arguments already developed in the first instance, namely that no dropping of charges could not be seriously considered until Roman Polanski would not attend the court.
The filmmaker, aged 76, had fled the United States in 1978, before the sentencing, for "unlawful sexual intercourse" with a girl of 13 years.
He has never set foot in the United States since.
The deputy prosecutor in the county of Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayama, said that Roman Polanski "must be there to appear at the hearing."
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, it is possible to escape?, asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "request a favor to the court, while scorning his authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to render their decision -- he also stressed that "there were other alternatives to the leak."
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to request the dismissal of charges against Roman Polanski.
Counsel for Samantha Geimer, the victim, has also claimed, once again, the end of proceedings.
Recalling that his client is no longer bear to be harassed at every rebound of the Polanski case, she added: "Nobody in this room cannot say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough ".
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on U.S. arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he has been under house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, pending a possible extradition.

Honestly, the market is very calm, noted Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
He remains in narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very weak and I think it will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend has been supported by the publication of economic indicators better than expected, which "have helped improve market sentiment about the strength of the economic recovery," summarized analysts at Charles Schwab.
In the US, retail sales rose 1.3 percent in November for the second consecutive month and much more than expected.
The US consumer confidence has also significantly improved in December, to 73.4 against 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the index of the University of Michigan.
The indexes were, however, hampered by a further rise in the dollar, the highest since two months against the euro, which leads to the bottom "sensitive sectors in the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
The technology stocks lost ground.
The bond market fell.
The yield on a 10-year Treasury rose to 3,540% vs. 3,482 percent Wednesday evening and that a good 30 years at 4,497% vs. 4,492 percent the previous day.

The news of Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," according to his son David
The news of Johnny Hallyday "are very positive," said Friday his son David on his arrival at the airport in Los Angeles where he should go to the bedside of his father, hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It is very hard, it is going very well, "said David Hallyday its exit from the plane that led to Paris shortly after 1300 local time (2100 GMT).
The son of the singer, air relaxed, assured that he would go "very quickly" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection following surgery for a slipped disc on 26 November in Paris.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent him suffer and be able to administer his treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted Monday for an infection following surgery for a slipped disc on 26 November in Paris.
The singer had to be réopéré on the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to major damage resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning at the Lycée Français de Los Angeles where is educated their daughter Jade, to attend a school spectacle, an AFP photographer reported.
The head of trauma and orthopaedic surgery at the hospital in the Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel Monday to Los Angeles with the singer.
The producer has vehemently challenged Dr Stephane Delajoux, neurosurgeon who has operated the singer on 26 November at the International Park Monceau Clinic in Paris.
We were told that it was a massacre.
Surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, said Mr Camus.
I heard talk of a possible judicial proceedings to come, "he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday was "party much too quickly to Los Angeles, with the permission of the surgeon in Paris."
I had this doctor in person in line who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and I was amazed, as I myself had two hernies discales, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "party without drain, without anything," after his operation in Paris.
Dr. Stephane Delajoux is well known in the artistic community.
He had made the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was at the time.
In 2007, he had also made the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to eliminate haematoma following a cerebral hemorrhage.
But it is also a physician at the sulfureuse reputation, repeatedly condemned by justice, in matters medical liability and for tax evasion and fraud.
Mr. Olivier Metzner, counsel of the Order of Doctors, was accused of being "a man without scruples" pursued "regularly" before the Council of the order, and that is "not advisable".
After several days of silence, Dr Stephane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
He said that the intervention was "perfectly well" and that the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not haemorrhagic and does not therefore required the laying of a drain," he added.
In any event, the tour of the singer, whose health problems multiply since this summer, appears in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (Amiens) as planned, it seems very short, "said Mr Camus.
The association UDF increase the tone and amount the New Centre no longer use its acronym
The association UDF, controlled by the MoDem of Francois Bayrou, reacted Friday to the takeover attempt of the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the logo of the ex-parti giscardien, by putting it on notice to no longer be used on any medium, under penalty of prosecution.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced its intention to recover the acronym UDF, ruling that Francois Bayrou did not deserve defending his political legacy after having reached out to the left.
The defense minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support his approach, he received the support of the Member Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP past the NC) which claims ownership of the trademark UDF for having been the first to the table in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But Friday evening, the office of the association UDF, controlled by friends of François Bayrou, who do not intend to let strip, exited his silence to launch a formal notice to the Minister and MP, demanding to no longer use the logo and to convey the ownership of the trademark, under penalty of prosecution.
You have multiplied in recent days, the statements indicating that you propose to your political movement + resume + the acronym UDF, writing the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including Francois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist Alliance.
You have also seen fit to follow up on your equipment activist and on the front page of your site, the name of this movement, the + New Center +, the slogan 'the UDF today +, also found the signatories of the letter.
As you know, you have no right to the use of the acronym, said the office of the UDF which puts remains the NC to withdraw "immediately the reference to the name of the UDF of any medium and (its) website."
It also asks Herve de Charette "to convey the property of (the) marks its legitimate heirs."
If you do not doing, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, prevent signatories.
In their letter, they clarify that the UDF "is a full-fledged political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to abandon it in 2007 "to create a movement competitor, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP."
The New Center did therefore, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 accession to the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office responsible for defending "the material and moral interests" training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, says the office, "when he filed the mark," there was "no longer a member of the UDF for three years," but the UMP.
It benefits criminally and fraudulently the abscence of deposit of the acronym UDF to perform on its behalf.
This indélicatesse is turning into a crime, dénoncent-ils, before ironiser on the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more fit to make a name for yourself than trying out of anonymity taking fraudulently a name to which it was not right."
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The tribunal of Nanterre decided Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine if, as in accuses the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, he has benefited from a state of weakness in his 80 s to rob a portion of his fortune.
The photographer of 62 years, known for his photos of stars, will be held on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, an offense punishable by a maximum sentence of three years imprisonment and a fine of 375.000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families of France, in which a mother and daughter are tearing apart while taking the reins of the L'Oreal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th Criminal Chamber also ordered a medical examination of Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87 years, should be waged collectively by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oreal has always refused to comply with such a review, at least not under the conditions proposed by the prosecutor in Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors appointed Friday will submit a report before March 10, 2010 in particular if Liliane Bettencourt saying could find themselves in a state of weakness and what periods.
I think it will submit.
I am going to talk about it, said at the exit of the hearing, counsel for Mrs Bettencourt, Mr. Georges Kiejman.
For his part, counsel for Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, lawyer Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is great news... The expertise will show that he (Mr Banier) has manipulated this elderly lady that we must protect, he said.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has committed criminal charges in the case against François-Marie Banier, photographer and artist hands-on, which it accuses of having benefited for years from the weakness of his mother to obtain one billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, insurance contracts or paintings by masters.
For his part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, which it sees as a longtime friend.
While the court should examine the admissibility of the action taken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, arguments from lawyers have sometimes turned into a large family unpacking Friday.
Thus, the lawyer Liliane Bettencourt has reported three letters sent by his client (1999, 2003 and 2005) at his notary, in which she said he is wary of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for 15 years.
Françoise, I've never been able to talk since her marriage. ".
For its part, the Nanterre prosecutor has again felt that the complainant was not entitled to act, especially as a tutelary judge refused in recent days to grant his request to open a procedure of judicial protection for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full ability to sue, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place, "said the representative of the public prosecutor, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court has finally decided that it would decide once the trial has taken place on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers.
Revolution managerial or end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our struggle to the development of economic intelligence has been vain...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies vis-à-vis its employees, said the companies' position vis-à-vis consumers before the revolution marketing: it is to join the staff to "values" determined from above as it once was, to impose on consumers of products designed by technicians of the plant.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the revolution has handed the marketing strategies of conquest of markets at the place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected factors preferences of customers back regularly!
A demobilization employees can lead to demoralization deadly desires.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much broader phenomenon which affects particularly executives.
The demobilization seriously undermine the development of all mental functions of the company, including R & D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE "requires all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires on the part of employees a commitment that the authoritarian management revenue thwart completely.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would put the staff at the centre of the concerns of the company in the same way that the client.
The relative utility internal surveys
The internal polls – as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its salariés- will incite a revolution in the managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I fear that no.
- First because I could see that, facing a new situation, any structure is finally, after many twists, to make a priority... what she has always done.!
- Second, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of the pouvoir- grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most of the leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
Issus of major engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old theory behaviourist, revived recently by the "American" neuroscience and widely disseminated, unknowingly, by the institutes and the media.
Thus, suggesting that it is possible to handle the "levers" (sic) the commitment of executives, a recent survey by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr conforte-t-elle the leaders in a mechanistic governance posture, unsuited to today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern business, implies a vision finalist human behaviour.
She is to integrate, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: for employees, the commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means of achieving a portion of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only studies from motifonctionnelle Analysis adopt this design of motivations of employees.
These studies have shown that they feel their company based on a predetermined doxa allowing them, through their image of the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these factors of mobilization, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and submit their human resources management "in the place."
They create a breeding ground for the coordinated development of a robust and effective economic intelligence.
Address by Oslo: the "just war" is right to praise in Obama
The American right hailed Friday the speech the day before in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had brocardé the awarding of the prize to Mr Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former vice-presidential candidate during the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, "said Ms. Palin, égérie from the right wing of the Republican Party, the newspaper USA Today, adding that she herself addressed the issue of the war" sometimes necessary "in his memoirs which have just been published.
The war is obviously the last thing in my view that Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We must stop these terrorists any there, she said.
Mr. Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, has sought Thursday to Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, said that the president had made in Oslo "a very good job."
I found that the speech was really very good, welcomed the former chairman of the House of Representatives, which has particularly liked the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
For some side, I found this speech quite historic, "said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed at the radio show" The Takeaway ".
The former elected, regarded by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012, said he was delighted to have seen a "leftist president" to remind members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not put a price for peace if the use of force did not exist."
For Michael Gerson, former pen of George W. Bush converted a columnist for the Washington Post, Mr. Obama has delivered a speech "very American".
Besides appearing in "citizen of the world" as "it always does," he spoke as an American president, "reminding Europeans" they live in a bubble of security that they have not created and that they do little to preserve it, "said Mr. Gerson.
Among the few right to not be convinced, a hawk in the Bush era, the former ambassador to the UN John Bolton, called the speech "dull, ampoulé and without inspiration" on the site National Review Online.
To the left of the president, Rep. Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When envelope the war in the concept of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocents, "he warned.
The center-left press remained commendation against the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that the Nobel prize was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, called his speech "superproduction" even for one speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo discourse "should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," has inflamed the California newspaper.
Mr. Obama "gave the speech he was," said the New York Times, the ruling "both dark and uplifting."
Teamsters: three marathons for a procurement agreement that saves Christmas
After three sessions of marathon talks, the road sector unions and employers' organisation TLF, only to be stayed until the end, arrived Friday evening in an agreement that puts an end to the strike and the threat to the supply of Christmas.
At the meeting of signatures Friday evening, the secretary of state for transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "delighted" of this agreement, after several rounds of negotiations, which began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions negotiators were left in the morning Friday, with the hope to sign soon in the late morning the text of an agreement.
And even if three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had slammed the door.
But it took more than six hours a meeting which began at 1100 so that everyone is in agreement and at 6 pm the text should be signed.
The conflict "would have been very damaging for business" and "it was feared that it would disrupt the celebrations end years," said Mr Bussereau.
The text provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and euro2.9% for the highest (international transport).
In hourly rate for the bas-salaires, "you spend 8,72 euros to 9,06.
It is not a great thing, but it is very far, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
This or we will give the order to our supporters that there are no obstacles, no blockade centers of supplies.
But we can always be a few holdouts who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, hailed "a good agreement," even if it was "difficult to concede the increases on high-wage given international competition."
According to him, the increases will be the order of 170 euros a month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the top.
That is the agreement of good sense and respect of employees, "said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) hailed" a historic agreement. "
Richard Jaubert (CGT) has meanwhile referred to "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for the upgrading of the travel costs of 3%, and the holding of general state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will notably to address the issue of a 13th month and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a drop of 100 million euros in employer contributions" has been the subject of a governmental amendment to the bill amending budget for 2009, passed in the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate vote "in terms identical".
The signing of TLF allows that the Agreement applies initially to the member companies to this organization, and in a second time, the entire profession, in the event of extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be "in the shortest possible time," assured Mr Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organisations may only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "fool's bargain", because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to offset a portion of the carbon tax."
The Secretary of state? transport we were obliged to negotiate in the? emergency, not in conclusion d? an analysis shared, but not to thwart the turkey eaters next New Year, deplored the Unostra.
For the Otre, the agreement risk "digging the grave d? a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months."
RER A: disruption this weekend, unions unhappy with the proposals of the RATP
The disruption on the RER A, the biggest urban transit line of France, will continue over the weekend, while a meeting Friday on the second day of strike between unions and management of the RATP left on their hunger regarding their application of premium.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there will be trains that between 1000 and 2000, owing to a train on two on the central portion (between Defence and Nation) and one train in four outside the central section.
The interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, requiring passengers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette, who expect 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is making efforts to serve the big stores."
The RER A crosses from west to east the city of Paris.
The stretch RATP short of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre in Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one train in two was circulated at peak hours, and almost no rowing in off-peak hours, as planned.
Since Thursday, there was no crowding on the docks, the Franciliens is being organized.
Thus in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less busy than usual, especially because of the absence of middle and high school students.
A Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, 29-year-old engineer, was being lifted "a half hour earlier, to be sure to arrive on time."
The Saint-Lazare station has not been saturation, said SNCF, which had provided a framework of agents and security forces.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left the Saint-Lazare station to join the subways.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, deemed "meagre" by the unions, a meeting with management Friday afternoon.
The Director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the RER A on all aspects, working time, career etc.
This is not what we want drivers, who are demanding a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP puts even its proposed premium brackets, has outraged the CGT, stressing that the leadership "was not fichue to fix a problem while among truck drivers and the SNCF is done."
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday for "a wider review of conditions for the exercise of the profession," said the RATP.
What did also say to the unions that the company "scoffed users of the weekend.".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded a committee of establishment at the headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the leadership, which refused until then any discussion during the strike, had suggested "in a spirit of appeasement" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to widen the RER B Tuesday, after the filing of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
The unions are demanding a bonus of 120 euros (Unsa) to EUR 150 euro30 variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to the million daily passengers.
Drivers of RER, all in the second part of career affect 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros in bonuses for staggered schedules, Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish justice dissolved the pro-Kurdish party, decision has far-reaching consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled Friday the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision which was immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which just reach out to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) has been disbanded because it had become a "hotbed of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," said the press court president Hasim Kiliç, after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dissolution, said Mr Kiliç, adding that 37 of executives of the party, including its chairman Ahmet Turk and Aysel Tugluk MP, are banned from politics for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Mrs Tugluk and confiscation by the Treasury assets of the party.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (about 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MEPs would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without a label.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP to obey the "AQGs" of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), blacklisted as a terrorist group by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political wing of the PKK rebels.
The party assured, however, that there was "no organic links" with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with him.
The verdict of the Court comes as the government comes to extend a hand to the Kurdish community in proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, to try to cut off support to the PKK Kurds and put an end to the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP had said that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in the southeast, where many protests against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the largest city in the southeast populated mainly by Kurds.
The police fired tear gas and used water cannons, while protesters throwing Molotov cocktails and stones with slings.
About 100 people marched in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr Türk said that the decision of Justice would "deepen the despair.".
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurdish) banning a party, "he told reporters.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of parties.
This does not resolve, "said Minister for Energy Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a sinking total of democratic openness launched by the government, "said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, "he added.
On Thursday, the PKK has claimed an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months.
The new "Silicon-valley"
For a long time it had the reputation of city secret, prohibited to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the 10 districts of Moscow, was under the Soviet regime, a place of secret weapons research, under strict surveillance.
Today, with its 216 000 inhabitants to 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the "Silicon Valley" of the Soviet Union.
Significant production sites and research into micro and nanoelectronics are located.
From September 2008 representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, place science francfortois – with academic institutes and companies in the Frankfurt innovations centre (FIZ).
There have been meetings reciprocal and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg signed a "Memorandum of close cooperation."
The signatories were the mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the prefect of Zelenograd Anatoly Smimov to the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz section chief project for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strong point is scientific research, will depart at Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific Exchange
It is a scientific exchange sustainable.
But as economic relations.
It will allow companies to the FIZ to enter the booming Russian market.
Conversely the Russian scientific companies seeking contracts in Germany.
institutes Zelenograd is the seat of Soviet research firms and celebrities.
There are the Institute of Electrical Engineering from Moscow, the major firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as "socialist planned city" for research into weapons.
Zelenograd (literal translation "Green City") gets its name from the forested hills in the heart of which research centres are located.
The project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
You can place high enough the magnitude of the project Stuttgart 21.
To its supporters it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe".
If you want. S21 is far more than the land-filling of a railway station, more than a monster-sized construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of the BadenWürttemberg, in a chaos despairing yards for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 is born of the spirit of the 1980s.
The stations head line, with routes which terminated in full-throated city, had a reputation at the time to be the relics of the art of transport in the 19th century who were effect of brake shoe modern rail traffic because it was once a lot of time to get the locomotives back to the front.
Arrival, judgment short, departure – this is what we must do.
That is why stations head line should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart, too: a station of passage of trains, which lies about halfway on the Transeuropéenne Magistrale rail between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava where the slogan "heart of Europe".
The project S21 will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners have acknowledged that the cost to bury the station in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
Indeed, stations head of line does not really pose more entry and exit problems since there are modern trains, reversible with railcars and voiture-pilote at both ends.
However it launches now achieving Stuttgart 21 beside the realignment of the inter-city line towards Ulm.
The regional policies and communal prevailed.
The railways is the party because it is the taxpayer who made the costs of the risks of the largest infrastructure project of the federal republic and not a public company.
From the point of view planning this project is relatively well justified.
It gets an urban area that – if we are to believe the computer-generated graphics planners – will be very verdant.
For the system of rail transport the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and enlargement of the section are designed for a human trafficking that blamed - and this is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth.
At the time he did not yet exist competition from cheap flights.
The modern traffic policy should concentrate on strengthening freight traffic because transport by rail is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new route, with its leanings, unsuitable for freight trains.
The S21, and it is much more serious concerns indirectly many other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be submerged in the draft the Schwaben.
This is the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade will this money for other junctions and congestion in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transport said in all 60 major projects.
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section across the Rhine Valley 180 good kilometres.
Since 1987 this line is built at idle.
It would be really urgent support here to build on the fungus.
But the project S21 is the effect of a hoof of braking.
The itinerary of the Rhine Valley is becoming the bottleneck of international freight traffic, and this in the heart of Europe.
The Government is considering the judgment concerning the airport
At the regional parliament in Wiesbaden, the Land Government has raised the possibility of appealing to the ruling of the Administrative Court of Hesse concerning the prohibition of night flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the coalition of the CDU / FDP had entrusted experts to examine the legal point of view the ruling by the Administrative Court, which is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Tribunal of Kassel had justified in writing that the Land should adapt the regulation concerning the prohibition of night flights in the case or the construction of the trail of aterrissage northwest of Frankfurt Airport would be reached.
The approval of attérir for 17 planes between 2300 and 5 in the morning, as envisaged by the Land Government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against air pollution at night.
The coalition must have decided for January 4, if it wants to make an appeal against the judgment.
The opposition criticism this time and tries to put pressure on the government representative for celui-cirenonce to appeal to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections and which was to prohibit night flights. Otherwise, it will be condidéré as a total failure in a word.
It is darned difficult to be allowed to keep its word, said the leader of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir alluding to the éléctoral slogan of the FDP "We keep our promises."
The Minister Dieter Posch denies the accusations of Schäfer-Gümbel who claims that the Land Government tries to authorize still night flights using avocasserie and "roublardises".
It takes time to make a precise legal review.
The coalition doesn't take a decision on the basis of a "quick first impression."
It is important that the decision is legally reliable, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition concerning the statements of his part on the prohibition of night flights is completely érronée.
The U.S. banks repay aid
Large U.S. banks, very affected by the crisis, will défont their relationship vis-à-vis the state.
The Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had fully repaid to the Treasury $45 billion (more than 30 billion Euros), corresponding to aid through the Tarp rescue plan.
The US television channel CNBC reported in a story that Citigroup was also planning to repay the aid received.
The banking institutions seek to get rid of restrictions, who accompanied the acceptance of the money, such as limiting bonuses awarded to the leader and Regulation of higher charges.
The Bank of Americaa launched a capital increase through the sale of securities from investors who has reported $19 billion of fresh money.
The remainder comes from the coffers of the bank who are well satisfied with the sale of several branches of other sectors.
On Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis the Director General of the Bank of America held specifically to thank American taxpayers: the injection of capital has significantly helped overcome a difficult period.
The bank had assumed its capabilities by purchasing the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup also plans to get cash in the financial markets to be freed from the tutelage of the state.
The U.S. bank could launch as early as Thursday a capital increase of 20 billion dollars, reported the chain CNBC citing banking circles.
The spokesman for Citigroup did not wish to comment on this information.
In June the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had benefited.
Election accelerated
Finally everything is still spent more quickly than expected.
Just two weeks after the dismissal of the current taking the post of redacteur in chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German channel ZDF, the successor is appointed.
The committee wanted to vote yesterday evening to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who heads the drafting in Berlin of ZDF was the odds-on favorite.
The chain, however, did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote so as not to pre-empt the proceedings.
However, it appears that there was also the desire not to further damage to the steward of the ZDF Markus Schächter in the event that the proposal would not be accepted by the Council of Administration.
Frey, who is the candidate of Schächter, needed the votes of nine members of the Commission on 14.
The outcome of the vote was not yet known at the end of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Council of Administration to extend for five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender but it had been rejected.
Only seven members of the Council had declared their support for the reappointment of Brender and 7 others had voted against. The impeachment by a vote of Brender represented a failure although predictable for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which has a majority in the Council of Administration had already hinted several weeks before the vote, not wanting to renew Brender at his post.
This is Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse who had organized a league against the editor.
He had denied that the contract of the esteemed redacteur in chief be extended, citing the fact that the rate of listening to the news broadcasts of the ZDF had fallen under Brender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, denouncing the growing political influence exerted on ZDF.
At the end there was even 35 experts in public law who were immiscés in the debate and who felt that the way to act Koch was unconstitutional.
But it will have been in vain.
Peter Frey: who is it?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 at Bingen.
He has studied the science-policy, pedagogy etles Romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the Radio body Südwestfunk (Rhineland-Palatinate) and the German newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau (national).
In 1983 he became editor in the ZDF firstly to the news magazine "heute-journal" (newspaper today).
Then his journey continues: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy editor-in-chief of the time; then Washington correspondent in 1991 / 1992, then until 1998 he was head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (fortnightly news programme presented the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the service of foreign policy of the ZDF, then head of the write-up in Berlin.
After the disgrace of Brender, whereas it had just been elected journalist of the year by the journal Medium Magazin, the Greens have announced that they would a constitutional complaint
The opponent of Koch to the Council of Administration, the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the states should transform the Treaty of the ZDF Intergovernmental proposals so that the staff of the steward could not be blocked by a political majority biased.
However, Beck has no plans to seek the withdrawal of political figures who are members of oversight committees of the ZDF.
Peter Frey, the likely successor to Brender had deftly manoeuvré with the Council of Administration criticizing the Committee vehemently in his decision to dismiss Brender.
Through this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose for the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, as well as the Council of Administration could elect without being soupconne to put in the position a political supporter.
In the representations arithmetic of parties, Frey is classified left-wing liberal.
Grand Clean-Up in university education
Success for part-time students: after a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliatory: during a meeting between the Ministers and delegates to the conference of rectors, an agreement has been developed stipulating that the working conditions of students Bachelor or Master should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to overcome their studies.
They are particularly put accordpour to lighten the weight of reviews: a single examination is expected to close the module of study chosen.
In addition, the workload should be reconsidée to ensure "proportions realistic and acceptable."
Political authorities and institutions of higher education want to facilitate the recognition of exams between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also agreed to hold joint structural requirements more flexible for the channels of Bachelor and Master.
At the regional level, there should be no regulation differs from one state to another.
Less reviews
Since the beginning of student protests in June, the Minister of Education of the Länder and the presidents of universities have constantly in the mouth the phrase in vogue: "étudiabilité".
But for the first time this expression seems to take a concrete meaning.
The accreditation council has decided to slash the number of certain tests: "Each module should normally be concluded by a single examination," it said in a document of 33-odd pages on future requirements for admission to graduate students.
Reinhold Grimm, President of the accreditation council said that by reducing significantly the burden of exams we should be able to stop the slippage, which interfered considerably with the étudiabilité.
The "étudiabilité" should also be considered in the future, the decisive criterion of the organization of studies.
The modules like the bottom must be examined carefully to see if you can't avoid this sensation of choking you feel sometimes in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in RAID on Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and the flexibility to allow and encourage the personal initiative".
The new regulation will affect access to new graduate students but will also be adapted to the existing cycles.
These cycles must be "réaccrédités" every five years, which means, however, that it was not until 2015 that all cycles have been reviewed.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory who depend on the accreditation council created by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had exerted some pressure on the Länder for they weigh on agencies so that the programmes are not too loaded and the regime of exams not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and graduate schools specializing have already heard with their regional departments to take the appropriate measures.
The Rhineland-Palatinate is so far the only Land have agreed to grant more resources to the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize programs tutorielset strengthen the educational guidance offices as well as the offices of examinations and the International Relations Department
The Länder and universities provide why a budget of 10 million euros.
In early 2010, the government wants to submit to Parliament an amendment to the law on higher education institutions.
Following this it will take more pass a single examination to complete his studies.
The organization of studies will be more flexible, more must be able to guarantee the recognition of transcripts of other institutions of higher education and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "étudiabilité" of all graduate students would be reviewed.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition have again discussed the issue of conditions of studies in the country.
The décisionsont been welcomed but there have been some criticisms.
The Federal President of the Socialist student union has indicated that he would like the organization of educational policy is happening more in the future "behind closed doors" of Ministers and presidents of universities.
In the latest educational after the strike, students as individuals concerned should be able to speak a little.
Future diplomés higher education we received the support of the President of delegates to the conference of rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "the student experience is very helpful to us," she said Thursday during a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with whom the HRK is working on a common reform project.
For the union of Education and Science (GEW) decisions made in Bonn do not go far enough. He claims the right and the opportunity for each Bachelor graduate to enroll in a cycle of Master.
Andreas Keller member of the steering committee of the GEW also asked that the Länder provide students Bachelor today, tomorrow there will be enough places for studies in Master and education conditions as good as possible.
The Länder must hire more lecturers.
By contrast, the Ministers of Education have not raised the possibility of easing access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is these words "Arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work of the poet Werner Söllner, in which he thématise in snippets of phrases troubling, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who won freedom but lost at the same time its own linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat in Romania, was first professor of German and English in Bucharest and, subsequently, director of collection in a publishing house for youth before moving to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner has received various literary prizes; in 1993 he took the pulpit highly coveted poetry of Goethe University Frankfurt and since 2002 he was director of the Forum for Literature of Hesse in the house of artist of Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
It has been much talk about him in literary circles not last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "The German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your files Securitate."
Obviously de-stabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his fellow writers such as Richard Wagner germano-roumains, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had worked as an informer for the Securitate political police.
Söllner received in 1989 the Prix de la langue German jointly with some of the participants.
The enrolment trials began insidiously in 1971.
I am, "Söllner" so someone who has not sufficiently resisted auxessais intimidation of the Securitate. "
Poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (MI Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honoration of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and his best literary troubles with the mechanisms of power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, in a case that clearly demonstrates the abyss and the bassesse of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as you can say according to current knowledge, not only guilty but also a victim.
In his own record Securitate, MI Walter played a role, ensures the specialist literature Michael Markel after the confession of Söllner and it refers to the positive influence of MI Walter, who had interceded on his behalf.
"He had been drawn from all difficult situations at the time," according to Markel.
moralde Markel has felt the need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before the public was unexpected, however the confession of a former dissident its collaboration with the Romanian secret service is not so surprising.
Germany is a reserve pleasant for spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper Die Zeit, "after reading the 914 pages of his own record.
Presumably, the victims have made speculation and have sometimes guessed what real names were hiding last names borrowing Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Instead of Germany where meanwhile the inspection of files of the Stasi is a highly-reliable process, the attitude vis-à-vis the legacy of the files of the Securitate still is very confused.
A systematic clarification was constantly frustrated and slowed in past years.
It was not until 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work toward assimilation of the archives of the Securitate (CNSAS) but the restitution of files has instead dragged since.
It has existed since 2005 a law that defines the management of'archives.
Whether the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very large, was confirmed by an interview with a former official of the Securitate of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel prize to Herta Müller, expressed so very dismissive towards the winner.
She had a psychosis, and ultimately it was questioned only once.
The infamy of power thought he could speak here, without any gene, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Of course, many questions inevitable are associated with the case Söllner as happens so often in a context of guilt hidden.
Why now? Who has been despoiled? The weighted reaction listeners, the admission of Söllner, offered hope that the rest of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge that by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday received the Nobel Prize, is more than a footnote.
Tumultes in the Champions League
It had the impression that a representative arrived here, fired four straight pin from a Christmas party nice, on which the maker of sportswear had spread its goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross monta at midnight less one-quarter in a Mercedes class C, he had just call, an orange plastic bag supplier in hand.
The man, whose skull ibis drew attention, allowed himself driving in the city that was still foreign.
Otherwise our 50-year-old could make itself the wheel – it had not been drinking alcohol and he was not drunk with happiness.
He had spent a pleasant evening but tomorrow it should resume work.
Because it is now that it would begin.
The words of the Swiss that we had to hire three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth finals," that is to say in the Champions League through our 3: 1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania "but we must not allow ourselves to be blinded by success. This will be a brutal battle not to fall."
The "big job" lies ahead Sunday.
Here, it is to repeat in Mainz the results of the Champions League on a daily basis.
And it will overcome the weaknesses that resurfaced after the three goals expeditious of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Drawing of lots
The eighth finals of the Champions League (first leg 16. / 17. + 23. / 24 February / return match. 9 / 10. + 16. / 17. March) will be drawn in Nyon on December 18..
The joy of the inauguration of the successor of fulminant Babbel was moderate.
And the joy was not moderate only among those who had brought luck, which was forwarded to the professionals of Stuttgart destabilized, an unfailing motivation and pleasure to play.
I was seeing the players and I told them that they should concentrate on their strengths, I advised to be more courageous, explained the "plumber souls" – Gross - the recipe for success that sonnait if bienmais which was no longer the trainer with Babbel effects.
He has triggered a certain magic, confessed Jens Lehmann - supporter of Babbel - "in football when there is a new impetus it happens sometimes things that we would never have thought possible.".
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks break for injury, advanced to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" found by a proverbial "fresh wind" and working methods of the new leader: "This is someone who goes to the action and requires discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation. "
But apparently Babbel had failed.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the milestone, warned the manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart is especially in need of tenacity.
Like Gross, the players and the manager tightlipped to overstate the victory against a defence totally outdated and weakened Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having had four days later a bad awakening at Leverkusen with 0: objecta 4, Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, pointed out that they had achieved a goal of the season but there were others who were still far away.
We have not yet passed the difficult course.
What Heldt the day of his 40th birthday does not have the heart to make the festival, even after the first victory at home over the past three months, is due to the events of the weekend that an interview televised goalkeeper Jens Lehmann did bounce back just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that other are contrecarrait and not Jens, Heldt, in response to the criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the leadership of weakness of style and said she had decided to change coaches under pressure from fans pubertaires.
Lehmann had seen also as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jalousiele fact that his day of freedom after matches had been deleted.
The statements by Lehmann were "marked by a pure selfishness" enfonça Heldt and announced the consequences for the goaltender.
They could do more to become friends for life these two quadragénaires.
In any cast, they agreed to everything else, that is to say that without the prior work of the group by the coach replaced, strong and combative sports representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "for a large part in the success" rétorquèrent Heldt and Lehmann in chorus – and even the man in the acquiesça plastic bag.
World Championship heavyweights
Combat hot in Bern: Kevin Johnson caused the challenger constantly verbally and gestuellement world champion Vitaly Klitschko.
But after twelve rounds difficult Ukrainian defended his title of world champion heavyweights from the version of the WBCs federation.
A unanimity of judges he imposed pts..
Hamburg - Vitaly Klitschko retained his title of world champion heavyweights.
The federation WBCs announced that on the night of Saturday, the 38-year-old champion had won a victory pts. at the unaminité of judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120: 10).
For the third time Klitschko defends with honour his title since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously the Ukrainian had already won twice the title of world champion federations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately he failed the long-awaited KOs.
Klitschko, walked 39 times winner in 41 professional fights, had to confess by twice its defeat because of injuries.
The challenger Johnson has to accept its first defeat at the 24th fight.
In the Arène of Bern, before 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko has mostly wanted to dictate the fight, the top of its 2.02 metres, by his against the left.
Johnson, 11 inches smaller, which before the duel, announced the end of the era Klitschko, managed to avoid the blows of the empéchant champion, and Klitschko to bring into play its against right-wing dangeureuse.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, has mostly tried to move the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko words and gestures reached his shots did very rarely champion.
It is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, have exceeded with Klitschko distance of 12 rounds.
The challenger had done a lot of noise in the capital Switzerland before the fight.
The insulta Klitschko treating villain of "zombie" who "is not really capable."
During weighing on Friday, the champion was unable to refrain from provoking Johnson in him removing his sunglasses nose "to see his eyes."
comeback victory since the Fourth of Klitschko.
Klitschko has emerged again during his fourth fight since his comeback on 11 October 2008
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten at the time the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" Ring WBCs it had previously abandoned without a fight.
This year, defending his title of champion, he won the battle against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and September against Chris Arreola of USA.
"I've just taken a blow in this fight, and am in perfect form," said Klitschko to explain his quick return to the ring.
His rève is to try to gather in the family all four major titles.
His brother Wladimir is the IBF and WBO champion federations.
But it is Britain's David Haye, who détroné the general Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 metres - in November, wears the belt of the WBA.
This summer, Hague had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko scheduled to take place in September.
It would appear that his development company plans to play this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The case Kunduz
frontal attack opposition: the head of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, has accused the Defence Minister Guttenberg of lying in the case of the Case Kunduz.
The SPD and The Left parties (die Left) demanded Chancellor explanations.
Hamburg / Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on an air attack on Kunduz, the opposition has accused the Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of having délibérémentdissimulé some facts.
The Minister has intentionally "made an untruth" on the deadly strike two tankers last September, said the head of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, Saturday during the broadcast of information of the chain ARD "Tagesschau" (the newspaper pm).
Clearly, this means he lied.
The order to kill was given to the total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
It is, in essence, the content of the report available to NATO and which was read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new revelations of media, the objective of lafrappe was in reality, not to destroy the stolen trucks, but was well to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the investigation report of NATO, 142 people had been killed or injured during the American air attack was launched at the request of Colonel German Goerg Klein, military commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left prayed Saturday Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to decide as soon as possible before the federal parliament and reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Green Party Renate Künast are of the opinion that Mrs Angela Merkel must clearly say whether the targeted killings strategy is part of Afghan politics of the Government fédéralet if the chancery, the army and intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The Chancery has in no way influenced the army action in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, voices were increasingly strong to express doutesquant to the real reasons for the dismissal of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as it had been presented by the department.
According to the information in the newspaper SPIEGEL, the information they had handed over to Guttenberg concerning the attack tankers were both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the report of NATO and concealed from the Minister some embarrassing details.
In the entourage of two senior officials it suggests, however, that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein as well as a military police report.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reported that Wichert would meanwhile demanded in a letter clarifying facts.
So far, it has not received an answer
On Saturday, the department did not wish to comment on these accusations and referred to the Committee of Inquiry of the federal parliament which would be the following Wednesday so dapporter light on the facts in question.
The worlds of the dream
Some see, just awake, pictures and hear voices that nobody else sees or hears.
It is not only among the mental patients, or under the influence of drugs, that the boundaries between fantasy and reality mingle.
Until these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is going very well.
When we are lying in our chambers clouded, we can indulge without barriers to the dreams and the wildest fantasies.
However that, awake, experienced state of dream; hears and sees things that others do not perceive, has quickly earned a reputation in the Western world to be crazy or drugged, or at least to be an original.
Such images and voices did not appear that among the mental patients or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination that is at stake: it is the same neuronal activity that allows us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, but that sometimes prompts the boundaries between the dream, madness and reality blend.
A state of awakening aware, taking the form of a dream, may come in various forms, in the best case we call it visions, at worst madness.
But even if the trigger and effect differ, the mystical visions of Hildegard von Bingen, the experiences of drug of the Prophet of the New Age Carlos Castaneda, statements. chamanes, the second of hallucinations and psychosis are attributable to process very similar.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance of neurotransmettrices substances in the brain - primarily dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and the achétylcholine - breaks down and that the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
The délirantes complex thoughts and hallucinations occur very often for a schizophrenic psychosis.
The gravitational pull of the Earth has no power over the individual.
Since antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between the madness and the dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of rêve-éveillé; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 "great similarity between the madness and the dream," to Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all irregularities, sensory illusions, fantasies and imaginations who composed".
We're in autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into a comic strip character.
His body has two dimensions to the colours criardes.
The pull of the Earth no longer has power over him, he looms on the tidal the ceiling.
He feels a coup.
Behind him creatures of devil ailées, grimaçantes, his mouth bloodied, showing teeth.
They continue, give him kicking with heavy boots, the flamboyantes lay against the walls, he feels pain throughout the body.
The thundering voice, nasty howl, outgoing, walls and radio.
It can no longer bear those voices who insult and humiliate.
Henning T. uprooted two cables his stereo system, in fact a loop and attached to a hook attached to the ceiling.
It rises on a baffle and happens the loop around his neck.
He jumps.
The loop stands out.
What you will serve as a lesson, shout the voices in a chorus to extract the burst. "Go in a clinic and fais-toi treat!"
Today Henning T. has 40 years, he lived six acute psychosis, the last date of 2 years, the first of nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
The diagnosis: schizo-affective, paranoid psychosis, furthermore it is maniaco-dépressif, he takes medication for depression, mania and schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he was married for three years.
During the psychosis I experienced terrible fear and deep despair.
The illusions are a cruel reality.
A percent about population suffers at least once in his life with schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics is the most common illness after depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, people can no longer tell the difference between the world inside and the outside world, they find themselves in a state of hyper excitation, which are that they may suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices - voices that command, who comment or interact.
The optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the trivial, the brain can no longer filter the disruptive signals, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Just as the dream, psychosis opens the locks in a tide of ideas and fantasies outcome of deeper layers of conscience.
The perception of reality into psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the department of psychiatry at the University Hospital of Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is located in the centre of the situation, at a service focused on him.
At the same time he found himself in a passive role, it is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
That is why people with schizophrenia often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they don't have the opportunity to adjust the reality, the illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Making the experience once in a lifetime of a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is seen during the psychosis is fundamentally conserved."
The thoughts and hallucinations délirantes are based on reality, the alienation of the lived takes place in a real framework.
Why our brains it this kind of cabrioles, is still an enigma to researchers.
Some exceptional situations can bring everyone to lose momentarily the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determinants.
Researchers assume that those involved are tiny brain damage.
It is assumed that the neural maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, "says Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained is how the anomaly of the neural system occurs and also the fact that it does not manifest for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis, if there is a predisposition.
Similarly the hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they act on the neurotransmitter.
When our brains heating.
What is crazy, "says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck is that the suffering of their hallucinations and psychotic medications expensive to unravel while others buy drugs very expensive to obtain.
The perception pleasant or unpleasant illusions is often just a matter of perspective.
Kasten brings together for ten years reports on hallucinations and phenomena of images illusory: last year it released its results in a book entitled "The unreal world in our heads."
The hallucinations are indeed part of concurrent phenomena typical psychoses but also an impressive number of many other diseases.
Among them or borderline mental disorders like depression but also migraine headaches, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or head trauma.
It is surprising that under certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is prone to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that normally are inhibited.
They take form when the areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions are not enough, hyperactives or refrénées; when our brains heating but also when there is a lack of stimulation.
The drugs can trigger this state like a brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, the chagrins of love or other mental states exceptional.
In recent studies, one-third of participants acknowledges having made at least once in a lifetime experience of a hallucination.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. was 16 years old, she lives in a small town Pomerania and it goes to the school.
A girl everything to be normal to say.
If there were no images and voices.
During the break, it happens that a young boy, thin, with long châtain hair, wish him the floor.
When she replied his comrades watch, surprised - nobody else sees or hears this boy.
They believe that this shy young girl is a rêveuse lunatic but Sarah K does not dream, it is certain.
She is awake, hears and sees the boy as she sees and hears the girl who is seated beside her on the bench.
It can even collect his presence momentarily.
It is a pleasant sensation, she found this young sympathetic.
Am I crazy? wondered t-elle sometimes.
But she knows that this young and other visions are not real and they will disappear again.
The night appearances are generally frightening.
Often the visions are cumbersome.
When she is in class, it happens that it can monitor the course because the professor is just trying to present a new pupil in his eyes and ears when he is invisible to others and that the professor is visibly trying to explain the equations to the table.
The night appearances are generally frightening.
When, in the dark of his bedroom, it expects sleep too little and too late, she often cannot distinguish if she's awake or dream already, if the images she sees, faces grimaçants or the girl with sanguinolentes cuts on their arms and legs are in front of its eyes open or closed.
Let me quiet, shouts t-elle to these creatures.
She did not speak or her parents or friends, they would take to a mad.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. now has 20 years.
It was his tray last year and she lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago the hallucinations have ceased.
Since she came into contact via the internet with the psychologist Kasten she knows very well that she is not crazy.
The madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or has not sufficient incentives, the likelihood is great that he has hallucinations after a certain period of time.
I suppose that the brain is not quite busy, ensures that there are animation.
Sarah K., single girl, was afraid the other children when she was small and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when she learned at age 13, that the man she called Daddy, since she was old enough to think, was not his real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active in the acoustic and visual hallucinations, and for the impressions and actual noise, it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to differentiate between illusion and reality. "Every experience," according to Kasten "takes place in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are also pictures that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real. "
For Kasten, nocturnal dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those in acute psychosis.
Conversely schizophrenia, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that the ghosts are not real images.
That is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish the hallucinations as a special talent.
There is only one step from the dream and the hallucination.
In our world too focused on the conscience has unfortunately been quickly tend to take the imaginary experiences for illnesses, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor at Heidelberg and the clinic's chief doctor of psychiatry and psychotherapy Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious disease, painful but which also contains something positive, creator - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has studied the form of so-called oniroïde experience, one particular form of modifying the conscience awakened by the dream.
The experienced oniroïdes semi-rêves are very complex which are perceived as real by those who live and that it cannot differentiate the dream even when he is in a state of awakening.
The state of consciousness oniroïde occurs during trauma or in situations of extreme conditions as for patients with polyradiculopathie who fully aware, experience paralysis engine.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to total disability and a sustainable move, it replaces the real situation which undermines his life, by his own imaginary world who is divorced from reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between the dream and the hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change in the world has held, but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, a form of intense means and interpretation, in a situation intolerable in itself, a capacity for organization that we have been given to us men, not to sink into nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
The Zurichois Peter Cornelius Classen, art historian also describes her experiences oniroïdes in his book "Change of Heart" as action to safeguard the soul.
It was 49 years, when his conscious leaves for a trip of several days after the operation of a heart valve transplant followed; during this time, his body was sentenced to remain immobile in resuscitation.
Claussen plunges into a world he created from scratch, visit places foreigners, trip back in time. He is bedridden old man in a sanatorium rail, a robot at his bedside care about his health.
He lives in the Middle Ages among nobles who manufacture drugs based on blood.
He was abducted by a Greek on motorcycles who takes in his country, he is riding with his hospital bed in the Alps and faces a névé Korean mafia.
It is absorbed completely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen these domestic trips are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a state quite different, he wrote in describing what he lived.
Instead of the dreams, memories from mental trips are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
We can even say that they are much more distinct and more extensive than the lived reality.
The intensity of this lived detonated the horizon of our other everyday experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, the oniroïdes, psychoses delusions, hallucinations and psychédéliques experiences show us how our internal representations of the external reality is fragile even in a state of WKC.
Any change in consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten "can result in a distortion of what we call reality."
An experiment which can also be quite rewarding.
The first snow can fall
Burda
A 27 years, children will be the result of the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen to the post of CEO of Editions Burda is an intermediate solution: over the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to resume the press group, he told the newspaper Spiegel.
The company must remain at 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long term, the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of its children
The two children will inherit at age 27 and are firmly determined to integrate society, said Hubert Burda, 69, Spiegel.
All the details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they are active in the company will arise thereafter.
It will also see if they are capable of.
We cannot impose its children to 7,500 staff without knowing whether they have the capacity to deal with it.
This would demolish the children as well as the company.
Burda had indicated last Thursday that it was withdrawing from the Président-Directeur-Général position as early as January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, is a member of the Council of Administration since 1999.
It was primarily responsible for the technology sector.
Subsequently he served in the sector Treasury that is to say that he was responsible for the company's capital and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took the helm of the marketing, the foreign sector, printing and Finance.
As for the first time this is not a family member who is the head of Burda editions.
Children of Burda have respectively 19 and 17 years, his son Felix who allegedly today 42 years, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to make the connection of 10 or 15 years "
Burda said that the company must remain at 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always occurred in families that have left lead by a bulimia capital, who have made huge speculation unfortunate thinking they could rise still higher.
It was never my strategy.
I've never had a rêvede, universal power Burda said.
I don't really see myself in the role of the country as preceptor could be Springer and I do not intend to be part of these leagues such as Time, these companies have taken too much weight.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that allows only to watch his e-mail, without providing the possibility only see certain types of attachments or surf the Internet.
It took her five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine the appointed as one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see in the streets, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike the Smartphones, Peek offers a monthly subscription prices and a very low, less than half what it costs, for example, the subscription data of the iPhone.
Given its success, the company launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free service data for life, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event, The Web is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is equally limited that his grand-frère American, but includes a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription fee, about 12 euros, includes the roaming across Europe.
Those travelling with a Smartphone already know what represents the fact renounce the data when it crosses a border or seek desperately a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a connection of Fon) to consult his mail.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly seductive and it is a long time that it should work.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and options trip, but as far as I am concerned, I need to have made a thesis in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small print.
The repeated reminders to the order of the European Commission to propose affordable roaming tariffs throughout Europe have had an effect barely discernible.
Outside his country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and it was not wrong.
What a small aircraft like the FonPeek (it is still curious that it calls Fon when he doesn't have the Wifi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators are beginning to think differently and are studying different proposals allowing them to make their data network.
Kindle is another good example, he understands the downloading of books and other research on the Internet.
Without subscription and without boat.
It is a device connected and you pay during its purchase and not every month.
And that is what I hope one day to the FonPeek: a purchase option with access to life as Peek proposes already in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I watch my mail on my phone, thank you.
I would simply because I think it is a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The favorite color of Michelle
Yellow is, without doubt, the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
If she went to the inauguration of Barack Obama to the presidency of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, she has chosen the same to accompany him in the second time, without doubt, the most important of his life: the surrender to Oslo for the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a model very similar in both occasions: in addition to ressemblante, a yellow colour firing towards the green with bright reflections, both times, the SafeguardTM consisted of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and coat, in the same fabrics, and was festooned with a large embroidery or a necklace.
If although a first glance, it appears that the first lady of the United States follow the wake of Princess of Asturias and chose to submit the same required.
But the fabric in which are cut both sets makes them very different.
If for the inauguration it was a lace thick, however, she wore in Oslo a printed velvet.
The accessories are also different: green shoes to Achilles means for the first time, and a similar model, but golden, this time.
The hairdressing too has changed: hair are now identified when she was dropped last time.
75% of mothers who work have had professional problems because of their maternity
Discrimination in the workplace has increased in recent years, especially for women younger generations who want to be mothers.
That is what reveals the study "Fertility and career women in Spain," conducted by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, conducted on 9 737 women aged 15 to 75 years, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers saw their careers limited due to motherhood.
The study indicates that there are many differences concerning the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, whether or not women work and the type of job.
Those who do not work outside the home, working part-time or have a job shortly stable, begin earlier as a couple, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
In contrast, women with a stable job, mainly in the public sector, pushing the entry into life as a couple and the first pregnancy, and having fewer children.
Women aged between 35 and 49 with a fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after being installed as a couple. This figure rises to 4.9-million-hectare among those who work in the public sector. "These figures show that women with a stable job needed more time in their lives for the win, which has led to repel the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised influence largely motherhood, but less the start date of common life, "said the researcher of the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that widens the gap in the age of marriage for women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training is high, the more they marry and have their first child later.
The difference is also among the women of the same generation.
For example, in the group aged between 35 and 49 years, those who have studied elementary and superior have respectively been mothers for the first time to 25.1 and 32.1 years on average.
"Another disctinction also appears between women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have conducted studies elementary marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who studied average level or higher reversed this program and give priority to obtaining a stable work as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child, "said Ms. Delgado.
Diane Kruger also well worth
L'Oreal Paris comes to add a new name to his list jalousée ambassadors: Diane Kruger.

The poker d'as of Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer (Alfaguara ases of illustrations for Fernando Vicente), 33-odd "X-rays" of writers who have crossed his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
It does not according to the Equality predictable and apprehended (summary Sketch, life and work), but by seeking something similar to the core of ignition of the character created.
The trip is exciting and Vincent spares neither the scares nor illuminations.
Délicieux pleasure, this book is also an invitation moving to the readings and relectures.
I leave you here a few snapshots.
Of Albert Camus: "In its pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same that I was going through without the name: the pleasure against the ill-fated destiny, morality without guilt and innocence no god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihiliste Christian-based, allegorical, he wrote what he had in the blood, not in the head, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, as the blade of the knife which threatened to kill him."
Of Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by the wife of a passion which lasted 13 years, in the flesh which he conjugua the emotion of adultery to the pleasure of remorse spiritual, a privilege that was to reach the sky on the path to perdition."
On James Joyce: "The Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of eight thousand metres summits of world literature, he must climb by the north face, on which the best climbers lâchent still taken."
On William Faulkner: "It was a strange type.
In itself, he said sometimes he was the heir of a landowner in the county and other times he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of magnitude. "
On Louis-Ferdinand Celine: "This writer collected the cry denies pushed from a bridge by the character of Munch to wear echoed until the bottom of the night of the 20th century, in his literary form, and he did in the leak itself and citing the postériorité with a speech violate the maggots."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day it began to knees and pria:" Dear God, I'll beg to do that I continued to write as a woman. "
Of Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were engraved worms of Spenser:" Sleep after the effort, / after the storm the port, / the rest after the war, / after life, tired death delights. "
On Virginia Wolf: "In his baggage she was carrying also its depressions.
Her husband accepted very normally she tell him that Edward VII épiait between the azalées or that the birds singing in Greek.
It has never seen a man as patient and lover of a névrosée whose literary talent exceeded the madness. "
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos if it is to try to conceal Joyce among Baroja?
What tried Benet if it is to shoot Baroja by Faulkner?
What did This if it is to suck up the glory of this man so that he could serve as a pedestal? "
A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years, strolling in our neighborhood of the town of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent beside her and our dog, a sang-mélé, saved the S.A.P. and does not weighing more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they assenèrent him two strokes behind -foot who laissèrent the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is great because we don't see what there was fun to attacking free a defenceless small animal which, moreover, was on-leash.
Added to the indignation of a woman who was walking quietly and injuria, when these individuals came to fear for his physical integrity, since a énergumène which attack an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an elderly man or, ultimately, anyone smaller than him.
The episode took place at around 5 p.m., a Tuesday as another in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog was gémi throughout the day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint to the police station in the neighborhood although we doubt that this serves to much, and not to touch the sensibilities, we just want to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
The indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We don't understand what's going on among young people so that they find amusing to mistreat free a defenceless animal that gives us the affection, friendship and we held company.
We don't know where rose good education and respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for helmets
The tire maker Michelin, in collaboration with the Spaniard for the Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to encourage the helmet, mainly among motorcyclists younger, as reported today the two structures.
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of helmets, since it is the only element of protection to avoid injuries to the head, or even death, in the event of an accident two wheels.
Michelin said that this campaign was in line with his commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond the design and manufacture of products always safer" and said she contributed to this objective by other actions to educational and informative.
This new campaign to encourage the helmet two wheels, under the motto "To be or not to be," will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 garages motorcycles, in order to ensure the widest possible dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main goals is to develop products always safer.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is progressing
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles are starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 10 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the employers' union manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, the number of dealers.
It should, however, temper the good news, since the reference to the comparison, the month of November 2008, has been particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
Consequently, despite the rebound last month, registrations accumulated during the 11 months are 40 percent below those of the previous year.
Since January, if we add all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from passenger cars, light trucks, vans, pick-up trucks and LDGTs chassis) 95 853 have been sold.
Large clouds affecting most of their applications are not so much dissipated. Indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized companies, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external funding.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions entailed by limiting bank loans, it should add other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic climate.
Faced with this situation, and unlike cars, subsidies for the purchase of the 2000E have little used.
In addition to individuals, the self-employed and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicle weighing less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of emissions of Co2 which does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, may also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, in Ganvam, it recalled again the need for the administration to pay close attention to these vehicles and also to the commercial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealers' association predicts a year 2010 similar to that which ends, for which she calculates a drop in sales (for passenger cars and SUV) 19%.
Support for the emergency braking is now mandatory
As has been held with the ABS anti-lock system and as will happen with the ESP stability control systems to help emergency braking will be a compulsory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles newly registered, while for the rest of vehicles a waiting period has been set up at the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if, by its mode of action, it can also help prevent many rear shocks.
The attending emergency braking is increasing the pressure on the brakes in emergencies detected by the system through the kick given by the driver.
But it does not always maintained the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for cars Bosch, a third of drivers involved in an accident had not been able to rely on the brakes before the collision, and half of them had not benefited all his strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of aid, revancha, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to a study of the EU, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it calculates that an accident on four with injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to act slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it means increasing pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device is the best-endeavour on the brakes in order to minimize the damage.
General Motors is pushing until January the plan for Opel
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Saragossa) have been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably 8 – after Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude the rescue plan of Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, meant that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may mean that the final document, which will be submitted to workers and the governments of the countries where factories, be postponed until early 2010.
By contrast, GM, it ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened the pressure on the US manufacturer so that it takes a decision soon.
GM admits being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of the Dutch manufacturer of sports cars Skyper, supported by the Russian group Converg, grows.
Where there would agree with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab in the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of a Porsche Boxster Spyder
In designing their last and precious jewel, engineers from Porsche had left the Boxster S and have managed to amincir anything that less than 80 kilograms, which leaves the balance to only 1 275 kilograms.
This has led to happen, first, the automatic roof has been replaced by a bâché roof to reduce manual, 21 kilos, to employ doors in aluminum like the GT3, another 15 pounds less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the gasoline tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilograms of earned, climbing bacquets to sport-governing, still 12 kilograms, and with tires (LDGTs), 19 inches, five kilograms.
Finally, they have renounced the CDR-30 audio system, thus gaining six other kilograms and have replaced the poignéesdes doors by handfuls fabrics, saving the kilo remaining.
Although the model also exists with the box KDP with dual clutch, the test was conducted on a model with manual gearbox six speeds, primarily on secondary roads network of California, in the mountains, with curves particularly tortuous.
His behaviour cannot be qualified as beyond reproach.
The decrease weight does not preclude the car to drive on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: it was a long time that we had not tested a model as small and light, at the same time, guarantees all security in bends, including at high speed.
It is a small athlete, able to heat its musclesà small speed for as long as necessary, until we ask him to sprinter, curb, recover and grow again its engine...
It is out what we wanted. Through his leadership, communicative also said that, the car will do what will indicate our hands on the wheel.
And it will do so with a surgical precision.
His engine at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be strengthened with Option "sport" or through a system that alters the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The ability of acceleration is brutal, whatever the judgment or during recoveries.
The suspensions are firm but not harsh or uncomfortable.
The coating roads we have travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged but the car was well managed the potholes.
The electronic assistants were barely act of presence throughout the journey, while on some curves we found frost in the morning and gravel, later in the morning.
Ultimately, a ultralégère car, more fun to drive and that is much more than a simple amendment of the Boxster S.
The car will be put for sale in February 2010, at a price of 70 831 euros.
"Bag Girl"
As a friend intimate Karl Lagerfeld, an icon of the Cocoon line Coco starlette and occasional marches of the house, the singer posted his face bad girl with as much capacity that its Chanel bags.
More than a "Bad Girl" or an "It Girl" is a "Bag Girl."
The Baskonia is a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral won a resounding triumph in 91-82 during his visit on the ground difficult of Maccabi Electra, despite numerous absences that was the team of Dusko Ivanovic. She is well ahead of his group, after the extravaganza of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight baskets at three points was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
The team of Vitoria has managed to fill absences important Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large dose of commitment and collective work, even if she had to wait until the end to win.
Moreover, the great skill since the perimeter, with 16 baskets at three points scored, determined largely the final victory.
The match began quickly to the blue and red, who took the advantage at the start.
The fact that the first four baskets of the team of Vitoria are marked since the perimeter, presaged they had jumped on the ground in Israel with the wrists hot.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was on the same tone, but the team of Alava chose the game within Barac and the work of Eliyahu, who was received by cheers and applause to return to his former home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to get out as the best player of his team, with 13 points scored, although the "minus six" Splitter assessment was already suggest that this night would not be the best of the Brazilian.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far away, and the team of Avala wanted to remind those of Vitoria that it does not win so easily on their land, and thanks to "the hand of Elias," they succeeded in entering the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to ensure that the yellow take the advantage on the Path (50-49).
Other difficulties
Players of Ivanovic, wounded but far from being dead, needed to pick up some shares entitled to take the air, and it is at this point that arises submachine gun Mirza Teletovic who, with three baskets to three consecutive points and using English and Ribas remit the meter to score a reassuring (54-67), and that the premises managed to increase at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The team of Avala walked to play everything to everything during the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) avisèrent that they were tired person they take what they had earned during the first 30 minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, does not résignèrent and tried to support it in line with the three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for mistakes, players from Ivanovic does not précipitèrent, defended well, and although the Israelis have converged at the last minute (80-85), the party was a foregone conclusion and victory fell outside Tel Aviv for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented the Unicaja fight
The Unicaja lost loudly in Greece to face Olympiacos and has ceded the top of Group B of the Euroligue, in a match marked by the absences of players in the Unicaja, especially in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The team of Malaga was not frightened by the mood of the flag of Peace and Friendship nor by the breadth of the rival, probably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a big budget.
The game of the first quarter, helped to dream the Andalusia. An aggressive defense and three baskets on three consecutive points, two of the ringleader Omar Cook and Guillem Rubio who has ébloui the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the game, and internal Bourousis Vujcic Schortsanitis, has helped to topple the 22-20 score in the 13th minute, when an action, an early scuffle, between North American leaders Beverley and Williams led to the disqualification of two players.
The Greek team has begun to function in showing its superiority in the two camps, while the exit for injury the pivot English Joel Freeland and three personal misconduct of Carlos Jiménez weighed on the Unicaja.
The Lithuanian winger domestic players and Linas Kleizas, with their baskets at three points, creusèrent the 44-32 advantage in the 19th minute.
A rebound impossible
The third period was particularly offensive to the Olympiacos who, despite the 19 losses, displayed superior and came even to match the difference in the disputed meeting in Malaga 66-48 in the 27th minute, killing staggering the head of the group.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last outing of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, thanks to his organization, baskets within three points of Cook, and to support Lewis, left a little hope with 66-57, at the thirty-first minute.
But the victory was virtually impossible because the Olympiacos was relentless when the players were lobbying and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The Croatian center Nikola Vujcic, manages to boost the score at 81-62, at the 37th minute, and the Unicaja is submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.

Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president will abandon the diplomatic legation at the latest on January 27, 2010, the date of the official end of his mandate.
Francisco Catunda, charge d'affaires at the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, has confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he fled since 21 September, before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on 27 January, at the end of his mandate, he must seek another destination."
The chain has also quoted the former agent, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the period established: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," said Zelaya by phone.
After the elections of 29 November (during which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the embassy of Brazil until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed, since Zelaya refused the condition of exiled policy that would impose the de facto government headed by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you
After days roses since last spring, during which inflation of assets has been the dominant note on the markets, uncertainty there arises again, which is not surprising since it comes to their natural state, in an environment where officers make decisions on a future inherently uncertain.
The cure employed by central banks to stabilize the markets has been to monetize the debt by the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by providing ample liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been virtually finalized and without jeopardising their policy non-conformiste liquidity, begin to put a bit of sand in the wheels, as did the ECB, with their award to one year in the next week.
Consequently, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain an economic revival without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility scholarships and gaps business obligations are rising again, although they remain very distant paranormaux levels they have reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize the risk private and public debt is again affected.
There was again a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany were shelters chosen by investors, provocative increased differences between the countries in the euro zone and Germany.
Spain has been barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor its threatened a new downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a bit of uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of moral hazard, trying again to provoke a matter of conscience among lesresponsables of global economic policy which had hampered the destructive effects derived from limiting credit on the destruction of employment, whereas what we should do is declare a new day of Thanksgiving pardons.
However, the situation in Dubai resembles a fight between the tribal sheiks to restore its place in power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government which conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government who discovers the pot with roses.
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be totally irrational that the Ecofin saves Hungary to a breach of its external payments at the beginning of the year and allows a member country of the euro zone not to respect its commitments.
What makes sense is that the Ecofin has prompted the Greek government transparency and makes its citizens jointly responsible for the need of extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalization of risk premia transitory, after some excesses in high positions, it would be predictable.
In the case of Spain, while our differences in public debt grow to the extent of the obligations of European companies, nousn' 't have to worry.
If the European gap decreased and that our people continued to increase, it would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
The case Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our predictors oblige most services of studies to anticipate their models of recovery and to revise upwards their forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, returning to the office with a Japanese model pourl' Spanish economy, it does not bode much hope for their warning.
Again, this has all seem to be an excellent opportunity to buy assets in Spain, although for the moment "caution is the mother of safety."
Sectors connected
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where is discussed these days the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades.
After his speech, which was followed by the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Galán has outlined to reporters what he had mentioned before the subcommittee, to huit-clos.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 000 million euros by 2020 and 60 000 million more between then and 2030, where nuclear plants now in operation would remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments do not amount to 60 000 million but to 95,000.
However, Iberdola believes that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but distribution networks and interconnections international.
From 2020, the question is changing, and it will increase the power.
His gamble focuses too much on coal-fired plants in gas, with mechanisms for recovery of carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this area, it considers that 18,000 MW more are needed, along with other "energies of support."
Galán, who believes that the draft Law of sustainable economy that the government has approved is in line with what is his company, did not wish to attack the royal decree aimed at encouraging the use of coal, which contradicts the national policies to combat global warming.
According to him, there was "a gamble clear long-term" in this direction, despite the measures "one-off", as the chairman of Iberdrola has qualified.
Anyway, Galán believes that investment decisions, although they are in the long term, must begin to be taken, because they take some time before reaching maturity and a permanent gainful framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins the market handling of Aer Lingus in ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on earth, will play the role of privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services in 10 European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms were not disclosed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a memorandum of cooperation to create the Innovation Centre of intelligent infrastructure.
The alliance provides an investment of 20 million until 2012, including 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will conduct research on energy efficiency on highways and at airports.
Acciona dispute his first motorway in Australia to Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona fights for his first highway concession in Australia, market on which it is already working as business manager of energy and water.
The site at stake is a tunnel estimated at $700 million Australian dollars (about 1 047 million euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A Channel 5 kilometres long in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, such is the option to allow Acciona to settle in the country as a company of public works and highway concessionaire.
The mayor of the city wants to dispose in late 2014.
Having chosen the public-private partnership (PPP for its initials in French) to complete the project, as part of a business plan under the tutelage of Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the presentation of their bids in May, the planned investment amounted to 1 700 million Australian dollars (about 1 047 million euros) and in the last phase clashed three consortia, with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, only Spanish company in smooth, and his associates are MDBs and Ghella.
The first is one of the biggest manufacturers in Australia, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists of underground work.
Against the team of Acciona, shoe the consortium Northern Direct, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, manager of the Australian Transfield infrastructure and the group French manufacturer Bouygues.
The third and final consortium that has passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German builder Hochtief, which has in turn the participation of GBA), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian market infrastructure promises of major roadworks and privatisations but enter represents a great difficulty, whether it is through acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that followed firms Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and that remains a milestone not validated for the Spanish giants of the sector.
ACS has barely win a place on the market by its 30 percent stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.

Their participation in the Champions League reported 476,4 million to Real Madrid and Barca since its creation
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs, since its birth in 1992.
Indeed, Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona earned 467,4 million, which puts them in third and fifth position of clubs who have pocketed the most money in this competition.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League does not just fame. It is also one of the main sources of income for big clubs.
Indeed, the competition has allocated 5 362,5 million euros in the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who participated in the event since the inception of the tournament, during the 1992-93 season, according to information from UEFA.
The Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have been well served during this distribution.
The club white was the third of the continent to receive the most money for his participation, and the only one with the A.C. Milan, have won three times the trophy.
The Catalan club, current defending champion and the last winner of the old European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
In the top of the list are the Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams who, in addition, have charged more money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, although they have lost to Barca.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, as regards the money generated by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure of allocation money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the agency chaired by Michel Platini plans to win 1,090 million through the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will spend 413,1 million in payments fixed: each of the 20 clubs who participated in the classification matches (including the Atlético Madrid) received 2.1million.
Moreover, those who have managed to participate received 3.8 million just to be there, in addition to 550 00 euros for each match.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (800,000 euros) and equality (400 000 for each team). Those who arrive in eighth finals receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in quarter-final reçoivent3,3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion wins 9 million, against 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, on the basis of fixed payments, a club will win at least 7.1 million, and the maximum 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barca has pocketed $2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there was the time-varying payments, which are allocated 337,8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the largest, and has four attitrées seats.
The champion of the previous year pockets 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid depending on the number of matches played over the'édition of the year.

It is a newly created position that will directly depend on the group's president.
And it is not free of controversy, since the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged embezzlement of more than 230 million Sos to companies of Salazar.
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months Sos reveals new embezzlement cannot be ruled out.
Concerning the credit to Salazar, the former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Audience they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.

New tools for expertise cars
In these days of bad weather and accidents, the car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are brought up in a garage, where an expert to assess the damage and the cost of the repair.
Every disaster is different, and the calculation of the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complex.
Calculate to hand the cost of compensation of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
In contrast, with the assistance of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
It is for this reason that almost 100% experts use such systems.
Suppliers of services and solutions for the assessment of claims and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of information provided by manufacturers, then to treat them and offer their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex North American group, Solera, is the company leader; 80% estimates are carried out with its products.

When a new car lots on the market, these companies are at work.
It is a very difficult, because it takes catalogue each thousand pieces of the vehicle and register his price.
In addition, it establishes a graphic image "smart" of each model on which you can click on different parts of a passenger vehicle.
If it is a model sold heavily, the work can be ready in a week if the process moving very quickly.

Audatex invests each year 90 million to develop such databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are stored, and clients receive updates every two days.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer a variety of products.
The most common application for the repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing pieces of scrap or to calculate the residual or monetary value of a car.
The only company that has a guide who provides information on the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.

The greatest cost was $5.75 euros, for customers who use little, to the maximum ten times per month.
Then, each insurance company, which conducts thousands of expertise, negotiates his price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow full identification of a vehicle and equipment with which he came out of the assembly line, only through its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on the glasses of vehicles, and AudaSubastas is a server opened for business on the Internet that allows us to bid on vehicles reported wrecks.

Devis four-phased garage
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user gets a quotation in just four steps: identify the vehicle, seek the replacement, create a quotation and generate.
Ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince the older professionals, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1 034 vehicles, including 666 of Tourism, 109, 137 all-terrain motorbikes, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use a computer and an Internet connection are necessary.
Once the model to repair identified through its chassis number, a graphic image of the actual model in question is then one selects Exhibit necessary.
The user can include such variables as the price of labor, increases or reductions, then it can print the specifications to defer to the client.
AudaTaller is not a tool of estimation as AudaPlus, but a catalogue of references.
The main difference between these two systems is that those directed at garages does not include time manpower estimated.
The cost of using this tool to the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be the subject of a credit.
Currently, the company Audatex works for that these images are in three dimensions.
It is an innovation that mechanics are a very good eye, as it will, for example, to select a door and turning to see the face internally.
