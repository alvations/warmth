To the term of the exchanges, the stock market of Prague toppled in the negative 
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the stock market of Prague réctifia his/her/its losses. 
The transactions with the ?EZS actions nearly reached the usual daily exchange half. 
Tuesday, since the beginning of the exchanges, the stock market of Prague renewed with his/her/its fall of eve, when it nearly lost six percent. 
This time, the decrease is due to the fall of the actions in the Wall Street. 
The reaction of the market facing the result of the vote of the house of representatives American, that refused to adopt the plan of stabilization of the American financial sector, is thus also audible at home. 
Fall of the actions in Asia 
The Asian stock market lived Tuesday a dramatic fall, even though the indications succeeded, during the day, to erase a part of the losses. 
The indication Hang Seng of the stock market of Hongkong lost four percent during the exchanges, but later, he erased a part of the losses and reduced the decrease to close to 2,5 percent. 
The Hang indication Seng China Enterprises according to the movement of the Chinese actions of the stock market of Hongkong lost 3,8 percent, the markets being closed in Shanghaï. 
The actions of the stock market of Sydney lost more five percent, but finally one succeeds in reducing the losses to 4,3 percent. 
According to his/her/its indication, the Stock market of Taiwan lost 3,6 percent. 
" The hesitation about the action of lifesaving in USA will influence from all over the world on the financial markets, " observed Joseph Yam, the chief of the monetary office of Hongkong. 
Although Hongkong is part of China, he establishes his/its monetary politics himself, that means the central bank independently complicates. 
The interest rates have in Hongkong the same level that to the United States. 
According to the Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd, the American legislators should take the negotiations quickly and adopt the proposition of sustains the financial system. 
Otherwise, one would risk that other countries undergo the impacts of it. 
The bloodbath of the American actions 
Monday, the house of representatives American rejected the project of sustains the financial system, to which she/it should have dedicated until 700 billions of dollars (close to 12 bilions of K?). 
The legislators disowned the call thus to sustains it of the project of president George Bush. 
According to Bush, the project should solve the main reasons of the financial crisis and help to consolidate the whole economy. 
The American actions lived, Monday, a bloodbath and the main indications of actions knew the biggest fall of these last 20 years. 
The indication Dow Jones lost close to seven percent, having known a fall of such a span for the last time in 1987. 
The indication already lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposition was not adopted, it was in free fall. 
The Convention gave up: the government of USA can inject 700 billions of dollars in the banks 
The chiefs of line of the American Convention and the government of president George W. Bush agreed on a larger shape of the financial help agreement to the American financial system. 
He/it will be submitted to the vote in beginning of next week. 
The American legislators did a decisive turn in the talks on the adoption of a lifesaving plan under the shape of a financial help of an amount of 700 billions of dollars (about 12 billions of crowns), granted to the American financial system. 
Success is not for as much sure. 
Indeed, before can publish the final version of the law and to submit it to the vote, the Congressmanses must finish a certain number of details of the agreement. 
The plan of sustains the financial system will be examined Monday in the house of representatives. 
Tells Sunday to the agency Reuters Barney Frank, the president of the committee of the banking and financial regimentation of the Room. 
According to sources, Wednesday to the earliest, the plan would have to has be submit to the vote priori in the Senate. 
According to the economists, the announcement because the plan of lifesaving will be adopted should constitute a first major psychological factor to resuscitate the financial markets. 
However, being given the complexity of the mechanisms thanks to which help in the markets can be efficient, will follow a " disillusion ". 
Paulson: The plan must be efficient 
" We achieved a big progress. 
We adjusted our divergent opinions concerning the shape that the packet of measures should have for the stabilization of the market, " confided to the Bloomberg agency democrat Nancy Pelosi. 
According to her, the final vote could be done since Sunday. 
In the night of Saturday to Sunday, representatives of the legislators met the minister of the finances American Henry Paulson, in order to give to the government's bottom a final shape. 
This one should purchase, by the financial societies, the unmarketable real estate assets that entail the financial enterprises in considerable losses and threaten the stability of the system in his/her/its totality. 
" We are about to put us okay on a plan that will function and that must be, also, efficient on the market. 
It is necessary to pursue this plan of restoration of the markets again, but I think that we are of it, " says Paulson. 
A signal for the Asian exchanges 
The world financial crisis has considerable impacts on the markets of actions that fall. 
According to the democratic senator didn't run away Harry Reid, the legislators make so that the Convention succeeded to a definitive agreement since Sunday. 
They wish to calm the investors thus before the beginning of the exchanges on the Asian financial markets, that are situated in the first hourly zone, where the decision of the Convention could influence on the exchanges of Monday. 
However, for the meantime, it is impossible to specify with certainty when the two Rooms of the Convention American procèderont to the vote, nor if the negotiations don't risk to remain blocked, at the last moment, by such or such problem. 
The legislators hope that he/it will be adopted during the days to come. 
Nevertheless, the law will know even many modifications. 
The total amount destined with the help of the system must be divided in two parts. 
The first 350 billions of dollars, as president George Bush wished it, must be as early as possible available. 
But, if the Convention will have the impression that the program doesn't fill its function, it has the possibility to block the concession of the remaining amount, while following two stages: first 100 billions of supplementary dollars, then, to finish, 350 billions of dollars. 
Mr. Bush greeted the progress in the negotiations 
Although the president can put his véto to this decision, the Convention, him, has the possibility to put this one in minority. 
In spite of these modifications, the main idea of the program, that consisted in getting some finances for the bad real estate title acquisition, whose value fell, because the hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to pay for their mortgages, was maintained. 
The whole work is made. 
The house of representatives should be able to proceed Sunday to the vote of the law, and the Senate Monday, " indicated the republican senator Judd Gregg. 
The American president George Bush is himself happy with the progress in the negotiations. 
His/her/its spokesman Tony Fratto declared that Mr. Bush was happy with the progress done Saturday and appreciated " the bipartite effort in order to consolidate our financial markets and to protect our economy ". 
Golden parachute limitation 
The president of the banking committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, negotiator in chief, says that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of contributing them against the losses, the agreement of reductions, the progress of the plan on the axis of the time. 
The new law also foresees to limit lesdits golden parachutes for the directors of the societies participating in the program and it institutes a committee, that will assure the surveillance of the fund. 
This last should be managed by the ministry of the finances. 
" We worked very hard on the question and made important progress toward an agreement that will work and will be efficient for the market and for all Americans ", declared Paulson. 
The plan also plans a help for the real estate owners, who have some problems to pay. 
The government should negotiate new deposits in the case of mortgages that it is going to purchase, while decreasing the allowances of the debtors and while allowing last to keep their houses. 
Marek: A psychological help 
According to the chief economist of Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but his/her/its realization is going to be very difficult. 
" And it is due to the fact that one ignores what the mechanism and the price of the acquisition of the problem assets will be. 
This point will be determinant to decide on the sharing of the losses between the financial sector and the government, " said Marek, this week, to the iHNed.cz server. 
If the plan will now be adopted, or in beginning of next week, is not, according to Marek, not so important that it. 
" He/it is a lot more important than the congressmans get okay, since this week, that they sustain this plan and that they will dedicate it as early as possible. 
This psychological significance of the agreement, farsighted the adoption of the plan, import the at the moment, " underlined Marek. 
A struggle pushed to the extreme: readers MP3 against the mobile. 
One will counsel you, how to choose 
Whereas practically all mobile know how to read some MP3S files, no reader MP3 knows how to phone. 
He/it seems to result some clearly that he/it is worth to buy a telephone better solely. 
Nevertheless reasons exist sufficiently to obtain an independent reader. 
The choice depends entirely on the fashion of use and the requirements of the future owner. 
It would be absurd to buy for the house an upscale expensive gramophone to put the new album of Maxim Turbulenc. 
On the one hand, such musical products don't leave on disk vinyl, and, of the point of view of the quality, there is not any objective reason, so that it occurs. 
However, if there are in your shelves of disks vinyls heaped, with the art rock, the jazz or blues, you dream probably at least of such a gramophone. 
He/it is some in the same way of music during the displacements, to know the compressed music, to say it of simplified way - of music in MP3. 
There also, there are some categories according to the price and the quality. 
For one, it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a reader, like a fan of the Pink Floyds would have difficulty supporting earphones bought for twenty crowns in the market. 
There are two extremes, between which there is enough place for everybody. 
The choice is large. 
The life span of the batteries is also decisive 
Some readers of upscale music are capable of a lot more things than of a simple reading of music, but it is there about unknown functions, well evidently, of most mobile. 
No present device is only as universal the telephone. 
Next to the functions first, the telephonic calls and the consignment of SMS, it is capable to read music and the movies, to record these last, he/it possesses one variable quality camera and can, for example, as far as serving to the navigation. 
And if one takes in account the Smartphoneses and the communicators, you will have in your pocket a small computer. 
Since no refrigerator knows how to grill meat and that no television will take any photographs, we attend a miracle practically. 
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without inconveniences. 
More the number of functions that you use is big, more the interval between two reloadings will see itself reduced. 
And the reading of music is one of the most important energy guzzlers. 
Are rare the mobile that are capable to read music during ten at twelve hours, in most cases, this number is distinctly lower. 
To this consideration, the readers of music (especially the most rudimentary) are distinctly more effective. 
In the case of the mobile inexpensive, count that they won't play music that during some hours. 
So, it happens in addition, to you to call from time to time, procure yourselves, to be sure, a second to reload for work - this being valid even for the more expensive devices. 
Himself problem won't put itself for readers MP3, who are capable, following a reloading, of a continuous working of at least 9 hours, including least effective. 
Another problem occurs at the time of the registration of music in the mobile. 
Unfortunately, that a part limited of the devices arranges a connector universal USB, especially as not all cannot be connected directly to the computer, without a special software. 
One can, evidently, to record music directly on the card memory, but few readers of cards know how to take itself/themselves of it without reduction, being given the minuscule measurements of the cards memoirs used in the mobile. 
With regard to the readers, you don't have need, except exception (iPod), of no software. 
To fill, through the USB connector, the device of music coming from the computer, is sufficient. 
Most mobile and some readers are going to create themselves a library media classified according to the interpreter's name, the title of the album, of the style, or then according to the user's judgment. 
Some devices only display an index having a structure of tree, to the manner to explore it of Windows, of others are capable of the two (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, the intelligent telephones with operative system). 
The readers are easier to manipulate, the mobile have more ability 
In the choice of a concrete device, especially interest yourselves to the accumulator's life span, to the capacity of the memory, to the quality and to the type of sound exit and, of course, to the easiness of the order. 
If music is for you, essentially, a background noise and so in the day you are going to listen to some that during limited one time, for example while taking the tram, it is sufficient you any mobile reading the MP3S. 
Practically all mobile are some today capable. 
You are not even obligated of too to pay attention to the formats of music that the mobile or the reader is capable to read. 
All arrive to read the MP3S and the big majority of music that are going to arrive until you will have this format exactly. 
He/it is part of the most widespread formats and to part him, the big majority of the devices manages to read the music of WMA format also. 
The AAC (format used by the Apple business and his/her/its iPods), as for him, is less current. 
The mobile upscale permit also, for example, the in line music purchase. 
He/it is sufficient to visit, since the portable telephone, the operator's pages web (or those of another supplier) correspondents and to buy the song or the album in question. 
This only service should constitute a reason convincing to obtain a mobile musical. 
The offer of the operators is unfortunately miserable and it limits herself/itself, in most cases, quickly to radio tubes facts. 
The prices are not either of the lowest. 
Nevertheless, one generally considers that this manner to buy music (that it is or even by GSM, internet, by the cordless internet) will dominate the musical industry in the future. 
Most people always carry their mobile on oneself. 
At every time that you want to listen to something, you only have to take the mobile of your pocket, whereas you forgot your reader MP3 home. 
However, he/it is also important if you always have on yourselves of the earphones or a handsfree with connection. 
If it is not the case, you can use the built-in surrounding walls, that all mobile possess practically, but a minimum of readers MP3. 
For many, the main advantage of the mobile musical is their price. 
Least dear cost less three normally one thousand. 
For a price of three four thousand crowns, one can already have a walkman very appropriate. 
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of exit for plain earphones. 
The price of the best telephones and the equipped better, also provided an entry for plain earphones, don't pass fifteen one thousand. 
The readers, on the other hand, have the advantage to have an easy order. 
Indeed that arrives to assure the most rudimentary reader order - that don't correspond necessarily to least dear (cf. our choice). 
A minimum of functions; and the resemblance of the order with the one of a station cassette, fluently used in the past, or of a gramophone, is obvious. 
There is not risk of collision by chance under the shape of a connected mobile internet, followed of a transmission invoice of data immense. 
What device to choose 
Even the mobile least dear (by ex. The Vodafone 527) possess a slot generally for cards exchangeable memoirs (the M2 type, microSD, and so forth). 
Even while taking in account the supplementary purchase of such a card, you are not going to pass two thousand crowns. 
But make attention. 
The models of basis don't sustain in principle that of the cards with a maximal capacity of 2 GBS. 
Solely the dearest even manage it with cards memory of 8 GBS. 
If to possess you a mobile already and want again buy a reader inexpensive MP3, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver. 
According to the capacity (max. 2 GBS), you must not spend more than 1 100 crowns. 
If you are part of the more demanding listeners, rather choose the mobile specialized walkman (Sony Ericssons, some Nokias and Samsungs). 
These devices are provided of independent keys of order for MP3, and this is how the ease of the order comes closer of the one of a reader independent MP3. 
Sony Ericsson, of which the mobile of the set walkman have the same menu user that of readers sold MP3 separately, is the one that went the farthest in this domain. 
The same service, in the same category of price, but with a capacity of memory (until 16 GBS) and the accumulator's life span (normally 15 hours, until 35 hours) superior, is assured by a reader MP3 produces by one marks mentioned higher. 
A first virtual operator will win Czech Republic this year - same. 
Maybe 
The mobile market in Czech Republic is advanced relatively, our operators proposing the same services practically that their partners in Europe of the west. 
In spite of it, we lack something all the same - a virtual operator, who would force the classic operators to lower the prices. 
It can happen that he/it won't miss during a long time. 
We already evoked, time and again, on Mobil.cz makes it that the Czech operators are part of the dearest in Europe. 
The ?TÚ (The office Czech of the Telecommunications), that signalled that the price of a SMS was raised more at home that in the rest of the union, confirmed it besides. 
This is how, following the last steps of the European Commission in the domain of the regulation of the royalties of roaming, a paradoxical situation risks to occur - the SMSS sent since the stranger will be for some customers of the mobile operators less expensive Czech than to the country. 
How is this possible that the prices in Czech Republic maintain themselves so high, in comparison with Europe? 
The answer is simple, it misses a competition that would wish to enter indeed in the fight. 
It can appear paradoxical, since we possess nevertheless three networks mobile and a penetration that passes the extensively 100%. 
On the contrary, the operators mobile like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competed. 
In this, Pavel Dvo?ák, the president of the Council of the Czech office of the telecommunications (?TÚ), that declared repeatedly that of place didn't have anymore in Czech Republic for another operator, made chorus with the operators. 
He/it is probably true that a classic operator with his/her/its own network doesn't have more a lot of luck apparently (besides, now, he would only find with difficulty some frequencies). 
However, a possibility exists again - a virtual operator. 
It is exactly the virtual operator entry on the mobile market that entailed a considerable decrease of the prices, to which had to, thereafter, to react also the classic operators. 
Yet, before even the entry of the disturb - feasts as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, of the voices similar to those that one hears today at home let themselves hear in Britain. 
However, he/it appeared that he/it remained place for such operators and that they could have a real success. 
We are not besides obligated to be going to look for too far to find some examples. 
In the month of February we had informed you of the launching, in Poland, of the virtual operator Mobilking. 
In six months only, this operator succeeded in winning more than 100 thousand customers and to become the fifth operator of the country. 
Let's add that behind the Mobilking, there is the group financial Penta, that possesses the U:fon among others in Tchèquie. 
The virtual operator advantage being the possibility to concentrate on a group targets a lot more concrete. 
So that their working is efficient, they need a lot less customers indeed that a classic operator. 
They are, indeed, exempt of construction expenses, of exploitation and of maintains the network mobile, relatively elevated. 
This is how in the world, the virtual operators stand out down like operators cool - they propose the calls and the SMSS inexpensive, what is often counterbalanced by an offer of services limited. 
For example Tesco Mobile proposes, in Britain, of the SMSS at least two less expensive times than his/her/its competitors. 
However, as the shows the example of Mobilking in Poland, to bet on a group targets unaccustomed can constitute a good stroke of advertisement also. 
Indeed, this operator aims specific manner the men. 
" The true men choose Mobilking - an operator who pleases them and to which they can trust, " said David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, exploiting this virtual operator. 
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be susceptible to walk also at home. 
Miroslav ?epický, the spokesman of Vodafone, in doubt,: " The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which is based most virtual operators. 
Of as much more that he/it is saturated relatively of the point of view of the offer of the services ". 
In Czech Republic, no luck, say the operators mobile 
He/it seems nevertheless nearly sure that if there will be a virtual operator in Czech Republic, it won't be Mobilking. 
" We debate the expansion of this project to success, but in Czech Republic the negotiations are not a lot of promoters. 
The launching of Mobilking will rather take place in other countries of our zone, " says in a maintains telephonic for Mobil.cz Jana Studni?ková, spokesman of the group financial Penta. 
She/it confirmed thus indirectly that the operators in Czech Republic were not, in any case, not favorable to this idea. 
On the contrary, they try to make all their possible so that a potential competitor cannot appear. 
The group GTS Novera, that would like to clear a new step thus in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the domain of the customers enterprise, don't hide, since long enough, his/her/its intention to throw a virtual mobile operator. 
" We are anxious a lot to be able to propose to our customers not only of the stationary services of telecommunication, but also mobile. 
And will be the earliest best. 
We already led repeatedly some negotiations about this possibility with the set of the mobile operators Czech. 
With some, we succeeded in advancing in the negotiations, " said the spokesman of the group Pavel Kaidl. 
The future is therefore maybe promising. 
According to no - official information, he/it seems that we could welcome the first virtual operator maybe already from here the end of the year. 
But for the meantime, his/her/its creation is accompanied by a total silence. 
" At the moment, we don't estimate that there is place on the Czech market for a virtual operator as Tel. 
The Czech market is in comparison with others very specific. 
At present, no topic so long as a complex and serious project in this domain didn't contact us, mentioned Vlastimil Sr?e? of the department of press of Telefonika O2, in his/her/its declaration for Mobil.cz. 
Other operators also relate some to the specificity of the Czech market. 
The spokeswoman of T - Mobile Martina Kemrová affirms in a rare understanding with the declaration of O2: " We didn't record viable and bilaterally advantageous project, that could act as basis " for the meantime. 
And add her: " He/it is excluded practically that a virtual operator appears in the T - Mobile network from here the end of the year. 
To operate in a lapse of time also limited, we should have a concrete " agreement from now on. 
Vodafone rather directs his/her/its attention on the achievement of the requests to get his/her/its own license 3G. 
Miroslav ?epický says in relation to it: " We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the domain of expenses and infrastructures shared. 
It is that that, according to us, mean the more of contributions of the point of view of the customers. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this domain being a partner's discovery to put a common network in place for a fast " mobile internet. 
The responsible authorities: in phase with the operators 
The mobile operator gait is easily comprehensible, the entry of another operator would mean a rise of the competition, would have led to a decrease of the prices and therefore to a decrease of their profit. 
To what good therefore to facilitate the advent of such a competitor? 
When it is about their interests, the operators know how to get along like thieves in fair. Quibbling coming with the creation of the U:fon also testifies some. 
The biggest obvious pressure on the ?TÚ, at the time of the creation of the U:fon, was the one experienced by the T - Mobile society. 
Reveal some some information accessible to the public pulled from the pages web of the ?TÚ. 
However, today, the U:fon is suitable to serve like argument not to accept a virtual operator. 
Martina Kemrová noticed to this topic: " The competition on the mobile market was, besides, amplified lately by the entry on the market of a fourth mobile operator. 
Seen the character of the mobile market in RT, it is obvious that the entry of a supplementary player would submit it, and especially his/her/its services, to elevated " requirements. 
But being given the mobile operator attitude that here it is, the indifference of the Czech organisms of regulation appears disconcerting. 
It yet is not solely about the attitude of the ?TÚ, that, contrary to Britain and to developed other countries, doesn't have unfortunately, in Czech Republic, the power to intervene in the economic competition. 
This one belongs exclusively at the office for the protection of the economic competition (ÚOHS). 
However, this last adopted, facing this problematic, his/her/its typical position. 
" The entry of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question concerning the renting of the necessary infrastructure. 
No agreement of this type has been concluded at present, because the potential person concerned offer doesn't have presented interest priori not sufficiently for the classic operators, specified in answer in our question Kristián Chalupa of the department of the outside relations of the ÚOHS. 
A formulated thus declaration would not surprise on behalf of representatives of the operators. 
But on behalf of an office, that must represent the interests of the consumers and between other as to take care, to what no one takes advantage of his/her/its position on the market, such a declaration is more that disconcerting. 
Of as much more that Kristián Chalupa adds: " To the stranger, where the virtual operators are normally present, one can note that their entry on the market contributed to a decrease of the mobile " telephonic service prices. 
However, to make pressure in the sense of a honest working of the market and a decrease of the prices made not apparently gone of the interests of the ÚOHS. 
What is effectively shocking, it is nearly concord touching of the three operators mobile, that ensues of their reactions. 
The question, if it is indeed there about a luck, put himself as a matter of course. 
In the same way, a price of the strictly identical gas to all stations of service is surely due to the luck and to the hard fight of the competition. 
" The office didn't raise, to this topic, of signs of a behavior anticompétitif, it is not a right therefore to intervene one way or another. 
None of the operators has dominant position, no one has a corresponding responsibility increased of his/her/its behavior on the market therefore. 
The necessary tools to the opening of the mobile market to the virtual operators miss probably same to the regulator of the telecommunications, specified in his/her/its declaration Swayed. 
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market constitutes one of the numerous points of faction. 
Of course, an applicable market analysis elaborated by the ?TÚ, according to which the telecommunications constitute, of the point of view of the economic competition, only one market, exists. 
None of the Czech operators has dominant position on such a market. 
However, some experts of the right propose another vision of the things: so that the creation of a virtual operator is possible, it is necessary to get, at every time, the consent of the network operator. 
And the mobile operator has the monopoly enough logically on his/her/its network. 
This is how he/it necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of his/her/its activity. 
However, even without admitting this arguing, he/it should be at least troubling for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators proceed a similar manner visibly. 
Yet, the complaints many persons concerned (including the society GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face, in the negotiations with all operators, of the analogous constraints. 
To make fall again the responsibility on the ?TÚ is a current enough tour in the communications, to the means of which the ÚOHS washes the hands of the business. 
We already met this type of attitude in several similar cases. 
One didn't succeed unfortunately in making pass in the novélisation of the law on the telecommunications, adopted lately, a widening of the powers of the ?TÚ on the domain of the economic competition in the telecommunications, although many specialists promised an improvement of the situation. 
It, the representatives of the ÚOHS owe the knowledge very well, but their interests are located apparently other part. 
When no one watches, that can work 
It says, the working of a way of virtual pseudo operators, several in the networks mobile Czech, remain unobserved. 
It is about enterprises publishing their own list of price of the mobile telephonic services, but these last are only in part public. 
In most cases, he/it is question of businesses taking care of the multi level marketing. 
The particularized mobile telephonic services are proposed thus for example by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and well of others. 
The lists of price of these businesses generally arrive only to elected. 
The tour of magic consists in the fact that the enterprise makes before the operator represents a customer undertaken classic, that orders a great deal of SIM cards. 
As customer importing, she/it gets offers of price (and of others) special. 
What poses problem, it is that the commercial conditions of all mobile operators Czech forbid such a resale. 
" If he/it occurred that that you evoke, it could be about a transgression of the contractual conditions that we would examine and that could succeed to a stop of the collaboration with the society in question, answered our relative question in this problem Martina Kemrová. 
Nevertheless, he/it is rather little likely that an echo of such an activity didn't arrive until the persons responsible of the operators mobile. 
In the case of the three enterprises mentioned it can be notably about thousands of customers. 
Auncun operator, yet, don't be pronounced against such a procedure. 
Indeed, the activities of these businesses their bring no - negligible profits, and, at the same time, by opposition to the real virtual operators, they don't threaten them not at all with their own official marketing. 
Miroslav ?epický indicates the possible problems: " The law permits such speculations, nevertheless, the services of these enterprises are only used by a percentage of customers negligible. 
In addition, these are forced to admit that the SIM card in phones them is not recorded under their name, they are not able to therefore have some fully, to the manner of the customers plain of the operators mobile ". 
However, it is precisely it that should appear strange in the ?TÚ. 
Besides, ask himself another question in the ÚOHS. 
If the operators mobile close the eyes on such a procedure, why do block them the creation of a virtual operator? 
It is necessary to add that the ÚOHS has relatively large powers to be able to unveil such an activity, and if he won't wish to be content with the explanations of the operators, that affirm not to have no idea that it would occur, their contractual conditions forbidding it. 
When we won't be anymore the most expensive country 
As we already evoked repeatedly, the virtual operator entry on the mobile market brought a considerable decrease of the price of the services. 
However, practically in all countries where appeared of the virtual operators, the classic operators endeavored, soon more, soon less, to prevent their creation. 
The arguments used by these last were practically the same - a too small market, or even too saturated, of the problems with the quality of the services, etc. 
However, it is precisely to this level that intervened, in the developed countries, the regulating organisms, that defended not the interests of the operators mobile, but those of their customers. 
As well by formal measures that by a casual pressure, they ended up getting the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others. 
Unfortunately, the Czech regulating organisms treat this question to the manner of a hot potato of which one gets rid while transmitting it to a near target. 
Following the experiences that we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in expertise is them in these cases more that profitable. 
But don't throw the handle after the felling ax. 
If the information of slide say truly and a virtual operator will appear soon at home, the Czech mobile market will get back maybe in movement. 
If one of the operators accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS will only remain with difficulty impassive facing the dismissal (to the discrimination) of other persons concerned. 
And we will stop calling dearer than in the rest of Europe maybe. 
The new Czech hymn has four new versions. 
Choose the best 
Listen to the four realizations of the new version of the Czech national anthem. 
Sunday, on the occasion of the Day of the Czech nationality, did prime minister Mirek Topolánek present the new registrations of the Kde national anthem solemnly domov m?j (Where my homeland is?). 
The hymn has been recorded again by the orchestra of the national Theater under the direction of Ji?í B?lohlávek. 
We have four versions - with a masculine or feminine solo song, an interpretation with ch?ur and an instrumental version. 
Is the song assured by Kate?ina Kn? ?ínková and Adam Plachetka. 
Otakar Jeremiá? and Jaroslav Kr?eks are the authors of the arrangements of the hymn. 
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server. 
B?lohlávek considers the Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns. 
As he/it had already confided before to the ?eský rozhlas (the Czech public radio), he/it chose for the interpretation of the versions solo of the singers with young and representative voices, that are marked and appreciated. 
" Since the beginning, I tried to take care to that that the two singers, as well as the ch?ur, have a good diction, so that one understands words well, that they sing simultaneous way, he/it " has specified. 
The Czech national anthem will celebrate, the next year, his/her/its 175è birthday. 
The Kde song domov m?j sounds for the first time in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the Theater of the states) in Fidlova?ka (Bazaar of the cobblers), Czech original piece of Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of Franti?ek ?kroup. 
He/it became popular and people appropriated it spontaneously. 
After the creation of the Tchécoslaovaquie in 1918, the first verse became naturally integral part of the national anthem. 
He/it stayed one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic. 
How sounds the " new " hymn 
The public transportation (MHD) pragois will introduce, Wednesday, the flea in their system of billetterie 
Wednesday October 2008 1st will be registered in the history of the Pra?ský Dopravní podnik (the agency pragoise of the transportation) as the date to which will bring up in the subway, the trams and the buses the first passengers, that, instead of having a ticket made of paper, will have in their pocket an electronic coupon. 
At the moment, this last is accessible for more or less hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard intelligent card. 
The passengers can buy a coupon 30 days or 90 days (this one will be valid from January 1st, 2009) and at a time to make record it on their intelligent card in the points of information and the offices of the Dopravní podnik (the agency of the transportation), situated in the stations of Muzeum subway, M?steks, Nádra?í Hole?ovices, And?ls, Roztylies, Let?anies, Kobylisies, Rajská zahrada, Ka?erovs and Lukas. 
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy the coupons by internet on the pages web of the Dopravní podnik: www.dpp.cz. 
More than four hundred people took advantage of the service during the morning. 
Those that will begin to use the in line store can forget definitive manner the ticket windows in the stations of subway, where they had to trample until now with impatience in long tails in the goal to get tickets made of paper. 
Indeed, they will buy their coupon by internet and one will record it on their Opencard card in one the thirteen M?stskás knihovna (municipal libraries). 
" In this points contact, there are at the disposal of the passengers a ticket window with a formed staff, that will help the persons concerned with the purchase by internet and, besides, will record the coupon that they bought on their card, " said the spokesman of the project Martin Opatrný. 
Next to the libraries, it will be also possible to record the electronic coupons on the Opencard in automatic tellers installed in the hallway of several stations of subway. 
Like what do these distributors look? 
They are red, recall the machines to stamp the tickets and the passengers noticed them maybe already in the stations of Roztyly subway, Bud?jovickás, I. P. Pavlovas, Florencs and Vltavskás. 
" Today, the city has five of them, but from here the end of the year, it should have of it eighty of them, " added Opatrný. 
An automaton will control the coupon instead the driver 
The automatons that are going to function from tomorrow, are easy to use. 
To introduce the Opencard intelligent card and the coupon bought previously is sufficient is going to record itself himself on the card. 
The electronic coupons are not only valid from tomorrow in the capital, but also in the surroundings of the city. 
To know in the out-of-town trains and the lines of bus 300 to 499, that the inhabitants of the townships of the central Bohème essentially use to reach the capital. 
" In the trains integrated in Pra?ská integrovaná doprava (built-in transportation of Prague), the controllers are equipped with readers of cards, to help of which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of the coupons "; explained the control of the tickets Filip Drápals of the Ropid organization, that conceives the timetables of the public transportation pragois. 
The out-of-town buses are equipped with readers of cards built-in to the driver's case. 
At the time of the embarking it is therefore not only necessary to show the intelligent card to the driver, but it is necessary to place the Opencard right side up indicated on the side of the case also. 
This is how the driver controls the validity of the coupons recorded. 
" In the event that the passenger would have need to verify the validity of the coupons recorded, there is not anything simpler than to ask for these information the driver, " completed Drápal. 
The passengers who don't take the out-of-town buses and won't remember of the date where exhales the validity of their coupon, can join the automatic tellers, initially used to record the coupons on the card, all over again. 
It is there, on the screen of the device, that is going to show off the information concerning the validity of their document. 
The Sudetens asked for a referendum in USA 
The Germans of the Sudetens asked in 1945 what ?umava is integrated to the United States. 
It ensues of a letter put down in the collections of the Jiho?eská v?decká knihovna (The scientific Library of the Bohème of the south). 
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the body of employers of the United States of America. 
In 1945, some groups of Germans of the Sudetens applied supposedly to the president of USA with such a desire. 
It ensues between other of a preserved letter in an archives deprives, that is today set down in the collections of the Jiho?eská v?decká knihovna. 
Germans of ?eský Krumlov ask in the letter the American president not to permit that " ?umavská ?upa " (region of forests to the south of the Bohème) - annexed by Hitler according to the agreement of Munich - is returned to Czechoslovakia. 
" We understood the situation well and wanted to be indeed sure that words proclaiming that the American troops come on the German territory not in oppressors and enemies, but in liberators, is written in the letter, signed " People, to which the fate of the ?umava holds to c?ur ". 
Since the rallying in Czechoslovakia is not supposedly promising - while knowing the Czech national character - that of brutality, of attitude without considerations, incomprehension, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take in his/her/its hands the protectorate of the ?umava for now and forever. 
" We cannot believe, that you would grant this territory at a State foreign to us, that oppress and destroyed the minorities and that doesn't have in anything contributed to the victory of the Allies without taking in consideration the opinion of the quarter of million of the inhabitants, is written in the letter. 
The reason pretended for which the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire of vengeance of the " Czech " oppressors. 
If the president of USA questioned the opinion of the Germans of ?umava, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish if his/her/its inhabitants wanted to be part of USA, or to live under the body of employers of the United States. 
Although the text contained in the letter can, considering the present knowledge of the history of the postwar, to appear somewhat naive, according to certain surviving, it illustrates the waitings of the Germans of the Sudetens of the time well. 
Whereas the Czech Germans had to glimpse at least that the question of their extrusion of republic will put itself, very little among them confessed themselves such a possibility. 
Some waited that the United States and Britain were going to get for the Sudetens a certain type of autonomy. 
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia. 
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in ?eské Bud?jovice, confirms it. 
During the war, this one was, as German of ?eské Bud?jovice, committed in the marine in the countries Balt. 
When at the end of the war, he/it was captured by the English and placed in the camp of capture of the Holstein region, the score of Czech Germans came to consult it so that he/it teaches them Czech. 
" They believed than once back at home, Czech would be profitable " to them, says Chalupa. 
Who done none of the Germans capture didn't live in Czechoslovakia before the war estimated, according to him, that, following the Decree Benes?, would he/it be expelled of republic. 
You don't think - you pay! 
An emotional country will attack the drivers 
The action aiming the most expensive road security in the Czech history. 
A manner to characterize the emotional media country that to the intention to throw, Wednesday, the ministry of the transportation. 
The office of minister Ale? ?ebí?ek estimates that she is going to discourage the drivers of a dangerous behavior to the wheel. 
This country costing 150 millions will appear to the television, to the radio, to the movies, on internet, but also on tracts. 
She/it should discourage the drivers of the fast conduct and the alcohol to the wheel. 
But also to remind them to take the belt before starting. 
She/it wants to touch the conscience especially the young drivers, the bikers, the pedestrians, without forgetting the professional drivers. 
What will appear in the spotlights? 
Especially of the personal histories that are going to attack the emotions. 
Also testify the bloody " slogan " of the whole country of it: 
You don't think - you pay! 
The sentence " You don't think is registered in capitals on the license plate. 
Then, in a pool of blood, there is the sentence " You will pay ". 
What must symbolize that one can pay of life for one instant of inattention. 
The spotlights are going " to haunt " the spectators until 2010. 
The ministry was inspired by analogous countries in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where one can see some pictures commonly with drastic pictures of the victims of the accidents. 
He/it estimates that it will entail a decrease of the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on the Czech roads. 
The spotlights were prepared by the agency Euro RSCG. 
The strategy of sugar and the whip against the drivers 
" What works with the drivers, it is the system of sugar and the whip. 
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by the fact to win of the time, when they grill a red light. 
The whip, it is the threat of a fine or an accident. 
The risks must be reminded to the drivers, " said Martin Ko?án, the psychologist of the transportation of the hospital Na Homolce. 
This is how we need campaigns of information in the press and especially of the negative advertisements, estimate the psychologist. 
The panels signalling the danger to the drivers are, according to him, already less efficient. 
" When a static panel that puts in guard against a danger is installed, it probably goes quickly to merge with the environment and the drivers won't notice it anymore, " signalled Ko?án. 
Olmert would nearly return in return for the peace all occupied territories 
Ehud Olmert, the president of the Israeli temporary government, was pronounced in favor of the restitution of practically all territories occupied in 1967, including therefore Transjordan, Jerusalem Est and the heights of the Golan, in return for the peace with Palestine and Syria. 
He/it made this declaration in an interview published Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth. 
" We must succeed to an agreement with the Palestinians, what means that it will be necessary to return nearly all territories (occupied), or even all, " said Olmert to the daily. 
" We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we should yield to the Palestinians an analogous percentage (of the Israeli territory), since without it, the peace won't make itself, it " added. 
He/it admitted that the possible restitution would consist of Jerusalem Est. 
" The one that wants the security in Jerusalem, and don't want especially that the tractors and bulldozers crush him the feet, arrived like that to one my best friends, should give up parts of Jerusalem, " noticed Olmert as making allusion to the two attacks in the city, in July, at the time of which several people was killed and of the score of people wounded. 
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find " a special solution for the Mount of the Temple, the sacred and historic " places situated inside the Old city. 
" The one that will want to maintain the Israeli sovereignty on the whole city will be forced to integrate 270 000 Arabs. 
It won't work, he/it " underlined thereafter. 
Retirement of the heights of the Golan 
Olmert was also pronounced in favor of the retirement of Israel of the heights of the Golan, what constitutes, according to him, an indispensable condition in view of the conclusion of an agreement of peace with Syria. 
However, it would require also some efforts on behalf of Damascus. 
" I don't propose to conclude the peace solely with Syria on the basis of one retirement of the Golan, he/it " signalled. 
" The Syrians know very well to what they are going to renounce to get the Golan. 
They are going to give up their present relations with Iran; they are going to give up their relation with the Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they are going to renounce to sustains it constant that they grant to the terrorism of the Hamas (Shiite movement), of the Al - Kaïda (terrorist network), as well as of the one of the Djihad (holy war) in Iraq, " specified the prime minister. 
Questions that emerge after the accident: The stewards in the bus are they illegal? 
The law ignores them; to walk in one bus long distance is forbidden 
In the context of the tragic accident of the bus of the society Student Agency close to Padua, in Italy, emerges the question if the stewards and the passengers can move during the journey inside the bus. 
" If one wanted to respect the law in a strict and formal way, a steward's activity is contrary to the law on the road circulation, " said the spokesman of the ministry of the transportation Karel Hanzelkas. 
The accident in question, during which perished a stewardess aged of 22 years, has apparently been caused by the driver of a truck who crossed the path of the bus. 
The girl was at this moment unfortunately sat next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she has to her/its disposition two other seats. 
However, the bus can have an accident, or even to pull up abrupt way, also as the steward serves coffee or distribute the newspapers. 
What imports, it is if the bus is according to his/her/its technical card equipped up with places or no. 
If this equipment for places is not ratified up, the passengers must remain seated. 
The buses long distance Student Agency don't have any places up; what has been confirmed to Aktuáln? .cz by the director of the enterprise Radim Jan?ura. 
" It is a question that we dealt with the ministry and, in the beginning, he/it forbids all displacement of the passengers. 
Then they annulled it and we got that the passengers can go to the toilets during the journey provided that they have their own seat, he/it " has unveiled his/her/its position. 
The law ignores the steward 
Univocal legal interpretation of steward's role doesn't exist - no legal prescription takes care of this role. 
On the other hand, forbidden not no legal prescription either to the carrier to propose some services. 
The law on the road transportation knows the term of vehicle conductor solely; it doesn't define her/its rights and his/her/its duties, " add with more of ambigüité the Hanzelka spokesman. 
Josef Pokorný, the director of the department of the circulation of the road vehicles, esteem, on the contrary, that the law treats the problematic sufficiently. 
" All depends the fact if the bus has in its probate the permission to propose the places up. 
All resides in there, he/it " says. 
The buses are divided in urban, where there are the places up and a limited maximal speed, intercity with places up and a more elevated authorized speed and by buses long distance without place up with the most elevated authorized maximal speed and seats equipped with seat belts. 
As in the plane, said an expert, 
Jaroslav Ho?ín, expert in BESIP (security of the road circulation) in security in the transportation, doesn't see the displacement of the stewards on board like a major problem. 
" At the time of a regular circulation, there is not a danger. The situation can be compared to the one of the service in the planes. 
There either, he/it is not sure when will occur a turbulence and the airline stewardess can knock itself the head ". 
" However, in the case where the bus would have pulled up abrupt manner, the laws of the physics would be evidently valid. 
Like in an urban bus or in a tram. 
The carrier must manage the security of the stewards by internal prescriptions, it " says and esteem also that of the point of view of the law, the problematic is not adjusted. 
Jan?ura is ready to suppress these services 
Student Agency is the only carrier bus to propose the services of stewards. 
He/it hires two hundred of them. 
Even after this accident, the director doesn't consider their profession like a profession to risks. 
" Nevertheless, as soon as I have the impression that it is about a profession to risk, I will suppress it. 
The passengers can receive their coffee and their newspaper to the embarking. 
It would also decrease expenses, he/it " says. 
The worry of security is the reason that gives to the absence of stewards in his/her/its vehicles the director of the Asiana Alexeï Litvine, who assures, in comparison with HIS/HER/ITS, a very reduced number of lines. 
" We don't have any stewardesses. We oppose it since the beginning. 
Sooner or later it will end up a deadly accident, he/it " has said, there are one years, in Týden.cz. 
An immense tragedy arrived 
A young stewardess of the region of Plze?, who worked for the society since two years, did perish at the time of the accident on the line of Naples. 
A Slovenian truck probably has quité the emergency lane without using blinker and it blocked the path at the bus. 
The driver of this last to try to avoid it by means of an abrupt man?uvre, but he/it touched lightly it by his/her/its right side. 
Jan?ura refuses that the two reserved seats to the rest of the stewards have been sold. 
" In the case of the lines long distance, it is not possible to reserve these places, they are blocked ". 
The enterprise intends to carry complaint against the driver of the truck. 
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency won't wait for the judgment of the courthouse, but with regard to the financial compensation, it also counts on the guilty party. 
A modification of the law? 
Not in view 
A modification of the law, that is in the process of to be elaborated, since more of one year, by a group of thirty experts of the ministry of the transportation, could bring some precisions as for the displacements of the stewards on board of the bus. 
" However, she/it didn't succeed to an any conclusion on this point. 
To say truly, she/it is not interested too much at the buses, but rather to the system of points, to the maximal speed on the freeway and to the use of the portable to the wheel, " said the practiced Ho?ín. 
" The ministry of the transportation doesn't consider the activity of the stewards like a thing that would fundamentally put in peril the security of the passengers, " concludes the Hanzelka spokesman, while specifying that the control of the security of the buses is under the power of the police and the office for the security to work. 
The hopes of the Düsseldorfoises rest on Frankfort. 
The big words didn't miss in the letter addressed by the leading committee of the WestLB to the employees of the house. 
Of by an union of the entities of the financial institute of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Frankfort, " the central institution of the financial markets of the financial group of the Sparkasse " could constitute itself, according to the mail returned public Monday. 
The WestLB would bring a " block of doubled expertise " of a lasting productivity in such a business. 
Sum all, such a relation could be the kickoff decisive verse other concentrations in the sector of the banks of the Länders. 
Veils to what it resembles when a committee board of directors is anxious to demonstrate his/her/its capacity of action in difficult times. 
Because the WestLB, wounded, sudden always a strong pressure. 
It is not only the European Commission, but also the federal authority of Surveillance of the Financial Services that has, it only lately, clearly makes the government of the Land of Rhineland of the North - Westfalie that the time was counted in the research of a future solution understand. 
He/it is however already question since some times - also of the side of Frankfort - of a relation of an any shape between the Deka bank, that knows the customers of the Sparkasse of by their funds of investments, and the WestLB. 
Certainly the chief of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas made known at the time of the presentation of the numbers of the semester thin August that he didn't see any sense in the fusion of the house of the Mainzer Landstrasse with a bank of Land, that it is the Helaba or the WestLB. 
However the board of directors of the Deka, of which every half is supported and by the banks of the Länders and by the groupings of cases of saving, assigned the leading committee to drive some talks with the WestLB in view of activities commercial townships. 
It could be then about the debit of the financial market, or of parts of this one. 
The talks come however only to begin, one says in the financial place. 
It is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, that, with his/her/its 3000 employees, account for one most important employers on the financial place of Frankfort, enter in game lorque he/it is question of funding of the sector of the cases of saving. 
In 2003 one believed during one moment that the Deta-Bank could merge with the bank of the Land of Rhineland Palatinate and the Halbab. 
Nothing yet came out again this ternary bouquet. 
Hardly the plans had them summer returned public that the government of the Land of Hesse was against all involvement of the Hellaba in these. 
Thereafter, the two other houses either himself rejoignèrent not. 
The bank of the Land of Rhineland Palatinate has been connected instead to the bank from the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg to Stuttgart. 
But there were always news negotiations on the regrouping of the Deka-Bank with banks of Länder. 
Lastly, Günther Merl, president of the leading committee of the Hellaba, had been however against all commercial strategy of fusion with his/her/its bank. 
Independently of it, the feeling seems to spill that the regrouping of the different establishments of the public sector is especially urgent. 
Now that the election to the Parliament of the Land of Bavaria passed, an union of the BayernLB with the bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg could materialize in all first. 
For the Helaba, it is not particularly a good news. 
If the pressure that obliges to new fusions had to increase, the possible partners escape him little by little. 
In the South, she/it would be henceforth a junior partner, although she/it has until there better resisted to the crisis that the banks of Munich and Stuttgart. 
The grouping of the savings banks and transfers of Hesse - Thuringia, that possess 85 percent of the capital of the Helaba, has on the other hand drawn a bolt in the beginning of the year on all union with the WestLB. 
Would remain to the rigor the NordLB. 
Of such géo - strategic reflections doesn't reflect while one of the facets. 
Another facets puts the question to know what manner the different commercial models of each of these banks can match. 
In June, Merl declared that the decisive question, to know thanks to what commercial model the future capacity of the banks of the Länders should be assured, had not been until there resolute by the German grouping of the cases of saving and transfers. 
To term, a dépeçage of the WestLb could take place, dépeçage that here is not evidently wished. 
It is also of it of which he/it is in place question in the letter of the committee board of directors: in any case, would be aimed a `Solution globale' for the establishment. 
How all it will be put in the same basket with the union of some entities with the Deta-Bank remains to see again. 
The second weekend of the Oktoberfest is also known as the weekend of the Italian. 
For Elena, it is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time. 
But this time, Elena comes with it as girlfriend, and therefore nothing is similar, he says. 
Behind them, close to one barrel of five liters of beer of the Kaiser mark, is held a bearded well built that shows to about 200 visitors of the Oktoberfest what deep sounds his/her/its throat can produce. 
Elena first hits Luca, kiss it then. 
Of Bologna, they came until Verona. 
From there, of the road station close to the station Puorta nueva, four buses take the departure tonight to 23h45, `Destinazione Monaco, festa della birra', arrived foreseen to 6h30. 
Three buses are reserved above all for the Italian, in one some buses travel exclusively of the brésilens. 
In a corner of the parking lot, the South American sing golds and already next to their flag, they already celebrated the last night. 
And also loud, explain Marco Guarda, it is not for the Italian. 
The buses belong in Marco, that wears a long coat doubled of false fur and glasses to the large silvery settings. 
Since five years, they go at the Oktoberfest, already three outings nothing that this year. 
They go there of night, remain the day to the feast, and go back to 22h30. 
There to spend the night would imply of the useless expenses, explain Marco. 
The journey costs 75 euros, including the pot of welcome with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, the health insurance and a person responsible of the German talking group - Marco made a course of language in Frankfort. 
And already the buses roll in the night on the Autostrada `Brennero direction '. 
There is not any beer, not again. 
Quickly, all becomes quiet in the bus, the travelers sleep. 
It is better so, they will need their strengths again. 
Pauses will be made to Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while a big number of others drank with Italian registration plates make one pause once again shortly before Munich, on the freeway 8. 
When au small morning, the group of Marco finally arrives at six thirty as foreseen on the parking lot close to the Theresa place, close to 50 other drank all the Europe are already there. 
Elenas, Lucas and the other assemble, Marco holds a last speech, explain the plan of attack. 
First: to cover itself/themselves of the small yellow cap. 
Is written `Fête of the bière', in Gothic, over on the left and nearby the address internet of the agency of journey of Marco `Conoscersiviaggiando.it ". 
Secondly: `Lorsque the doors of the beer marquee open up, one court', shout Marco in the small morning. 
`Courir! ' to Run and to reserve the places at the bottom of the tent. 
`Pas, otherwise one blocks, and not all yellow caps on the same benches, it is necessary to distribute them in the room! ' 
The mug, shout Marco, cost 8.25 euros. 
And don't forget the order! 
`Montrer to the agents of security that we behave well! 
As soon as you leave your places, they left! ' 
Third: `Ce evening, does to have come back here have ten hours and half battery! ' Included? 
And that is it, it left toward the Oktoberfest. 
On the path, someone ties yellow caps to the trees to recover the path, to the panels and even to an electoral poster of a big Bavarian popular party. 
One is anxious to be ready for the return. 
It is the second weekend of the Oktoberfest, known as the `Week-end of the italiens'. 
Precise numbers don't exist; one speaks of 50 000 that get under way through the Alps and collapses in the kiosk to beer, 10 percent of the visitors would have come intentionally from Italy this weekend. 
The police of Munich is reinforced by seven policemen of the Tirol of the South, by Italian voluntary lifesavers that sustain the Bavarian red cross that achieves a statistical on the countries where the Italian occupy the first place owing the British (60 interventions) and the Austrian (about 80) with close to 200 medical interventions. 
The one that is especially appreciated of the Italian, it is the tent of the Hofbräu restaurant. 
Nights of insomnia for the shareholders of Hypo Real Estate 
The German banking system is relatively steady, insisted the federal Minister of Ministry of Finance a few weeks ago only. 
What luck that the politician used the `Relativement word ' and that he slipped that the sector German banker would not be saved by the movements of crisis. 
This one occurred indeed this weekend. 
The financier of the real estate Bavarian Hypo Real Estate (HRE), side in the DAX, gets a German bank syndicate a credit of one billion to protect itself/themselves from the turbulences of the markets. 
A person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters Monday that the credits of help are delivered until an amount of 35 billions of euros. 
The Hypo Real Estate should pay some interests henceforth on the fraction to the what she would have right thus. 
Money comes as many private banks as of public right banks. 
In background, it is the society - girl Depfa who supports the losses. 
The financier of state was himself, according to an article of newspaper, refinanced to very short term for projects long-term for which he had borrowed money - what is not more possible since because of the distrust towards the markets. 
At the first semester 2008, the reserve of liquidities of the bank had been reduced from 95 percent to 2,37 millions euros, the clean capital rate had also weakened slightly from 1,6 to 1,45 percent. 
The profits in progress and those clean coming from financial transactions was, in relation to the same period the previous year, fallen to the point zero, the profits coming from the assignment of credences and determined movable values as well as the termination of store in the operations of credit had fallen of more than 70 percent to 5 millions euros. 
And it is only thanks to the important profits pulled downstream from the repayment of the accounting costs coming from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as of the repayment of the interests according to the book of the fiscal procedures and the commercial purchases for the enterprises of Konzern that the deficit of the gains of about 16 percent proved to be to be curbed. 
After his/her/its privatization in 1990, the former financier of state had first of all speculated badly on real estate industrial credits, that had been then filialisés in the Aareal bank. 
Parce what the classic state financing was not profitable enough, the Depfa had entered then more intensely into the projects of infrastructures and in the financing of projects in common between private investors and États (Deprived Public - Partnership, PPP) and varied internationally. 
On the value of the society - girl, the Hypo Real Estate must proceed to amortizations that should have on the calculation of the gains and the losses of the group an essential material effect that remains nevertheless fuzzy enough. 
The fact is that the dividends have been amputated. 
Already for 2007, they had been truncated at two third. 
The Hypo Real Estate is, since the acquisition of the Depfa, an investor of state and highly important infrastructures. 
She/it is stronger than of other dependent institutes of the refinancing on the inter - banking market since she/it doesn't possess any deposit of customers. 
With the bankruptcy of the investment banking Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the assignment of credits between banks is again himself considerably dried, the banks having accumulated their liquidity. 
The Hypo Real Estate has need annually for a part - about 50 Billions of euros - of the set of the credits of the Depfa of a short-term means of refinancing. 
According to a communiqué of the Hypo Real Estate, the need of financing of the group is covered with the medium-term credit and the enterprise protected extensively currently from the influence of the financial international markets out of state of march. 
Other sources say that the refinancing would be assured thanks to funds until end 2009. 
The president of the committee board of directors of HRE Georg Funke explained on the other hand that the group Hypo Real Estate would not have to resort at the financial markets medium-term anymore. 
The federal Bank and the federal establishment for the Financial Service Surveillance (Bafin) leave of the principle that the capacity of the group Hypo Real on the market is assured henceforth. 
The shareholders and the creditors of the bank have only to hope for it. 
However, within sight of the dynamics and the imponderability of the crisis, no certainty exists. 
It is not besides unthinkable that it is not necessary to resort to financing in all his/her/its extent. 
But the opposite either cannot be separated. 
After the fact that the bank is, according to the last communiqués, again to the doors of the insolvency Sunday at the end of evening, this lifesaving at the very least temporary won't succeed to reassure the minds either. 
The course of the action collapsed from 75 percent to 3,30 euros. 
The courses of the liabilities, on the other hand, carry themselves particularly well. 
Whereas the debts to the first chief hardly moved, the courses of the second plan loans bend. 
The more touched are especially funds of investment of the former society - girl Württemberg Hypo and those very sensible that have a life span beyond 2009. 
The liabilities of the bank Hypo Real Estate seemed to be before an alternative speculation investment, henceforth their value must be considered like dependent of the stability of the system international banker after the clean hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the very institute that made enter the crisis in the establishment by the acquisition of the Depfa bank. 
So much that the institutes of broadcast, the governments and of the commercial banks less touched are even ready to sustain the system, one can presume a resorption of the arrérages on time. 
Or will happen to that that no one dares to hope at the moment - that the financial crisis can be surmounted in the next 15 months. 
But facing the noises renouvellés of a partial nationalization, the probability that approached the safety became today a simple founded hope. 
It should reserve above all of the insomnia nights to the creditors long-term on the decision to know if they must part with their engagements. 
The investors short-term can use that on what they pulled a feature to constitute a plotting of the losses for the next years on the next tax on the incomes of stock gain funds automatically appropriated always. 
Sylvana and the secrets of her limp in Bento 
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years, must present itself for the first day in the Highschool of Tachibana, the girls begin to guffaw to laugh: the German is so " kawaii "! 
What does that mean? 
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangases - in his/her/its new Log of exchanges, she speaks of Japan. 
" The first day of course in Japan. 
That is that that I was excited. 
Already the path to go to the school frightened me. 
I live in periphery of Tokyo in direction of Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes until the Highschool of Tachibana. 
I have to find it the path all alone, fortunately I didn't get lost. 
The beginning of the courses doesn't seem to be fixed in an as strict way that at us in Low Saxony. 
The pupils appear to one after the other from eight hours, until at nine o'clock less twenty, a tour of table begins with the professor, the " home room ". 
But before the course doesn't begin, it was my turn to present me. 
I am not at all the kind to like to speak before people, especially before a class of 40 pupils. 
As I didn't have the uniform of the school again, I put an old skirt of my welcome mother, as well as a shirt, of the blue upward socks and shoes in leather crotchets. 
In this holding I presented myself therefore, before the desk, and tried all to pronounce correctly: ' Sayonara Wo Sylvana she... ' - I am called Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in one week. 
At that moment, I was very happy to have begun to learn the language him there well two years. 
The 31 girls of the class have all makes low Mass, guffawed to laugh and makes some signs, and I constantly heard the Kawaii " word ". 
I already knew it thanks to my mangas. 
He/it belongs to the indispensable vocabulary to the survival of the Japanese ados and mean " cute, cabbage ". 
Then I slipped myself quickly to my place. 
The girl next to me made me a big ironic smile, she found that it was a honor that the correspondent must sit down next to her. 
The rest of the hour was quiet enough, but when the gong resounded, I have been attacked in the rules. 
Everybody spoke as much as possible, guffawed to laugh and put me a lot of questions - in this case, it is difficult enough to understand English Japanese. 
During the pause, they have then all took their Bento. 
My mother of welcome had also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it is indeed something else that the miserable German snacks. 
I had rice to the aromatic herbs, of the small sausages, a salad of cucumber and algaes, of the fruits and a way of meat surrounded with Tofu. 
Most of the time, I have no idea of that that I eat precisely here to Japan. 
The things have a bizarre appearance and a completely new taste. 
What is sure, it is that all is indeed good. 
Good, except maybe the crystallized salty plums, brrrr! 
The Bentoses are not only lunches in the Japanese schools. 
He/it sometimes arrives that a girl offers to a boy a Bento that she prepared herself, and that is prepared then particularly carefully - in the hope to be able to make a little better the boy's knowledge during the pause. 
I read it in my mangas. 
I am curious to know if I could observe it as here. 
" Why Japan in particular "? asked me for my friends when I told them that I wanted to go one year by the school in Tokyo. 
I answered then always: 
" Because that fascinates me, what ", 
At the end of account, to read some mangas, it is what I already prefer for years. 
And in order to understand the mangas and the culture that find itself of it better, at one moment, I also began to learn Japanese. 
For me, it was indeed clear that I had to travel there one day. 
Because I also have a weak for the traditions, the customs and the customs. 
And here, one gives them a lot of importance. 
On one hand, Japan is the country of the technologies and the most recent tendencies - of another side, he is stern, disciplined and traditional. 
And like all is if organized well, I never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city that I ever saw ". 
The rats also have some sensations 
A rat or does a cockroach flee before the danger, does that mean that he also feels the fear? 
The neurophysicien Joseph LeDoux is convinced some: a lot of animals also have some sensations. 
But how one could verify that he/it feels the same thing when he/it behaves in the same way as us? 
In the magazine in line " Edge ", some contributions are published since several years by famous scientific. 
SPIEGEL present ONLINE in a set of articles of the answers to the question " That to be you true without being able to have the proof " of it thinks? 
I believe that the animals have the sensations and other states of conscience without me or that of other has until can prove it now all as one cannot prove that the other human beings have a conscience. 
But in that case, one can at least to hope that all human brains present the same configuration. 
As soon as we turn other species circa and that we approach the questions of felt it or in general of the conscience, we penetrate with difficulty in lands practicable because the Hardware doesn't correspond. 
When a rat is in front of a danger, he makes the same thing that a lot of other animals: he/it makes the dead, flees or attack. 
The human beings behave of the same way, it is why certain scientific deduct some a lived subjective comparable. 
However, I don't believe there. 
Two aspects of the structure of the brain return the transposition of our lived subjective to the one of the difficult animals. 
One of the aspects is that the circuits almost always associated to the human conscience include the Cortex lateral préfrontal (because of his/her/its involvement in the short-term memory and in the functions of direction and execution). 
This vast region is a lot more developed at the human beings that at the other primates and seem to be entirely absent at other beings. 
All the least therefore for these aspects of our conscience that depend on the Cortex préfrontal, among which the conscience of that we are, and the capacity to foresee and to decide, it is reasonable to suppose that the human being even differentiates himself/itself of the other primates. 
Another meaningful particularity could reside in the man's linguistic nature: a big part of his/her/its existence being bound to the language, it often means that his/her/its conscience depends on some. 
In this case, one could exclude the animals. 
But even though the conscience had to not depend on the language, this one would influence it surely, so that the animal conscience, whatever is the way of which it is produced, would probably differentiate itself a lot of most our states of conscience. 
It is for it that it is as difficult to determine like what can look the conscience at other animals. 
If it, internal and subjective, doesn't let itself measure nor, because of this particular Hardware, to analyze while founding on our own experience, then his/her/its observation poses us thick problems. 
Most my developments make reference to the content of lived it conscious, but another aspect of the conscience that should be more easily scientifically accessible exists nearby. 
One could examine the processes of conscience of the animals without taking into account their content, and it is precisely what happened at the time of study on the short-term memory of the primates, especially with the example of the visualization. 
But in this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, one concentrates more on the nervous interrelationships of the conscience that on the mechanisms causals: the two can be identical or not. 
Curiously, this approach also underlines the weight of the Cortex préfrontal in the realization of the visualization. 
But that results some him then for the emotions? 
Me of it finished that an emotional system as the one of the fear is activated in a brain conscious of his/her/its own activity. 
What we designate like " fear " is therefore the mental state in which we are when the activity of the defense system localized in the brain (or his/her/its continuations, as the reactions of the body) monopolizes the random-access memory. 
Observed thus, the emotions are bound closely to the regions of the cortex that characterize the primates and especially the man. 
Of subtle degrees of felt it, associated to our voluble nature, clear themselves, because we can, with the help of the words and the grammar, to differentiate and to categorize some states to impute them to others that to us even. 
To the contrary, Antonio Damasio thinks for example that the sensations coming from primitive activities are born in the regions of the bodily sensation of the Cortex and the cerebral trunk, all as Jaak Pankseep that concentrates more however on the cerebral trunk. 
As this network didn't alter a lot during the human evolution, it would be able to participated quite of transverse sensations in all kind. 
From a merely theoretical view point, I cannot contradict it, but I believe it indemonstrable. 
Pankseep asserts because what represents like fear at the Men and at the rats is felt presumably also like such in the two cases: how could one verify yet if the rats and the Men feel the same thing when they behave in a similar way? 
Does a cockroach flee before the danger, but if he feels the fear? 
To my eyes, some similar behaviors are not sufficient to prove of lived them identical. 
Certainly, the nervous comparison helps: the rats and the Men possess similar cerebral trunks, the cockroaches don't possess a brain on the other hand even. 
But the cerebral trunk is to the origin of the sensations? 
And even though one could prove it for the man: how could one demonstrate it at the rats? 
Do I believe that the rats and other mammals, maybe same the cockroaches (who knows?) have some sensations. 
But I would not know how to demonstrate it. 
And because their sensations differentiate themselves presumably completely of ours (since the human conscience rests on special circuits and on the language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior that the emotional sensations of the rats. 
In any case, some progress dawn on the nervous plan insofar as one sizes up the same thing at the rats and at the man. 
As I don't explore the language and the conscience at the rats, nor the sensations, I don't know if they exist. 
One could judge it as the short-term, but I prefer to advance rather than to knock me constantly against a wall. 
I am indeed a pragmatic émotionel. 
Platini, president of the UEFA,: a delay of grace for Poland and Ukraine 
The prime minister attaches Iwan Wasjunik explained that the preparations would be placed soon under the direct responsibility of the President and the prime minister. 
" The government considers the decision of the UEFA in Bordeaux like a proof of confidence in Ukraine and in his/her/its capacity to organize, in collaboration with Poland, the championships of Europe ", announced Wasjunik. 
" But it is not an amnesty for our country. 
Work has just begun rightly, and there are many again to make in the two countries ". 
In the calendar of the construction or the destruction of the stages, the streets, the hotels and the airports, the two hosts run after the delays. 
The number of stages for the championship of Europe could possibly be reduced from eight to six. 
" We cannot waste anymore time. 
We must work to the maximal " speed, declared the President of the League Ukrainian Grigorij Surkis. 
" The UEFA constantly has us to the ?il ". 
An even more radical measure has been decided in Poland. 
The direction of the soccer league Polish PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and has been replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator. 
The commission had met on the demand of the Minister of the Sport Miroslaw Drzewieckis. 
A true danger that the PZPN is not capable to act in the rules " would exist ", declared Drzewiecki of the press agency Polish PAP. 
" We assured in a mail to the President of the UEFA that the preparations of the European Championship of 2012 would not stand some. 
Several members of the First Division league were, already in the previous season, condemned for obligatory relegation manipulation; at the end of account, the beginning of the League even has of the to be baffled at the last minute. 
Dennis indignant Quaid counterattacks 
She/it wanted to make the promotion for a new movie, spoke of his/her/its private life in an interview - and has problems now with sound ex: the Hollywood star Meg Ryan raised the veil on sound ex adultérin Dennis Quaid. 
He/it foams - and counterattack. 
A war of the Pink belated for the ex couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors deliver themselves to an ungainly battle - to the knowledge of everybody. 
Last week, Meg Ryan had expressed itself in an interview for the newspaper American InStyle on the reasons of the failure of the marriage: " Dennis was me during a long time unfaithful, and it was very painful ". 
She/it would only have taken knowledge of the extent of the deception after the divorce. 
The motive of this striptease of the thought resides in the relations of press of Ryan for his/her/its new movie " the Women " - the history of an adultery is told there. 
The reaction of Dennis Quaid on his/her/its unfaithful husband qualification clearly fell: it would be " Monstrous ", said this one to the " New York Daily News ", 54 years, that " Meg broods over a new time the history of our relation and manipulates " it. 
It would be besides " regrettable ", that " the pain and the distresses that a divorce includes for every child are revived again in public " for their common son of 16 years Jack ". 
Whereas Ryan lives alone since the divorce, Quaid got remarried and will become soon the father of twins. 
So was his/her/its answer to the stroke of claw: " In any case, my continuous life. 
I estimate myself happy to have a marvelous family who goes to best ". 
The prices of the tickets of plane and hotels fall 
In the first half of the year 2008, the flights and the nights of hotels were less dear than the previous year. 
In Germany, according to a present survey, the flights would be reduced even until has 50 percent. 
The flights and the nights of hotel would have become again advantageous - it is the result of a survey of the beneficiary of financial services and journeys American Express. 
The enterprise analyzed its data of bookings of the first semester of 2008 and established, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, a clean decrease of the profits in the second quarter. 
After the prices on the market of the hotels increased during years, the nights of hotels already reduced in a lot of places. 
Of January to March, the prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities examined again on average of 6,9 percent in comparison with 2007 in 41 the 48 examined European cities. 
Of April to June, the prices were however already 3,6 percent lower than the previous year. 
The tendency was especially clean in Paris and in Rome, where the travelers had to paid from 30 to 37 for hundred less than one year earlier. 
The reasons of all it would reside for American Express in the weak course of the dollar that drove decreasing to a " desire of journeys of the American " tourists. 
The financial places as Frankfort or London would be touched in the same way more by the receding of the prices of the hotels that the industrial sites like Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger. 
In the Swedish city, the prices of the hotels are held with a rise of 26,3 percent, the record in Europe. 
Also concerning price of flights, the tendency was to the rise in the first quarter: 
Because of the increase of the price of the kerosene, the passengers in economic class have to pay it on average more than 7,1 percent in 2007, the long-range flights, a lot of consumers of fuel, even increased until 29,2 percent. 
Of April to June, the prices of the tickets in economic class fell on average of 12,5 percent in comparison with the previous quarter, in class bustles and in first class however, the variations of price were extensively less pronounced. 
In Germany, the prices knew an even more important fall than in the other European countries: 
Of January to March, the prices had increased 11,9 percent, in the second quarter, they fell of 23,6 percent. 
The German interior flights have even been divided by two according to this survey. 
The reasons of this fall of the prices would be on one hand a bending economic growth, explain the business. 
The demand cèderait of the land in a lot of segment of the market of the journeys by plane. 
Of another side, a pressure accentuated of the competition would exist of by the treaty " open " Sky that liberalizes the aerial circulation between the United States and Europe. 
Sign of the tense situation is the suppression by the aerial no - profitable journey companies, as well as the number raised of aerial companies that would have put down the balance during the first semester 2008 - they were 24 companies anything that in Europe. 
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0 
With a goal and the simple methods, the SV Hamburg becomes first of the ordering. 
In the Borussia, Luhukay didn't always succeed in finding an eleven functional. 
Of Kristoffer Klein. To enlarge. Landing in disaster for international gambler Marko Marin. 
The player of Gladbach only went late in the game and his/her/its shooting survey failed against the centers the goal. 
His/her/its message was formulated precisely, it had come out of his/her/its lips in a persuasive way. 
He/it simply knew that he/it was right. 
" We need this second goal ", hissed Hermann Rieger in the passageway of the cloakrooms of the arena of Hamburg. 
He/it didn't much happen in the cloakrooms, the half-time was finished and most had sat down again to their place. 
Rieger was during close to three decades the physiotherapist of the HSV, he enjoys a big reputation as a lot of former protagonists. 
And it is why his/her/its demand has been received at the strategic places. 
The trainer attending Cornelius Jol has acquiesé and raised the inch to approve. 
Cornelius is the trainer's brother in chief of Hamburg Martin Jol. 
Whose orders seem to have been similar: and that that jumps with this second goal! 
The setting in practice missed. 
" All was not very beautiful to see today ", confessed Marcel Jansen later. 
Bastian Reinhard would have wished to be loosened " also more. 
This 1:0 (1:0 at the half-time), the team of Hamburg owes it to a striking of the head succeeded by Mladen Petric (at the 11st minute); and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not hurt the weak players of Hamburg. 
" That was a dirty victory ", summarized Marine Jol. 
The SV of Hamburg will celebrate this Monday his/her/its 121 years. 
Already Saturday afternoon, the supporters celebrated themselves themselves, the blue sky to the over of the arena and the pictures of temporary ordering on the gigantic screen that indicated their club as first of the class. 
That is going to be a birthday without real feast. 
" We know how to stand back ", said Marcell Jansen. 
He/it suspects that the intermediate result of the picture reflects the character unforeseeable of the first League more that the domination of his/her/its HSV. 
The team with his/her/its newcomers late committed - the Brazilian Snow banks and Silvas, goal keeper Petric all as debauched Jansen of the FC Bayern - forms itself certainly smoothly, but she/it doesn't yet shine. 
" We have need of more than charm and of more than dribbles ", required Jol. 
After the failure of the vote 
In Wall Street, the fear circulates. 
The new first of the failure of the lifesaving plan made fall temporarily the Dow Jones of 700 points. 
It was the more heavy loss of points in the space of one day of all the history. 
Later, the Dow Jones made up for it a little. 
Toward 20h30, most important stock indication to the world côtait 10.579 point with a decrease of good five percent. 
The index of stock market of the Nasdaqs technologies was to 1548 points with a decrease of more than seven points. 
The most losing of the Dow Jones were at this date American Express that nearly lost 14 percent and the Bank America of with a loss of about 12 percent. 
No title could return any profits anymore. 
The actions of the Bank Goldman Sachs accused a decrease of nearly ten percent. 
A few days ago only, the big investor Warren Buffet had associated to the society. 
In the setting of the lifesaving plan, the means must be mobilized for the purchase of that that one calls the spoiled hypothecary papers. 
The sum must not be however poured in once, but progressively. 
In counterpart, the État should recover some options on the actions of the financial society that will be able to be exchanged correlatively to the evolution of the course in order to reduce the load of it for the Public Treasure. 
The courses of the actions inhaled in the whirlwind in Europe and to the United States 
The billions of help for the banks in Europe and to the United States don't palliate to the concerns of the investors. 
The course of the action of the big bank German Hypo Real Estate collapses and pull the Dax toward the bottom.

The flight of the space probes influences dark matter 
For years, a mysterious phenomenon let the researchers in the puzzlement: of the dark matter the speed of the space probes influences during that that one calls the man?uvres of gravitational support. 
The experts fear that the general theory of the relativity is not completely correct. 
Since nearly 18 years, the space probe " Odysseus " vole in the space. 
Because of conductions of fuel soon frozen, the death cryogène threatens it. 
For years, a mysterious phenomenon is reason of disarray among the researchers - the anomaly of the gravitational support. 
The gravitational support is a man?uvre of the space probes, by which they get a supplementary impetus in the gravitational field of a celestial body, the Earth for example. 
Thus, the probes can save a lot of fuel. 
The probe of research américo - European Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, all as the probe solar Odysseus. 
It is what astonishes the researchers besides for years: the flying objects don't always behave to 100 percent the way of which one waits for it according to the venerable laws of gravitation. 
Well more, some irregularities appear to the level of the speed. 
The probes become unexpectedly more fast or slower. 
Until now, the physicists could not explain this effect. 
They baptized it the anomaly of the gravitational support. 
Some experts feared that the theory of the general relativity of Albert Einstein, that describes the strength of matter attraction because of the curvature of the space, cannot be entirely correct. 
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute heart Advanced Study of Princeton always believes hard as iron that Einstein was not mistaken and tried to explain the anomaly of the gravitational support with the help of what one calls the black matter that the astronomers identified in the universe. 
" The black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, matter that is also close to the Earth ", it writes. 
The researchers of the space only know the existence of the black matter since about ten years. 
He/it apparently emanates of her a strength of attraction whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies. 
Her, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that means that she/it doesn't send reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light. 
According to the calculations of the scientists, the black matter would represent a good all the same fifth of the whole mass of the universe. 
The tourists removed in Egypt are free 
After ten days to the hands of their captors, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be freed as well as the Italian foreign minister confirmed it. 
The Sudanese captors had required a ransom of several millions of euros. 
During the fusillade preceding the liberation, six takers of hostage would have been killed. 
In the south of Egypt, five Germans have been removed. 
The negotiations for the ransom would already be hired. 
The Germans are constantly in the collimator of kidnappers. 
WELT ONLINE depicts the most important cases. 
The European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free. 
It is that that communicated of concert the Egyptian state television, the TV channel Arabian Al - Arabija and the Italian medias. 
The Italian Minister of the Business Stranger Franco Frattini confirmed the liberation after the bulletins of the TV channel Italian Sky TG 24: " Our fellow citizen and the other hostages have been freed. 
We are verifying their state of health ", told Frattini. 
The five Germans, the five Italian and the Rumanian as well as their eight Egyptian accompanists carry themselves well and are in security, announced the Egyptian national television. 
The 19 participants of the excursion in the desert should be already under way toward the Cairo. 
The circumstances around a fusillade before the liberation of the hostages remain even fuzzy: thus, the kidnappers would have been near to put a term to the abduction, according to the dires of an Egyptian security agent, before the Sudanese army doesn't kill six of the kidnappers without warning. 
" The problem was solved. 
They agreed with a ransom ", declared the agent. 
He/it remained to collect the hostages " only, when sudden, " this surprise " occurred. 
The Sudanese soldiers had knocked this Sunday six of the captors in the border zone between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, down and had stopped two among them. 
Hostage's takers had required of Germany a ransom of an amount of six millions of euros; money had to be put back by the German woman of one of the hostages. 
The daily " El Masri El Jom " declared that, according to the dires of a German mediator, the liberation of the hostages was late because the kidnappers feared for their security. 
According to the article, the captors wanted to free the feminine hostages after the payment of the ransom. 
The men had to be kept until the captors found a sure road to flee. 
The German embassy in the Cairo refused to make all commentary on this narration. 
Abuse of a father-in-law " that led to the suicide " 
A courthouse has been informed that years of abuse inflicted by his/her/its father-in-law led a woman to commit suicide. 
Michael Trerise, 57ans, of Stithians, in Cornwall, has been jailed during six years after having admitted eight chiefs of accusation for ways of indecent facts. 
The courthouse of big process of Truro referred that it bound his/its daughter-in-law regularly, Stéphanie Randle, during his/her/its childhood, of 5 at 7 years. 
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession ": I feel responsible for his/her/its death ". 
The courthouse has been informed that Melle Randle, aged of 34 years, committed suicide at home in Mutley, Plymouth, April 1st, 2007. 
Child when she/it lived in Coventry, Trerise had attached it and bandaged before forcing it to sexual acts, whereas his/her/its mother worked at the pub. 
Trerise and his/her/its wife divorced in the years 80, and he/it returned to live in Cornwall. 
His/her/its daughter-in-law left to Plymouth. 
But the courthouse has been informed that Melle Randle, regular volunteer of National Trust, was haunted of the abuses that had been inflicted him two times per week. 
The attorney general, Ramsey Quaife declared in court that had told some friends that Melle Randle, that was a good surfer and bicyclist, seemed emotionally since 2006 " dead ", and " had lost all hope towards life ". 
In April 2007, his/her/its true father, Terrance Randle, found it dead in his/her/its apartment in Plymouth. 
One thinks that she/it committed suicide while choking himself with a bag in plastic. 
Mr. Randle faced his/her/its daughter's beautiful father who had otherwise, written a letter of confession that finished thus,: " I attached it and bandaged it regularly ". 
" I didn't abuse her sexually. 
" I feel responsible for his/her/its death ". 
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: " You are indeed bizarre as fetishist, your victim had to certainly be terrorized, especially at the age of 7 years. 
" This unpleasant saga ended by the victim's suicide. 
And that that even more astonishing, it is the fact that if she/it had not committed this gesture, his/her/its history would be finished certainly ever in court ". 
He/it added: " I underline in particular, as describe it his/her/its father and his/her/its mother, the effects of your crime committed during years on Stéphanie. 
" Without these, she/it would be probably today a young happy, promising woman, and of success ". 
Condemnation for loss of official data. 
The ministerial officer of the office Cabinet who had forgotten of the documents secret bip, in June on a train, will be condemned by the Official Secret Act, knew the BBC. 
The man of the Defense Ministry was in displacement when he forgot highly classified two documents, on a train in direction of Waterloo.

There is the condemnation serious of this act, without no criminal intention insinuation. 
The correspondent of the BBC, Frank Gardner declared that this episode had people of Whitehall a lot. 
" They will have thought that this business would have remained between the walls of the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet Office " has it declared. 
The salaried employee who cannot be named, is accused of violation of the section 8.1 of the act, that means the clause that is about the safeguard of the information. 
.Le Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer is placed under the tutelage of the Metropolitan Police, seen the very sensitive nature of his/her/its work bound to the Committee Associated of the Secret Services,

A Dark Street in the City, Often Forgotten, and can Be Soon on sale. 
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, of solely functional others. 
. And even some taxicabs veterans as well as some local residents know for a longtime how to give some indications to go to Extra Place, because they didn't hear to speak ever of it. 
The street is in the East Village and browses the north of First Street - to not to confound with Second Street - enters Bowery and Second Avenue. 
Of about 30 feet of large for 120 of long, she/it looks like a dusty alley rather than to an active artery. 
. No panels indicate the street. 
It is potentially impossible to find it on a standard atlas. 
This street has some admirers however. 
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the constructor of the recent buildings of luxury on First Street. 
He/it would like repaver Extra Place, and to create a more fluid passage toward the stores and the boutiques, that should open in the new buildings. 
Of other admirers including neighbors for a longtime, declared to be charmed merely by this abridgments because he/it remains one of the last and more former streets of the pâté of houses. 
But the Department of Preservation and the Real estate Development of the city that manages the street, doesn't have any interest to keep it. 
This month, at the time of a meeting of the committees of neighborhood owners, of the representatives of city agency and Bay Avalon outlined a proposition allowing the real estate constructor to buy the street. 
But the committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and asked a new proposition to submit next month, declared Susan Stetzer, the local manager of the Committee n°3. 
" He/it only remains little spaces belonging at the city, and we would wish that the city preserves Extra Place " has it declared. 
" They could propose to put back it in state and to manage it, that that besides Avalon could make, but we wish to maintain it public ". 
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted repaver the small street and there to install some seats, some would be used besides by a coffee to which the constructor will concede the space. 
The proposition of this potential acquirement was made public to the meeting of this month. 
Michele of Milly, the carries speech of Bay Avalon, declared that although the society wants to exploit the street, it doesn't mean necessarily that it wants in to be the owner. 
" the main interest of Bay Avalon is of relooker this abandoned alley, and to make it public " has it declared, underlining that it was the city to suggest it the sale ". 
Seth Donlin, a door speech of the Preservation of the real estate, confirmed that the city wished to sell the street well, underlining besides, that the mission of the agency was to develop the property rather than to manage it. 
Compared to his/her/its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place let a light historic print. 
Some believe that extra Place carries this name since 1802, when the inheritance of the big farm of the numerous children of Philip Minthorne was divided, letting of quoted this small tip of earth, that remained since abandoned. 
The posterior entry of the CBGB, a monument punk closed rock in 2006, has open re in Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photo in cover of the album of Sweep " Rocket Russia " to 
" this place was magnificent " declared Danny Fields, the manager of Sweep them, that took the photo in November 1976. 
She/it was full of junks, of rags, hogsheads, posters, of leaves and ropes ",. 
Some residents, including the bloggeurs that had already spoken of the evolution toward the luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea to sell Extra Place, saying that this humble small property should remain public. 
Others proclaimed Extra Place like a true rarity - a potentially identical fragment to the city that should be flipping in peace. 
Jeremiah Moss, that drives a blog named Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled " The Book of the Contestations: A Look Bitterly Nostalgic on A City in the Process of extinction ") relates the history of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in the Yorker new. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: " Extra Place is a small narrow dead end, sink night and day, and delimited by the doors of a warehouse made of rusty iron and shutters, full of newspapers of the past week that fly off along the gutters ". 
To few exceptions near, the street always has the same pace. 
A short rat nimbly to the bottom of the alley, close to a door that led previously to the CBGB, and that became now the seat of a store of clothes chic. 
Of the graffitis on the walls, a bottle of 22 ounces emptiness beer, rest to quoted of newspapers that have just been rightly thrown.

The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English language 
In this part of the program of Supervision of the education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi debate the position of the candidates about the bilingual education. 
Lance T. Izumi, former member of studies in California, and former director of the education department in the Pacific Research Institute heart Public Policy, is not the co-author of the book " as Good as You Thought it. Why the middle classes must be able to choose their school. 
To attract the Hispanic elector favors is a complicate business. 
The propositions of Barack Obama on the education are an interesting example of it. 
The campaign of M. Obama underlines that " the students Afro-américains and Latino have less luck of himself diplômer that the white " students. it is a truthful fact. 
To fight these differences, the program of education of M. Obama sustains in particular among so many other topics, " the bilingual " transitional education for those that learn English. 
However, the question that puts itself for Obama is to know if his/her/its desire to achieve a bilingual education that defends the instruction in class of other languages that English, go besides his/her/its interest aiming to eliminate the differences. 
Take for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school of the East of related it of Los Angeles. 
The students of this school are in big majority Hispanic, and of low incomes. 
More of a third of the students, constituted many new arrived, study English. 
Among the students of the CM1, 100% took the exam of state of maths of 2008, practiced level. 
In the same way, 93% of the students nearly took the exam of English of languages - d'arts 
This incredible success was reached thanks to another ingredient that the one advanced by M. Obama. 
Sixth Street bets on analyses, of the practice, a constant assessment of the capacities as well as an exemplary attitude. 
In addition, and there is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, return Linda Mikels, main of the Sixth Street, this school instituted the instruction of the language English " full immersion ". 
The total immersion in English language nearly focuses on use constant of English in the instruction. 
Melle Mikels, contrary to the bilingual education, affirmed " us to me had an enormous success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months after, if you went without his/her/its class, you would not have had any luck to identify " it. 
" It works, she/it observes, " it worked for us " 
Mr. Obama he/it would not owe to take example of the Sixth Street Prep and to retort it in the other schools composed in majority of Hispanic students learning English. 
The excellent results gotten by this school speak of them even; but the policies on the education inside his/her/its party (the Associations for the National education sustain the bilingual education for a long time) and his/her/its enormous support in favor of the bilingual education, darken the prognostic of the answer of M. Obama. 
Although he/it is favorable to the fact the immigrants learn English, Mr. Obama considered this question lately as petty, when he proclaimed that we owe all to stop polemizing on the wording of the laws in English language. 
" On the contrary, he/it declared, " you must insure that your child speaks Spanish ". 
So M. Obama wishes to eliminate the differences indeed, he should consider then with attention, the models of education that function, rather than to disdain them or to consider them like petty.

Last month, Gebrselassie had missed the Olympic marathon of Beijing, fearing - can be of way exaggerated to the eyes of today, - that the pollution of air doesn't increase its problems of asthma. 
On the contrary, he/it promised to run to Berlin. 
In near perfect conditions - sunny time, 48 degrees to the departure, 55 to the arrival - Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an average impressive of one one thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds 
The runners of track like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, all two Kenyan, convert in long-distance runners, contributed to the reduction of the record of the marathon of more than two minutes in these last ten years, since 1998, when the Brazilian Ronaldo Costa da won in Berlin in 2:06:05.

In a City to Part, the pride and the tests of the Black Life 
Hidden in the development of his/her/its immense park, to some miles of the sunny, the brilliant and the gigantic Orlando, be a small calm city where is born the pride and the complications of the Afro-American experience. 
" Eatonville, first entirely black city to integrate, house of childhood of Zora Neale Hurston, this description that it made in 1935, is not anymore if simple to make nowadays ". The city to the five lakes, three short of croquet, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of guavas, two schools and not of jail ". 
She/it now became a city of pilgrimage 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival that holds every year in Eatonville, to do homage in Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance. 
And of various ways, the city that she/it describes - became tourist thanks to his/her/its inclusion in the tourist guide of Florida published by the Depression - era Federal Writers' Project - remains a place to part. 
She/it is not as independent, worthy, and private as she was already in the years 30, when Hurston told that the black farming population of Florida was often reticent to share his/her/its true thoughts with the white man, qui"nous knowing so little, doesn't know what it loses ". 
Even though it is about the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who invoked a dialogue opened on the theme of the race besides, greatly here remain prudent of the stranger's look. 
" we are very prudent as for the way to tell history " declared Hortense Jones, 59 years, resident since always and most former parishioner of the city. 
" it is necessary that she/it is compliant to the reality. 
Eatonville has been defined a long time like a paradox of the triumph and fights. 
She/it represents a historic model of a hold of power of the blacks as well as a community at a time of nearly 2400 people where the rate of poverty is two times the national average. 
It is about a central point but also of a Southern black farming culture example - disdained some times, of cheered other times - that recalls the birth of the American slavery. 
What would explain why the residents are at a time proud and protective. 
The interest towards the picture of born Eatonville with Zora, that everybody here calls Hurston. 
She/it presented her/its native city at the whole world through sincere books, full of dialect, as " Slippers Men " and (1935) and " " Their Eyes Were Watching God " (1937). 
Five paragraphs in the guide of Florida transformed this city, situated rightly to the exit of Road 17, a road that crosses the center of Florida, often forgotten, that succeeds in chapter of the black history and the human drama. 
Daring such a thick case in life as in the literature, Hurston led the readers in the store of property of the first mayor of Eatonville, Mr. Joe Clarke, that was divided then in several private parts. 
" past the road on the left ", she/it writes, " you will find the modern brown and white public school, with his/her/its gardens and these areas of game well preserved of which Howard Miller always took care, although he knows to read hardly and to write. 
She/it made besides mention of the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn " sells drinks of all kind as well as everything that can serve to people of passage. 
Therefore, in hardly about hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville to an auto government but also to the analphabétisation, to the remarriage, and to the sex. 
Well evidently, Fodor was not so. 
It was not made of it a portrait that everybody appreciated. 
Zora described the reality " well declared Ella Dinkins, 90 years, one of the girls of Johnson that Hurston immortalized, mentioning the songs without color, interpreted by men who rented their beauty ",. 
She/it added: " some people didn't appreciate ". 
One always remembers Hurston like a quick and eccentric person, who frequently came back after his/her/its family moved to Jacksonville, Fla. 
Augustus Franklin, 77 years, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in city without warning, on board of a thick Chevrolet, a cigarette to the mouth and carried pants here, where same today, one trust traditional dresses. 
Numerous residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin told, whereas many ridiculed her. 
people were always happy to see Zora " has him declared. 
But he/it adds besides, swinging in his/her/its chair of the posterior patio that gives on Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that " she never remained too long ". 
To the death of Hurston in 1960, she/it was poor and his/her/its books were out production. 
Eatonville and the whole world seemed he to have forgotten. 
Although she/it was previously a star of the literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman of the Barnard College of the years 20, she/it was buried in an any tomb, in Strong Pierce, Fla, where she/it lived. 
In Eatonville, no big commemoration, nor of plate for the big public. 
I don't think that they understood the contribution or the inheritance that she/it offered to the world " declared Valérie Boyd, author of " Wrapped Rainbows " in, a biography of Hurston published in 2003. 
A crucial moment occurred in the years 1980. 
Of the public civil servants of County orange wished to make five ways go a freeway in city, to replace the Boulevard Kennedy, street main to two ways of the community. 
The development of Orlando already pushed Interstate 4 until the west angle of the city. 
The proposition was made whereas Eatonville got exactly over one period difficult of his/her/its history. 
A forced integration, among so many other things, put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community. 
In the years 50, the dispute on the mixture of the races led the hate in the doors of the community. 
" at that time, a white youngster strip came to throw the oranges or objects against the sat people on quoted " it declared Mr. Franklin. 
" a lady even died. " 
They threw a watermelon of their car ". 
In a letter of 1955 addressed to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston puts in doubt the request of the Runs Supreme aiming to a forced integration, defining his/her/its decision in Brown v. Board of insulting Education " rather than glorifieuse of my race ". 
The residents now proclaim that the elimination of the racial segregation in the schools, although positive in some aspects, diluted the cohesion of Eatonville and has weakened the confidence of the young. 
" the black children had the habit to be kissed - I remind some well - one kissed our master the morning, and declared N.Y in the evening also ". Nathiri, girl of Dinkins Ella as well as director in chief of the Safeguard of the Community of Eatonville, a group non profit. 
It lasted, she/it added, until the moment where the teachers and the students didn't come anymore from the same place. 
" You don't kiss your white professor because he/it is white - I want to say that there is here, a cultural " demarcation line declared Melle Nathiri. 
The civil laws, besides, permitted to create the space for a lot of other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who went besides the prejudice, as her, armed of a happy clean confidence and the lines of conduct as ": how can go without them of the pleasure of my company "! 
It passes " me. 
In 1975, writer Alice Walker surrendered on the anonymous tomb of Hurston and began to fight to make relive his/her/its reputation. 
Five years after, a biography cheered on Hurston achieved by Robert E. Hemenway, a true best to saddle, reintroduced it thus to the American cannons. 
The project of the freeway arrived rightly as the most famous girl of Eatonville had recovered her appeal. 
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston consider it like a savior. 
The community began to organize a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences that this freeway would generate. 
The hundreds of fans came to the inauguration of the festival two years after, and many come back in January, to commemorate it. 
After numerous years, related it repulsed the proposition of the freeway. 
" The fiasco of the freeway to five ways, extremely fast, a true civic " pride declared Melle. Nathiri. 
Melle Boyd quite summarized the declarant that " Zora saved Eatonville ". 
The victory against the project of the freeway allowed him to change his/her/its own picture. 
Of the people non residents, as Rachelle Munsons, a lawyer that frequents our church depuis1993, began to come in big number, and the residents began to reconsider the past. 
Eatonville is classified historic city since 1998. 
A library mono theme (renown well evidently Hurston) worked in 2006, on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, repavé. 
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: to six miles of Orlando, she/it can consider at any moment himself like a rear kicks posterior at the time of one day of summery, small rain as she/it was when she/it was founded by 27 black families in the years 1880. 
(one counts today 90 percent of blacks) 
The strangers who come to discover the history of Eatonville, his/her/its reason to be, are dealt again with prudence. 
It is necessary to ask for the permission for most interviews, and some things - as the walls of the vielle church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields - must not be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, as Melle Jones, a courageous teacher and that has a weak for the quick red, are always afraid that their insular community is understood well. 
However, seen the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain local pride level is emerged. 
The young in particular, have the tendency to consider Eatonville as Hurston considered its whole race: beautiful, problematic and all, nor better nor worse, but also proud, creative, bosseuse, mad and mixed that the other ethnic and racial groups in America. 
It is a lot of sincere civic affection that one hears in the voice of the nephew of M. Franklin, Edwin Harvey, 18 years, that foresee to come back to Eatonville after the college to work for the local government or Police's strengths, that need supplementary strength. 
And even for the youngest, as Alondra and Alexia Kenons of 11ans, twin of Winter Park, seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly. 
" Most people, who pass in that zone, will think ": oh, this city didn't compare anything in other " Alondra Kenons declared after the Mass last Sunday. 
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate history, it is a very beautiful city ". 
Here to New York, all speak finance fluently.

Not before the ticket windows of the cashiers, nor to withdraw the species or to make a remittance, but before the ticket window of the customer service, where the usual customers ordered their checkbooks, the tourists asked for the direction for the Macy store, and the new customers opened some accounts. 
Most those before me, I would learn Starr, my " authorized " personal banker, later made all line for the same reason that me. 
Not of the same way, because they had already withdrawn their smaller bank savings, as those of the New Jersey, of Pennsylvania, and Staten Island. 
They withdrew their money of the accounts of saving named thrifts (such a society of the building), of the credit associations, and the local savings bank type and their subsidiaries that only function in a state, and that say to treat the customers as their family. 
In a recent passes, 15 of these banks made bankruptcy. 
These last days, Washington Mutual, a bank to the capital of 327 $made resort to the syndic of bankruptcy, and whereas the New Yorkaises brought home for the week end this Friday evening in, another bank, Wachovia, to the accounts saving of a value of 440 $millions, looked for désespéramment a purchaser to save it. 
The office and the employees of stores who are in front of me, afraid of another potential debacle, transferred their money in a bank that seems reliable to them, either the one that makes the more of lifesaving to Wall Street. 
Some New any Yorkaises became very familiar to the world of the finance these last weeks. 
" I heard a lady in my supermarket local Chinese, to speak on the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bank that made bankruptcy, and of his/her/its skinny general director Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity that she/it could have had to criticize a colleague. 
And Lyn, the caretaker in uniform of my building, changed the topic of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or of the deliveries of my merchant of fruits and vegetables. 
She/it told me, following my visit to the bank. " I put all my savings in the monetary fund market. 
" I changed, I don't want to take risk ".

" I photograph the master out of the stage to capture elements of his/her/its character " Günther Bauer - Photographer 
Nor heels, nor clothes of gift. 
The gas of the big masters of flamenco, free of all tensions to get the aspect loosened of the man or the woman. 
On one hand the artist. 
Of the other, the person. 
Inseparable safe in the intimacy, in these unknown moments of the big public, where one discovers to intimate gestures and looks flown of the artists who don't worry about to go up on stage. 
The German Günther Bauer mixes in " Flamenco - people " the some production théâtralité with singers, the dancers and guitarists with this side less known of the artists. 
In this project, the photographer takes the particular iconography of the flamenco coins different angles. 
Inclusive in the programming of the Month of the Flemish Photograph, the exhibition " reflects the international importance of flamenco, bigger every day ", explain the creator, who clarifies that " Flamenco - people " can be that but, after having seen the photos, the observer realizes that these are not pictures typical of artists on stage. 
These people photographed " in the street " are artists capable to transmit on stage the passion, the sadness, joy... while captivating the public. 
To capture of the instants of personality of these artists to make photos on stage is not necessary. 
They have a personality and one clean character. 
What interested me that was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera of the instants of personality of the flamenco " stars. 
With the festival " popular Song of the Mines ", Bauer started in 1997 a long journey to photograph the singers, the guitarists or the dancers with one camera to plate. 
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of the camera and the material, recall the classic photograph. 
The setting in ?uvre of different stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the picture, while giving him a key of modernity, it reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: " A music with very traditional roots that evolves and that surprises every day ". 
It is not about the dance nor the song in itself, but of the personality and the artist's character who captivate the public with his/her/its art. 
The research of the essential and the magic was the constant of this work that one presents these days to the gallery El Fotómata. 
The stars of flamenco as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about photographed seventy artists. 
The project turned into an anthology of flamenco, that will be published soon in one book of compilation of the portraits exposed to the gallery. 
The passion for the portraits of Bauer brought it to repeat the idea there are two years with the " old sportsman " Portraits (SportARTproject "). 
Although the concepts are different in " Flamenco - people ", the photographer admits that he adores to photograph the portrait of people, to know them and to be able to enter more or less in their life for one instant long. 
I believe that in the photograph the portrait is the most difficult kind. 
You are in front of people, of characters that sometimes you don't know or that let you some minutes only to be able to make them a photo. 
In spite of these circumstances, as photographer, I always try that my ideas become reality ". 
This collection of portraits of the present flamenco that titles " itself Flamenco - people ", is exposed to the Gallery El Fotómata, situated to the number 20 of the street of Subdued it (parallel street in Hercules' Peupleraie) that will be open until next October 16.

The movie of a length of more than two hours and half, "  Sangre of mayo » will make his/her/its exit in the rooms of movies next Friday, that will become then a set televised for Telemadrid of more than four hours. 
Big admirer of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci assures to have achieved with this filming " child's " dream thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, that charged it, there are three years, to shoot a commemorative movie for the two hundred years of Madrilenian May 2, thing that he always accepted when the narration stuck to the national historic facts. 
The 15 millions of euros provided by the Township of Madrid constitute for Garci a " unique " opportunity to reproduce with the decors and the suitable clothes the ambiance of Spain "une that made a mistake of chief for the fight, since, the struggle for the independence drove the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII ", it has signalled.

A lot of actors in " Sangre of mayo " repeat before the camera, as Miguel Rellán, of Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo. 
Four times candidate to the Oscar (he/it won an of it), Garci considers that the three movies candidates who represent Spain this year in the academy of Hollywood, "  Sangre of mayo », "  Sept tables of billiards français » and finally the winner, "  Les sunflowers aveugles », are not representative of the young Spanish movies, " that would deserve to be best-known ", he has declared.

When the times are so hard and without reason to live, he/it doesn't remain to the human beings that the admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to like Paul Newman. 
He/it embodied for everybody an ideal of beauty and truth. 
He/it was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the lost reason defender and defeated, as the foundation for the fight antidrogues created in honor of his/her/its deceased eldest following an overdose and the creation of his/her/its own mark of food bio. 
It was a victory for a country that had difficulty imposing itself/themselves against a suicidal food culture. 
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention nor to the nationalities nor to the passports. 
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, noted that no James Bond died before it. 
Another English, the oscarisé Sam Mendes, said that to work with Newman marked the summit of his/her/its career. 
The bad boy arrived of Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his/her/its biggest inspiration. 
" He/it placed us the high " rod, noted George Clooney, that is maybe the only one today that tries to pierce the screen as Paul Newman made it: while being a lot of honnêt and while having a serious private life and far from the objectives. 
It is not always nowadays easy or possible in the media jungle. 
But there is the one that tried, and Paul Newman is an example. 
After a divorce, he/it was married fifty years in Joanne Woodward, to that he/it was faithful even though the opportunities didn't miss him for not being. 
" But why would have to me to eat a hamburger out of my home, if I have a steak in my fridge "?, did he/it have the habit to joke. 
To the sky, he/it attends with pride the meeting of his/her/its daughters with his/her/its fans on earth, something that is not so usual in America. 
" Among all big roles that he/it interpreted, he/it was never as proud as the one the devoted husband, the father in love, the thoughtful grandfather and philanthropist ", say him. 
Madrid in the race to the organization of Olympics of 2016 
And yes, the dream of a lot of between us is that Madrid can organize Olympics, after the failure in 2012, it could achieve itself in 2016. 
But me I wonder if we are ready. 
If we take the example of the yesterday race: we are not it! 
They call it the perfect race, but according to me it was the worse race in which I never participated. 
If they had taken in account all mistakes occurred during the race, these would be the object of an eliminatory note. 
But examine all in detail and since the beginning. 
The mistakes begin with the withdrawal of the numbers, that obliges you to go there early. 
It is not pain but if they make you displace that would be better than they gives you all (including the computer chip for the shoppings). 
And well no 
They made you go over there only to take the number (first mistake, to move only for it) and (after a long waiting line) surprise!, there was only the size ' S ' for the vest (second mistake, because I need a XL size) 
In what world do we live? 
Is this him because of the crisis that they decided to buy that of the vests of small size with less cloth and finally less dear? 
Hey well, it is not anything in relation to what happened the day of the shoppings. 
To part the fact that it is necessary to go there very early to withdraw the computer chip, the waiting line is of 15 minutes and, besides, it is necessary to let his/her/its bag to back to the entry. 
The waiting lasted more than 35 minutes, it is incomprehensible since 11.000 people are waited for these shoppings. 
Since there is had a long waiting line, the competitions began and we had not let our bag again to back to the entry, although makes once, the withdrawal was worse. 
Besides, rain came with the waiting of more than 40 minutes during which took place of the rebellions and the assaults of the shack. 
I believe that about 500 people will have the pneumonia tomorrow, and some people as me, won't even appear with time in the classification exact, because of the flea that they gave me that, I think, didn't mark the departure correctly. 
Of course, if they asked me to mention an example of perfect race, this one would not especially come me to the idea. 
So I believe that we will always dream to become the city host for the OLYMPICS of 2016. 
Microsoft looks for a receptionist (virtual) 
To the conference on the Emergent Technologies of PUT it Microsoft has been presented a new system of recognition of picture and human interaction, an Artificial intelligence species endowed with little intelligence but capable to accomplish some basic tasks, as to call a taxicab (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move in the campus of the enterprise) in answer to that for that one asked him at the time of a conversation. 
Thanks to a camera and to a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this " receptionist " can know how much people has in the place, that they are - including to remember what stations they occupy - and to listen and to hear the words keys of their conversations. 
But also to regroup them according to groups of conversation 
In the video of presentation, the receptionist detects a third person but she understands that she doesn't belong to the group that is speaking with her and that she is not part of the enterprise. 
She/it asks him if she/it is here to return visit to someone and she/it tells him that she/it will answer him in some instants. 
All this without blue screen. 
Impressing. 
But of course it represents the future. 
Now the enterprise has other things on which to concentrate, for example on the next version of his/her/its operational system, Windows. 
This week one spoke in addition to a change of strategy at Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be lighter and he/it won't have as many programs partners anymore. 
Steve Ballmer discovered that if the computers were sold with the indispensable instead of useless applications, they would go more quickly five times. 
It represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, didn't stop of added of the functions and the " extra " to Windows. 
The change of strategy is the welcome. 
Microsoft is right, his/her/its operational system loses importance but also his/her/its software. 
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those that adhered to the theory according to which Google Chrome is the first gait on behalf of Google to make competition to Windows. 
Several people underlined understandably that a navigator Internet is not an operational system. 
The operational system will always be necessary since it is the indispensable basis so that the computer material and the software consist of themselves. 
He/it occupies the same function that your wife or your husband when you have to tell something to your stepmother. 
It is true. 
He/it will never disappear but it is necessary to see the " death " of the operational system no like an absolute truth but like a relative truth. 
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea. 
People pay attention less and less to the operational system but more and more to navigator Internet. 
One only lights the computer to make turn Firefox, to Explore or Chromium and every day people spend more time sailing on Internet that to browse some windows. 
To whom serve the half of the applications provided with the système ? 
Who can the more can the less. 
And Windows 7 should contain less applications, a lot less that Vista. 
Less heavy, cluttered month, less complex. 
At present, Microsoft is interested more in the launching of his/her/its own services online so that they become finally an alternative in Google. 
They have hopelessly need of it, indeed, and I show you an example. 
The present photo in this article, has been taken in the beginning of this month in one rooms of rest reserved to the employees of Microsoft in Redmond. 
On the distributor of drinks, a poster asks them to use their own tool of research - " Your research. Our future ". 
In 2006, a survey concluded that 66% of the employees of Microsoft used Google to look for the information on Internet. 
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7. 
She/it won't leave in the beginning of 2009 but toward the end 2009 or to see in 2010. 
Microsoft will try to throw at the same moment Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 surely. 
The telephone, after all, look more and more like a computer. 
But the launching of Android being late and the iPhone being already on the market, it will be them expensive. 
The Fabulous Marcel 
Pablo Picasso took it on the French Riviera, Leonardo Caprio di carried one of it in him ' Diamond of blood ' of Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino in ' The Godfather ' of Francis Ford Coppola and makes part of the holding of the association of the sinewy gays. 
And if we start enumerating all his/her/its apparitions, one could also mention this strong mustached that raised some weights in an itinerant circus. 
It is not that a simple masculine body vest made of cotton, tight-fitting and without sleeves. 
The English call it ' tank' but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels distinguishes himself/itself among all others. 
First of all, by his/her/its flaming name - although he/it is known as ' Marcel ' - that has to see with sport since he/it takes the name, according to the legend, of boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of singer Edith Piaf. 
Him ' Marcel ' distinguishes itself of the other by his/her/its excellent cotton, by his/her/its unisex cut, by his/her/its distinctive logo and by the small Belgian flag (hardly recognizable) that the most known body vests have in the neck. 
But attention, because the only produced not Belgian mark that of the tank bips. 
But she/it also produces the sweat-shirt, the old-fashioned boxers, the cardigans made of cashmere, of pants made of cotton, of the babies, of the mini - shorts... 
Of the dresses conceived for the comfort of underwear. 
Even though it is a pity to carry them only as underwear. 
They have too much charm. 
" I want to become a young mom; the candidate doesn't worry 
His/her/its enormous resemblance with his/her/its s?ur didn't prevent him to develop his/her/its own personality. 
Monica Cruz is small but full of zing. 
Currently the Cruzes s?urs take their new activity very seriously in the fashion. 
According to Monica, they are not that of the beautiful and famous girls who lend their name. 
She/it was present to the promotion that the Mango mark made in Paris to his/her/its new social seat but as well as to the most important price of the fashion presentation that the Spanish house sponsors.

A very intense day but, at the same time, exciting, waits for us. 
On what is your new collection based created for Mango for this fourth season?

I like to go for a walk a lot in city and to observe the women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often make it. 
Dancer, actress and drawer, you are a very versatile woman: this is not? 
I believe that yes but at the end of account all joins himself and these activities have a lot of things in common. 
Since I am all small the clothes pleased me; I wanted to go to my grandmother to watch in my aunt's cabinets and to see his/her/its clothes. 
It was brilliant, nearly better than to go to the amusement park. 
Then, when I became dancer, I always tried to take care of my way to dress me. 
The dancers like greatly well to dress for the courses and the tests, to look at himself in the mirror and to feel well. 
And in actress's role, when you take the clothes that is at that moment that you really get in the character's skin. 
Finally, all is bound. 
You had 30 years ago: does it have hard summer for you? 
Not of the all. 
I feel better than my 30 years ever, rejoice me. 
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and savor life with less problems. 
The biologic clock doesn't frighten me. 
I made all things that I wanted to make since all small and it gave me a lot of internal happiness. 
Do you think then, to become maman ? 
Of course, I want to become mom because my body asks me and, besides, I want to become a young mom; I don't want to lose that. 
With regard to the candidate, I don't worry. 
What I will make that is to give a lot of happiness to my son and to raise it with a lot of love. 
Let's come from it to the movies, you wait that the different movies that you shot last year leave. 
It is true, I am in a hurry that they leave. 
Me that am a woman descended of the theater, I am very impatient and worried, I would like all to have now but of course it is not possible. 
I am in a hurry that way the movies ' The última hora' and ' In busca of the tumba of Cristo'. 
To see this that you will think some? 
Did you start a few days ago on the footbridge with Naomi Campbell, this is not? 
Don't say ça ! 
I didn't go up on the footbridge to make the model. 
Simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I know it since quite a lot of time, to invite me to participate in London to a parade of beneficence for his/her/its association in favor of the support to the women and the clothes that we exhibited - I exhibited two clothes of our collection create for Mango - were sold to the bids to collect money for the NGO of Naomi. 
The people that Naomi is a person to the tender c?ur. 
They say so many things on her, me I know it, a lot of things are not true. 
Besides, this if good side of Naomi fascinates me. 
She/it asked me to parade for a reason so noble, but if she/it had ask me to make the peartree, I would have made it nevertheless. 
The important it is to return the best life to the women of the third hulls. 
The recidivists of the alcohol to the wheel should install the system ' alcolock' 
The Minister of the inside wants that the driver who had more than three administrative sanctions for alcohol level, has to install in his/her/its vehicle a system that prevents to start the vehicle in state of drunkenness, or if he doesn't blow. 
The initiative has already been announced in the month of last June and it appears henceforth in the report of the Minister of state in which this initiative is considered like a pilot project that will last one year. 
His/her/its goal is the driver's reinsertion while proposing him courses of road rehabilitation. 
The Minister of state loaded of the road security but also the General Direction of the Road Security and the Foundation Technological Institute for the Security of the car will participate in this initiative. 
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of the drivers stopped to have driven more of once in state of drunkenness, takes the car. 
The alcolock would avoid it since it is a system plugged on the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the breath and prevent to start the vehicle if the driver doesn't blow before; or when the rate of alcohol of the driver is superior to the one authorized. 
His/her/its cost is superior to 1.000 euros and is to the driver's load. 
To this consideration, a survey led to the States Unis in 2007 demonstrated that the vehicles equipped with this device reduced until 65% of the infringements during the first year of installation. 
And in Spain one estimates that it could save life to 115 people every year. 
This measure stops that to the administrative sanctions for two reasons: to face these behaviors before they don't turn into penal infringements. 
And to facilitate his/her/its setting in ?uvre, since the legal reform can be made by plain ways but, however, the reform made by penal ways requires a reform of the organic law. 
The device is not even available on the Spanish market under no commercial shape, although some industrial vehicles and of function possesses one of it already to tentative title. 
Tomorrow, the Convention of the Deputies will vote an initiative of the Spanish socialist party that proposes to install like that in the school buses this system precisely has been made in France. 
To Mexico without ' peep-toes ' 
To 17h40 precise, foreseen official hour, the plane of the Spanish aerial strength in which the Princes of the Asturieses traveled landed in the presidential Hangar of the airport Benito Juárez of the Mexico DF. 
The sun was on the eve of to lie down but his/her/its rays obliged again to put the hand in manner of visor to be able to see the royal couple getting off the plane. 
To the foot of the staircase, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present. 
Some hours before I had asked in the street, to the taxi driver, if he/it was informed that the Spanish Princes visited the city to finish their official journey. 
- Ah, of the stroke one won't be able to go very well, to the airport to take some customers at this hour... Are you from here or alors? ? 
- No, non gentleman, I am Spanish but I lived here thinking two years. 
- Ah, very well? 
But the Mexican press knows very well that the Princes of the Asturieses are and know the importance of the journey. 
They are several to wait in the hangar of the airport close to the red carpet and to a military row composed of 27 soldiers of marine. 
The Prince is smiling and dressed of navy blue, the Princess, when to her, has hairs to wind, is dressed very temperately and don't carry his/her/its ' peep-toes ' habituelles ; maybe that they had told him that a storm threatened. 
They make a brief stop by the photographers before passing in the room where the official cortege waits for them. 
At the door of the hotel where they accommodate, one of the four bigger hotels of the city, a journalist funny of the Mexican television waits for them. 
The most prestigious price of the fashion 
There is not a more suitable place surely in the world to present a price of fashion that Paris and drawer living extraordinary and good more doesn't exist surely live that Valentino. 
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to reinforce the international picture of the new talents of the fashion. 
The winner will be rewarded by a price of 300.000 euros. 
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian taken winner of the first edition, looked at its models in the window of Mango to the 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she nearly cried some of emotion. 
Certainly it is the second more department store of the mark in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1.335 square meters of surface. 
The first boutique is at London. 
The events, as well as the desire to thank stylist Valentino, president of the jury of the contest, made that we met in a luxurious to dine in the Garnier opera of Paris. 
With like table neighbor the one of the extraordinary family Chagals, the presidential table prepared by Mango, appeared even more spectacular. 
While having thick on the c?ur and as making against bad fortune good c?ur, because of his/her/its brother's recent death, Nati got a garment of Mango and some adornments of ELAH, who cut the breath, and arm over, arm under with his/her/its son Luis - a beautiful man of nearly two meter high? she/it came with Valentino at his/her/its dinner prepared in his/her/its honor. 
Andiks, the owner of Mango, an elegant man, as well as the Baron of Rotchil finished the evening without jacket because they had lent them to two ladies. 
Monica Cruz, who presented itself at the store with a trousers and a shirt? of his/her/its own collection - and that for the dinner is transformed itself while taking a sexy and black long dress, is himself touched when during the nocturnal visit of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the room of the repetitions of the ballets and while remembering of the good old time, she/it seized one of the bars and she/it made the gesture of a ' big bent '. 
Inés Sastre didn't remain for the visit of the dependences of the palace, but she showed us before on his/her/its portable telephone of his/her/its son's photos. 
The following morning, did we have the pleasure to see Olivier Martínez? another beautiful man who moves by motorcycle - and John Travolta, that arrived to the intercontinental hotel of Paris, with his/her/its sheets, his/her/its napkins and as having asked beforehand, that there are not any odors in his/her/its room. 
Of the stars under the starry sky of Paris. 
Oh there there, it is life. 
1001, the number antistress, 
There is not that 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and the frenzy of the daily life. 
And to crown the all, they are all listed in one book that will bring the relax to the booksellers September 30. 
The clock nearly saddens us when it sounds every morning at 7 o'clock, but it is again worse when one thinks about the agitated rhythm that imposes us the present life. 
The office is synonymous of tension and the computer of pains to the back. 
Stress represents the pain of the XXIème century. 
But one nor two methods don't exist to fight the daily fatigue and the problems bound to the world of work. 
But well 1001, nor a besides nor one of less. 
To part the positions of yoga, the classic massage or the treatments ' spa', Susannah Marriott unites in the pages of one book all one ' menu' of methods adapted to the taste and in the time of each. 
The ?uvre antistress titles itself ' 1001 ways to relax ' and will arrive directly among the booksellers of publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK. 
If someone believes that it is not possible to get the tranquillity in lieus as work or through personal relations, this ' manuel' denies such a belief. 
Besides, this manual offers other methods as contact with the nature or returns 100% natural that help to loosen you. 
If adrenaline doesn't run in your veins to restore the balance of your body and if stress became a problem, it is time to sit down in the sofa, to disconnect his/her/its mind and to concentrate on reading. 
To speak while sleeping 
Some children speak during the night. 
I don't relate to those that wake up very awake while telling us something that happened the day of before, but to the children who speak during their sleep. 
The first time that it happens to that can surprise you, but actually it doesn't have an importance. 
It is a benign change of the sleep that is called somniloquie. 
It is frequent enough, especially at the children and at the teenagers. 
It is sure that there are more of a that speak during the night of them. 
This phenomenon can appear in a very sporadic way (once in life for example associated to an episode of strong fever), or in a more periodic way (every day, once per week, once per month...), the day according to the child doesn't remember anything anymore. 
Unique reason that determines his/her/its apparition doesn't exist 
They are often bound to other changes of the sleep as the nightmares, the nocturnal terrors, the enureses nocturne (to make pee in bed) or somnambulism, but it is not still the case. 
As we already told it before, they can also be associated to very strong fevers, to situations of stress or excitement. 
Anyway it is little a phenomenon studied. 
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable. 
It can happen that he/it speaks with a calm thin voice, with isolated words, of the whispers or on the contrary with scream, of the tears, of the long speeches... 
In the case where the somniloquie becomes very frequent, it would be discriminating to observe the child and to consult a specialist, to verify if there is a problem that provokes a lot of anxiety and in order to get an explanation to this problem. 
We said that it is a benign change, it is why doesn't have a treatment, except if it is bound to another change of the sleep that can be tidy (for example, if it is bound to an apnée of the sleep or stress). 
What one can make that is to take in account a certain number of very simple preventive measures as: 
To try not to excite the child before being going to sleep. 
Therefore to look for the calm games and to avoid the programs or sets televised that is more or less violent. 
With very nervous children and that have the pain to relax, techniques of relaxation can be used to help them to calm itself/themselves internally. 
It will allow the child to be sleepy. 
As soon as the somniloquies appears try to remain quiet. 
Remind yourselves that they are innocuous for the child and that the following day he/it won't remember anymore of what happened. 
Useful Council 
Don't wake it up. 
It is useless since he/it is unconscious and you would wake it up. 
Even though he/it speaks, he/it sleeps and take a rest therefore. 
Remind yourselves that if he/it appears anguished very several times, he/it is counseled to consult a physician or to verify what provokes so much anxiety at the child. 
If you understand what he/it says (what is not usual), don't have the temptation to question it to get some information. 
You won't get anything, because while sleeping, it is not conscious to be able to organize his/her/its thought. 
Besides, you will hear what he/it says, but you won't know to what he/it is dreaming, of the stroke paid attention to the way to which you will interpret information and to the findings that you pull of it. 
Do never tell the child that you can interrogate it during the night to know his/her/its secrets. 
Same not while joking. 
It provokes a lot of anxiety. 
In conclusion, don't worry, it is not anything of very mean, it is an episode that only lasts some minutes. 
Illhaeusern... finally 
Illhaeusern finally recovered the path of the victory on his/her/its land after a long period of scarcity. 
Without making a big match, the Yellow and Black created themselves biggest number of opportunities and succeeded to transform one of it for the gain of the match. 
The rhythm was not very sustained during this meeting where the attackers had difficulty expressing itself/themselves. 
After one tentative first of the captain visitor Kauffmann who touched lightly the sky light from afar on a shooting, Illhaeusern was going to take the ascendant slightly and by turns Fonderflick with Hirn Roman of the tip of the foot or Diebolds came from afar, then above, to tickle the defense of Dannemarie. 
In the face, one made block in the middle of land and one let the restless Riahi rightly to the forefront of the attack. 
The beginning of second half-time was going to be decisive with first two opportunities signed Riahi and Temporal for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousienses by Swamp, positioned well to take a bullet repulsed on one tentative first of Diebold (53rd '). 
But scorer Illhousiens won't be able to savor his/her/its happiness a long time and will be able to oblige to regain the cloakrooms later a dozen of minutes and to let his/her/its team mates thus in numeric inferiority. 
But Dannemarie won't know how to benefit from this and won't pose any thick problems to an Eleven illhousien that moved back a little rightly for " compacter " his/her/its defense, except in the last seconds of game where, after a thick mess, the bullet passed very close to the transversal.

The movement propagated itself to other harbors of the Atlantic facade and the English Channel, as to the Sands of Olonne, in Vendée, where the trawlers remained to embankment, or in the Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the movements of the trade ships. 
The fishers of The Turballe and the Croisic, in Loire Atlantique, stopped in the evening the blockade of the important refinery Total of Donges.

In the Guilvinec, the " committee of crisis " must decide Tuesday of the continuations indeed to give to the movement and his/her/its involvement to lentrevue foreseen to the ministry of agriculture and the Fishing in Paris. 
But some Breton fishers don't want to be represented by persons responsible of the national committee of the fishings, that didn't sustain their movement. 
" The strike is going to continue " because " the fishers won't release anything " and " don't wish to move to Paris ", announced Liliane Cariou, the chairwoman of the committee of the fishings of Lorient, for example. 
The professional fishers, who don't pay for taxes on diesel oil, pay currently about 50 cents by liter but they estimate that the doorstep of profitability of a boat is only reached with a diesel oil lower to 0,30 euro the liter.

Close to two republican out of three rejected his/her/its plan. 
" It is a bad signal sent to the market, that sees the Convention incapable adopting a plan ", estimated Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial. 
" It shows to what point the market counted on this plan ", she/it has added, fearing that a project adopted in several days arrives " too late ". 
" If the project is effectively moribund (...) then the relay will have passed quickly to the Fed (the American central bank, ndlr) and to the other banks power stations to manage the crisis, what would tighten the conditions of credit " more, warned Brian Bethune, chief economist in Global Insight. 
And accentuating the feeling of emergency more, " every day that passes brings the fall from a financial " institution to the United States, underlined Mrs. Piegza. 
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual Friday, the authorities organized the acquisition of the banking activities of Wachovia by his/her/its rival Citigroup. 
In Europe, the crisis accelerated suddenly, pushing to interventions of emergency to the profit from banks to United Kingdom, to Benelux, in Iceland and in Germany, sign that the markets not only cope " to an American crisis, but to a world " crisis, added the analyst of FTN Financial. 
The bonded market went up strongly.

Obama, winner to the points of the first duel televised 
To the first debate of Friday between the two candidates home White followed another to know that, of John McCain or Barack Obama, carried away it. 
Without surprise, the HQ of republican and democratic country proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that would have been followed by a third of the American families. 
The analyst politicizes David Gergen estimates that the benefit of John McCain, although honorable, was not brilliant " enough " to allow him to stop his/her/its decrease in the polls at five weeks of the presidential. 
The Gallup institute, of which an investigation of opinion published Saturday grants an advance of five points to Obama (49% against 44% in McCain), judge that it is the democrat who pulled his/her/its pin of the game. 
At the undecided voters, who are those that count, Obama left winner for 39% of probed them, while 25% among them grant the victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll. 
Obama should be able to confirm his/her/its advance Thursday with the good benefit waited of his/her/its colistier, Joseph Biden, at the time of the first and unique debate public with his/her/its rival, Sarah Palin. 
" It would be a mistake to underestimate it. 
She/it is had of good instincts ", warned Bill Clinton however this weekend. 
The septuagenarian McCain didn't have a rest to put his/her/its indisputable experience forward concerning foreign politics, while underlining his/her/its adversary's innocence " on these questions that were to the c?ur of this first face-to-face meeting. 
Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that... he/it has accused has several resumptions. 
" I don't believe that senator Obama has the experience and the necessary knowledge to be a president ", he also has assured. 
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in the advertisements televised republican. 
Obama has, him, underlined that he represented the future. 
Without disassembling itself/themselves, he/it appeared concise and precise. 
He/it put his/its capacity forward to take the good decisions, and to restore the picture of the United States in the world. 
" McCain didn't always understand, while Obama, if ", retorted, this weekend, a democratic spotlight blaming to the republican for not having taken the whole measure of the impact of the crisis on the "Américain of the street ". 
" During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say on me, but nothing on you, denounced Obama, yesterday, before 20 000 personnesrassemblées for an electoral rally in north Carolina under a beating rain. 
He/it didn't even pronounce the words " class middle " or " hard-working ". The financial discomfiture clearly favors Obama, that is considered by the Americans like the able to save the economy very close to the precipice. 
" The week to come could be a decisive " turn, estimated, yesterday, the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer. 
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, an old of the Clinton administration, compared the " good instincts economic " of Obama to those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998. 
For the democratic candidate, the present " debacle is the final verdict of eight years of a bad economic politics put in ?uvre by George Bush and sustained by senator McCain ". 
Reaffirming that he/it would arrive nevertheless to reduce the taxes of 95% of the Americans in spite of the starts of Wall Street, the senator of Illinois also signalled that the realization of a possible energizing independence of the country by the renewable energy promotion was his/her/its first priority, with the setting up of an insurance - health system. 
McCain, him, wished to construct a park of 45 nuclear power stations of here to 2030. 
Prudent, the two candidates avoided the questions carrying as regards to financial lifesaving of 700 billions of dollars (470 billions of euros) adopted last night by the Convention and extremely unpopular. 
In Minsk, did " you notice that there was an election, you "? 
Young and opposing showed Sunday evening on the main place of the fundamental biélorusse to reject advance the results of the legislative. 
A few hundreds of Biélorusses met Sunday evening since the closing of the polls on the central place of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent character of the legislative. 
Whereas no result had been announced again, many youngsters had come to demonstrate against the power of president Alexander Loukachenko: " the dictator, resignation ". 
Some confess not to have voted even: " To what good, since they will make what they want my voice ", said a young. 
They don't believe that the regime that made good face to the foreign observers in the goal to take language with the European union is ready to do a democratic turn. 
The sanctions, of which the interdiction of visas for 40 leaders biélorusses and the frost of some holdingses, could be raised if these elections were considered like essences by the observers. 
They were not according to the opposition. 
" We have been held aside from the electoral commissions and our observers could not participate to the spoliation ", deplored Iouri Potemkine, the spokesman of the union of the democratic Strengths, a heterogeneous regrouping of twelve parties. 
" It is a cosmetic change, underline Alexander Milinkievitch, former candidate of the opposition to the presidential of 2006 and chief of line of the movement proeuropéen, because the important it is that the voices count, and at home, it is the ministerial power. 
If deputies of the opposition enter to the parliament, it is that they will have been named, didn't elect. 
But their entry to the parliament can mean the space to the television, of the meetings in the regions and the propositions of laws ". 
The opposition must therefore to enter in the political game because " it is necessary to start the dialogue with the European union. 
Because if our economy, that is indebted heavily opposite Russia, enter in crisis, and that we don't reform ourselves, we risk to become a protectorate of Russia. 
However we want to be independent ". 
The opposition fears that the organization for the security and cooperation in Europe that didn't follow the electoral process recognizes the validity of the voting. 
She/it underlines that the numbers of involvement appear too much elevated, and that the generalization of the vote by anticipation (26% of the voters in Minsk) opened the voice to all manipulations. 
Did " you notice that there was an election, you? interrogate leader Social democrat Alexander Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners freed in August of this year. 
He/it had person there in the polls. 
And there will be to the maximum five deputies of the opposition in the parliament, those that suit to best the power ". 
The silence of the night falls again on the place of October. 
To the television, president Loukachenko and the members of the electoral central commission are pleased of their success. 
The interview - Of blood become again sure 
Héma - Quebec celebrated yesterday the 10th birthday of his/her/its foundation, and his/her/its chairwoman, the Dre Francine Décary, was right to be delighted, because Héma - Quebec became one of the suppliers of blood the more sécuritaires and efficient of the world. 
And especially, he/it reconquered the confidence of the public that had been shaken seriously by the scandal of blood contaminated in the years 1980 and 1990. 
As one knows it, the national reserves of blood managed by the Service of transfusion of the Canadian Red Cross have been contaminated by the virus of the immunodéficience acquired (VIH) and the virus of the C hepatitis during the years 1980. 
Before this drama and she/it grumbles of the public, the government of Canada instituted in February 1994 a public investigation, presided by judge Horatio Krever, investigation that aimed to make light on the circumstances having driven to such a tragedy and to formulate some recommendations so that such a disaster doesn't reproduce anymore. 
Whereas judge Krever lingered to put down his/her/its report, some provinces established a committee having for objective to plan a new system of blood management in Canada then. 
To Quebec, the Gélineau committee filled this mandate. 
Following the Gélineaus reports and Krevers, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma - Quebec to go against Quebec and the Canadian Society of blood to supply all other provinces and the two territories. 
" In 1998, when Héma - Quebec began its activities, hardly 38% of people had confidence again in the system of blood in Quebec, remember the Dre Décary. 
The situation was discouraging. 
By dint of efforts to improve the security of the blood products and work on the land during the years that followed, we regained the confidence of the public ", she/it says before affirming proudly that to the beginning of 2008, close to 94% of the Québecois population had confidence henceforth in Héma - Quebec. 
The Dre Décary keeps however in head that " the confidence is something of extremely fragile ". 
Since his/her/its creation, September 28, 1998, Héma - Quebec applied the principle of precaution. 
At this time, one attended in Europe the bursting many cases of the shape human of the illness of the mad cow, a new variant of the illness of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, tell the one that holds the strong since his/her/its foundation in 1998. 
" And we didn't know at all if this illness could transmit itself by blood. 
One leaned then on one main recommendations of the Krevers reports and Gélineaus, according to which when one doesn't know it and that a serious illness can ensue some, in this case the illness of Creutzfeldt-Jakob that is characterized by a degeneration of the brain leading inevitably to the death, one institutes measures of exclusion. 
In April 1999, one refused the blood of people that had stayed more than one month to United Kingdom since 1980 therefore. 
However, a few years ago, he/it has been demonstrated out of all doubt that this illness transmits itself by blood. 
This episode showed us thus that the principle of precaution that one applied had the sense ". 
In 1999 appeared on the market an a lot more sensitive technique of tracking of the VIH: the tests of nucleic acid (TAN) that permit to detect directly in the blood of the donors the presence of the virus himself and no the one of antibody against the virus, on which rested the used until then tests. 
The TAN permitted to shorten the mute period, that spreads between the moment where the person has been infected and the one where the first viruses can be detected in blood by our techniques, explain the specialist. 
One could reduce this period to a length lower at one week. 
One decreased the risk that some donors are infected without the knowledge thus substantially and that one can detect them. 
These improvements permitted to lower the risk considerably to contract the AIDS by a blood transfusion. 
Today, a person out of 12 millions short the risk to receive blood contaminated by the VIH. 
" In other words, it means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 millions of blood products before someone is infected by the VIH. 
As Héma - Quebec distributes every year between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products, it will take more than 24 years before occurs a transmission case of the VIH by a blood product. 
I believe that one can feel at ease today to receive or to prescribe a blood transfusion to regain health ", affirm the chief of the direction of Héma - Quebec. 
" Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the security of our products. 
One never knows what pathogenic is going to emerge in the system. 
Appeared not later than the past year on the island of the Meeting the Chikungunya virus that, like the virus of the western Nile, is transmitted by a bug in blood. 
It is necessary to be constantly heedful ", pursues the Dre Décary before underlining that in addition to a provision sécuritaire, Héma - Quebec must also foresee a sufficient provision. 
" The needs increase because the population ages. 
The treatments anticancéreux being more aggressive, the patients often need a refill in red globules or in tablets. 
The ageing of the population also has some consequences on the network of the blood donors that regroups 3% of the admissible Quebecois on average only to the grant of blood ". 
All person in health, aged blood can yet give 18 years and more answering the criterias of admissibility every 56 days, either six times per year. 
On average, 14% of people that propose their blood are not accepted, because they are reached of the AIDS or the malaria, for example, and if they traveled in a country where rages the malaria, they will be excluded during one period of one year. 
" With these 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that answers the needs of the hospitals. 
The shortages are very rare. 
But it is necessary to renew the members of this network of donors as they age and cannot give their blood anymore. 
However it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but especially to keep them and to incite them to become regular donor. 
Today's being so wild life, one rarely finds the time to spend one hour giving his/her/its blood ", be sorry Francine Décary. 
With a yearly budget of 297 millions of dollars, Héma - Quebec not only provides blood products, but also of the human cloths, of which of the bony grafts, the cardiac valves, the ocular globes and skin that are nearly used exclusively for the big burnt. 
These cloths are analyzed, transformed and frozen before being stored at Héma - Quebec that also manages the only public bank of cord blood to Quebec. 
The umbilical cord that was considered previously like a biomedical loss overflows with a rich in cells stumps blood capable to serve to treat the serious illnesses, as the leukemia. 
" One celebrated, a few weeks ago, the setting in bank of our thousandth sample of cord blood and one foresees to appropriate more of them of one thousand per year. 
One should begin to propose some for grafts in the beginning of next year ", specify the Dre Décary that describes this program of withdrawal of cord blood as very popular. 
" Several moms are disappointed not to be able to have access " there, because Héma - Quebec doesn't have the means to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals of Quebec. 
Soccer - The impact in semifinal

In brief - victorious Goal of Kovalev 
The trio number one of the Canadian is ready to undertake the season. 
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn enlivened the attack in a gain of 3-2 of the Canadian to the shootings of dam facing the Pantherses of Florida, last night, in the Center Bell. 
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, marked a goal, Plekanec accumulated two helps, and Kovalev harvested a pass in this gain, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory matches. 
Kovalev gave the victory while marking the unique goal of the fusillade. 
" I am not even ready, warned the Russian. 
I need another match to feel me at ease ". 
" He/it tried to make some too much in first period, noted Guy Carbonneau. 
But I think that he/it appreciated the end of the match. 
He/it had a beautiful ovation ". 
Charest bets on the North 
The prime minister doesn't exclude to trigger some elections before the end of the year 
As soon as the general advice of the liberal Party finished, Jean Charest surrendered yesterday in Jean - Heel, to Quebec, where the new minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (on the left), tent to make itself/themselves elect on the occasion of the by-election of today. 
To " repulse the limits of our last big border of the north ": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength while remaining in the big lines, to the term of the general advice of the liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday. 
Behind him, during his/her/its speech, was projected a way of Mill to pictures. 
Turned in buckle, on three immense screens, of the spectacular clichés of hydroelectric dams, of mining exploitation, of Quebec seen etc. by " Google Maps ", of the cards, 
Of the big means as in electoral period. 
Dawns some of press, besides, the prime minister refused to exclude that he would trigger the elections this fall, even though he made notice that his/her/its timetable was charged very. 
The " North " Plan is the fourth flap of a " vision " that the prime minister pretends to have for Quebec, the one of a " new economic " space, which understands an understanding on the manpower with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and of the understandings with the Ontario. 
Often mentioned lately in the prime minister speeches, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had made the object of a presentation never. 
The prime minister limited himself/itself however to explain why the North was " a jewel to the potential immense ", but didn't give due, of investment amounts, nor of precise priority in the projects to come. 
At most some avenues of that that could be developed more: notably hydroelectricity, the forest, but especially the mining sector, dopey by the emergent country growth and the public infrastructure reconstruction. 
The North contains " nickel, zinc, copper, turntable, however, money, iron, titanium, and same diamond ", according to the induction of M. Charest. 
This " territory two times big as France ", " it is at home, it is in Quebec. 
Not only it is at home, but it is us " of it, he/it has insisted, as to show well that he/it solicited a national founding myth. 
Quebec constructed itself a lot in his/her/its relation with the North, he has underlined: the rush toward gold in Abitibi, the Québecois engineering, the Bay James. 
" It is ours, it is our future ", he/it has added, after having made a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense card behind him. 
The North, 70% of the Québecois territory, consists of a portion of Labrador that Quebec always claimed, specified the prime minister at the time of the point of press. 
" It is a traditional position that all governments reiterated. 
There is a line of border on which there is not an understanding since a very long time and, when the opportunity presents itself, I reiterate that position in the name of the government ", it has indicated. 
The rest, " with the climatic changes, is necessary to reconsider our vision of the North ", he/it has declared while speaking of the passage of the northwest, that will open up all year round because of the melting of ices. 
In this new context geopolitics, the prime minister estimates that to occupy the territory is a duty. 
And the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuitses? 
The prime minister said that the government of Quebec would be very attentive to their consideration and that the project would benefit them, notably to the young. 
Two ex-ministers coming from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former deputy péquiste of Ungava), already started some consultations by about thirty communities. 
An interdepartmental committee presided by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transportation and natural Resources) has an important place started works. 
The prime minister doesn't exclude a big meeting, " not necessarily a summit ", but one moment where " one will give itself a common " vision. 
The development of the North would make itself besides in conformity with the principles of the lasting development. 
The North Plan will be devised, neat and respectful of the environment ", it has promised. 
Jean Charest described this " vision " as being in continuity with the one of prime minister liberals that preceded it. 
" As the liberals who preceded us, we thought otherwise to transform the challenges in new opportunities of growth and development ". 
It was besides one of the recurrent themes of the weekend, that is started itself Friday by a big cocktail to underline the 50th birthday of the arrival of Jean Lesage to the head of the party. 
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Central Beauharnois in Dam Adélard-Godbout. 
" Of Godbout, that created Hydro Quebec, in Lesage that made the calm Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa that made the Bay James, our party knew to forge the future ", declared Jean Charest. 
Dawns some of press, he/it invoked another reference, curator that one, the program " Roads to the North " of John Diefenbaker, prime minister of 1957 to 1963. 
While approaching the project of hydroelectric dam of Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr. Charest underlined that his/her/its setting in service was planned for 2012. 
" That remains between us there, but I foresee to be " there, he/it has confided to his/her/its militants, causing at home of the fed applause. 
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that there would not be an election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, didn't separate the possibility to trigger a voting this fall, what the law allows him. 
He/it underlines that his/her/its timetable is filled however, notably by a mission of the advice of the federation in China and a Quebec summit New York. 
The general Council of the weekend provided to the liberal chief a containing nationalistic resolution platform, notably of the " constitutional " aspirations that went like a letter by the post office: the PLQ asks in particular for the recognition the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution. 
He/it also wishes that Quebec names members of the Council of broadcasting and the Canadian telecommunications and that these last have a right of veto on the decisions taken in Quebec. 
Of the side of the opposition, one welcomed the big lines of the North Plan with skepticism. 
The chief péquiste, Pauline Marois, took out again the Politics of development of the North - Of - Quebec that the Landry government had thrown in 2001. 
According to her, the liberal government, while arriving to the power in 2003, gave up applying it. 
If he/it had made it, " one would be advanced more today " commented Mrs. Marois in his/her/its candidate's sides in Jean - Heel (voting that takes place today), Françoise Mercury. 
The ADQ told to support the adoption of a North Plan by the government. 
" But what one wishes, it is that that is not just a spectacle ", commented leader Sebastian Proulx, in replacement of Mario Dumont, that comes back of vacations today. 
Letters - A dishonored country 
It is Mr. Vic Toews, ex - minister of the " Justice " (oh irony) in the Harper cabinet, that took the liberty the last summer to say Louise Arbour that she/it was a " shame " for Canada. 
To throw the opprobrium thus on this woman who led an unceasing fight for the justice and that deserves all our admiration says some as long on the prime minister setting that on Stephen Harper himself. 
Here we are before a government that is the only one, among all implied western countries, to not to have repatriated his/her/its national shut in in the concentration camp of Guantánamo. 
A government that doesn't hold account by no means because Khadr Omar was quite a young teenager at the time of the facts for that are blamed him. 
The only government that, in spite of the fact that Canada signed the Convention of Geneva, disown his/her/its speech and let stagnate in inhuman conditions a child - soldier. 
The only one that relies on a parody of justice to value the accused's guilt. 
Let's recall, for memory, that the UNICEF, international Amnesty and the association of the Canadian Bar, notably, plead for the repatriation of Khadr Omar so that he/it benefits from an equitable suit in Canada. 
It is this same government that closes the eyes on the torture: imports him little that a young adult is henceforth psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of exactions. 
One doesn't realize it again, but we attend an insidious erosion of our rights, our liberty and our " democracy " at the moment, this word that Harper doesn't quit to wave and that sounds hollow so in his/her/its mouth. 
Came the time where no morals exists anymore: one can manhandle, to torture, to jail a Canadian citizen arbitrarily up to here according to the goodwill of government's chief minority (that will be some him therefore after October 14...). 
Number of voters believes that they will find the salute in a party that extols the Virtue, the Law and the order: they don't see that this government gave up what made the reputation and the dignity of our country. 
The shame, Mr. Toews, she/it is there, in this renouncement, and not elsewhere. 
Free opinion - The speech orwellien of Barrick Gold 
In his/her/its edition of September 17, The Duty published a letter of M. Patrick J. Garver, leading vice-president of the mining Canadian Barrick Gold. 
Pursuing a logical orwellienne, this one affirms that biggest company aurifère of the world instituted a pursuit in slander of six millions against three authors and a small poor publishing house in the goal to throw a " transparent " public debate. 
If he/it is true that the judges are independent and unbiased, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of pursuits in slander, but the law. 
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is overlooked completely by M. Garver. 
Because, for Barrick Gold, the best way to lead a public debate would she/it be to lead to the ruin whoever dares to sustain a position contrary to his? 
No matter the exit of the suit, the authors and the publisher of the book Black Canada should spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and to fight, to very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers nearly sustained by the pockets without bottom of the mining. 
The tactics, in these unequal struggles, is besides often to ruin the defendants in order to impose an out-of-court settlement that will gag the opposition in addition to frighten whoever will dare to bend all over again on the question. 
So Barrick Gold wanted a public debate indeed, it is in front of the public opinion that she should have presented her/its vision of the facts. 
Contrary to what makes itself in several the countries where work Barrick Gold, proceedings in Canada normally make themselves by the exchange of ideas and no with truncheon. 
He/it was sufficient to the mining therefore to open his/her/its books, his/her/its files and to establish a true debate, through the newspapers, the medias, the publications and the financing of independent teams of research that could have made light on the question. 
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust the public opinion and reject the reverse of the hand the petitions and letters of support to the authors of Black Canada. 
Maybe Mr. Garver could he/it explain how he/it can ask at a time for a public " debate " while despising the opinions of this same public? 
In the vice-president's world, he/it seems that this word only designates the fatly paid lawyers and no the set of the Canadians; has a view rather narrow of the concept. 
In democracy, even the detractors have right to the speech. 
What doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - Barrick Gold, it is that the public that sustains the authors and publishers of Black Canada make it before all because he/it rejects the brutal manner of the mining. 
This public is ready to hear Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of exchanges civilized of arguments, and no in the setting of that that several discern like a pursuit - gag (pursuing the " public " debate, Barrick Gold has just put down besides a setting in home at the place of the authors of Black Canada summoning them to quit the use of this term...). 
Beyond the speech surréel of M. Garver, the pursuit of Barrick Gold is a direct attack against the academic research liberty and the quest of truth, essential to all democratic society. 
She/it denies, in block, the right to the quote of believable sources and to the debate on the facts and the interpretations, that represent the very basis of the intellectual work. 
If it is impossible to study and to debate topics that displease to the rich enterprises of this world in a country as Canada, at the risk of pursuits to repetition, who will be able to make it? 
So Barrick Gold wanted a public and transparent debate indeed, she could make it while following the scientific norms used by the authors of Black Canada. 
She/it has a right of retort. 
The academic environment, to which we belong, knows to manage proceedings and the disagreements for a long time and to solve the conflicts. 
The excessive pursuit of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what it pretends, it doesn't want of a transparent debate. 
It is a loss for the academic world, all as for the public debate in Canada, and he/it is time that the governments put the devices limiting this kind of abusive pursuits in place. 
Operation of lifesaving of Wall Street - Democratic and republican get along 
The Bush administration and the chiefs of line of the Convention, at a time republican and democratic, finally arrived to an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic lifesaving plan since the Big Depression of the years 30. 
The new version of the plan of 700 billions of American dollars aiming to pull up the financial crisis that shakes Wall Street since months must be ratified again by the two rooms of the Convention. 
She/it foresees notably: a better control by the elected of his/her/its setting in application, of new mechanisms aiming to assure the repayment of the committed public money, of new arrangements to contain the number of houses seized for defect of payment, as well as a right of look on the wages poured to the leaders of the enterprises rescued. 
The American secretary to the Treasure, Henry Paulson, the chairwoman of the house of representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the republican representative to the table of negotiations, senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, to the term of a marathon of negotiations of two days. 
" We achieved big progress in view of an understanding that will be efficient on the markets ", declared the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson. 
" All has been made in order to put in progress to the shelter the real economy and the Americans plain of the crisis in Wall Street ", explained the democrat. 
" It is the fundamental point: if we don't make it, the traumatism, the chaos and the disruptions on the daily life of the Americans will be immense ", declared the republican Judd Gregg. 
The negotiations had turned to the sprint in the last hours by fear of the effect that a new failure would provoke on the mood of the investors. 
The hour limits that one had agreed was the opening of the markets this morning. 
Associated to the negotiations late, the two candidates in the American presidential election rather appeared favorable to the understanding, without failing to express their discontent that one is obliged to arrive from it to this extremity however. 
The democratic senator Barack Obama attributed the addition of some arrangement to the understanding, notably the one aiming to allow the owners to preserve their domicile and the one on the salary of the leaders of the surviving enterprises by the État. 
" When one asks the taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is not of what to be pleased. 
But these measures are necessary ", he/it has commented on the waves of the American television. 
Interrogated on another chain to know if he/it would vote for the proposed plan, his/her/its republican adversary, John McCain, answered: " I would like to see the details, but I hope that yes ". 
" The big lines that I read [show] that it is something that we are going all to digest and with which we are going to be able to advance. 
The option not to make anything is not simply acceptable ", it has said. 
The plan of 700 billions aims to purchase with the money of the taxpayers the doubtful credences, active to risks and unmarketable of the American financial institutions. 
He/it arrives after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble that first led to the hypothecary credit downfall to risk (subprimes) before spreading to other shapes more spilled of credit title (PCAA) and to clear on a frost of the liquidities and on the stampede of the banks and the financial institutions. 
It is an elected republican group that had made fit with a hood the first project of understanding, last week. 
One believes to have come out of this dead end since the democrats accepted that some poisonous " assets " of the companies in difficulty are only assured by the government, rather than bought. 
In order to round the angles for everybody to the Convention, one also added a disposition stipulating that if the government had to assume some losses during five years with this program, it could put new taxes aiming to help it to recover his/her/its stake in place. 
The new plan foresees the remittance of one first decides 250 billions to which will be able to be added 100 other billions if the president the necessary judge. 
The remittance of 350 other billions should be ratified by another vote of the Convention. 
In return for his/her/its aide, Washington will get some involvements in the rescued enterprises that will be worth him some dividends in case of profit and that he will be able to resell when the storm will have passed. 
The federal government will have the possibility to delay the procedures of seizures concerning the lodgings attached to the home loans concerned by this plan, as well as to fix some limits to the remuneration and to the versed indemnities of departure to the leaders of the enterprises touched. 
The architects of the plan would like to see submitted it to the vote of the house of representatives since today, and to the one of the Senate Wednesday. 
In spite of all their efforts, he/it is not even certain that their plan will have the green light. 
Some voices continued to rise yesterday against this project indeed, so much in the republican camp that democrat. 
" Obviously, Washington doesn't hear you, declared to the address of his/her/its voters the republican Scott Garrett, member of the commission of the finances of the Room. 
" Yes, we have a serious financial problem. 
Yes, there are some solutions. 
But not the one that consists in taking advantage of the taxpayers ". 
Animator of a small group to the Convention nicknamed " the caucus of the skeptics ", the democratic representative Brad Sherman presents the things otherwise, but arrives to the same conclusion. 
" Four hundred eminent professors of economy, of which three Nobel prizes, wrote us to tell us: one asks the Convention to not to hurry and to examine the way attentively to take ", he/it has declared yesterday. 
At the same moment, in Europe, one had a new time the proof of the world nature of the crisis. 
To the term of an emergency meeting, the three countries of Benelux announced the partial nationalization of the group banking Fortis for 11,2 billions of euros (16,3 US billions). 
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, Netherlands and Luxemburg had been made necessary after the bank French BNP Paribas made known that she gave up acquiring his/her/its competitor in full wreck since she lost 2 billions of euros (2,9 US billions) in the crisis of the home loans to risk in the United States. 
Fortis uses 85 000 people and is part of the twenty bigger European banks and the ten bigger insurers. 
" It is not some lost money, declared yesterday the Dutch minister of Ministry of Finance, Wouter Bos. 
In exchange, one recovers a right to vote in the bank and the influence. 
It is exactly something that the savers and the households now appreciate that the weathers look uncertain ". 
During this time, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government seemed in way to nationalize another bank manhandled by the financial crisis. 
According to the English press, the government would retake in progress from his/her/its account the set of the loans at the Bradford bank Bringley and, of which more than 41 billions (75,5 US billions) of home loans. 
The bank Spanish Santander made known yesterday that it is her that would buy the branches and accounts receivable of the British bank. 
The Bradford Bringley and would be the second bank, after the Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis. 
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a committed icon 
His/her/its beauty to the eyes of azure was a long time his/her/its card asset, of no will say his/her/its weakness. 
Was himself him free of the narcissic mirror, the American actor to the charming smile? 
Yes and no. 
His/her/its modesty, his/her/its sensitivity and a talent that stood to reason will also have moved away it of the register of power that gives birth the true sacred monsters. 
But what big long-distance runner! 
Paul Newman, extinct Friday, at 83 years, of the continuations of a cancer of the lung in his/her/its ranch of Connecticut, home one of the last icons of the American movies of the years pomps. 
Less monumental than Brando, like that he/it looked and of which he/it was a long time rival's way to the screen, more prudent in his/her/its game, certainly more fragile, but apostle also of the liberty and the dramatic convention bursting. 
The mingled bloods often make magnificent children. 
He/it is born in Ohio in 1925, a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin. 
Of these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream. 
Without ego excessive, ultimate mark of quality. 
Because in him projected itself all one country in love of the self made man, of the fighter of the war of the Pacific, wounded to the fight, that in the beginning of the years 50 studied the dramatic art then in Yale frequented the Actor's Studio of New York, before triumphing soon to the theater, to the television, to the movies. 
This same man who militated for the civic rights was also the automotive pilot who was classified second at the 24 hours in the Mans in 1979, doubled of a sex symbol, although member of a couple models formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward. 
Also disappear with him the zones of shade of this secret, discreet, committed star, allergic to the bursts of the showbusiness, of which one won't quite have pierced the enigma. 
A honest man, to the noblest sense of the term. 
The disappearance of Paul Newman procured the dizziness to the film-lovers this weekend, whereas collide his/her/its big roles on the black screen of the memories. 
More of a half century of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation parade through him. 
Come back to jostle themselves in memory the cowboy of charm of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his/her/its sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Pussy on a burning roof adapted of Tennessee Williams in 1958. 
More close to us (1990), one evokes his/her/its sensitive gentleman Bridge, uneasy in his/her/its old age by a marriage that didn't fill all his/her/its promises. 
So much others Paul Newman passed to history. 
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by the hate), of Robert Wise, a role destined to James Dean, took after his/her/its death, that threw really Newman in 1956. 
This nice crook in the brillantissime the Sting (The con), Oscar of the best movie in 1973. 
Bitter and avenging billiards player in the magnificent the Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), he/it will take the character of it on the return in the Color Money of of Martin Scorsese, that was worth him in 1987 his/her/its unique Oscar on nine nominations. 
This face through ages, it was he. 
Again him. 
The times jostle themselves through his/her/its course. 
The young especially know it through the cultissime Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, trainer of a hockey team on ice little orthodox. 
His/her/its fans recovered it in 1994 in the Hudsucker Proxy of the brothers Coen. 
With a last role of godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the buckle was curled. 
In opposition to several legends of the movies that released the profession enough early, Newman will be stayed a long time in saddle, while denouncing Hollywood, his/her/its golds, his/her/its pomps and his/her/its concessions. 
The French film-maker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, no without humor, " like a living challenge to " the underplaying " judging his/her/its too supported benefits. 
The profession always was not stretch for the beautiful Paul Newman to that the roles fell a long time quite cooked in the beak. 
He/it played the young however less often first that the dropouts: neurotic, alcoholics, bastards or desperate, of which his/her/its perfect features reflected the drifts and the revolts. 
As director, Newman revealed some facets badly known of his/her/its true chaste sensitivity. 
His/her/its Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (according to the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his/her/its wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, drew a thin feminine portrait of melancholy. 
He that lost his/her/its son Scott by overdose dedicated him his/her/its movie Harry and His/her/its in 1984, work of modesty and sadness. 
Among the rain of homages that surged yesterday on Newman, his/her/its big buddy and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they had played together in the Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) affirmed, very saddened: " His/her/its presence returned my life and this best " country. 
Generosity, love of the existence is vibrant features of the extinct actor. 
Beyond his/her/its career of legend, also fade away a big militant for the civic rights, the ecology, the independent movies, a protester of the drifts of Hollywood. 
One will have seen his/her/its hoe a lot sitting on pots of vinaigrette, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging the process of bad enough taste, although gag to the departure. 
The profits of these sales were poured nevertheless to his/her/its Foundation for the childhood in difficulty. 
Newman, rather than to sit down on his/her/its myth, will have committed until the tip. 
He/it let to his/its five girls a letter containing these sentences: " Still and until the end, your father was unbelievably thankful of his/her/its good star. 
It was a privilege to be there ". 
And a privilege for us to have followed the course of a so lucid and so generous American artist. 
Citizen models, in short and in addition. 
What could really manufacture Zuschlag &amp; Company in their factory to invoices? 
Shortly, October 8, are going to start the audiences relating in progress to the penal procedure, against János Zuschlags and his/her/its accomplices. 
The politician and his/her/its accomplices are accused of swindle, under criminal organization shape, in a permanent and regular way, having dragged particularly important damages. Other chiefs of accusation kept against them, as for example, forgery and use of forgery. 
According to the public prosecutor's office, money coming from subsidies, was spent at personal ends, while the benefits were justified by false invoices. 
The money of the État and townships, about 65 millions HUF to the total, went on the one hand in the cases of the movement Fiatal Baloldal and on the other hand, in the pocket of some people. 
Their method, also made public by the authorities charged of the investigation, was to receive the money of the subsidies gotten while giving out invoices of expenses, behind which no real benefit was provided and so, the associations never respected their engagements. 
According to the act of accusation, a big part of the invoices was false. 
For these last, they obtained of the notebooks of invoices in the market of Józsefváros, while they manufactured the seals in Kiskunhalas. 
For the names of societies that were going to represent on the invoices, he/it was decided some, among others, during the tours in province of the North of the Balaton lake, done by István Lados, on demand of János Zuschlag. 
According to the deposition of this last, he/it had to mark the pensions and restaurants. 
For his/her/its personal consumptions, he/it asked for an invoice, on the model of which they achieved the other invoices that they were going to introduce, among others, by the Ministry of Youth and the Sports, the ministry of the social business and work, as well as the Township of the Capital to reach subsidies. 
The majority of the invoices was created by István Lados and by his/her/its accomplice András ?ri, that according to our information, especially took care to write the necessary files to the obtaining of the subsidies. 
At the time of a " circuit of location ", one of the choices of Lados was a pub. 
According to the two invoices given out by the Zuschlags in 2003, this place assured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Bridge Egyesület. 
However, according to the manager's subjects, it would have been impossible that as much people occupy this place, at the same time. 
Of the same way, in summer of the year 2002, the invoice established in the name of the foundation Jobb Jöv?ért, that will carry the name of Együtt thereafter has Harmadik Évezredért, swarmed of mistakes of shapes and bottom. 
A pension, situated in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three rooms, and maximum ten people could spend the night there. Yet, the invoice mentioned hundred thirty customers. 
The emitters of invoices to the overflowing imagination also fell in the excess, when they mentioned the society Pigal Kft, also belonging in the Horeca sector. In their accounting, nor the name of Jobb Jöv?ért, nor the one of the Hoppá didn't appear, according to the information given to the public prosecutor's office. 
Gy?z? Farkas, the manager of the society, declared to the hvg.hu site that when the public prosecutor's office convened him and showed him the invoices, it knew, immediately, that it was about false documents. 
" The name of our society and our number of tax were placed to a bad place on the seal ". 
He/it added: " Beyond the shape, the fact that according to the invoice, hundred people lodged there, didn't glue either, since this establishment only counts eleven rooms, that don't have as much place. 
Besides, the invoice also mentions of meals, and our restaurant is closed a long time " since good. 
The zealous invoice emitters are not himself non informed on the travel agencies of Budapest, being part of their choice, but only organizing of the abroad journeys. Thus, they indicated some stays ingenuously, in Hungary on invoices to adjust, what also goes in opposition to the practices accountants of the agency, cash. 
Moreover, as he/it appeared at the time of the investigation, they also added the VAT on these documents, whereas the benefits concerning the activities of journeys, whose destination is outside of the union European, are invoiced without VAT. 
In the same way, the rate of VAT of the four invoices established in the name of the Révfülöp hotel to the order of Jobb Jöv?ért was incorrect, since the benefits of the society don't support a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%. Besides, the employees of the hotel only give out the printed invoices, while the false were written to the hand. 
The investigation of the public prosecutor's office reveals that the " emitters " also committed some mistakes while mentioning like benefit the transportation of goods by road, that the issuing society of the invoices could not exercise, since his/her/its profile was the advice in investment. 
Besides, it is also for vices of shapes, as types of inadequate invoices and the false seals, that the invoices given out to the order of Együtt have Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and of Biztos Bridge were revealed false. 
All as in the case of the society Ravenna Bt. or of the sporty practicum of Kunfehértó, that all two deny to be the authors of the invoices given out in their name. 
The forgers don't have non lent attention to the fact that the society HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation as (in 2001) the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have one meal at home. According to our information, it is for this reason that the liquidator of the society denies to have given out this invoice. 
Invoices established deliberately 
Another category of emitters of invoices is the one composed of those that were quite conscious for that it was asked them to give out fictional invoices. 
The foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány, to the demand of the grouping of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, established an invoice to the order of the Együtt foundation has Harmadik Évezredért, for a sum of four millions of HUF. 
According to the act of accusation, the manager of the society Collab Kft. is brought to give out some false invoices by one the accuseds, Ludovic Györfi. 
In the same way, did cooperate with the Zuschlagses, the society Biogate Kft., who is currently under liquidation and who in 2003, did give out some invoices to the order of the foundation Jobb Jöv?ért Alapítvány, of the association Atlasz Egyesület and the Vörösfeny association? Egyesület, for an amount of about five millions HUF, but behind which no benefit has been provided effectively. 
No financial movement took place, either, since the given out invoices have been annulled thereafter, but it, the organisms avoided to mention it in their accounting well. 
The following category of issuing societies of invoices is the one of the societies directly bound to the accuseds. 
Thus, the administrative delegate of the general director of the society Delta Trió Kft., taking care of the trade of fuel and automotive vehicles, whose social seat was in Budapest, but where it was there untraceable, was Iván Kubatov. 
In October, November and December 2005, this society gave out several invoices concerning the computer facilities sale, for an amount of about 18 millions HUF. 
According to the investigation, these facilities would have been bought by the society Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, that was in liquidation since September 14, 2005. 
The director of this society was a man of Rumanian origin, to whom Iván Kubatov would have sent also of the documents in relation with the society, between 2002 and 2005. 
From what we know, Kubatov recognized during the investigation that he gave out some invoices to the order of the Atlaszes societies, Hoppá and Együtt has Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and that he pocketed their countervalue. 
It is precisely to the demand of Kubatov Iván that the societies created F - Bani Jos Faipari Kft of the Rumanian masons. and Jos-Investment Bt. 
Actually, no these societies didn't function, what the accused explains by the fact that they didn't receive any work. 
He/it used nevertheless of these societies, since to the demand of Mr. Zsolt Szente, codefendant as well as editor of the acts of foundation of the societies, he/it established some invoices to their names, to the order of associations relating in Zuschlag, as the Atlaszes associations and There - Generációs. 
Kubatov gave to organisms, 15 invoices to the total, given out by the societies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, F - Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of 14,2 millions of HUF. 
The public prosecutor's office thought that 10% of the is indicated on the invoices as well as the VAT went in the pocket of Kubatov. 
The man even used the society Szi-Beri Bt. to establish the fictional invoices that have been used in the setting of the demand of Biztos Bridge subsidy. 
In January 2006, the There - Generáció association and Szövetség has Modern Magyarországért introduced a demand of subsidy by the organism of public utility of the socialist party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA). 
They got this subsidy for an amount of two times 500.000 HUFS, but these amounts have not been used for the objectives indicated in the demand. 
To avoid that it is known, five fictional invoices received of the society Works Team Kft. have been presented to the TMA. 
Besides, these are these invoices that have been found at the time of the search done in the office of Kemecsei Árpád, to the Ministry of the education. 
At the time of the audience, a part of the accuseds will relate the method of manufacture of the invoices, as it had already made previously it before the public prosecutor's office. 
What could be indeed interesting would be that the main accused, János Zuschlag himself, decide to raise the veil on all the history. 
Until now, his/her/its confessions are not very detailed, and although he/it promised to tell the least details repeatedly, he/it didn't make it again. 
The question is to know if it is in his/her/its interest, or then, the socialists would possibly, have concluded an agreement according to which in return for the repayment of a big part of the fifty millions of HUF, Zusi would carry alone the hat. 
Today, this last is hurt probably, since the demands for his/her/its investment in supervised residence, on basis of an allègement of his/her/its detention conditions, fall continually in the ear of a deaf. 
While those that caused a lot more important damages, and the authors of non repairable economic offenses, go for a walk freely or of the less, wait to their own domicile for the end of the procedure. Doesn't have him this possibility. 
The psychology of the overbid: why does one spend more money? 
At the time of auctions, the purchasers tend to spend more, and to overestimate the merchandise. 
The researchers in neurology and in economy of the university of New York succeeded to put up to date the neurological and economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior. 
According to their survey published in the magazine Science, the human beings don't want to be outdistanced at the time of this type of competition, as for example an auction on eBay, and it is why they prefer to pay even for a too elevated price. 
These research tempted to raise a neurological diagram of this kind of " game " with the help of applied auctions. 
One of the groups of volunteers played the bingo, while the other group took part in a playful auction, while with the help of a process of functional magnetic resonance (IRMf), the researchers analyzed the active cerebral experimental topic domains. 
In the two games, the participants could win money, but during the auction of which an essential element is the overbid of a third, the whole being under the trunk cerebral, named striatum, got in movement in an intensive way at the time of the loss of the part. 
This part of the brain, next to several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "auto - stimulation " of the nervous system. 
It is why, according to the researchers, the rise of the prices explains itself with the flight before the violent reaction of the striatum. 
To the support of their theories, the members economists of this group of researchers pursued analyses of financial surveillance. 
At the time of these, three groups outmatched facing a partner, in various circumstances. 
They simply informed the group controls the real value of the product in question, and they did their stake thus. 
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they took winner of the part, then they would receive 15 supplementary dollars, in reward. 
While the third group gleamed received these 15 dollars before the bids, but the members of the group also lost this money, in the event that they lost the bids. 
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the accent was put at one on the victory, while at the other, on the failure. 
While proving the hypothesis of the neurologists thus, the members of the team of the players " against the failure " were arranged to more elevated stakes than those done by the group control and the group " for the victory ". 
" These results cannot be demonstrated already by no economic theory existing. 
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena noted at the time of auctions that by the pleasure to win and the parade before the risk. 
Only the methods of neurological imagery helped to suppress the contradiction between the two theories while clearing, now, on a third explanation ". - noted Andrew Schotter, the professor of the faculty of economics of the university of New York. 
Hepatitis: when do we have to consult a physician? 
In the world, B hepatitis or chronic CS suffer about people half billion, while in Hungary, the illness chronic of the liver is mentioned among the first reasons of death. 
One estimates to hundred miles the sick carriers of the hepatitis virus in Hungary, but only seven miles follow a treatment. It is of the to the fact that often the patients don't know that they are carriers of the virus. 
Denomination hepatitis is a generic name given to infections concerning the liver and caused by different viruses. 
There are a lot of likeness between their symptoms. The inflammation of the liver and the jaundice are characteristic, but the pathogenic agents and the illnesses generated defer the some of the other. 
The viruses of hepatitis, according to the pathogenic genes, propagate themselves mainly under two shapes: hepatitises TO and E through the digestive tube (for example: food or water contaminated), the BS hepatitises, C, D and the other viruses by blood and the organic liquids (semen, vaginal secretion, saliva). 
For the travelers, he/it is recommended anyway to make itself/themselves vaccinate against the viruses TO and B. vaccine doesn't exist against the C. 
The symptoms of hepatitis TO appear to two at three weeks after the consumption of food contaminated, in general, accompanied by a bad general state, of weakness, of pains of stomach and nauseas. 
Develop himself then on skin and on the white of the ?il a visible jaundice, the stools become more lucid and urine takes a darker color. The recovery can take two at three weeks. 
To shortcoming hulls it, every year, a million of people die of the most serious shape of this pathology, as cancer or the cirrhosis of the liver caused by the B. hepatitis 
The main reason is some that according to evaluations, only a patient out of ten receives a medical treatment. 
The C hepatitis can also have serious consequences: if she/it is not treated, she/it can lead to a cirrhosis or a cancer of the liver. 
Most patients are not known reaches the virus, because the pathogenic gene destroyed in a sly way the cells of the liver. In a lot of cases, the first symptoms only appear after 20 at 30 years. 
Therefore, a precocious prevention is very important, as well as of the tests of tracking regular. 
The contamination is a lot more elevated than the average among a population of three groups: people having undergone a blood transfusion before 1991, the consumers of drugs and tattooed them. 
Currently, one encodes to 200 millions the patients reached of a hepatitis chronic of C type in the world. 
Since the illness can be detected by a routine exam in laboratory, it is counseled to consult his/her/its medicated physician since the observation of unknown origin symptoms. 
The illness can be healed, if it is detected in time. The virus can be éradiqué of the organism, in this way risks it of contagion disappears and the development of a cancer is warned. 
September 30 is the world day of hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 by the organisms representing patients of the four corners of the world. 
His/her/its objective is to attract the attention on the cirrhosis of the chronic liver, caused by the viruses, on the reasons of his/her/its development and on the importance of the precocious diagnosis of the illness. 
Does the one that grows in God feel him less the pain? 
According to the results of a recent research, the religious belief would function like a way of analgesic, that would already have contributed to make more tolerable the Catholic martyrdom death. 
The daily British Telegraph published an article according to which researchers of the university of Oxford achieved an interesting experience as analyzing to what level the belief in God could influence tolerance to the pain of the human being. 
In the setting of this experience at the very least bizarre, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists have been submitted to shock treatment, while each of them observed a painting representing the Virgin Marie. 
According to the results, the Catholic believers were capable to exclude a big part of the suffering. 
Thanks to a technique of palpation of the human brain, one could also discover that the Catholics were capable to activate the part of their brain responsible for the regulation of the pain. 
This analysis is the first of a set of experiences, to which of the academicians, the scientists, the philosophers and the theologians participate from different sectors of the university. 
More precisely, the experience takes place of the following way: an instrument giving out some sparks and distributing the shock treatment is fixed on the left hand of the experimental topic. 
The researchers asked the participants of the experience to look at way sustained two paintings, one being the Virgin Marie painted by Sassoferrato to the 17th century and the other, the Lady to the ermine painted by Leonardo of Vinci at the 15th century. 
The researchers to the origin of this experience hoped that the view of the Virgin Marie evokes a way of faith state among the believers, while the choice of the painting of Da Vinci, not very different of the first, carried on his/her/its soothing effect. 
The experimental topics spent one half-hour in an IRM scanner, and during this time, received 20 shock treatment in four part following each other, while watching either the painting to religious theme, either the one to more general theme. 
The Catholics declared that at the sight of the Virgin Marie, they felt as " in security ", as someone of which one " takes care " and they calmed themselves, and the peace invaded " them. 
To the view of the thematic nun painting, they gave account of 12% of pain in less that when they looked at Leonardo's ?uvre. 
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who has himself took part in the experience, think that one can reach the same effects with any other strong picture, at the atheists, under the condition to find the suitable photo. 
" We should find a picture facing which they react very positively, as for example a mother or a father ", declared the psychologist. 
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, greeted the results of these research. 
" The practice of the faith should change and in a lot of cases, change our personality " effectively, added Wright. 
After these excellent results, he/it remains the question only to know what would the effect be on the regulation of the pain of the topics if one shows to the believers a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same caliber? 
Would the view of a Virgin Marie of better quality provoke better results? 
You are what you reveal about your case 
On the occasion of his/her/its tenth birthday, Google affirms that one can find it over at the bottom of the pocket of people for the same reason as the sky to the of their head. He/it knows where they spent their vacations, what specialists they consult and what are their centers of interest. 
It is not yet again enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people of the society. 
While with regard to the skeptics establishing a parallel with the vision of horror of Orwell, these don't see the essential of the web 2.0 exactly. 
Eric Schmidt declared, there is little, to the Financial Times that the main ambition of Google is to gather more information again on his/her/its users. It is necessary so that the founders of Google can respect their initial objective that sounded as follows: Let's " collect in a system all information of the world "!. 
According to the leader of Google interrogated, after ten years of a world chaos work, they are always only at the beginning of their objectives to be able to treat all information. 
To the question: what will there be in five years? Did Schmidt answer that he would like that Google can answer questions like " That I could make tomorrow "? or " What is work who would go me best "?. However, the software won't be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first sight, that the day where they will know enough on the users. 
He/it is not perfectly clear for all internauts that the words used during research on internet, the IPS address of the computer that throw research and the pages consulted then by the interested people are listed precisely. 
Through the intermediary of the program Personalized Search thrown has two years, the users can, for example, to stock their own historic of research and can consult that that they looked for, on what they clicked. Thanks to this, long-term, Recommendations, program being based on the same logic, will be able to give the a lot more personalized answers, and will submit us the products and services on basis of our previous declarations and our preferences recorded. 
To what happens if someone uses my data against me, if he/it watches what my work is? ask for the users, who worry seer the monopoly of information of Google. 
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by the society that can cause the fear, and it is not the remord, the fear of the punishment, the desire of liberty or possibly the revolt against the power that can cause at the internauts a counterreaction. 
It is however a confirmed fact that the sought-after terms are not only recorded, but in justified cases, they are transmitted at third, and in this legal case kind, nothing protects the personal rights of the internauts. 
The most resounding example of this last time is probably the action coordinated against Brazilian child molesters, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information that he had harvested on the page public named Orkut, permitting an identification thus. 
The internauts anxious of the person's rights could breath a sigh of relief in last May, when Google, arm over under with the organism protective legal electronic EFF, proved his/her/its good right in court facing the FBI. According to the returned judgment, in the future, Google won't be able to be obliged not always by any of the points of the constitution to reveal some information on the secret demand of the FBI, of some nature that it is. 
(At the same time, the federal government got with success some 50.000 addresses web and 1.000 terms of research that it had taken back in relation to the backing of the law on the child's protection, voted several years before. But at the end of account, he/it doesn't succeed in obtaining the lists of the private user research, nor the whole list of the sites internet and the keywords of these last two months.) 
The judgment of Google is therefore contradictory enough: he/it is fustigated by those that fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and their private domain in suffer when they begin to use the Googles services. Therefore, they tackle them in the mind of revolt that one demonstrates against the multinational societies proud of their conservative picture. 
During this time, the culture American geek and his/her/its " seedlings " uniting the enthusiasts, the activists and the enthusiastic users of the computer who appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of the big enterprises, the " connected " corporation, by opposition to his/her/its rival, Microsoft, cataloged like invader of the world because of Windows, and that, even though all two fight for the same objective. 
It can explain itself by the fact for that Google, contrary to Microsoft, doesn't ask its users of code of identification, don't ask for money for his/her/its applications. The documentary code and the packet of programs, continually cooled, have an a lot more accessible effect, more young and cooler, facing the practice of the official giant of the software. 
The reason can be also that the geeks sees the problematic relation very precisely between the rights of the person and internet, and that that the web 2.0, the word key the more proclaimed of these last years, pull exactly behind it. 
Indeed, the web 2.0 doesn't concern something else that the collaboration, that the fact that we let some traces deliberately behind us, and that we use the channels of communication placed at our disposal, and while the dimension of these change one by one, the essential remained the same: one exposes itself. 
A young, in general, can hold a profile on several public pages, of Facebook in Xanga, and he/it can even join these to other benefits, as for example in Twinter, or to last.fm, listing his/her/its musical habits. Then, he/it can join these to a system of pursuit, as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young can also hold the blogs, in which appears to their most recent galleries of photos that they stock on Flickr automatically or on Picasa. 
While one can take knowledge many examples, as the one of the girlfriend that understands easily at the sight of the photos of the morning, valued by the common friend circle, with that his/her/its unfaithful friend spent the evening, or the one of the society that dismissed one of his/her/its employees, nothing that for the sincere opinions that this one wrote on its blog about the bip management, one can be on a thing: the term of private life is completely to reconsider nowadays. 
The one that lives a life online, is constituted of what he/it shows himself, and this is how one can define the principle hiding behind the behavior of the young of today. 
The one wants to hide something, or of the less, wants to try to get round the monopoly of Google, can make it (while beginning, for example, with Scroogle, using the system of Google research, but, at the same moment, letting deliberately no trace). 
The number of people that, deliberately, don't record themselves on public pages so that it is not possible to recover them, is not of the least. The services of Google online, while passing by the word processor to the treatment of picture, to the reading of information can be replaced by alternative versions, that are not connected to enormous parks of servers and that don't collect our best profile, having existed until this day. 
The public opinion waits, without hiding itself/themselves indeed of it, the moment where Google will unveil its real nature. 
The society, with his/her/its present value of 156 billions of dollars, is worth more that IBM (140 billions of dollars), Intel (124 billions of dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billions of dollars). The domains advertising AdWords/AdSenses threaten the turnover of the advertisement agencies, while the benefits introduced to a more and more important speed not only cause serious migraines to Microsoft, but to many other computer program creators. 
However, the critical observers find, next to all it, of the contradictions having troubling effects,: for example, the bip management of the society refused, in his/her/its entièreté, the protests of the employees, after it doubled the price of the kindergarten of enterprise and after the society judged too costly the daily multiple restoration, take whenever. All it seems derisory next to the fact that already in 2006, Google acquiesced before the Chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement, the society detects all results that wound the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime. 
Of after one internal rules of the society, the new services are not announced that when they can be used. What is on, it is that in the next months and next years, they are going to make move the world on new points. While some think that the project of scan and storage of books and magazines of Google takes some measurements so important that the society is going to meet shortly facing the supreme court of the United States, others tremble before its Health system, because in this one, one can construct a complete medical profit from our previous analysis results, our physicians and our problems. 
The fact that Google brings up a data base genetics can give a good raw material to the next generation of science-fiction authors. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with half tones orwelliens, describes the future in which a man could be approached in an alarming way anything that through the data of Google. 
Two miners helped to make disappear the traces of the homicidal duplicate of Ózd 
" The police convened two miners to interrogate them in the business of the homicidal duplicate of Ózd. According to suspicions agents, they helped to make disappear the traces of the crime ". - declared the spokesman of the police department of Borsod. 
The young recognized the facts for that are blamed them. For the meantime, they are accused of complicity. 
The two miners, that, according to the information of MTI (Agency Telegraphic Hungarian) are girls, defend themselves free. 
The complicity of murder can entail a setting in detention capable to go until 5 years. 
The suspect of the homicidal duplicate of Ózd, a young man of the corner aged of 23 years, has been placed in temporary detention, Sunday. 
The retained chiefs of accusation against him are homicidal multiple, committed with premeditation and by interest. 
During the investigation, he/it was revealed that the young man of 23 years owed a thick sum of money to a man of 53 years. 
The suspect didn't want to adjust his/her/its debt and it is for this reason that he attracted his/its creditor, last Wednesday, in a site of Ózd where he killed it, as well as this man's small girl, aged of 9 years. 
According to the information of the MTI, the young man premeditated his crime. The weapon with which it was going to commit his/her/its hidden crimes on the scene of the crime is the proof of it. 
The police examines the weapon and the circumstances of his/her/its use with the help of specialists. 
The stock market of Warsaw makes a proposition for the acquisition of the stock market of Prague 
The stock market of the values of Warsaw proposed two hundred millions of euros, about five billions of Czech crowns, for the acquisition of 100% of the packet of actions of the stock market of the values of Prague. 
Ludwik Sobolewski, the president of the stock market of the values of Warsaw, confirmed this proposition that the Polish made although, previously, the Czech excluded the stock market of Warsaw of the circle of the new potential owners of the stock market of Prague. 
The reason of this exclusion is that the stock market of Warsaw is to the hands of the État. 
99% of the actions are to the hands of the Polish État that want to separate of more than 60% of his/her/its actions in some months of activities. 
According to the daily economic Czech E15, the proposition of the Polish represents the most elevated offer that has been made until now for the acquisition of the stock market of Prague. 
According to the Czech press, the stock market of Vienna, the stock market transatlantic Nasdaqs, the Stock Exchange of New York, the stock market of London and the Deutsche Börse made an offer until this day. 
Petr Koblic, the director of the stock market of Prague, declared last week that among the persons concerned, the stock market of Warsaw would be the new least good owner, and didn't exclude the fact that it could succeed to the disappearance of the stock market of Prague in the future. 
The value of the stock market of Prague is estimated between 5 to 10 billions of Czech crowns by the specialists of the market. 
On basis of an agreement between the shareholders, a few 90% of the papers would be sold. 
The most important owner of the stock market of Prague is the investment banking Patria Finance, with about 25 percent involvements, followed by the 14,7 percent of the bank Ceská Sporitelna and the Tiger Holding Oven S. a.r.l. with 13,5 percent. 
The financial crisis of the point of view of the European press 
In their commentaries of Tuesday dedicated to the international financial crisis, worsening from day to day, the newspapers leaders of the European press evoke a " second September " 11 already. 
" The global financial disaster, one owes it to the American " president - accuses the daily of Rome, The Repubblica. " The president even was not capable to make block with his/her/its own party behind a proposition of law, scratch in a hurry, aiming to carry help to a despairing situation... 
Instead a new Pearl Harbour, as multimillionaire Warren Buffett evoked it, he is appropriated more to speak of a second September 11. 
A part of the Madrilenian press also sees the scapegoat in Washington. 
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, these are the defaults of the political direction of over there that brought the world economy very close to the downfall. 
The danger of the downfall of the American financial system deludes itself every day, and thereafter, the whole world is going to pay for the strong price of it. 
Bush's plan was far from being perfected, however according to the vote of the convention, a real danger threatens, the one that Washington doesn't propose a political tool to treat the crisis. 
The world economy hangs in the emptiness, just as in the history of the capitalism, one of the biggest transformations takes place. 
One cannot ignore the threat longer - underlines the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva. 
Some states can aim a life-preserver again to their groggy financial organisms, and thanks to the money of their taxpayers, they can save them of the bankruptcy. 
Of course, more of banks collapse so again such of the dominoes, then nor of the financial means, nor new improvisations won't be sufficient. 
To long term, we have need that the states of the union European make little case of their national selfishness, and that they centralize the control above the divided financial markets. 
Nothing that Monday, the weakened financial organisms received more 100 billions of euros - recalled the Viennese daily, Der Standard, that adds that the fears according to which the European taxpayers also go to put the hand to the pocket, very deep, in a similar way to the American in the goal to remedy the crisis, become more and more realists. 
Up to here, the EU is not himself really occupied of the crisis, that, like a tsunami, crossbar, of part in part, the old continent. 
The " lifesavers " must not immediately wave hundred billions of euros, on the other hand it would be discriminating if they noted in what case it would be rational to touch to the money of the taxpayers, with the objective to warn thicker damages. 
The intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumblebee 
What method would be better to develop some technologies capable to avoid an obstacle, if that the imitation of a detector of obstacles is already existing in the nature? 
As for example, the one of the bees. 
In the astonishing project presented at the time of the CEATEC, taking place to Japan, the humming bees gave the strategic idea of departure to the engineers of at Nissan, to inspire them on the way of which they must conceive the next generation of detectors of obstacles. 
In collaboration with the university of Tokyo, Nissan constructed a mini car robot, a system to order auto inspired robotisé - bio, of BR23C type, that he equipped qualities of the bees, the final objective being to encourage the clarification of a system capable to avoid all obstacles. 
At the time of his/her/its flights, every bee constitutes its own space, of oval shape, that actually, look a lot like our secured protective cockle - explained, at the time of the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the department searches for and development and technological public relations of the mark. 
The ?il multifaceted of the bee play a primordial role, since it is capable to see in all directions, in an angle of 300 degrees. 
To imitate the functions of the ?il multifaceted, the engineers approached the idea of the telemeter to laser. 
This one identifies the obstacles in an angle of 180 degrees and to a distance of 2 meters before the BR23C, he/it values the distances and send a signal to the microprocessor of side, that immediately transforms it in man?uvre of loop line. 
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of second. Then, the mini auto robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of his/her/its wheels while turning it of a sufficient angle to avoid the collision. 
Contrary to all existing system this man?uvre of loop line takes place currently, entirely in an instinctive way. 
" If he/it was not some so, the mini auto robot could not react enough quickly to avoid the obstacle " - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Laboratory Mobility and the project car robotisée. 
She/it must react in an instinctive and instantaneous way, since this technology corresponds to the layer the more vulnerable and most internal of the protective envelope, a layer where for the meantime the collision is considered unavoidable. 
All this process must reflect what the bee makes to avoid the other bees. 
The process must take place in a wink of ?il. 
To the contrary of the bees, the difference cannot go upwards, downwards or in diagonal, it can be only of two measurements, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn. 
In this manner, instead infinite combinations that the bees possess to avoid the other bees, in our case, one could not use that the rotary movement, the acceleration as well as slowing as man?uvres at the disposal of the mini auto robot 
The BR23C uses some batteries polymeric Lithium that is lighter and of which the extract of energy is bigger, what makes their life span longer than in the Lithium - Ion version. 
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is primordial, not the treatment of the data, and even less the capacity to stock. 
This mechanism must only treat some incoming signals per second, and to react to these. 
It is not necessary to stock them and to react with the intuitive logic being based on the data of the previous man?uvres. In this way, he/it only uses some dozens of kilobytes of memory of it continuous. 
One doesn't need memory of a capacity of gigabytes, nor even of megabytes. 
It is the first step toward the conception of a technology serving to the instantaneous loop line. According to the evaluations of Nissan, this system will make its entry in series in the made cars in the next ten years. 
Another application could be his/her/its incorporation in the system of navigation by GPS satellite, so that it can guide the driver toward his/her/its destination while avoiding the obstacles being on his/her/its path. 
One even gave a name to the overpriced baby 
The version written of the plan of lifesaving economic of 700 billions of dollars, aiming to purchase the doubtful credits of the banks, and to use in several times, is ready. 
To the first tour, the half of this sum is going to be spent. 
Reuters announces that to the new proceedings course continuing until after midnight, Saturday, local hour of the coast is, the leaders of the Convention fell okay on the controversies existing since days and days, around the plan of lifesaving of a total amount of 700 billions of dollars. 
" We did a seriousness step forward " - declared Nancy Pelosi, the democratic chairwoman of the American Room of the representatives, of after which he/it remains to put the agreements on paper only. 
The compromise, born from the plan, is sustained by the two candidates in the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain. 
The American secretary to the Treasure, Henry Paulson, declared while commenting the results of the compromise that the program is going to function and will be efficient, however other measures must be put again in ?uvre. According to Pelosi, he/it is not question, here, of the lifesaving of Wall Street, but to make turn the cogs of the economy in the opposite direction. 
The version written of the plan has been returned public before the Asian market opening, Sunday evening to 20h, local hour of Washington (that means Monday to 2h the morning, according to the local hour of Europe Centrale), but didn't provoke a spectacular rise in the stock market. 
Monday, the house of representatives will be the first to vote the proposition of law answering in the name of law of stabilization economic of emergency of the year 2008. Then, his/her/its fate will be between the hands of the Senate. 
Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, then, the White House also greeted the news of the agreement. 
" We are satisfied with the advanced reached this night, and we appreciate the efforts of the two parties strongly to consolidate our financial markets and to protect our economy " - declared Tony Fratto, the spokesman of the White House. 
Otherwise, the program diverges of the initial proposition made by the Bush administration, that it, mentioned that the 700 billions of dollars had to be spent in only one time, for the acquisition of the titles carrying on doubtful credits. 
Henceforth, maximum the half of the sum of 700 billions can be spent. The first 250 billions will immediately be delivered after the adoption of the law by the Convention, probably Monday. This first sum will serve to the secretary to the Treasure to buy doubtful credences of the banks, while the use of the 100 billions of supplementary dollars will be let to the President's discretion. 
The program will be supervised by an independent organism, in which the president of the Federal Reserve will also take part. 
The expense of the second half of the 700 billions depends on a new decree of the Convention. 
To the terms of the law, the secretariat to the Treasure will be able to put a combined strategy in place: he/it will be able to, at the same time, to buy the doubtful credences, of the titles carrying on mortgages and the doubtful mortgages, as well as of other poisonous " credence " types. 
The competent people of the ministry declared that the acquisitions can take place in the setting of an auction, but also directly. 
The rule gives the possibility to the concerned societies, to take part in a program of insurance, where the secretariat to the Treasure guarantees the tools to the origin of the concerns, for which the enterprises will have paid a bonus equivalent to the foreseeable damages. 
Henry Paulson declared that the law provides the necessary tools in order to dedicate 700 billions of dollars for the needs urgent of the financial system, that it was about the vast doubtful credence acquisition, of their insurance, or to prevent the risk from seeing the system dragging the downfall of one or the other important financial institution. 
" We are going to take the necessary arrangements, to be ready to the application of the law, as soon as she/it is signed " - has he/it added. 
On the other hand, the leaders of the banks being in bad stances and waiting for the help of the État can expect that that their indemnities of departure, named simply parachute golden across the Atlantic, will be plafonnées by the government. 
The limit of the wages is only mentioned in very precise cases. Besides, the limitations depend on the way of which the secretariat to the Treasure proposes its aide in the enterprise. 
The principle of the limit means that if the secretariat to the Treasure purchases in the setting of an auction, them prélèveront a surplus of tax on the golden parachute, unless the president of bank discredited leaves at the retirement. 
Directly after the doubtful credence acquisition, the government will intervene in an aggressive way to insure that the amount poured to the leaders is not exaggerated. 
So that the picture is complete, it is necessary nevertheless to add that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The limit only concerns the new contracts, this to motivate the involvement thus to the plan. 
It is the first time in the history of the United States that will be in force concerning general director pays of the legal limits - commented the president of the commission in charge of the financial benefits of the Room of the Deputies, the democratic Barney Frank. 
Besides, the État obtains a right of acquirement of parts in the banks taking part in the plan. In this manner, the risk of the taxpayers decreases, since they can be even a winner in the business as soon as the economy and with it the saved banks will fall again on their paws. 
The project of law mentions that in the five years to come, the President must introduce by the Convention a proposition that will enact on the manner whose losses are going to be restored to the taxpayers, from the financial sector. 
Of the two sides, there were evidently those that expressed their doubts in relation to this plan. 
It is not for it that the American citizens elected us, it doesn't protect the dollars of the taxpayers - declared the republican deputy of California, Darrell Issa. 
His/her/its democratic colleague of the Ohio, Mary Kaptur thinks that these are the same that press the hold of the measures, that those responsible of the downfall of Wall Street.

Barack Obama and McCains sustain all two the plan of lifesaving of the banks 
Sunday, Barack Obama all as John McCain, the candidates to the presidency of the two big American parties, assured of their support the plan of lifesaving of the government of 700 billions of dollars. However, there are the politicians who require the resignation of the American secretary to the Treasure. 
After negotiations marathons that lasted of the days and days, the representatives to the Convention and the administration finally announced, Sunday at dawn, that they concluded agreements of principle as regards to lifesaving of the banks. 
This plan of financing, having for objective the thaw of the crisis of Wall Street and the overcome credit market, became the central question of the presidential country. 
Obama and McCains even present themselves, each as more capable than the other, to drive the country out of the economic crisis. 
According to the most recent polls, with the stake forward of the economic questions, Obama succeeded again in obtaining a little advance. The advance of McCain, gotten with the nomination of Sarah Palin as just colistière after the republican convention, melted.

The review of the press of the territory linguistic German 
The camp of right is intact, it is only to the c?ur of the party that the voters became more conscious - this is how evokes the Der Spiegel, the weak score of the CSU in the Bavarian country. 
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of the red and black. 
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de) 
In the edition internet of the German left newsmagazine, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his/her/its article titled " The revolution in Bavaria devours his/her/its fathers ". 
According to this recognized political expert, the erosion of the CSU began long before that the sad Beckstein-Huber duet takes its functions. 
The Christian socialists transformed Bavaria during decades and now, these are these same modern citizens who turn them the back. 
This change of time is at the same time the problem of the whole Christian democracy, and of this fact, also the one of Angela Merker. 
For the CSU, the failure quite was not a surprise, but Sunday, arrived to term a process that was likely has it, exactly ten years: the indisputable hegemony of the national party ended. 
There is it ten years, in 1998, the CSU collected itself with 47,7 percent, and this for the first time since the fifties, with an underhand score of the level of the 50 percent. 
It repeated itself there are three years at the time of the elections of the Bundestag of 2005, that means the at the time so evoked Stoiber. 
The reason can be imputed from it to the modernization " devouring his/her/its parents ", stake in place in the region in a solid way by the CSU. 
It makes 40 years that the sociologists announce it but they were mistaken strongly concerning the rhythm. However secularization, the results of the education and the establishment of Germans of the north and the East in the region of Bavaria, in full development, could not remain without consequence on the fidelity of the CSUS voters. 
A modernization goes together with the increase of the opportunities, and the consequences of such a politics are also visible. 
The camp of right is intact, it is only inside the party that the voters became more conscious, more critical and more stubborn. 
He/it is also astonishing that during these last weeks, it is exactly the classic citizen groups that rather moved away from the CSU, as the independent, the craftsmen, the possessors of the ferry and the graduates of studies superior. 
In these groups, the support in the CSU lowered below 40 percent. 
Die Presse urgent (diepresse.com) 
In his/her/its article title " Who? With whom? Preside them of party are held on the reserve facing the questions of the coalition ", the conservative Austrian daily takes care of the situation of the confused domestic policy that got settled after the Austrian elections. 
The Austrian socialists of the SPÖ want to discuss with the curators of the ÖVP. 
The forbidden ÖVP in the SPÖ to interfere in his/her/its internal business. 
The party BZÖ populist appears opened for negotiations. The green don't want to agree on the coalition. 
The elections took place, now all turns around the coalition; at the time of proceedings organized to the public television, the leaders of party have let glimpse their cards hardly. 
Werner Faymann, the president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with the ÖVP. 
The SPÖ wants to show that the collaboration of the two parties is effectively possible - it is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership. 
The question according to which he/it would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the present president of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor, remain opened on behalf of Faymann. 
As he/it mentioned it, the Schüssel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected. 
A retort of this combination is out of the question. 
Molterer reacted with prudence to the propositions of the reds. 
As he/it already told it, a collaboration will be surely fruitless so Faymann tempts to interfere in the internal business of the ÖVP. 
In his/her/its party, the choice of the opposition or the entry in the coalition is momentarily quite a question open. These points must absolutely be debated within the ÖVP. 
Jörg Haider, the president of the BZÖ, appears again open to all propositions. 
" To avoid the coalition of the red and black, we are ready to assume governmental " responsibilities - declared Haider. 
Járóka declared: It is necessary to break the circle vicious of poverty and the segregation 
Today, started, in Paris, the Summit European for the equality of the odds, whose host is France, as representative of the present presidency of the union European. 
In his/her/its message exposed before the plenary assembly, as one main spokesmen of the consultation of experts, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz eurodéputée Gone Popular European, attracted the attention on the segregations in the education, because it is a violation of the right that touches the more the children roms and of this fact, one of the main brakes to their success in life. 
In the name of the French presidency, this high-level conference was on the one hand open, by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Work and the Social Business, and on the other hand, by Vladimir Spidla, European commissioner loaded work, the social business and the equality of the odds. 
Among people invited to take part in the consultation, one finds the partners social European, as well as most eminent representatives of the legal protection and the European civil organisms, in the domain of the equality of the odds. 
According to the press office of the group of the deputy Fidesz Popular Gone, Járóka warned that next to the distinctions noted at the time of the enrollments, the roms disappears of the work market, in the first place, following their weak qualification. 
" A crushing majority of young roms doesn't possess any diplomas of secondary, and as a consequence of an elementary education of bad quality, only a minute left has the possibility to get a superior " study diploma. 
Otherwise, Járóka insisted on the fact that the education like elementary right of the human being plays a role key when one must put forward the other fundamental rights. 
The investment in the precocious education of the children roms means a backing of the economy of the countries members of the union European. 
According to the eurodéputée, it is necessary to make become aware of these reports in a possible largest circle, also between the roms and the non roms. 
Indeed, a child rom begins the school earlier, more it increases his/its odds to become a productive member of the work market; by the taxes paid from his/her/its income and his/her/its consumptions, it participates in the budget of the État. 
" Of by their nationality of the union European, the roms must be assured of their right to an education of quality, and to be protected from a weak quality education and sectarian ". - underlined Lívia Járóka. 
Of after deputized it, a collaboration of the union oriented European toward an objective and an action is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of desegregation of the schools. For it, the respect of anti - discrimination instructions exists and of a primordial importance is in preparation. 
" It is necessary to break the vicious circle poverty, the segregation and the jobless person. It is necessary to give the possibilities assured by the democracy to the children roms, so that they can participate by right in the future like citizens of Europe " - required Járóka. 
In the name of the "Année European for the equality of the Odds " assured for all, the objective of the Summit for the equality of the odds in Europe organized every year last year since the summit in Berlin, is to assure an unique platform to sustain the measures taken in favor of the equality of the odds and for the struggle against the discrimination, aimed to the European level and the level of the countries members. 
CSU: the grace for one period of transition 
It is in October that will be taken the decision carrying on the fate of the duet fallen Huber-Beckstein 
In spite of this pathetic electoral failure, the heads didn't yet fall, and the debate on the personal questions to the summits of the Bavarian CSU has been postponed. 
The president of the party, Erwin Hube and the chief of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can preserve their place again. Is the question to know until when will last the grace? 
The fate of the tandem, having undergone a loss of voice catastrophic of 17 percent, will be on the agenda of the convention of the exceptional party, held the last weekend of October. 
The members of this pair very criticized have, in any case, makes feel that they didn't especially hold to their seat. 
Thanks to it, they used themselves to pacify the members furious of the fraction and the basis, that one day some personal consequences required after the " Bavarian " tsunami for the loss of the absolute majority. 
There is it five years - it is true, again under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, to the summit of his/her/its career - the socio - Christian union took back 60,7 percent, while today, one year after the putsch against Stoiber, it only remains 43,4 percent of their strength. 
During 46 years, the CSU was the sovereign " "unique of Bavaria giving 18 percent of the German GDP. 
But, the curators always count strongly in this region of the south, of importance key for the Hungarian economy. To the future, they will be forced to the coalition. 
As one of the first signs of an internal réaménagement of the party, the vice-president and the federal minister of agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as the successor possible of Huber, also received a place in this modest group of recognition, that initiates uncertainly of the discussions with the liberals of the FDP, as well as with the Free Voters, formed along the values of right, about a possible coalition of the government of Munich. 
A foot of nose strange of the destiny was that with the help of the Free Voter list, enter in the legislation the Gabriele Pauli, of which the hold of measure against Stroiber acted as possibility of putsch perpetrated by the Huber-Beckstein duet, to treat then without care the very ambitious municipal stateswoman. 
Now, the leaders of the CSU put all their energy to consolidate, one way or another, Beckstein. 
In this transition, Stoiber, that pulled the strings until now in the backstages, will also receive an active role. The former chief of the regional government and ex - president of the CSU, designated September 28 as the most bitter day of his/her/its political career. 
Monday, Huber threw some acrid remarks toward the CDU. According to him, they would have deserved a lot more support on behalf of the party brother. 
Other politicians CSU interpreted the defeat like a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel. 
Following the Bundestags elections, that will take place in September 2009, Merkel won't be able to be again a chancellor that if they put back one way or the other on foot, with a common strength, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005. 
According to Merkel, covering up with difficulty his/her/its disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of land of the CSU won't influence a negative way the big coalition of Berlin. 
What is yet relative because it won't be easier to manage the CSU wounded, and the crisis of the socio - democratic always lasts. 
Since 1946, the SPD reached its worst results with 18,6 percent in Bavaria. 
Lukasenko - his/her/its rival: 110 - 0 
No deputy of the opposition reached the parliament biélorusse after the elections of Sunday. 
According to the Russian observers, it explains itself by a country directed by Alexander Lukashenko, that assures him prosperity and stability, while according to the organization for the Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), it explains itself by illegalities committed at the time of the spoliation of the votes. 
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers of 43 countries, doesn't recognize the elections. 
Although the legislative composed of opposition happens very well of 110 people in this country of 10 millions of inhabitants since long decades, before the elections of yesterday, the opposition uniting his/her/its strengths under the name of United Democratic Strengths (ODSZ) hoped seriously that Lukashenko, renewing his/her/its president's mandate for the fourth time at the time of doubtful elections, on the traces of the modification of the constitution in 2006, would " allow " this time the presence of some deputies of the opposition the parliament. 
In this way, the ODSZ gave up sound boycotts foreseen to the origin. 
The fact that the Biélorussie, dependent economically more and more Russia, would like to improve his/her/its reports with the EU, where politicizes biélorusse qualified of undemocratic because of the order, Lukashenkos and several politicians loud placed don't receive visa of entry, was one of the waitings of the opposition. The Biélorussie has to take it a credit because of the reduction of the imports of Russian natural gas, always dearer, and contributed to the passage of the Beltransgaz society, owner of the ducts of gas crossing the country, thus passed to the hands of the Russian. 
The fact that the OSCE, at the time of the assessment of the country, put the accent on the positive changes rather than on defaults, as for example the interdiction to present itself/themselves for a third of the candidates to the opposition, made reference to a previous appeasement. 
However, the communiqué of the OSCE of Monday already contested the country, during which the essential of the candidates to the opposition could not appear in the medias, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present at the time of the spoliation of the votes. 
In spite of all it, the opposition feels a palpable improvement all the same in the political regime: the political convicts recovered the liberty, and Minsk is ready to small confrontations with Moscow, always while refusing to recognize Ossetia of the south and the Abazzia separated of Georgia. However, Russia with that the Biélorussie forms a confederation on paper, consider the two independent territories since already one month. 
" We made two steps forward, and a step behind, but most important is that the dialogue has been started between the Biélorussie and the EU " - declared Alexander Milinkevitch to our newspaper. 
According to the candidate to the opposition of the presidential elections of 2006, he/it is desirable that it remained thus, although " the power was afraid in this parliament that doesn't have any weight, to make enter only one objector " even. 
The opposition doesn't foresee actions of protests within sight of the results. She/it rather tried to send his/her/its message on the economic reform necessity by the voters. 
" Of course, we have a lot of worries on that side: we must make print our opposing newspapers in Russia, the local authorities put us of the sticks in the wheels for what is the diffusion, but I can also note that they are more and more to sustain the elections, even in the aged " people circle - declared Milinkevitch, making reference to the fact that in the present regime of Lukashenko, that considers the social security as his/her/its main result, the most sustained pensioner layer doesn't consider it officially more indeed as suitable. 
" Because of the indebtedness of the country and the rise of the commercial deficit, the downfall of the social security, ' evoking the silence of a cimetière', is only a question of time " - Milinkevitch esteem. 
Contrary to the politician of the opposition, the Russian observers qualified the elections of democratic. 
Serguei Lebedev, directing the mission of the Community of the Independent Étatses, declared to the agency of press Russian Ria Novosti: People don't believe in words, but in acts ". In this way, the absence of the opposition is only the proof of the maturity of the voters biélorusses. 
Brunetta: " From today, breakfast before work ". 
Ever, in the history of the Palace Chigi, no had not had any rotating doors for the entry and the exit of the employees. 
But to leave d?aujourd'hui, is in force this new measure against the shrewd kids, against that points and go drink coffee then during work hours in the bar. 
The novelty anti loafers have been presented today by the minister of the Public administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Chief of Staff of the presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi. 
«The rotating doors - tells Brunetta - are an instrument to work better, with more of productivity, more of presences and more of services " specify the minister. 
Now begin a new season of responsibility and transparency. 
" It is the reformism " underlines besides Brunetta. 
The installation in all establishments of the Presidency of the Council completes itself with the Palace Chigi. 
According to Masi, " the rotating door choice is even importing a symbolic view point. 
No resistance on behalf of the employees has been recorded, assure the Chief of Staff: " it is a process shared by the employees, and we had the collaboration of all ". 
In brief, more of breakfast during work hours; more of coffee nor increasing. 
Promise of Brunetta, that suggests while smiling, " a good cappuccino to 7h some morning is an excellent and healthful resolution ". 
At the time of a conference to the Superior school of the public administration 
of Rome, the minister communicates that " ?en three months, the absences of illness of the public employees cut down of 50%, either 60milles workers besides in one year ". 
And he/it adds that it is indispensable to make more efficient, the Public administration. 
Italian, " of which the salary dynamics - explains the minister - these last 8-10 years doubled in relation to the private sector, and well besides the rates of inflation. 
At the same moment, of the thousands of public employees, are united themselves to contest the norms of the Brunetta decree making resort in the Codacons. 
" while the minister of the Public Function spreads today the data concerning the decrease of absenteeism on the workplace because of illness - writes the association of the consumers - the active " loafer people continues to increase. 
Indeed, in Italy, of the thousands of employees of the correct and productive Public administration, are united themselves to declare the war to the illegitimate norms contained in the decree. 
In particular, in the Tar, one contests the supplementary allowance exclusion in case of infirmity because of service; the extension of the timetables of the timetables of domiciliary permanence of the sick worker, during which is done the visits of control, as well as of other aspects contained in the new arrangements wanted by the minister. 
Accidents on the workplace, Napolitano,: Crucial " " prevention 
Every day, in Italy, one counts 2.500 accidents of work, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain invalid in a permanent way. 
In 2007, the Inails data confirm indeed, that the white deaths were about 1.200. 
Of the numbers that reveal the gravity of the phenomenon that remains one of the main reasons of death, and provoke two times nearly more death than the homicides. 
To have the attention the institutions, the social strengths and the means of information on this dramatic aspect, the famous Anmil today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th national Day of the victims of accidents on work, institutionalized the second Sunday of October. 
" The troubling data distributed by the Anmil, as well as the tragic évènements of these last days, confirm the importance of the topic of the prevention on the workplace ", affirm the president of Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, at the time of a message sent to the president of the Anmil, national Association of mutilated them and invalid of work, Pietro Mercandelli. 
The chief of state expresses his " sincere appreciation for the associative continuous effort in favor of the prevention on the workplaces, the damaged worker protection, the aid to the families of the victims and the sensitization of the public " opinion 
" naturally indignant, everybody hit the fist to put a term to such tragedies that, of by their dimension, cause the clamor of the media and the involvement of the public opinion, even though the daily reality presents us some dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics. 
Napolitano doesn't hide that "il has a problem of resources there certainly: he/it is essential to invest in the formation and information " 
The numerous initiatives promues in the school sector, assume an importance all particular for a more direct conscience hold on behalf of the young that enter in the world of work. 
He/it is not of our duty, to maintain the attention towards this phenomenon, under to value the alarm on the social gravity, to apply and to improve the legislative norms. 
On his/her/its side, the president of the Room Gianfranco Fini underlined to the how much " this white death phenomenon constitutes an absolute social emergency, that insults the conscience of each of us, and impose to all institutions, to make a concrete effort aiming to put an end there quickly ". 
The data of the casualties on work seem to signal a light positive tendency, but it doesn't prevent that the number of white deaths is nevertheless impressive " underlined the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli subsequently. 
" we don't wish that this " tendency is translated at a discount " in fact, in a minor attention, because it is exactly when the attention relaxes, that happens to the tragedy. 
" we believe that in general, one doesn't make enough to contrast the phenomenon of the accidents and the contrast can be done thanks to multiple actions ". 
«According to us - underlined Mercandelli - more of controls and inspections are necessary, all as a more important intervention on the formation of the workers, and this, since the school ". 
- He/it added - " that it is necessary to make an effort again with regard to the communication and the sensitization of the public opinion. 
" But it is especially necessary, a bigger sense of the responsibilities on behalf of the employers facing a phenomenon that represents a social " emergency. 
«Mercandelli denounced " the progressive deterioration of the back-up conditions of the indemnity planned for the victims of work " and the " drift of aid toward which the system moves these last years " then. 
«The objective therefore, is to give back to the worker the guarantee of insurance? he/it has added - so that the destiny of the one that has an accident, must not depend on the spontanéisme or the legislator's " widening 
Reader Mp3 pointed of the finger, they put to risk the audition. 
To listen to music to full volume during one prolonged period using portable musical devices as readers Mp3, can cause permanent lesions to the audition. 
There is what the European Commission announces, that, in a communiqué distributed in Brussels, mention the opinion of the scientific Committee, on the unforeseen sanitary risks and identified lately (Csrseri) of the EU, published today. 
" of this scientific report - read ourselves in the note - he/it comes out again that 5-10% of those that, during one period of at least 5 years, listen to music to full volume using portable musical devices, during more of one hour per day and per week, risk a permanent loss of the auditory capacity.» 
" I am worried because a number as important of youngsters who frequently use the portable musical devices and the mobile telephones to full volume, can damage their audition in an irreparable " way unconsciously affirms Meglena Kuneva. 
" According to the scientific data - pursues the responsible Ue - it is about a clear risk and we must react quickly. 
What counts the more is to sensitize the consumers and to return these information of public domain. 
We must reexamine besides, the systems of control exist seen the scientific opinion, so that they are completely efficient and can follow the new technologies " 
Brussels asked the independent scientific Committee, to examine the problem, seen the intensive portable musical device use and the increase of the number of young expositions to the noise that these generate. 
" The scientists concluded the ministerial Ue - confirm that there are good reasons to worry, and that the European Commission will now examine with the member states and the other parts persons concerned, what measures could possibly be adopted to protect the children and the teenagers, against the exhibition to the noise coming from portable musical devices and similar devices, better. 
An European norm of safety that limits the level of noise of the portable musical devices to 100Db already exists, but the concern increases as for the auditory damages that could drift of an excessive exhibition in such sources of noise. 
It is possible to really limit these data making resort to solutions as the reduction of the levels and the length of exhibition to the noise. 
The Committee scientific Ue makes notice that the users of portable musical devices, who listen to music to full volume (more than 89 decibels) during 5 hours per week, pass the limits currently in force relative to the maximum noise level agreed on the workplace. 
Those that listen to music in such conditions during prolonged periods, risk a permanent loss of the auditory capacity after 5 years. 
It interests 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified around 2,5 and 10 millions people in the U.E. 
Rome, Alemanno gave the order to make leave the Commission for the future of the capital. 
Today we begin, in March we finish, in June we will pull the sums. 
There is the calendar fixed by the Capitol for the works of the " Commission for the future of Rome Capitale ", that took places this morning, to the new seat, behind the Thermal baths of Caracalla. 
In six months, president Antonio Marzano and the 49 other components of the Commission will finalize instructions for Rome. 
In March when they will have finished, the Committee and the local Council will value the analyses and the projects, in order to present in June, the strategic Plan for Rome with official " le"timbre of the Capitol and his/her/its mayor Gianni Alemanno. 
" The commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented there - holds to underline Alemanno - it should propose ideas of development of Rome of which will be able to use the political décisionnaires, that remains the Committee and the local Council. 
No superposition of roles, but solely the will to have a corner where to elaborate a big project for Rome. 
In March, she/it will have finished her/its tasks and will have disappeared then, because this experience must have a temporal length specifies. 
In June the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan descended of work achieved by the Commission for the future of Rome Capitale. " 
For those that accuse the Commission of being useless, since his/her/its opinions won't be coercive, Alemanno retorts ": All depends the work that the Commission will be capable to make, as well as of the quality of his/her/its propositions. 
If the quality is there, as in France thanks to the Commission Attali, as besides in Rome, I am some on, his/her/its contribution will be fundamental. 
Too often the politics is overwhelmed by the management of the daily and emergencies that appears from time to time. 
Us, on the contrary, we want to see the before, and farther, toward a deeper forecasting, working seriously to the development of Rome and his/her/its future ". 
Besides, the mayor of Rome is anxious to underline that " this Commission is neither an useless organism nor a bureaucratic whole: she/it is absolutely free, and won't cost an euro to the Roman city-dwellers, and will serve to study and to make participate the best intelligences that express the Capital. 
For Alemanno, indeed, a strategic, nor firm nor immobile reference draft, in order to allow our city, needs to improve, that of which she/it absolutely has need, while now thinking about his/her/its future an unit mind. 
One future that, specify the mayor of Rome, won't limit itself to the usual local borders, but that will watch farther» not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and of his/her/its legal statute of Capital, but " also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean ". 
Obama? The first anti - American president. Here is why. 
A famous American politician who is anxious to pass for independent, wrote: " Barack Obama will be the second anti - American president. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, that, of part his/her/its decisions, destroyed the economy USED and had some reports (as besides he/it always has today, as private citizen) with the hostile Islam ". 
The attacks against Obama increase whereas the date of the elections comes closer. 
A lady of Miami wrote on a site web: " this person is full of ambition ". 
Obama is covered indeed: he/it believes that he/it will win the highest function of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black " senators! 
Actually, it is about attacks that don't much say; these are evidently attacks of racial nature, and don't answer to the question of all voters: will he/it be a good president? We have besides the polls, that declare all that Obama will win and with a good advantage. 
In this case, it is again about someone that speaks with the c?ur and no with the brain. 
A newspaper of the Mississipi, in innards of the south of the United States, wrote an article: once in the cabin of vote, we know well to that the American patriot will give her vote. 
Here is that emerges an aspect of the American mentality maintained secret until the end. 
" So-called that that you want, we will even see ourselves putting the cross, on Obama or on McCain. 
There are even the people who swear: so Obama wins, we will leave from the States Unis. 
Things ever revealed until now, to such point that the success of the black candidate seems nearly certain. 
Anyway, in spite of all these reasonings, the winning card for the democrats is George Bush. 
One asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes committed by Bush during his/her/its mandate? 89 percent answered: Iraq. 
America changes. 
To Vietnam, this nation lost 50 miles soldiers and was sent back at home with foot to the buttocks. 
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost life, and the American have not been forced to make the suitcases. 
In spite of it, Iraq was, for most, the point of weakness of Bush. 
Who will take the place of George W will have an enormous stain to accomplish. 
Wears out, the economic debacle makes itself feel even among the journalists: in the press, it is the hour of the suppressions. And many accuse Internet, this " murderous " of the paper newspaper. 
Five hundred American journalists have been challenged by the PEW Research Center about the statute of their profession and mental control for the future. 
And well, all journalists are nearly today pessimistic as for their future. 
However, they didn't overtly declare to the attachés of information, to feel less worriers about the credibility. 
They don't feel isolated like once. 
The American journalist problem, it is money, the money. 
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model. 
Besides, the suppressions done in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to the assembly of the newspapers, are a thick problem. 
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the interviewed journalists, if one wishes that the traditional journalism as the big public hears it, cuts down in a consequent way. 
An obvious but complex pessimism invades the American journalism. 
Six on ten ministerial seniors and journalists of printing newspapers are convinced that the journalism to the national level is following a bad path. 
Locally, the ministerial group is to 65%. 
Publication printed against broadcast. 
The journalists don't have a seeing where goes the web. 
The biggest houses éditrices paves themselves a passage toward Internet, discerned by many as " the assassin " of the paper newspaper. 
The " economic " pressure that the journalists feel is increased until 79%. 
The 500 journalists interviewees admitted to get to the technology hoping that she/it " makes something good " for their journalism. 
Today, the biggest tear in the American journalism resides between that direct the newsrooms - that means the directors - and the reporters who work for them. 
56% of the directors to the national level, are convinced that the reporters share their values, whereas au local level, this percentage descends to 23%. 
For some, it is bound to the " safety of work ". 
The directors who think to lose their station of work in the space of 3 years, are from 47% to the national level. 
With regard to the journalists, one goes to 30%. 
The one of the " sure " work to the level staff (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda. 
Only 13% of the journalists work under contract. 
In an immense nation as Used them, with 300 millions inhabitants and the thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and Internet, the employers often offer what they want, and it becomes quickly a question to take or to let. 
The directors almost always receive thick wage, whereas the editor can win 10mille dollars per month, besides the retirement and the payment of the insurances. 
As for vacations, the logic becomes complicate: x days after the first year, x days after the third, until 15 days in all, passed a certain number of years. 
But, according to their revelations, the American journalists, are often " sick " during the year. 
It is the mistake of the climate. 
UNIPOL:TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA RESTE IN GROTTAFERRATA. 
The president of the second penal section of the courthouse of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the realtor's process, Danilo Coppola, that had asked to be able to leave his/her/its city, Grottaferrata, for a dwelling in Rome. 
. Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in the setting of the relative instruction in the Unipol-Bnl climbing. 
At the time of the suit to his/her/its load, last week, he/it had gotten the setting in domiciliary liberty transformed in obligatory residence in Grottaferrata. 
His/her/its lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorellas, had asked that the realtor can browse the journey of the province city in a dwelling in the capital. 
According to the courthouse, of such displacements (that the pm didn't grant) would permit him to influence his/her/its society and to have access to the proofs that accuse it. 
The elites in danger. 
The phenomenon had already appeared a few days ago, with the vote of the house of representatives, contrary to the plan of lifesaving of 700 billions of dollars approved by the White House,: a good meaningful number of American was, and the East again, more interested to punish Wall Street that to save the American economy. 
And it is well the New York Times of yesterday that confirm it to us communicating that the present crisis divides the republican Party, even more shared between his/her/its vigil soul East Coast, moderate, favorable to the federal institutions as well as to the business community, and his/her/its new soul, on the contrary, curator, hostile to " those of Washington " and to the world of the finance, powerful especially in the States of the Center and the South. 
The soul, exactly, that is made itself feel despotic way with the vote of which I spoke you in the beginning. 
However what has just been mentioned is only an example of the changes, of the big changes that the economic earthquake in progress préannonce or let run already: not only to the States Unis, but in all the west, and can be not only that here. 
To the States Unis like in Europe, the crisis seems to make accelerate the phenomena sat on since some times, to such point that, in the new climate, they solidify and are revealed. 
The first of these phenomena is the réactualisation, the extraordinary raise, of the double State category - sovereign, in relation to a way of renationalisation of the economy. 
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of financial banking institutions that has, evidently of narrow reports with the stranger, but that, above all, are implied on a big scale, the balances of people and families that live in only one Country, in only one State. 
It immediately creates a political problem for that governs it: that is to say as to answer the difficulties and the protests of people and families that are besides an electorate. 
In brief, the crisis appears economically world but politically, it is nearly only here national. 
The political internationalization seems indeed offside or, doesn't much have to say: the obvious proof is provided us by the European union that, shared as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, don't manage to decide no line common politics. 
And so, it is the government of every State that all wait interventions, of the plans of lifesaving and raise, of the new rules, and especially an affection of credits: when one crosses a difficult period, there are only the States that possess the economic resources, the financial resource mass capable to try to put back the things in place. 
They also possess the necessary means and recognition to use them: two resources of an inestimable value, of the elements of which no market nor international organization won't ever have an analogous way. 
This new pomposity of the crisis nation-state is always the rest in perfect harmony with the importance major that the more recent economic developments of the economy offer to assign to a factor enough bound to this element: territoriality. 
. Paradoxically, indeed, whereas we were convinced to have entered henceforth in kingdom of the network, of the technology always more sophisticated, of the non material, convinced that the globalized finance was destined to dominate the world henceforth, we made account of a stroke of one only, that our future should adjust its accounts on the contrary always more with the rather little material things as water, the harvests, oil. 
Of the things that can certainly be transported of a place to another of the earth, but that are bound in an absolute way in a space circumscribes, to a territory. 
Thus, that is sovereign, certainly possess more cards than the one that is not, that wants to say, the one that has the misfortune to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water. 
I now arrive to the second novelty that foresees a fracture however. 
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably said Politics, and therefore Leadership. 
To this consideration, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena. 
Of a quoted, the conscience of the objective need of leadership authoritative, the research of a no one that knows how to take in hand the situation. 
Of the other quoted, a wave of discredit for leadership exists, economic species that proved to be inadequate and full of shade zone. 
And besides, something of even deeper, in a certain sense, even troubling: a discredit, a suffering, a picture of unsuitability, a feeling of remoteness that has the tendency to imply the whole class of the directors in an increasing number of Country of the west. 
So increases more again the various class conviction, before the actions are the same social elite ideas until now to their apogee, their way to listen and to be, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be always more foreign to the opinions of the majorities. 
in brief, The demand of leadership, nourish underground way, a powerful and branched out movement of délégitimassions of the controlling classes and the traditional political orders, that appears in the " scratch electoral revolts " or, in the changes of collective moods of these last all last time, from the conservative ascension in Austria Bavaria, to the fall of the labor party members in Big Brittany, to the American participant at a congress rebellion against Bush (and he/it would be able to good that the victory of the right in Italy didn't arrive by chance). 
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, would say someone, always have more difficulty, what doesn't date of today, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of the Western societies, and that the economic crisis reinforces, increase and agitate excessive way potentially. 
To the view of all it, to speak of a present " rebellion of the masses " on the agenda, seems exaggerated honestly. 
But one says well, to keep the eyes wide open, it is not without reason. 
The supercolle to walk on the walls. 
To defeat the laws of the gravity thanks to a terrific glue and, in the future, to walk on the partitions as Spiderman. 
There is the objective of American various centers of research, and today, a team of four institutes has there nearly succeeds. 
With an adhesive measured 2,5 square centimeters hardly, the researchers succeeded in maintaining glued a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical partition. 
The SURVEY - The magazine American Science published the discoveries of some researchers of the university of Dayton, of Akron, of the Georgia Institute Technology of and air Forces Research Laboratory. 
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those that we know that a particular structure of the carbon uses, named nano tubes of carbon. 
" The principle of glue can be imagined like a set of disposed tubes like a battery of spaghetti ". Explain Zhong Linen Wang of the Georgia Institute Technology of of Atlanta. 
The scientists were inspired by the paws of the geckos, covered of microscopic hairs that permit to assure to the animal, a perfect adherent. 
The tests done on various materials, as the glass, the Teflon, and the paper of glass, demonstrated that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the paws of these reptiles, and at the same time, that him «detaches itself easily of the partition " explains Liming Dai, searcher of the faculty of engineering of the university of Dayton. 
TO WALK ON THE WALLS? ? this material could be used like adhesive temporary " adds Liming Dai. 
Can be to walk on the partitions as Spiderman? Can be that yes, but the researchers think a lot about an use less fascinating as the connection between the electronic devices, since the nano tubes of carbon are drivers of heat and electric current. 
Other applications could concern the aerospace engineering. 
For the meantime, not of terrific hero. 
The OTHER RESEARCH - The university of Berkeley, in California, devotes itself it also, in search of a new adhesive. 
In an article of the magazine American American Chemical Society, the Californian researchers presented an adhesive formed of microfibres as hairs, that himself auto cleans some dusts during the movement on a surface to guarantee a perfect and constant adhesion. 
Medicines: ever with juices of fruits. 
Attention to the juice of grapefruit, orange and apple. 
These drinks, especially consumed the summer because refreshing and rich in vitamins, if associated to some vital medicines, alter the absorbement amplifying of it or decreasing according to the cases, their efficiency, with consequences even serious for health. 
David Nailey, professor to the University of Western Ontario London in, recall the risks of the juices of fruits that they are, either limp some cool, if associated to the ingestion of some medicines; during the 236th national rally of the American Chemical Society in progress in Philadelphia, he/it throws a new alarms: one glass of juice of grapefruit, orange and apples, to reduce the absorbement of some vital medicines, annulling their beneficial effects is sufficient and putting to risk the health of the patients. 
The juice of grapefruit was already greatly criticized retained bus responsible for to increase the effects of some medicines anti arythmiques, antibiotics, anxiolytiques, anti staminales and neurological, until poisonous levels. 
MEDICINES TO RISK - It is the Italian agency of the medicine her even, that had given the news in a news-bulletin dated of two years, alerting the physicians and patient to not under to value the danger drifting of this mix and to pay attention to what one drinks, if one takes some medicines as for example, the Diazépam or the Méthadone. 
NOT THAT THE GRAPEFRUIT - According to the experts, even the orange juice and of apple contains the substances that inhibit the medicines. 
Long is the active principle list inhibited by the grapefruit and the other juices. 
Of there, the call of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology of the Public university of Milan,: " these discoveries are in general, immediately signalled to the various national and international agencies of medicines that will have to if need be, to change the informative notes of the medicines. 
He/it always agrees to read the illustrative papers of the medicines that one takes, and, if something is not clear, not to make itself/themselves impress, but to apply clearly to the physician or to the pharmacist " underlined the expert in the Ansa agency. 
The Nobel of the economy in Paul Krugman. 
The Nobel prize of the economy has been assigned to the American Paul Krugman for his/her/its research on the models of trade and on the economic activity localization. 
Krugman, 55 years, is a neo - keynesian that teaches to the university of Princeton and he is besides a famous editor of the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the biggest critical of the solutions in economy and foreign politics of the Bush administration. 
Some months after the attempts of September 2001, during the days of the bankruptcy of Enron, Krugman had written, in an article published on the New York Times, that the second évènement would have been more determinant that the first, in term of consequences on the history of the United States. 
A forecasting that unleashed numerous polemics, and that was reproached to the economist during years, but that was revealed now exact. 
" I am surprised and even a shocked little of the speed with which the memory of the scandals as the downfall of Enron or Worldcom, disappeared of the attention of the public " had declared Krugman at the end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the ministerial committee of the European central Bank, Krugman is a " economist of big value ", but also a divulger to the very aggressive style ", particularly critical towards the excesses of the liberalism of the Bush administration. 
Open Office, there is the third edition of the packet " anti - Microsoft " 
It is the day of the diffusion of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the continuation open source of personal productivity that aims to touch always and again more of users, of the house to the office, of the professionals to the public administration, proposing a free alternative in the most famous Microsoft Office. 
Following a work of nearly one year, achieved by voluntary developers, supervised by SUN Microsystem, the new packet Open Office, appears to the big public with various novelties: of the screen of welcome, and the reviewed interface and become less austere, to more important others, as compatibility been born for the system operative Apple Mac SKILLED WORKER X, and the support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the last version ISO standard. 
Open Office made particularly attention to the interaction with the continuation Office 2007, and it is indeed possible to open the documents with the new extension of Microsoft (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.) 
As interesting, some specific functions to some modules, as the one that permits to reduce the measurements of the PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by electronic mail, or to import of spins them PDF in the graphic development module, preserving the original aspect of the page. 
Still on this forehead, it is possible to create some documents " hybrid " PDFS that unite the diagram typical of the Adobe format to the elements of a leaf of calculation or a élaborateur of text. 
The collaboration between several people is an element that had various improvements inside the applications: in the leaf of calculation, various users can intervene, avoiding the conflicts on the modifications, in the development of texts, bus to every collaborator is assigned a color of commentaries for a better recognition in phase of revision. 
Some societies are even working to bring some functions of OpenOffice on the Web (one the cloud, on the cloud), and in the next weeks, they should give out the definitive result. 
The Italian version is déchargeable to the http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet address and be added to the English version that was on the mirror since Friday. 
Besides to Windows and Mac SKILLED WORKER, the continuation is as usual available besides, for the system operative Linux. 
On demand, the cd of installation can be sent at home or on the workplace. 
And if the theme of the exemption from payment can be a means to distribute it in the houses, it is exactly in the business, that Open Office the continuation tempts the big challenge, can already count on various projects achieved in the public administration and the schools. 
Without counting the realities that offer a service of formation, consultation and of aid, ideal for the small and middle enterprises, that could open up besides toward prospective of business. 
Open Office is composed of five main modules: Writer, for the video writing equivalent of Word; Calc, is the leaf of calculation that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the presentations rival of PowerPoint ;Dbase, such the famous Access, is the program that permits to work on the databases; finally Drwa is the graphic module. 
Objective for 2008, to arrive to 5 millions download, and preamble that today one nearly counts 3 millions and 600 miles, he/it is likely that with the exit of the new version, one can even pass the foreseen number 
Kohl also, is positive, it is the fourth case of doping. 
New case of positivity to the last Tour of France: it is about the Austrian of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the vest of the best climber. 
It is the site of the daily equipped It that returns the news. 
To 26ans, Kohl is the fourth positive bicyclist in the Cera, the Epo of third generation, after the Italian Riccardo Riccòs and Leonardo Piepolis, and the German Stefan Schumacher, them also of Gerolsteiner. 
The blood analyses done on Kohl's test-tubes are part of those achieved these last weeks, by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabries. 
If the against analyses confirm positivity to the Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place to the Tour and will have to forcing to discount two years of elimination. 
The news of Kohl's positivity to the Epo of third generation, has been confirmed by the chief of the French agency anti doping, Pierre Bordry, that communicated in the Press Associated, to have notified positivity to the Austrian authorities. 
The Austrian of 26ans stood on the rostrum behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, stealing the vest thus to pea of the best climber. 
IMMIGRES:NEW YORK TIMES DEMANDE IF THE ITALIE IS RACIST? 
Italy " as Country of emigrants turned lately into a destination privileged for the immigrants " welcomed with reticence. 
Would it transform the Beautiful country in a nation of racists? Here is on what himself intéroge the New York Times that dedicated a long article debating the theme of racism in Italy, leaving from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, original of Burkina, killed last month in Milan, to have flown a limps of cookies. 
This case puts in evidence what the New York Times define as the " paradox of the north ": the Nordic regions are at a time those where one records " more of integration and more of work ", but also " a feeling strongest anti - immigrants of the country and most important support to the Lega Nord " 
To confirm the increasing tension between Italian and immigrant, the NYT made as reference to the episodes of intolerance of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Mansion Volturno. 
not only. 
Even the new legislature wanted by the Lega to pull up immigration and to facilitate the extrusion of the clandestine, is mentioned like proof of the climate change in Italy. 
Tendency underlined by the Pope as well as by the president of Republic: " Giorgio Napolitano at the time of his/her/its meeting with Benoît XVI in the Quirinal, asked what the state and the church work together to defeat racism ". 
Expensive rent students victims, until 900 euros for a room. 
The market of the renting for students doesn't know a crisis 
According to the last investigation of the Sunia, the union of the tenants, to rent a simple room can cost to a student, until 900 euro in Milan, 700 to Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome. 
" The phenomenon reached very serious aspects henceforth to the point to exclude whole categories of youngsters, of the right to the survey because of the very elevated global costs that the families of source must sustain - explains the person responsible of the office of study of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities, the strong demand on behalf of the students distorted the market that a process of increase generalized is himself amorcémême for the residents so. 
In most cases, the offers of renting include besides a set of violations: contracts of free type, non recorded, without limit of rent, subleases. 
For the Sunia, of the extraordinary interventions through the intermediary of the revision of the fiscal imposition, are necessary to calm the prices. 
Reading in detail him investigates, we see that Milan, for a bed in the Brianza zone, is necessary about 450 euros; for a simple room, one goes from 650 euros minimum (zone Bandages Nere), to a middle value of 800 (Lambiate zone, Udine, and will Trust) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria zone) 
To Florence, a bed costs on average, 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros. 
In Bologna, where the students concentrate in the zones near of the university, 250/280 euros are necessary for a bed in a double, and of 370 to 500 for a simple room. 
In Rome, in the zones near of the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), one asks about 600 euros for a simple, 450 for a bed in a double. 
Slightly lower values (550 euro for a simple) for the zones near of the other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà). 
One can only save if one moves away in the zones périphériques:300 euro for a bed, and 450 for a simple in the zone Predestined, Centocelle or similar. 
In Naples, for a bed 300/400 euros, for a simple, are necessary one spends 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the Policlinicos zones, Vomero, and Colli Aminei. 
Bari, for bed, is necessary to count 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a simple. 
In the smaller cities, the prices are lower in absolute term, but they have a major importance in the economy townswoman. 
Finally, the cities as Perugia, in which the renting are often taken by students extra communal, one records an ulterior anomaly: the rent asked the foreign students is raised of 25/30% in relation to the one applied to the Italian. 
Adieu old Paradiso movies, the cities scrape the historic rooms. 
The rooms of movies historic ferment in favor of the Multiplexes. 
" A city without rooms of movies is a blind city, it is like a face without eyes " 
The picture offered by producer Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrate what he/it happens in the big centers urban Italian well, but also in the cities of province, 
The process of marginalization of the movies, with the birth in periphery of the big multisalles, and the death of consumption of the mono rooms in the central zones of the cities, is one of the major évènements that appears us ineluctable and incontestable; he/it has in more all features of a true cultural crime. 
To disappear, these are often historic and loaded places of memory, " it is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone that one knows, with which we shared a tip of path and so many emotions " observes the producer of the Nuovo Paradiso movies, movie that offers Tornatore him there 20 years, the first Oscar as well as the Big Price of the jurywoman of Cannes, and that told the poetry of a province room, and the nostalgia of a way of life the movies, lost can be forever. 
The numbers provided by Anec, the main association of the tradesmen, want all to say: these last five years, 316 movies of traditional type closed, and these are the main city rooms that especially paid expenses of it: 10 of less to Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in less in Turin, 5 in Palermo. 
Among the regions the more touched by closing, the Emilia Romaine is in head with 82 movies lost mono rooms, consistent by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41). 
The proof that confirms t that the first person responsible of their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because these are well the three Italian regions that recorded the more of new movies multisalles: 195 screens in more in Lombardy these last five years, 81 in Tuscany as in Emilia - Romagne. 
" The Italian exploitation developed itself in an irrational " way observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, " it is useful to construct new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee the survival of those that already exists all the same, bus when a firm room in a city, these fréquenteurs is not necessarily all disposed to go to the multiplexes. 
Without speaking of the deliberation missed of the credit in favor of the tradesmen: the debt antécédente of the state is of about 10 millions euros. 
He/it is ashamed that, of a point of view étique and state of mind, the Government doesn't respect the existing laws. 
To sustain the sector, it would be necessary between 16 and 18 millions euros per year. 
Let's note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worry these closings, decided to solve the situation thanks to the signature of a protocol between Town hall and Anec, the first of this kind in Italy, to defend and to promote the movies mono historic center rooms and in periphery. 
Among the normative foreseen, there are fiscal easiness measures in favor of the managers and advantages for the public in term of mobility: the spectators will be able to enter in the zone to limited circulation, and will have special tariffs for the parkings and in some parking lots. 
" It is an initiative that pleases " me observes Giuseppe Tornatore " and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna putting other measures in place. 
He/it is however obvious that, to contrast the terrific power of the multiplexes, the traditional rooms must also improve the quality of the sound and the picture, because today's public is more require. 
The defense of the traditional movies is a theme that for me, was always important: the closing of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, were the spark that convinced me to make " New Paradiso " movies to which I already thought since 10ans. 
I live in Rome since 25 years, and when I pass before the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, henceforth closed, where I lived shared emotions so much, I turn of the other quoted not to see the panels blackened by the dust. 
Ties between politics and ?ndrangheta, decree mayor of Gioia Tauro. 
«The mayor of Gioia Tauro was prepared to standardize the choices of the Town hall to the interests of the Piromalli " clan. 
heavy accusations are thrown by the magistrates of the Direction antimafia of Calabria, towards the mayor and the vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, stopped this morning for external contest for association mafieuse. 
The handles also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his/her/its small sons lawyer, homonym of the boss, already condemned for association of malefactors of type mafieuse, as well as to pay for 10 millions of euros. 
" an affront towards the normative legal and moral, and especially of the common sense " write the district attorneys, the two local administrations had expressed will to pay for the consultations to Mr. Piromalli. 
" So one would have been granted to the - Écrivent clan the judges - to enter officially inside the town halls facilitating the possibilities, already considerable, of control and orientement of the public " administration 
The president of the committee regional Calabrian Agazio Loiero, don't hide that of collusions between the local committees and criminality organized, there are more of one " of them in his/her/its region: there are the places where the intensity mafieuse is stronger than in others, where collusion is nearly unavoidable. 
But there are also a lot of politicians who resist the pressures of the ndrangheta, of the heroes who are honest ", 
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, continuation to which the police announced to have decapitated the Piromalli clan. 
Since the end last April, the local advice of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and always because of presumed conditionings between the organized criminality and the local administration, the local politicians had been unloaded of their function to manage the City. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been named chief of a center right coalition, after the ballot of May 2006. 
He/it shouted to the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the local advice. 
He/it accused the vice secretary of the interior at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing it of having plotted the all for a political question, but seen the demand of incarceration signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan even had succeeds to ask for the variation of the project of the A3. 
Leaving from the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the pm writes, is emerged " the availability to get married the requirements of a business man, representing a more known group, close to the Piromallis, standardizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan. 
When the energy is born of the waves, now the big rushes. 
There is an excessive layer that occupies more than 70% of the surface of the planet and now the big world companies of energy are discovering it. 
Waves, currents, tides, has the new renewable sources on which of the giants as Rafter put the eyes, and now essayent to put the hand there. 
The possibility to get the energy from the movements of the sea is studied since henceforth hundred years, and in the years 70, in concomitance with the first oil crisis, the research intensified. 
When the price of oil lowered, toward 1980, the idea to exploit the navy energy was put of side, but now the processes environmentalists and the new increase of oil give a big flight to the sector 
The World Energy Council (WEC) London estimated in 2007, that 15% of the world need in electricity could be covered by operating systems of the surge of the seas. 
This quantity would be the duplicate of the one that produce the nuclear power stations. 
And in addition, there would be the currents and the tides.. 
Giants to the attack. 
The first undertaken to bet on the navy energy was the Enersis, that in 2005, has siglé an agreement to construct an installation in the North of Portugal. 
When the understanding was announced, one would have said a true revolutionary step. 
At two years of it, always more of candidates among these vowed enterprises since always to the traditional energy bet on the navy energy. 
" Rafter studies the technologies currently on the oceanic energy - declared the spokesman of a company associated to the American oil giant, to the daily economic Wall Street Newspaper - and it values the possibilities to cooperate with us ". 
Cooperation in question, concern the obtaining of a permit deliberated by the American commission for the energy, necessary to lead to a project of exploitation of the navy energy in Alaska. 
There is a very interesting signal, especially if one considers than exactly in Alaska, Used them continue to extract oil, and lately president Bush put a project in place for new excavations 
Besides to Rafter, there is Verdant Power Inc. Of New York and Ocean Power of the New Jersey, that browse the way of the energy coming from the sea, and the are invested until today, although their details are known, indicate according to the observers, an increasing interest. 
Tecnologie to finalize. 
The experts speak again of a technology to his/her/its beginnings, of part the fact that the navy energy doesn't dissipate the fears towards the impact environmentalist. 
On present hour, the systems as those of Portugal, or some in Scotland, are of small dimension, and don't seem to create thick problem to the ecosystem. 
To produce the on a big scale energy, however, it is necessary to use some technologies with an impact superior environmentalist. 
" And the choices are various: Power ocean, for example, use a bound buoy system the some to the other. 
The thrust of the waves, that makes move the muds upwards and the low, is converted in a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats. 
The pressure has a turbine turned that on his/her/its turn, nourish a generator. 
The energy is sent to the strand through cables coins sailors. 
For the meantime, we have four systems of this kind in phase of project, in the waiting of an unique federal approval and a part of the energy could serve to a military installation. 
Verdant Power, on the contrary, product already of the energy for a shopping mall and a parking lot using six turbines coins marines of the East to Clinch New York. 
The movement of water at the time of the tides, made turn the blades of the turbines, creating a rotational movement that nourishes a generator. 
Verdant announced to have a long list of in waiting customers of the necessary authorizations to draw the energy. 
After the waves, the tides. 
A particular interest, they say to the institute for the research of the electric energy, merit at the moment, the potential of the tides. 
Although it was about an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more foreseeable of wind, the sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as source of energy. 
And it is exactly on the energy of the tides that of the states like New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, watch toward the coasts, invested 7 millions and half of dollars in 2008 and foresees some investments until 35 millions in 2009.
