No liberating for Tymoshenko by Parliament 
The Ukrainian parliament today refused the request, in the context of a revision of the Penal Code to abolish those sections on the basis of the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been sentenced. 
The new rules, which could have lead to the liberation of the imprisoned Expremierministerin members rejected during the second reading of the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes. 
Timoshenko was in October because of the conclusion of a supposed agreement with Russia on the purchase of gas was sentenced to seven years in prison. 
The verdict is not yet legally binding, in December, the appeal of the accused is to be negotiated before the courts. 
Timoshenko himself described the verdict as political revenge by the regime, and also in the West the process raises the suspicion of bias of the court. 
The request, paragraph 365, on the basis of which Expremierministerin was sentenced to remove from the penal code, which was backed by 147 members. 
226 votes would have been required for its adoption. 
Libyscher victory 
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion has been their losers. 
Muammar Qaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert, and without him the war is over. 
Now it is only to define the winner. 
As the region usually win in the elections Islamists, the question is just what the moderate or radical. 
The National Transitional Council committed itself to the common law of the host ' (a), of which it is now God has a certain idea. 
Libya would become a country without crime, because hackt for theft in the hand. 
Women should also be concerned about emancipation forgotten as soon as possible, possibly abtrünnige to be executed, and so forth. 
Instead of a single dictator, the society will mutually opposed future united by the Koran. 
In short, in Libya an order will prevail over here barely conceivable and, above all, is hardly desirable. 
Only, our lifestyle is not the only and objectively, is probably not the best and would hardly fit the aforementioned Libyans ." 
In this respect, it is rather surprising that the Muslim fighters of the infidel dogs could help. 
Her apology may only serve the fact that the NATO air strikes are not by any General from America, but were themselves guided by Allah, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hits. 
The victor in Libya and the West is not to do so. 
We only took part in a shooting that served the interests of Islam and our politicians sought in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any advantage. 
After the fresh and bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we prefer a military occupation of Libya. 
As a result, the Hiesiges is a concern - namely the expulsion of the crusaders. 
Will the oil companies but also without occupation the black gold at a bargain price? 
Hardly, and so can the West once and for all its altruism with the right to boast in terms of protection of human rights. 
If they do not spoil the band ' a-Vertreter.

Iranian students are ready to die for the nuclear program of their own country. 
They formed a human shield. 
Several hundred university students formed a human shield around a core chip in Iran. 
With this gesture, they wanted their support for the nuclear program of their own country to demonstrate against a possible Israeli attack.

The menu of a süchtigen child: it is not frühstückt and eats supper sausage 
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have problems with obesity, with 9 per cent of all pupils and 5 per cent of all children are overweight. 
Recent surveys have shown - obese children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyles. 
This shows once again how important for the healthy development of a human being is the environment in which he or she and the examples are surrounded. 
The tables are adipöser children sausages were up to 50% more likely on the table than in families in which important children live. 
More than 19 percent of the obese children had on the eve of the education campaign under the slogan "obesity is not a coincidence" chips for dinner. 
In families with sport is not exactly the favorite, but it also affects the majority of today's students, only 15 percent replied that their parents at least once in the week found time for active movement. 
Survey of 900 children 
The survey took place last year at the end of the school year, nearly 900 children from primary schools throughout the Czech Republic. 
This was the second year of action "obesity is not a coincidence," the general health insurance company and the company Unilever will be supported. 
So far, the project is more than 12 thousand pupils from 4th and 8th classes. 
Other unhealthy diet and lack of movement in the family are key factors for the rising number of children with overweight or even obesity are responsible. 
"Only half of the surveyed children, for example, five times a day, the modus zweites frühstück Frühstück-Mittagessen-Vesper-Abendbrot - one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet," is one of the polls. 
No breakfast and sausage for dinner 
Experts point out that even relatively minor matters, such as the regular breakfast time of the family are important for the healthy development of a child. 
In the Czech Republic but only 23 percent of the families of the pupils. 
And, in most families, everyone frühstückt for themselves. 
The worst was the fact that every tenth family is not gefrühstückt at all. 
The breakfast is a cornerstone of a healthy daily diet. 
The survey test, among other things, to the day that the families with obese children much more often unhealthy chips consumed. 
And almost everyone - regardless of weight, drink every day sweet soft drinks (70%) 
Although more than 40 per cent of children surveyed sport, but only less than half of their parents do that - which is only 15 per cent. 
Just do your own menu 
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and girls from 13 schools), offered opportunities for appetite and opinion to compile their own menu. 
"As far as Czech children between 12 and 15 in terms of nutrition, is a far cry from the ideal of a healthy diet. 
Among their favorite speises were many speises meal, meat courts and natural sweeteners. 
"What is alarming is above all the great popularity of sweet soft drinks," will be highlighted in the final report on the survey. 
At lunch, the main court, triumphed pasta just before poultry. 
Pulses, the children almost never liked, and the popularity of fish and vegetables as lunch was very low. 
Hinkehr health 
At the same time, the survey also showed that the children are very willing to change their eating habits, if they get accurate information. 
"In the control group of the survey involved the questionnaire after completion of the educational presentation" obesity is not a coincidence, "filling out, was a significant shift of preferences in many cases to principles of healthy eating," is included in the results of the project. 
This was an example of the sweet Limos, where many children began to give the priority ordinary water. 
The US military in the questionnaire is also much more chicken or fish as a main course of the day and were ready to eat less Knödel or sweet foods. 
Experts say - a Stylist must also be a good psychologist 
In the introductory article about how Stylisten learn, I had a little bit of gemeckert, a bit too much substance to it was the beginning. 
Since I was not aware at all, which is still. 
Lectures by three experts from the industry, the clothing of problematic characters and a seminar on how the "place." 
It is expected to be even worse. 
The closer examination, more information and practical challenges are before us. 
But even if the course is held on Saturdays and Sundays, yet it is well documented. 
This time we discussed with the director Alena (the course is not a single man), as it attracts a woman who has not been a perfect proportioniert figure. 
And that is, after all, most of us. 
Some people have a short neck, the other a young figure without proper trends and others are mollig. 
It is a matter of Stylist, broad shoulders to conceal optical, to extend the neck or the necessary hervorzuzaubern bends. 
We also got pointers about how to make a Frauentyp like Jennifer Lopez - that is, with a large bosom, wide hip and all slim waists - beautiful and attracts figur stressed, without being overly provocative. 
If, for example the difference between Taille and Hüften is so great that the skirt or trousers does not really fit, should be at least a piece of schneidern. 
This will certainly not regret, because good clothing is simply unaffordable. 
In such a tailor-made coat you feel much better than in a bar, go high and verrutscht Taille absteht, etc. 
Young people can afford, in turn, clothing with wrinkles, baus, Applikationen, embroidery or Raffung to bear. 
With this amount of information and figur types, I am glad that I have a whole week, I will do everything thoroughly. 
And yet I am afraid that in view of the assigned homework is almost impossible to achieve. 
Each of the teilnehmerins rate was allocated a Promi, for which it is to come up with suitable attire - clothes and evening. 
In doing so, we are the current design, the fashion style of the star and his Figurtyp. 
I am supposed to Miranda Kerr, " " you may be out of the campaign, Victoria Secret know. 
I juble inside, because for me personally, this is much better, for example, than Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, in recent times has grown to more than 100 kilos (' oh well, that is a bit exaggerated), or even the young Selena Gomez. 
The garments we always envy in magazines or on the Internet, first and then represented graphically. 
In the "mood board," as the outcome is known, then our very personal style and our relationship with the graphic design. 
It is very important to think about the graphic side of the Stylings. 
The Stylist models not only physically, but also makes the so-called product side in the Journal (after a specific target, for example handtaschen, Mäntel, etc.). 
They told us the Stylist and designer Mario Kameník. 
But the first Sunday. 
This means that a Stylist must have a good overall picture. 
The filled Saturday with information on Figurentyps was tempered by three visitors from the industry. 
The Stylist, Jan Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben. 
Jakub reminded us that fashion illusion and Stylist should be able to take advantage of this. 
And eingeschickter Stylist with a single piece of clothing to work in very different ways. 
The magic word is variability. 
This can be such a Trenchcoat as usual on the jeans, a T-shirt or coat, but can also bear on the naked body, to attract sales of shoes and wear it as a dress. 
It is enough, the sleeves and the collar hochzukrempeln, and the whole Look is quite different. 
 "Does that," he said. 
But most came the following advice: "First of all, you know what the rules are perfect." 
"Only then can they violate them," said Jakub. 
At last, I understand why we need pauken all these doctrines, which you can combine with what and why, even if you fashion journal often gets to see quite different. 
Not to mention of fashion schaus. 
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a Stylist much more clothing variant must have prepared than he ultimately photographed. 
So you have to be a Fashion story with ten pages (e.g. ten attire), be prepared for at least 15 stylen. 
And the clothes on the photograph in combination with other Accessoires sometimes looks very different than in reality. 
All of this must be expected in the form of attire. 
The fact that image and, a sometimes make up half of the success that we also confirmed Jan Pokorný. 
Since you need only look at Madonna, a not particularly brilliant singer, from which image and marketing a world star. 
In the Czech Republic, the services of a rather reserved Stylist. 
Even celebrities often think this is wasted money (the main thing is that I am, as I was of secondary importance). 
And if anyone can be stylen from us, then we should expect that he or she very likely a whole heap of other (smaller) size than he or she needs in reality. 
Then you need only turn to googlen to determine with certainty that the tabloid press, writes back to the appropriate Promi or decreased, and so on. 
Jan and Mario set us on Sunday not to believe that a Stylist to focus only on the fashion and then the clothes "to assemble them." 
In his work, above all, he needs to communicate with the people he stylt and he must be a shrewd psychologist. 
People judge without anzubiedern and his opinion. 
"If we have a director appointed to sift through their clothes cupboard and to complement fine pieces, then we cannot get rid of the whole storage cupboard and say, my God, this is terrible." 
"We need at least a few worthy things, which recommends what you can do about it," says Mario. 
He also showed us exactly what a so-called "job" must include. 
So a bag of Taille zuknöpft and which carries all the necessary Proprietäten. 
Apart from such obvious things, such as scissors, hair removal or security nadeln Abroller they also contains such Utensils as nylon thread (a Stylist helps the photographing of products, such as handbags or avoid) specific clips with which the clothes will be accelerated if it is too big (electric nadeln or other Klemmes are prohibited, so that the substance is not broken) and, of course, Nähzeug. 
This means that we must not only listen, but also can try something practical, we learned how to get it right. 
Even in the case of photography at the Atelier, where the floor is, you can damage the shoe base, let alone the outside. 
We have o klebten and klebten.... 
With the gap, we must not even touch the shoes, so that they are not damaged. 
So we really need to be sent. 
Mario delighted me by my "creation," praised without restrictions. 
The aforementioned skill is not exactly my strength. 
All of this was only a fraction of what we hear on the second Wochenend-Fortsetzungskurs. 
One thing is now clear - to address the Styling at professional level, is not an easy task. 
V Need for steroids: "The run" - the illegal race across America 
Recession 
The original careless journey through a series of completely preventable, dilettanti error on a routine journey to an early class. 
While it was able to meet the ambitions for the most part, but what is the point, though obviously had no desire to do a bit more. 
Even before he came to the counter, the new section with the subtitle "the run" high expectations. 
He Versprach the old game show "Need for steroids" to move a step back into a new dimension, and in the spielbar demonstration models he actually seemed not only one of many Action-Rennspielen. 
We were also curious how longer passages in which the main protagonist in rising from the car and on foot. 
But as it is used for NFS, is in fact a lot differently than we had expected. 
Of course, there are potentially quite decent Arkade-Rennen, but, overall, the game will be diminished by some unnecessary mistakes in this series of more or less a few years are present. 
So it is not a mistake, but more signs of unbegreiflichen laziness in principle of game developers. 
The adventure begins very well. 
Firstly, it will be introduced into the story, whose main character, Jack certain issues of personal character; the only solution seems to be an illegal race across America. 
In San Francisco, on the west coast, to the steering wheel - with the task, as the first in New York. 
The basic idea involves a whole range of interesting elements. 
The entire route is in 10 stages and more than fifty individual race. 
This means that each race will be fought on the other route and that the various stages in various sufficiently diverse and interesting environment. 
There is no moment the impression that the game would continue to offer the same thing. 
Some areas are still very nice, even though the technical level of graphic display which goes beyond the earlier parts of the series. 
So no bewegende. 
But the journey through the desert, autumn landscape or high through deep snow landscape we have a very pleasant visual. 
Every now and again bring atypical elements a little change in the individual race. 
In the desert, for example, you will be surprised by a desert storm, which severely restricts the view. 
In the mountains, in turn, must be extremely careful that we will not be buried by an avalanche. 
By the way, are fairly well incorporated the individual race. 
Although only a few, but they are insufficient. 
For a while trying to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then expect a personal duel with a single opponent. 
And also interfering with the police, who wants to blow the whole thing. 
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the car. 
This is more about some interactive Animations, in which Jack fleeing anybody else, and where he must help the players by pushing the right button at the right moment. 
So there is nothing complicated. 
It is surprising, however, that the game is much less of such passages, as one would expect (concrete only three). 
Ultimately, it is more likely to benefit, because this element has at least a chance to be boring - it is in the context of the above mentioned on the elements that make the game more. 
This model is in the Fußtapfes of the previous sections. 
In other words, from today's viewpoint, no trees, on the other hand, you could not claim that it would be a bad thing. 
Anyone who seeks realistic simulations must look elsewhere. 
But a troubled Rennfahren, the local model will continue to perform very well, even though the competition could be better. 
In the meantime, so far, everything is fine. 
Real problems are emerging only after a certain time. 
In contrast to the model, the model is not quite OK. 
From a game of this type, it is hard to expect that it is difficult to calculate Deformations and collisions, but if you virtually no impact on any idea how the car is, then it is obviously not everything is in order. 
A typical example: at the close or passing of oncoming cars "touched upon" the other car in some places only slightly in the other, almost identical situation but tailspin and wild performance. 
Or the same scrap metal. 
Thanks to the Restart-Systems is nothing more of it is annoying. 
The remaining arts are resolved: if you write-off or ends up far away from the route, then throws the game back to the last point of the route. 
Only - in every race, only five remaining arts. 
If you have exhausted them, everything is going on. 
Thus, the arts are more such a thing as a tool for the event that something does not succeed, but rely on it should not. 
Sometimes it helps, but not even the Restart, because nothing else helps to learn the critical section from the head. 
It is extremely unfortunate that the same things often happen in the same places. 
Some of these trends must be the case in a very specific way, otherwise we simply do not fit. 
Elsewhere at the appropriate juncture "civilian" cars are always in the same configuration, no matter whether it was the first or fifth, five seconds sooner or later a minute. 
This is particularly troublesome in situations when you see that the opponent romped to two oncoming cars, but even before they arrive, the cars are already in such a position that they must navigate around or slow down. 
And it is no matter when you arrive, everything is designed so that this situation is always close to your nose. 
The opponents have even more advantages. 
In the whole game, there are a few places where you are always in the same place will be overtaken by the same opponents, and here again without regard to the timing. 
The most madman's is at the end of the game on the long bridge, which is happening in the body. 
The opponent must seem hell bent on overtaking. 
And if he is, then he is, of course, the view, so they started their own car a few times in Klump. 
What is clear - we want the game to simply make it more exciting and exciting events, but this desire is so clear that they quickly spoiled the joy of the game. 
And that is a pity, because, despite einfacherem model is the game as a whole rather entertaining and sometimes action that you almost no longer know where it is one of the head. 
And, in principle, no matter what "guilt" - the concept of 50 unique routes, the Order of the race in a way that no boredom can pay, or something completely different... 
An unusual idea is also a change in the course of the race. 
We must not overlook garages, because it is precisely here that we can change the car, even though in most cases, the car is good enough. 
The cars are divided into three categories. 
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines on the highways and exotic sportwagen for the technical crews, for example on the Serpentins in the mountains. 
Hand in hand with the modus operandi of the story is also the aufgaben mode (challenges) - that is, the race in the individual situation, which we know from history. 
This is not just medals, but also to gain experience points for their own profile, the common tasks (challenges) and history. 
In order to get to higher levels, various objects need to be open-minded, ranging from the car to the grounds for the profile. 
This is at the same time with the role of online Autolog, which, among other things, the results are compared with those of other players, and also provides for further collective functions. 
One of the other incomprehensible Schnitzers is a situation in the last race of the story. 
This is the car in an underground rail tunnels (perhaps), where we were in the dark on the rails long night (or, for that matter). 
The Tacho look points between 150 to 200 km/h (say), but there is a subway and a tough scrap. 
In our editorial, we will probably still argue about whether a blackout of the decision was or whether the authors believe to be so stupid. 
The technical side is not Überwältigendes but at least the visual overall picture is, in most cases quite attractive, and here and there, even brilliant. 
It is all the more galling is that in a few exciting moments, the wiederhol rate is slower, and sometimes quite dramatic. 
This is particularly the case with greater numbers of do where a continuous FPS does not work anyway. 
The Tonwiedergabe is OK, and the sound track is a matter of taste. 
The effort so broad as possible to raise more young audience, a sound track (a lá "of all things" - but who is buying such a game because of the music?! 
The overall picture of Need for steroids: The run? The feelings are more mixed. 
If the game does not mention totally unnecessary mistakes would be diminished, we would have been able to argue with a true ring of conviction that the run is the best piece of NFS in recent years. 
But the game seems somehow unfinished. 
For a class of pleasure, but we should be prepared to make a mistake with the power of Flughafenscheinwerfern in the eye. 
Concert of the "students of the Velvet Revolution" with Charles University Gesangsensembles

Eu-botschaft Vicenová: 
The Czechs have the reputation of Negativisten and Euro-sceptics 
"The Treaty of Lisbon has the balance among the various institutions from the road." 
I would not expect that there is such a tough war." 
"It will take five, six years until the dust settling, and all have become accustomed to her new role," began girl Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, its presentation very strongly to the legal faculty. 
How seriously the motto, "this is understandable and openly about Europe," it has already been demonstrated in the first part of its presentation, in which it succeeded, the various institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such a straightforward and understandable way to describe some editor of the law faculty of Charles University would have been able to admire. 
Mrs Vicenová also praised the new permanent chairman of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy. 
"Initially, there was criticism that he is too low-key - a grey civil servant, such a role is not equal, but I must say that it has ended up all the time, how well he has taken up the cause. 
"He is a man of twenty-seven Member States listen patiently to communicate with them, and above all has clear ideas about how to move forward with the EU. 
The new position of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy said they then answer to the question: who is the real - the European Union? What number I should call? ," in other words, as an important step towards agreement and better visibility of the EU's policy towards countries such as China or India. 
No one wants us to ban our Ölmützer Quargel 
Mrs Vicenová was also on the agenda, according to which the European Union lived, is alive and wants to live in the near future. 
According to the Czech Presidency of two years ago, described it as a success. 
The Czechs had the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also held the summit for the Eastern Partnership. 
In the case of the government during the presidency, described it as a big negative, which severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic. 
The Czech representation in the EU currently has to do all hands full. 
In the words of the ambassador said that it was not only in the presidency, but also in the subsequent crisis, which until now has not yet overcome quite hectic. 
And since the seven-year budget must still be approved by the EU, which is precisely because of the current economic situation makes it much more complicated. 
Whether it will be a lean and economical budget, what sectors of the economy must take precedence, which countries and which are less favoured - all of this is now on the agenda. 
The ambassador also reminds me of their own slogans with which they came to Brussels: "This is understandable about Europe." 
"If I do not like something, then it is gräulich words, phrases and jargon that no one understands. 
How can I actually know as citizens, whether they are really in Brussels curved or round cucumbers and various large bananas invented or whether someone really wants to ban the Quargel. 
It would have been the land of the EU would also like to be used to get more Czechs in European institutions. 
Europe two or different speeds in prospect 
According to the EU Ambassador, the Czechs are reputed to be the Eurosceptics more negative than the positive side of the story. 
All the more galling is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions. 
There are many factors to blame, including the reluctance of our candidates, whose inability to write motivierung letters, and not least the weak support from the Czech side. 
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, they also have the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4. 
"Believe me, if Poland or Hungary comes to me and the Slovaks in the vicinity, then the Frenchman believes, in addition to me:" Hey, what is their heads together - is that your V4? " and makes a pretty sour face. 
According to Ms. Vicenové, expect the EU in future, above all, tough rules on the budget policies of the Member States. 
As a much fairer, as a "European federation" is the concept of a Europe of two or even at different speeds. 
"We have the countries of the euro zone and the countries outside the euro zone. 
"We have the Schengen area, and we already have the Institute encourages cooperation." 
"For the first time, it was said that only those countries should cooperate, they want and not want to be left out." 
"It is becoming more and more of these institutions, which at the end of a strong" Europe of different speeds, " " expects Mrs Vicenová. 
In this respect, they also paid tribute to the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the implementation of the principle, according to which all the issues with impact on the entire EU must be discussed by all Member States, and not only by the countries of the euro zone. 
Fire story: 
The IBM innovator enters into the second century of its existence 
If you are looking for an appropriate word that the strategy of IBM, at the very least, then this would be the word "longevity." 
For the general public is IBM a synonym for technological revolution, we know it as a modern company, even though since its founding a century has passed. 
The basis for this longevity has been its first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson, senior 
He was the slogan, countless global problems could be easily solved if people would be willing to think a little bit. 
His slogan "Think!" has become the hallmark, which should take the life of the future giant (and at the same time to the title of the company's internal magazine, IBM has been the year 1935 began). 
This was also the basis of the Watsen thoroughly prepared corporate culture. 
"For us from IBM means that long-term thinking is a kontinuelle movement towards the future. 
IBM survived and was also a whole century successful because it has been faithful to its principles and not shied away, everything else to change all around it. 
This allowed us, in the course of our first century, the technology to transform the business and society. 
We hope that in the next hundred years, we will create even more," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company from occasion of the anniversary. 
Durchdachtes system 
Watson has operations in the 1930s, social care of its employees - in a similar way as the Baa entrepreneurs in Czechoslovakia: the IBM-Leute had as one of the first American workers to pay for their holiday, insurance through the employer plus elegant uniforms and working clothes and a reasonable salary system for best innovators and traders. 
Equally sophisticated IBM long-term relationships with their customers. 
The company was brilliant from the start in the promotion of talent - as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM any discrimination - and could pick and choose accordingly. 
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan, the Palmisan at the helm of IBM in the next year will be swapped seniority by a woman, Virginia Rometty. 
It is already 30 years at IBM before they took the position of Vetriebs, marketing and strategy manager. 
IBM makes so-called online brainstormings in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations. 
No wonder - ideas, there are enough, the company is almost half a million people. 
An institution with good reputation 
Their steadfast position in business is guaranteed the company a strong image and for domestic and foreign policy. 
"From the outset, IBM was more the concept of an institution than a mere technological criticize," said the professor in the Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, rosa beth Moss Kanter. 
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company, the business problems with the help of technology helps resolve," said George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research. 
As the company itself pointed out, there is a difference, only to be present on the market, or directly to shape it through this presence. 
IBM - in the Member States of their logos because of family "Big Blue," is in a century to become one of the largest companies in the world has grown up. 
It is one of the diverse technology companies - IBM developed hardware and software, infrastructure, Hosting and consultation services in an incredible range of products, from servers to the nanotechnology. 
Of all the American technology companies IBM has the most patents and five of its staff have already been awarded the Nobel Prize. 
Among his best-known inventions include, for example, banking machines, credit cards, financial swap, bar code or diskette. 
With approximately 220 billion dollars stock market value (market capitalization) this year, IBM was the second major technology companies (Apple), but it was the first time since 1996, Microsoft took over. 
Looking ahead 
Not all products and innovations met the tastes of the customers of today - were unhappy with their own operating system, OS/2, the online service, Prodigy, or even the IBM PC computers jr. 
"Business is based on moving forward, so we should not be emotional attachment to the past," said Samuel J. Palmisano. 
This is why IBM has no problem to build its foundations on various platforms - and if they do not work, they also leave again. 
In contrast to the rival Microsoft, which in principle with its Windows operating system and falls. 
Erfolgversprechende technology 
The profits of IBM in the highest degree of services, software and hardware to participate in a fifth. 
It was 1990 hardware with a more than 50 percent share in the most represented. 
Since 2000, veräußerte IBM little profit abwerfend assets to the value of 15 billion dollars in the same time it invested 58 billion dollars in buying more forward-looking technologies. 
In these investment IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis for the first time as a storm swept across the world. 
IBM remained the legacy of his first boss, Thomas J. Watson, in the middle of the major global economic crisis increased its investment volume. 
So far, it seems that the company IBM is without prejudice to the current crisis. 
The value of IBM-Akties has increased since 2008 rocket by 120 percent and net profit of the company kontinuell is growing. 
The corporate slogan of IBM is this: everything can be changed - only the values do not. 
For that reason, too, can be expected that this flexible giant pulls off the next crisis. 
IBM-Geschichte: from that of shareholders cheese on weltall flights 
A hundred years ago, society was founded in New York, IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation. 
According to the IBM name, they first 1924 - it was originally a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America. 
According to the foundation for the subsequent company IBM, the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the 1980s of the 19th century. 
They had technologies such as the famous Stechkartenuhren on the registration of the work begins. 
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett towel, until 1930, also the chair of the board of directors. 
And it was a towel, the head of the rival company, Thomas J. Watson, so that he helped in the management of the company. 
This leader, then even the founder of IBM in the shadows - Watson's ideas is still the invincible culture and identity of the company. 
Watson led the company until 1952. 
IBM began, as the name tells us, with the manufacture and distribution of all sorts of machines for the trade - -und sausage schneidern cheese to go. 
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he has doubled its sales to nine million dollars and finance the company and on all continents. 
Watson was so essential to the company that he 40 years sat in his chair, he was the first of his son, Thomas Watson younger replaced. 
Under his leadership the IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence, and also became the first Programmiersprache. 
In the 1960s, engineers and computer helped NASA by IBM to launch flights into space - to the Merkur and Saturn, and in 1969 the famous flight of humans to the moon. 
Meanwhile, IBM in 1964, the first computer with the same computer architecture - the series IBM System/360. 
A classic PC, the computer standard of that era came in 1981 under the name IBM 5150 on the market. 
Twenty years later, IBM veräußerte computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand they bought the mom-and-pop part of the company's former price coopers and jumped wholeheartedly into the business with consulting benefits and services with high added value. 
The strategy, which IBM is paying off in the last three years, is the concept of "smart planet." 
It is the intention, technology wisely has not even been planned areas, for example, to improve the situation in transport and urban management. 
In the commercial sector, IBM, recently the platform "Smarter Commerce," which is intended to help the dealers to lead the entire commercial cycle. 
IBM also has a strong history of the Czech Republic. 
Back in 1932, IBM founded a branch in the former Czechoslovakia - was the first country in Central and Eastern Europe. 
Today, IBM R, among other things, a strategic outsourcing Center in Brünn. 
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe moved in Prague and there is also a Top-Forscherteam of world level, that deals with the technology. 
Darina Rychtáová on their meeting: 
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I do not want him more! 
Darina Rychtáová (53) says - now is closure. 
After her husband, Josef Rychtá (53) from the protector of Iveta Bartoová (45) whose lover was Darina remained hopeful that Josef springs from his rosy dream and come home. 
But it is now finally ended with the patience and for the further life she has set clear rules. 
"Josef can come home, but not more than my partner," said D. Rychtáová. 
When Darina Rychtáová singer I. Bartoová had taken refuge in her own house, she would probably not even in my dream, like that with her husband. 
When Iveta at their urging, after 30 days and went back to íany, Joseph went with the same. 
Indeed, he confessed publicly that they love. 
By the time Darina resignierte, indeed, it seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her relinquishing man - but she finally gave him the passport. 
Rychytá is no matter with whom his wife is sleeping 
If Rychtá Iveta Bartoová should leave in future, then he will certainly not be welcomed. 
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to take his days in our common home, then I will not chase him." 
"It is not, however, than to be loved, lost its way old mule, but as a person, which I do have some ties," Ms. Rychtáová betrayed; but they also said that she had already been emotional for him and is solely on mutual asceticism. 
The fact that he Darina the back door was locked, Josef has so far with dignity. 
"I respect the decision of my wife." 
"I stand together with Iveta, nothing has changed." 
"My wife wants a Papier-Ehe and I respect that." 
"The company is going further, I am concerned about the repairs, the garden, I am shopping." 
"By Darina I am quite normal, only the bed we do not share," said J. Rychtá (the story) Blesk. 
If Darina wants to find a new love, then he would not prevent them. 
"We do not sleep with each other, so I don't care whether she has a friend or who it is. 
It is clear that this is my fault, I am in love with Iveta and therefore I assume any responsibility. 
The worst female vices: what is it with you? 
If you are calling on the men to name some typical female vices, they invariably shake some promptly from the sleeves. 
Love women, you see in the following lines, in which we review a couple of Unsittes men wallen the blood in the cold? 
Shopping addiction 
If her husband to be shopping addicts? 
Do you at least buy a weekly? 
Do you like to shop and to be a little more? 
Then it is probably true in your case a weakness. 
Some women are at least aware and are trying to do their shopping to keep under control. 
But hand on heart, the woman is already on the lookout for a good clothes from a clothes shop on bummeln, and not all the same (in every possible colour kombinations) in the booth to try? 
Even if the shopping is a hobby for most women, it is often the pure hell for the men. 
How many times they have already told her husband - a man you would rather be outside... 
Constant dissatisfaction 
"I am not too fat?" 
"I would have to be reduced at least five kilos - I should start to go jogging or Gymnastik?" 
"I give you Gefalle?" 
If they somehow know? 
Yes? 
Then you probably belong to the women who are obsessed with how they look like. 
This is not a long time ago that you should leave, but many men have an allergic reaction when their wife whinges constantly about their appearance. 
The stronger sex is agreed - with increasing frequency of complaints, the women are always unverträglicher. 
Order and cleanliness in the first place 
It is a fight against windmills. 
Windows, clean sweep Fliesen and dust, the scheuern - and this at least twice in the week. 
Schimpfen you with their partner because he once again with dirty shoes trample on the clean open places, you are chastising children, because it is already a dirty gescheuerte washing basin and because the glass door in the living room cabinet has been again fingerprints, but where the Polier makes so much effort? 
If you are under this kind of "Devianz," then you should know that we should not exaggerate and order and cleanliness in family life does not stand in the first place. 
This excessive Reinheitsfimmel can also end up mutual relations and, above all, harm the calm in the family. 
Sticheln 
"Dirty Turnhoses." 
"Do you want the old socks really attract tomorrow?" 
"A wet towel is not simply on the floor." 
If your partner is subjected to such a tirade, you should not be surprised that he brings to the Palme. 
It is not a bad thing, but they want all his order. 
If they knew the men, then women might not need so much to meckern. 
Gossip and novelty 
Some women like to applaud and trat as getuschelt or even slandered behind the backs or forge alliances. 
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to panting through such issues, such as - who, where, with whom, how and why. 
I think each of us has a little harmless gossip and novelty at the camp. 
Hand on heart - which is probably all women of their own. 
But this is not to be confused with klatscht seekers gross calibre, whom nothing and no one is sacred, which I think everyone in their environment, and particularly for women's collectives have pose a significant risk. 
Jágr and Voráek gave Philadelphia with their Assistenzs victory 
The ice hockey striker Mr. Jágr had in Monday's game in the NHL with two Assistenzen large share of the 5:3 victory in Philadelphia, on the ice in Carolina and again by produktivster Czech player in the NHL. 
Beneficiaries of the overview of the neununddreißig ice hockey star was in both cases, Claude Giroux, who added an assistance and was declared the best players in the Matchs. 
Two Assistenzen in the same game also recorded Jágr's player Jakub Voráek. 
Jágr said after the game journalists, he had a great evening Giroux predicted. 
"Even before the game, I told him that he now manages a trifecta." 
That somehow I had the feeling." 
"Every now and again, such a feeling," Jágr said, after its action Giroux has already been achieved in the first shot of the Flyers a goal. 
A bit later, the second hits, "a Czech trail." 
Voráek won behind the door of the Hurricanes Puck and presented him between the circles the successful Maxim Talbot. 
One minute before the Abpfiff of the first third of the home players Patrick Dwyer, reached a Short-Hander, but the second half belonged to the Flyers. 
Specifically, Giroux. 
In collaboration with Jágr he made his third hits, then went on to Wayne Simmonds, whose shot on the fourth goal. 
"I love to play with him." 
"I do not want to say that he is the best player in the league, but he certainly is among the top three," echoing Jágr his Center. 
"I would not be in life that I finish my career with such an ice hockey player games, such as with him." 
"I am pleased about this huge." 
"I am raising my game to me." 
"All the years in the NHL asked my players their game to me and now revolves around the tables," schmunzelte Jágr. 
Carolina was playing for the drama - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who is from a criminal, it came to a goal. 
Matt Read prevented any further complication, in which he in two majority was against a successful. 
"Excellent acted Pronger in our zone." 
"He got off the Puck, I was driving and (Read) pulled away from vertical." 
"I tried to meet him, and I am glad that it has worked," Voráek described the final hits of the game from his perspective. 
With this victory, Philadelphia at the top of the Eastern Conference. 
The Czech defensive player of Montreal Jaroslav paek injured in the game against Buffalo, and in the second half because of a breach in the upper body. 
The Candiens losing about alongside their experienced Beck their leadership, including a unverloren in penalty 2:3. 
One of the shots could not turn Tomáš Plekanec. 
More than schmerzten lost points, the coach of the home team is probably the high sick absence on the defensive - the game they just played with five defensive players at the end. 
"This is a bad thing." 
"The meeting we played only with a single experienced player at the end, the rest were young players." 
"But because nothing can be done, so we must be ready," said Jacques Martin. 
"With every change a wave of attacks after the other, and we had nothing." 
"We would have to make the game easier and Puck have dropped from our third." 
There was still room for improvement," said P. K. Subban, a defensive player. 
The Czech Torhüter Ondřej Pavelec, 30 shots were fired by Tampa Bay and contributed significantly to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg. 
At the gates of the jets, which ended a series of five failures, had five different Schützes share. 
Development of the rice prices since 1989 
Until 1989, the SSR only five authorized state agencies: edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist. 
The travel agents at the time, above all, sold only travel in the socialist Eastern Bloc countries, in the West at that time were chosen. 
And so, Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), in the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimea peninsula on the Black Sea), to the Black Sea to Bulgaria and Romania and Hungary to the Balaton. 
One exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it also was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, Yugoslavia then proposed a pro-Western course, and that is why the trips to Yugoslavia have been severely restricted. 
A great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not even citizens of the Soviet bloc (Tschechoslowakes) was allowed in the framework of the socialist countries to travel freely. 
If a citizen of the SSR individually for Poland, for example, or even in the Soviet Union wanted to travel, then he needed a so-called invitation letter, because otherwise, individual travel was not possible. 
Even then, the travel agencies offered trips to the West, but huge queues had to accept or even in sleeping bags to be careful before the travel office, or at least "good friend" in the travel office. 
Even so, the issue has not gone for a long time. 
The so-called foreign exchange commitment - the condition for an exit in the West - was only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all. 
The Czechoslovak currency was not a free umtauschbare currency without foreign exchange commitment, so it would have been impossible to make the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a trip to the West. 
The majority of Czechs spent their holidays at home, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dachas - a habit that lasted until now. 
The Velvet Revolution of 1989 was followed by a travel revolution of the Czechs on the foot. 
While until 1989, a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria was the measure of all things, the Czechs spent 4.5 million last year on their foreign holidays in countries of the world. 
An enormous paradox today is no longer conscious at all is the fact that the currently most popular tourist destination of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989 could not travel at all, because it is part of the former Yugoslavia. 
Right from the beginning of the 1990s of the last century to the foreign exchange requirement was lifted into the neighbouring Western European countries, which is a huge wave of short visit to Vienna in Austria and Germany. 
The Tschechoslowakes have for a long time from their trips to the West simply cannot get enough, everyone wanted at least a few days ago. 
For example, the Czech tourists slept on trips to Paris in a tent in the park, because who would have the money for a shelter in the hotel or in a pension. 
A typical feature on foreign travel of Czechs was a canned beer and sausage, etc., loaded baggage. 
Another important milestone was the introduction of the free umtauschbaren Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally free to buy the Western currency. 
Our living standards and the average salary rose to 1997, einmündete in another important moment. 
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agents began regularly in 1997, preparing to travel by charter flights, which makes the air travel, thanks to the ability to negotiate quantity rabatte, compared to the past verbilligten unbelievable. 
At the end of the 1990s the Czechs, except the United States, foreign currency transactions with all the advanced countries in the world, which travel more easily. 
Another interesting moment in the history of the "velvet" tourist traffic in the year 2000, when, thanks to the high demand for the first direct charter flight was processed in an exotic country after Thailand. 
Since then, every year to fly direct charter planes with Czech passengers in far-off sunny countries; this year it flies directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations. 
The Tsd 100 Czechs travel each year in exotic countries. 
Another important moment in the era that our "revolutionary" development marked came in 2008. 
On 17 November 2008, the US visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country brutalized for daring definitely among the advanced countries in the world. 
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50,3%) and for the first time in its history for a single holiday trip, including the cost of the holiday more than CZK 15 Tsd per capita. 
The main aim is to find a new chairman - once again threatens a stalemate. 
For nearly five months, the Czech football no chairman and threatens the Ivan Hašek successor at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAR), not even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday will be known in Nymburk. 
To date, there is still no agreement on how the electoral system is to be elected. 
And without them there is no vote on the three potential successors. 
Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík. 
In June, Hašek resigned from his post, and his colleagues urged the departure had to reach an agreement and to find a strong personality, which could lead the football in future. 
However, in the era after Hašek broke the old quarrels between the two chambers were once again not be able to agree on a joint candidate. 
This was quite clear on 16 September, when the new chairman should be chosen. 
The main assembly delegates were in vain in the House of Commons in Prague's Smíchov district, because the trial produced no result, and it was not just about the election itself. 
You could not even agree who actually entitled to the full collection - only the statutory representatives or officials equipped with a full power. 
In this single point reached at least partial agreement, including the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, whose opinion a representation at full power base was not admissible. 
The disputes over the electoral system, however, continue to persist. 
The executive committee did not bring more clarity on the matter at its meetings - no matter whether ordinary or extraordinary, in principle, absolutely nothing else on the agenda. 
Even if the views expressed in relation to the election changed a few times - the central point remained the same. 
The question is: how should we proceed in the third round, in order to avoid a stalemate? 
"The bone of contention is the question whether we should proceed in accordance with the Statute, or whether an entirely different model needs to be found," said Duan Svoboda, one of the three nden leaders of the FAR, who represents in the management of professional football. 
According to satzungsmäßigem model triumphs in the third round of the one candidate who receives the greater expressed as support in the chamber, for which he is standing. 
Moravia is reportedly ready to respond to the compromise, that the one candidate to win the higher number of votes from both chambers. 
The Czech side, in turn, is on the condition that the winner in the percentage of the vote count at least a two-thirds majority. 
"Then, the two Vorrundes have absolutely no sense, this modus operandi would question the whole concept of bicameral," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, it would be best not to bend the electoral system, but according to choose applicable statutes. 
Surprisingly, this is also true Tomáš Paclík, even if it emerges that the statutory order of all the candidates most likely Pelta. 
"My wish is that as much as possible will be elected in accordance with the Statute." 
"This is no nonsensical ersatz variants to be invented, as in the last general meeting," said the owner (of the football club), Victoria Plze, who is standing for the first time, and above all in its opinions from Pelta to abgrenzte. 
Pelta, however, remains optimistic. 
In his opinion, it will be known in Nymburk as the new chairman, and he believes that the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively. 
"The possible qualification of the national team for the Euro on this day would certainly help to calm the emotions." 
"If the football first ride on the euphoric wave, it is also the willingness to cooperate more," said the official from Jablonec, all three of the Adepten has the most experience, both on a professional, as well as regional levels. 
Rajchl is more circumspect. 
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is mixed." 
"This is not a matter between the people from their homes in Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain rules for their own purposes," zurechtzubiegen ."" 
"That is why it is not ruled out a new blockage in the main assembly." 
"I hope, however, that common sense prevails in the end," Rajchl said. 
The only thing - much time remains for the agreement of all sides. 
Some negotiations should take place allegedly directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football generalität until qualification will be complete. 
The charter plane, which, among other Dalibor Kuera and Rajchl should fly to Podgorice in the morning in Prague did not start because of a technical disruption and so feverish for an alternative option, as a part of the executive committee but has yet to get to the site of the Barrage-Hinspiels. 
Ultimately, it is surely the meeting at ministerial level crucial to which it is supposed to come on Wednesday. 
Josef Dobe, the minister for education, youth and physical education, the divided parties would have liked to within the country's largest sports associations to reach an agreement. 
There is a lot at stake: state aid, the Vertrauungswürdigkeit of the Czech football and the upcoming general meeting of the STV, the Czech sport in the wake of the financial problems of Sazka the new direction. 
Paclík is in the battle for the position of the chairman, because he sees no suitable candidate 
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballer at the extraordinary general meeting would be able to make a strong candidate all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAR) have been met, he would have nothing to do with the battle for the top position. 
"If there was a good candidate, then I would fight for him and give up on the election." 
"But in the current situation is not managed to find such a Adept," said Paclík TK. 
The main reason for Paclík duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindich Rajchl, so it is to prevent the supposed favorites of the election, Pelta, arrived at the top of the FAR. 
Paclík also stressed that in case he wins the post of chairman, only one year, until 2013, until the date of the general meeting. 
In the position of the chairman, he would like to see an experienced " not too much involved in the football. 
"With some people coming into question, I have spoken personally." 
"It is extraordinary to think that some people said they wanted to do not currently identify with the Czech football. 
 "Such views would have liked to have changed," he quoted. 
The most troubling of all Paclík alleged Pelta links with the chairman of the Pilsner county football associations, Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence second votes on key meetings. 
For Paclík, for this reason it is unacceptable that Pelta the position of the chairman. 
"The current state in his victory would be einkonserviert and the Czech football, it would not move forward at all." 
"The support provided by Berbr, a cleverem Businessman, would get the football twice a bad thing," Paclík said. 
Here he plays that Pelta's name some time ago in connection with abhörungen investigation in a corruption affair, fell out of the Pelta, however, emerged unpunished. 
"I do not know what a victory of Pelta (tsch) should play football." 
"And as we would in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," said ekl Paclík, his former dictum, "he will sell the Pilsner football club, when Pelta chairman will be," but it already looks a little more calmly. 
If Paclík win in the election, but he could certainly imagine a future cooperation with Pelta. 
Similarly, another candidate, Rajchl, Paclík had supported before the main meeting in October, which ended with a fiasco. 
"He (Pelta) would be the first to which I would go." 
"He has great qualities." 
"I would like him well, for example as head of the national team." 
"But I do not believe that he is able to lead the association as a manager." 
"I don't desire my nose in matters of which I do not understand," said Paclík, which in September raised eyebrows - was that he was behind the recall of the referee commission with Luk Macela was at the helm, Dagmar Damková replaced. 
Paclík even claimed that he felt up to the role of the chairman. 
And it is relying on his skills in the management of private companies, since last summer, he is also head of Pilsen, with his support in May, celebrated the first victory in the league. 
"I have the power to do something to change in the football environment, and to a certain cultivation of this." 
"In order to limit the influence of certain special interest groups who tend to have an impact on disciplinary and appeal committees, which descends into horrific situations," Paclík quoted the example no secret of his antipathy to the sparta leader Daniel Ketínský. 
As one of his priorities would be the consolidation of relations between the FAR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with whose help he would lobbyieren the political leaders to ensure that more money from the lottery tax goes into the sport. 
"This is one of the key issues facing the new chairman should pay attention to." 
"When it comes to the taxation of gambling, such as the political parties to declare, then I understand their argument, but they must also make it clear where the money is going," he said. 
His link to the Pilsner club Paclík is also not a handicap, even though he himself pointed out, the chairman of the FAR should be "bipartisan." 
Pelta, in turn, is associated with Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla. 
"This is not exactly ideal." 
"It is my opinion but not much sense, my shares in Pilsner club hypocritical to transfer a third person to return after one and a half years," said Paclík clear. 
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAR ausschlössen a stalemate in the future. 
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association promised one of the candidates for the Vorsitzendenamt, Miroslav Pelta, he will be the case for much of his election, that the FAR gets new statutes in future disputes over the electoral system to exclude from the outset. 
The official from Jablonec is confident ahead of Thursday negotiations in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will certainly ease with a possible success of the Czech selection. 
Pelta had not realized election promised in September that he wanted in the case of his election to the national team and concentrate on the extraction of financial resources. 
It was decided at the last moment to participate in the election before the last main meeting, and it might help him the two-month break, his ideas about the leadership of the football to defend and present in a broader context. 
"People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect that the chairman is well known on Thursday." 
"He feels that it is high time that the association will be chaired by someone who believes the man, who is associated with the Jablonecer club, but also for many years in Sparta and acted on the Executive Committee. 
That is also why he thinks that he has enough experience to lead the Czech football. 
He is convinced that the current problems with the election euphoria is responsible at the time of Ivan Hašek reigned. 
"Unfortunately, in the main assembly statutes approved in June, which were not as complete as everyone had assumed. 
If they do not allow different interpretations, we would have been a chairman from September," Pelta said. 
It is the revision of the most important document of the civil union he used as bait for the delegates. 
"If I become president, then I will accept myself, and I am ready to take personal responsibility if it does not work." 
"This is a fundamental issue, without which he cannot be," Pelta said. 
In addition, he is not trying to define his opponents. 
He had previously announced that he could imagine a collaboration with Jindich Rajchl, which he acknowledges, because of his legal education, and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy. 
Tomáš Paclík attacked him for a long time, which, in turn, has left no dry thread at Pelta. 
In football, he has more than a year and can already point to some successes." 
"His attacks were disparaging and many people were shocked by his election campaign." 
"This is also why many doubt its true nature," adressierte Pelta his opponent, who will remain faithful to its proclamations, which he has already expressed in September. 
In his opinion, his most powerful weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest divisions, to the national team. 
And this was supposed to be the flagship of Czech football. 
"I would also like to try to end all Affairen - from the fog Bohemians, to the echoes of the corruption scandal last year." 
"Right after that, I would like to plunge into negotiations with the private and public sector, in order to ensure adequate funding for all football," said TK sechsundvierzig year candidate two months ago. 
At that time he also promised that his arrival at the top of the Czech football would mean no human cleansing. 
"I would have been familiar with the content of all employees," he said in Strahov direction, where there is understandably nervous because of the long anarchy. 
Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios, which accompany the forthcoming general assembly, he believes that the delegates are not in vain on Thursday to go to Nymburk. 
"If you really ought to be the only contentious point, as we choose in the third round, then we will get over that." 
"The football needs credibility and he gets it back only if he finally has a new leader," Pelta remains, two days before the potentially decisive day of his career of officials optimistic. 
Rajchl promises that the FAR from him to work hard begins 
If the current deputy chairman Jindich Rajchl at the main meeting on Thursday as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic should be elected, would this supposed vermiesen many people in the mood. 
Rajchl promises that in the event of his election will begin to work hard. 
He wants to introduce systemic changes, and the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football fields. 
In addition, he promised to resolve the case Bohemians, relations with UEFA and FIFA to bring more money into the football and otherwise to continue the work of previous chairman Ivan Hašek has begun. 
"As a chairman, I would like to focus on the football as a whole." 
Starting from the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, on the national squad, the professional football, and football for young people." 
"So I do not want to say that I want to do everything alone," Rajchl said in the conversation for TK. 
"I am a team player and would therefore like to distribute the powers of the executive committee that each member pays a certain area." 
And I will be handing out tough tasks, so that the football in every segment is moving forward." 
Many were not exactly enchanted, because they, rather than simply to criticize the work of others, to work really hard should start," he added. 
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football community was considered no longer to stand at all. 
"I know that I am working 20 hours a day." 
"But I must know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, I do not use a stick between the legs and every step that I am put into question," he said as an explanation for why he had hesitated. 
"Many people told me that I should not give up, because otherwise others would do so." 
"This is confidence that we must not miss," he said. 
It is alleged that motivated him, too, should be allowed to continue the work he has begun under Hašek. 
"In two years we have accomplished a great deal of work and I will not now simply throw." 
"There have been trials started only in a few years to play out, and I would just like to see someone cut off," he said, and hereby expresses its concern at the fact that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta was elected, the situation could return to the days before Hašek. 
"I believe in a systematic way and that is something which Mirek Pelta is not." 
"Behind him, above all, people who make the football so that he only chosen because it would be." 
I think you can blame some, but not that I would be biased." 
"I am trying to be objective." 
"I want football for everybody, because it all goes well, and not just the chosen few," Rajchl said. 
It also contradicts the assertion that he was only a leader of the Czech Republic. 
"Even though some people say the opposite, I have really to do the best for Mähres." 
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league is not in a Czech and Moravian part should divide their winners each aufstiegen in the first league." 
"Then it could not happen today that only three Moravian clubs play in the league, especially for the young players in Moravia is a problem," Rajchl says. 
Because the head of the Pilsner club Tomáš Paclík joined the battle for the post of chairman, Rajchl does not have the courage to assess his chances that he will be elected. 
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me to its deputy chairman and now realises that clear successes are behind me," Rajchl has led to the saving of tens of millions of kronor on unfavorable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and negotiations with the lottery law considers its success. 
On the other hand, it is partly the fault that the association was not in a single direction. 
While he says of Pelta, "he was disqualified from the outset to give the Czech football new confidence," he considers the second rival - Paclík for a strong candidate for the football really have something to offer. 
"No one can question that he Pilsen in just one year has done an excellent job." 
"If he is elected, he would probably continue with the things that Ivan Hašek has begun, and the personnel in the commissions he would obviously not fundamentally change." 
He would certainly not want to altered just on his behalf," Rajchl ruling on his rival. 
Europe's finest Pools 
Leap into the blue 
Yulia Stanek 
Planschbecken Ufo-Optik, future pools in Budapest: anyone who travels through Europe can be seen blue miracle - and after a city tour or a wandering Sprudelbädern hide behind the tired legs. 
A book shows, where roofs of corrugated iron in water is the most beautiful. 
When Iris Meder over the past one and a half years on a research trip, had one thing in their luggage is not lacking: a. 
Rücklings on the water, they looked great in elaborate domes, they swam putten marble, they waited in the basin, and was meticulously renovated youth swimming halls. 
Gefiel her a bath, she took in her notiz book - all the knowledge worth details about the design and history of the building. 
More than 200 explored architectural historian Meder swimming being shed in this way - and it is now in her newly published book "Badefreuden": swimming halls in Munich, historic Badepaläste in the Black Forest, "Hardcore-Betonbauten" in the Taunus. 
Through 13 countries introduced their "travel to the most extraordinary spas in Central Europe": apart from Germany, Austria and Switzerland visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia. 
The 46 year-old German is a true Badekultur-Enthusiastin. 
In sport, it is not much in the hat, Meder says - only in the water is different. 
The annoying thing is that fans come to terms with blue Kachels and chlorine gestank, while Jogger must inhale deceptively smell of ficht forests or gaudy Vogelgezwitscher can listen in the park. 
"I have asked myself one day why being shed must always be so ugly," says the Meder living in Vienna. 
"So I began to collect beautiful bathrooms." 
Water surface doubled architecture 
Geplätscher in the basin and ethereal sauna oils - the wellness factor in bathrooms is so great, because we are using all the senses, Meder. 
And if the builders of trouble swimming halls can be a real Augenschmaus: "Instead of a floor in bathrooms a water surface." 
"It is transparent, on the other hand, reflects the beauty of the whole building." 
All doubled optical: high vaults, colorful Kachels, bretter. 
The small forma band "Badefreuden" gives 190 pages of knowledge about the architecture and cultural history of historical wellness havens - but, above all, desire for a leap into the blue. 
Remarkable specimens discovered the Pool-Sammlerin Meder in their research in Hungary. 
In addition, sumptuous Heilbads such as the 100 years old Széchenyi-Bad in Budapest, they found a nitrate containing water in a urigen Karsthöhle (Höhlenbad Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as a Thermalbad, whose basin is filled with alkalihaltigem water and are located in a flaschenförmigen building (Városi Termálfürdö Jászberény). 
Spectacular prospects, however, offer many heated Freibads in Switzerland and Austria: while the Zurich Dachbad the whole city has in mind can be in a bad external pool in St Anton to look at the snow cover of an - and, in the Dampfbad there is a window from which you can monitor the activities of the Ski-Piste. 
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design beach visitors expected in length: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a Ufo landed in the Alps. 
From three upwards open Schales dampft in the winter, while in the background, the mountains of the Ötztals out in the sky. 
Alhambra in the Black Forest 
It is not in any swimming pool, the Pool-Sammlerin Meder the smell of chlorine in the nose. 
Many termination after sulphur smell in Árpád-Bad in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells so much for fuel oil, which we believe is unlikely to have landed in a Gesundheitsbad. 
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogenkarbonathaltigen water, which is almost black and whose of silt a stain on the skin, as soon as you slip into the basin - a wellness special. 
At one location was Iris Meder in their search for beautiful bathing sites, however, also disappointed: when it freed and being in Czech Bad Luhatschowitz wanted to visit, they found a cordoned off area. 
The 1902 by architect Duan Jurkovic bath has now been closed. 
When Meder a glance through the verwittert windows of the rot-weiß-gelben Jugendstil-Gebäudes, saw them as weeds between the open places. 
The decline has countered, however, in a beautiful swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais hot springs at Bad Wildbad. 
Three Bauphasen, this bath is already behind; it can detect not only neoromanische elements from the time of its establishment in 1844, but also a maurisch Hall in Alhambra-Stil, which was added to 1900. 
Since the careful modernization in 1995, the Palais hot springs pool kennerin Lieblingsbad Iris Meder - and not just because they originally came from the Black Forest. 
"It is quite an achievement, so different to merge Baustils into a fine unit," Meder said. 
With such a palace, the Tauchgang in the spa pool is apparently only incidental. 
Agricultural speculation 
Deutsche Bank is commodity business 
Christian Teevs 
Does the Deutsche Bank deal with agricultural commodities? 
According to online information, Josef Ackermann has asked a working group to examine the speculation for the poor of the world. 
In January the CEO's wants to draw conclusions. 
Hamburg. 
For the German citizen, the thing is clear: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study that banks with agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn. 
Two thirds of respondents want the Deutsche Bank and other lending institutions out of this business, because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest people in the world. 
This is the result of a Forsa-Umfrage on behalf of the consumer organisation Foodwatch. 
The study is based on a report that Foodwatch in mid-October. 
It shows the author Harald Schumann, betting on the global commodity markets prices soar - and the banks are partly to blame for world hunger problem. 
The campaign of consumer protection is directed specifically against deutsche bank chief Josef Ackermann, even though big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley to act similarly. 
Originally intended for raw materials were betting that traders hedge against price fluctuations. 
But now, most experts agree that the Zocker has decoupled from supply and demand - and expense of the poor to make profits. 
Unlike the US-Konkurrents Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to investigate the allegations and said that no business was "worth the good reputation of the German bank to be put at risk." 
According to information from ONLINE mirror an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the foodwatch report. 
By the end of the year, the review is expected to be completed, then the results will be presented to the board of the Deutsche Bank - all recommendation, as it is to be handled. 
At the end of January, the head of the bank wants to tell us what the consequences. 
In the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity business, or even the complete departure. 
Ackermann forge his image 
Foodwatch chief, Thilo Bode, welcomed the news, but at the same time reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: "The betting on rising prices of food particularly dramatic shows how reckless banks are hurting the common good." 
Ackermann is a top bank lobbyist now especially in the duty. 
"The German bank must remove all assets from its portfolio, where money will be used for betting on food prices," Bode said. 
"No matter whether Mr. Ackermann to hunger, suffering people or the reputation of the German bank." 
The insight of Ackermann is surprising at first glance, it is clear, however, that the CEO's just a few months before his departure from office would like to make a perfect picture. 
On Monday, the German bank announced that the head other than planned will not change in the supervisory board. 
In a departure from the controversial agricultural speculation he could improve his image. 
And he needs for possible losses to be little fun - after all, his successor would have to do so. 
Any other commodity facilities would be terminated 
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure high on the manager. 
So far, more than 30 000 Internet users participated in the campaign of the organization. 
Bode on Tuesday published the survey, for which the Forsa institute on 7 and 8 November has interviewed 1001 people. 
Just 11 percent think it is legitimate that the Deutsche Bank, which will have bet on prices for food. 
Many bank customers would also draw personal conclusions when they learn that their bank is involved in such transactions: every second, according to the survey would terminate all assets in which money is flowing into commodity speculation. 
43% would advise friends of such a bank, 49 percent said they consider to terminate their accounts and to switch to another institution. 
21er house in Vienna 
The moved pavilion 
Ingeborg Wiensowski 
An architectural history with ups, downs and happy ending: the Austrian World exhibition pavilion must present in Brussels in 1958, prices, was in Vienna for the museum, was empty and verkam. 
Now he is being reopened as an exhibition house. 
If dreams of modern postwar architecture, clear forms, glass halls, bold swings and new materials for the faith in technological progress are typical, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Charles Schwanzer of the Brussels World Expo is a good and famous example in 1958. 
Schwanzers pavilion at the Eurovision Song Contest Architecture for his easy and steel glass design. 
The building is seen as a milestone to date of contemporary architecture. 
He made the architect so well known that at the next World Expo in Austria pavilion was built. 
With his legendary BMW-Vierzylinderhaus plus schüsselartigem Nebenbau in Munich, he was in 1973, after all, internationally famous. 
His temporary Ausstellungsbau planned pavilion at the World Expo in the Swiss garden at the Vienna South station converted and in 1962 opened a museum of the 20th century - the "20s home" has been called it. 
This was the building but neither physical and technical as a museum - no walls on the slopes of the art, not a good climate. 
Nevertheless, it has been used so long before contemporary art was a new house in Vienna. 
Since 2001, the building was empty and came down more and more. 
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the pavilion, he is now "21er House" and will in future be used as a museum for contemporary art. 
On Tuesday night, the museum opened Belvedere, which includes the house, where the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in every respect. 
The new start Agnes Husslein-Arco, the 2007 new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere. 
Husslein-Arco completed his Ph.D. art historian with remarkable career, among other things, in the youth as a Eiskunstläufererin, then with Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and the founding director of the museum of modern Salzburg, strongly defended the reconstruction with politicians and Denkmalschützern, they get public funding and private sponsorship money and fixed use. 
Besides contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba will be issued by the eponymous foundation, a café and there should be a bookshop, and a spacious house had to be built. 
Strict supervision, small budget 
The execution was the ideal person Krischanitz. 
It is not just because he Joseph Olbrichs Secession in Vienna sensitive converted and enlarged and had won the competition, but because he Schwanzer has studied at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion for him an "enormously important place" was where he "almost every weekend" had seen the exhibitions. 
He knew the Ur-Entwurf, and he knew the problems of the building, which was already in his transfer to Vienna and his Umnutzung generosity and easily lost. 
In the current restructuring, there have been far greater problems: the building was "a schleuder energy," Krischanitz says. 
The profils windows were replaced outside glass fibre verstärktes insulating glass and the glass roof is replaced by special security glass. 
Kältebrücken-Stahlträger are reinforced or replaced, and asbestgefüllte blankets have been cleaned up. 
Two shells made room for the new use, a abgesenkter trench between home and road for the Belichtung, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still slightly Schwanzer-Pavillon. 
The original exterior doors are left, the house is removed in the old rotbraun Rostschutz-Farbton. 
And the cinema is even more exactly as it was before. 
And this is all under strict supervision of the authority and with a small budget. 
"We often had to find a material that is good and cheap, and the Denkmalschutzamt did," Krischanitz says, and points to a raw soil should go. 
Despite all the constraints, problems and repairing the buildings remained flexible and easy. 
It would have been difficult with the pavilion, "the usual from Brussels," Krischanitz said recently, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-Geschichte." 
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "create a proper awareness." 
In this case, the 21er house but not in the wrong place, because it is an urban fluke: if the Swiss garden is completely new planned "main station home," with offices and homes. 
And maybe another stroke will occur: the 21er House could increase by another Krischanitz-Bau, because the Sammlerin Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art hall, and, as we hear, they have been negotiating with the city a good location in the Swiss garden. 
Rail plans krisen winter package in millions 
The railways have contained a krisen plan, designed to prevent the Zugausfalls in winter. 
The number of staff is to be doubled. 
It will cost millions. 
In the battle against winter Zugausfalls and delays, the Deutsche Bahn, according to a newspaper report this year, more than 70 million euros extra. 
The "picture" newspaper reported earlier, citing a company internal krisen plan, by 2015, investments are planned by a total of around EUR 300 million. 
This means that a better availability of cars and rail network should also be achieved in extreme Witterungs. 
The plan would include a doubling of internal and external staff for snow disposal at railway stations and rail will rise to 16 000 people. 
The goal is to train up to the start of the year and 90 percent of the necessary lights within four to five hours to get rid of snow and ice. 
Two months ago, railway chief Rudiger pit after a top-level meeting with government and industry Zugausfalls and delays also warned in this winter. 
Last winter, the railways had major problems in passenger traffic since it among other things in difficult weather conditions, a lack of reserves. 
Many new like that have been waiting for years for a licence from the bundesamt railway. 
In addition, there is a delay in the extradition of ICE-Zugs. 
The rail system is also to be created for years that they are axes of ICE-Zugs much more frequently in the workshop to check after a Cologne Central Station on board an Axis. 
Deutsche Bank pays millions in the US 
After the uproar over boss Josef Ackermann is new hardships from the United States: the German bank must pay a fine. 
As if the problems at home for the Deutsche Bank were not enough, the industry giant has now surpassed its past in the United States: the Frankfurt Institute pays in a comparison with 145 million dollars (106 million euros), to disputes over the collapse of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis. 
It is about the sale of mortgage papers. 
The financial market regulator NCUA raises a whole series of big banks, cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; they could have played down the risks. 
Such assets lost during the financial crisis and the banks were in depth. 
"We are satisfied that we have been able to resolve the issue without the parties had to go before the courts," said a deutsche spokesman in New York. 
The bank admitted no fault with the comparison. 
This also applies to Citigroup, which is the payment of 20.5 million dollars committed. 
The Debbie NCUA-Vorsitzende Matz welcomed the accommodation of the two houses. 
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US-Genossenschaftsbanken and jumps in defaults to protect the consumer. 
The NCUA is trying to replace the caused multibillion-dollar losses. 
The now closed comparisons are the first of its kind. 
The regulator had also attacked other large banks, and in the summer of JPMorgan Chase, among others, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs sued. 
The questionable mortgage papers are so-called mortgage backed Securities. 
These loans are based. 
As the bursting of the housing bubble in 2007, has a wide range of financial firms to the disaster. 
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, has swung the US investment bank Lehman Brothers. 
Even though the events have been a few years ago, blowing the banks in the United States, a strong wind. 
Investors and regulators have made numerous appeals, in order to obtain compensation or to punish misconduct. 
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave. 
It raises 18 international big banks, the two state US-Immobilienfinanzierer Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions in the volume of around 200 billion dollars to have taken advantage. 
The German bank has a complaint from the FHFA, we are talking here about several transactions worth a total of 14.2 billion dollars from the years 2005 to 2007. 
The regulator demanded that Frankfurt for "substantial losses," but without specifying an exact sum. 
The German bank had the claims as unfounded and says, want to defend themselves. 
Warren Buffett is rising with 10 billion in IBM 
Financial guru Buffett invested heavily in the IT companies IBM. 
Since March he has bought in the value of more than 10 billion dollars. 
Until now, the great American investor Warren Buffett always said, not in IT and computer companies to invest, because the long-term development of the firms only bad forecast. 
Now, however, he read the accounts of IBM and changed his mind about investing in the industry. 
He said much earlier must understand that IBM implied in particular services and computer systems for the IT-Abteilungen besch affe other businesses. 
An investment by Warren Buffett is regarded as the financial world. 
As a result, the IT-Urgestein IBM now call "Sir IBM." 
Because Buffett revealed now in US broadcaster CNBC that he since March IBM-Aktien bought in the value of 10.7 billion dollars. 
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway is one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent. 
Buffett said that not even IBM previously knew anything about the commitment. 
He praised the management, even in the economic crisis had not yet provided for decent returns. 
"You have done a fantastic job," said Buffett, on the strategy. 
IBM has long been on the lucrative IT-Services such as the operation of computer centers. 
The more than 100 years old computer pioneer also offers software and advice, as well as powerful corporate computers. 
Buffett had more technology companies shunned until now. 
He says he will only invest in companies whose business he can understand. 
Instead, Buffett, for example, in a freight railway, a schmiermittel manufacturer or machine engineers. 
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway owns, in addition to roughly 80 subsidiaries, including shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich getting further away. 
The 81 year-old person had in the 1960s, the small textile firm Berkshire Hathaway and wise investments into one of the most valuable companies in the world developed. 
However, it is his modest lifestyle. 
It is therefore for countless investors around the world to be a cult figure. 
His almost unmistakable sense for making money has given him the moniker "Oracle of Omaha." 
Following the announcement of buffett investments, the IBM-Aktie vorbörslich rose by one percent. 
"Big Blue," as IBM is known, is in the stock market as a whole more than 220 billion dollars and with Apple and Microsoft are the most valuable technology companies in the world. 
In the case of Microsoft, Buffett said, but he did not want to buy their own. 
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend. 
The threat is real 
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" Turkish media cast doubt on the German rule of law. 
One newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology," which is now auflebe again. 
The murders of eight Turkish and a Greek small businessman in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background. 
This news will be in Turkey and the Turkish people in Germany reacted with fear and concern. 
For many Turks, returns with a long totgeglaubt ghost: since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and at Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with right-wing extremist background against Turks. 
The fact that in Germany, there is xenophobia, however, was never in question. 
The right-wing extremist network, however, reveals proportions, whose dimension is still far from predictable. 
"Is back on the bloody ideology?," the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "turk." 
The newspaper 'Sabah', however, stressed that one of the perpetrators has been a V-Mann of the constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities might be involved in the far-right quagmire. 
Besonnen responded to the Turkish community in Germany: they remembered at the weekend with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate to the victims of racist violence. 
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish leaders in a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the Turkish anwerbe agreement. 
The cooperation was orchestrated in gaudy colours - as a history of success. 
As a slap in the face, because the reporting by some Turkish media: "Germany's gift to the umpteenth" is the headline of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X," which cites the background of the murder. 
The German version of the 'Hürriyet' it is not thought to be linked. 
"It starts to stink," reads the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci. 
He stressed that people had been killed, the taxes paid and their work is an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany had done. 
It will be extremely critical in Germany's Turkish Internet forums, the actions of the police and their discussion later success. 
Why the German authorities have not been invaded much more in extremist right-wing circles to search for suspects, the authors were surprised. 
Some shows at least rhetorically committed to drastic measures: "Will continue to be done carelessly, the migrants do nothing other than the defense and the armed forces." 
"This will probably be the best protection." 
"From the goodness of the Enlightenment and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very much on the internal peace in Germany," writes "selenium." 
What does it mean if the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks demonstrated by Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s. 
The photograph of the ruine fire of Solingen is deeply embedded in German and Turkish memory. 
Because no other event showed the Turks more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans, that mistrust and distance can lead to violence. 
However, the attacks schärften the sense on the Turkish side. 
The mistakes of the past are not repeated 
In the Turkish press was particularly criticized the failure of German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl, refused to visit the survivors of Mölln. 
After the arson attack in Solingen he sent a message of condolences to the Turkish President, at the funeral in Cologne but represented by his Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, Kinkel was then in his speech on how many charges was provided by the local Turks. 
Quite so, as berechne the value of a human being, according to the size of its tax revenues. 
The current Turkish media coverage shows once again how deep the distrust of many türkes since then in the abandonment of the rule of law. 
In addition to the efforts of an extensive investigation and reassessment of the extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany needs frank words. 
The Bank of Zürisee 
The abenteuerlichste bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but also in Switzerland. 
The UBS was nearly bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since stumbled from one crisis to the next. 
Now it is intended to send a German. 
For example, Axel Weber was not considered safe. 
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank was reported in July that he 2013, an almost equally spectacular new job: president of the Swiss bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step. 
Axel Weber was celebrating publicly praised the Swiss whether their beauty and UBS whether their newfound solidity and kind remarks about the future of my colleagues. 
"The UBS has managed the Turnaround." 
"I look forward to working with Kaspar vill and Oswald Grübel." 
But in September, it became clear that everything would be quite different. 
A trader of UBS in London had bypassed all security systems of the bank and around EUR 1.7 billion verzockt. 
UBS-Vorstandschef Oswald Grübel, not only famous bankers in Switzerland, had to go. 
The same is true of the UBS board president also wounded since then - and all ask: when is finally Axel Weber? 
It became known that Weber, the Bank of February 2012. 
And the ratsvorsitz management will accept it already in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday. 
Axel Weber will be tough. 
He is not a banker, economics professor and central banker, and would have had a einarbeitung time certainly needed. 
With a stroke he assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just demonstrated once again that they have long been the title of "Europe's biggest bank deserves." 
On the one hand, the UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and on the other hand has been reeling for years by a scandal in the next. 
Nothing, it seems, is the Swiss bank once so proud. 
It started in the financial crisis. 
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation. 
The image of the silent and sound, but also ausgebufften Swiss Vermögensverwalters she had combined with ambitious goals: they also wanted to have a very large number in investment banking. 
For example, the UBS managed with 1.6 trillion dollars in 2007, more money vermöge more customers than any other bank in the world. 
And it was on the other hand, as investment bank advanced into the League of the world's largest banks. 
This made sense. 
The former banker and subsequent long-running banking professor at Zurich Hans told me: "I have my students UBS was always portrayed as being a good bank." 
"From today's perspective, you wonder: how could I be wrong?" 
It was huge. 
In 2007, it was the first time it appears that something went wrong in the UBS. 
In the middle of the year, Chief Executive Peter Wuffli resigned unexpectedly, until such time as highly intellectual and equally brilliant bankers. 
A few months later, you guessed why he was gone. 
The investment division of the bank had been verzockt with sub-prime mortgage papers and had to write off billions. 
In order to cope with this, UBS announced a capital increase of as much as 13 billion francs. 
There was real investors, however, some of which until shortly before the nose would have been gerümpft: an obscure Asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth funds, which was so secretive that not even learned his name. 
But that was only the first blow. 
In April 2008, there have been worse. 
The bank has had to announce new billion losses, board president Marcel Ospel, in 2006, the second-best paid board of Switzerland, resigned. 
In October 2008, followed by the disaster: the UBS was given their bad investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the state. 
The National Bank of UBS bought problematic securities for tens of billions, the Swiss Confederation was six billion francs for a mandatory convertible loan, on which it could be Miteigentümerin of the bank. 
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because she saw how dramatic it is a small country when it is so big banks. 
After all, the assets of UBS in 2007, more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see graphic display). 
"Once again, we could not save the UBS," banking researcher says. 
The first disaster was the second. 
Even a few months surrendered the UBS in tax dispute with the United States and indicated it was prepared to release vermöge customers, who may have evaded taxes with the help of the bank. 
They also agreed to a payment of 780 million dollars, and repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions, including criminal premium. 
In doing so, the UBS known more or less open to have helped in terms of tax evasion. 
At the same time she lost something that has always been their capital was in the competition for wealthy clients: the aura of secrecy. 
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same. 
It was followed by the resignation of chief executive officer and board president. 
And the exodus of client money. 
For example, the bank within a few months their credibility lost in two key portfolios: investment banking through speculation and asset management with the help of tax evasion. 
And just when it was a bit quiet again, just when you thought that UBS will now have to get back, because these unfortunate traders' story follows: an individual trader verzockt 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realises that something goes wrong. 
And it is obvious that the risk management works in investment banking, it is still not clear. 
"With the Adoboli case, we must note that risk control too little has changed," says Martin Janssen, an economist and finance professor at the Institute of the University of Zurich. 
The financial chief of a large German bank is safe: "The problem of UBS is that they risk control is not in control." 
It was exactly the idea of the caution with which the Swiss bankers were lined up for a long time, the guardian of the great wealth of the world: not too great risks for safety for money - didn't want to collapse the world on the other side of the Alpine republic. 
The vaults of Swiss banks were the symbol of unwavering reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate. 
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits the stereotype of the solid Swiss private bank - it is just a bit bigger. 
The situation is classic. 
The bank has its headquarters in Zurich station from the Central Station from directly leads to the Zürichsee, the frames from the snow covered peaks of the Swiss mountains. 
The buildings here are magnificent, the rent is among the highest in Europe. 
Juweliere like Tiffany is taking place here between Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli. 
For centuries the Swiss banks: the National Bank on the palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bear. 
The reception room of UBS is breaking through a heavy revolving door. 
The walls are Drinnen marble dressed, thick leather chair, along with the bank logo is a great sign for the "safe." 
The UBS knows what the customer wants here: security. 
This idea of the Swiss bank, both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point - or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank. 
His name he would not like to read in the newspaper, he is, after all, like all Swiss bankers, even with the two big banks doing business. 
The UBS had become far too large, it is taking place - particularly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons had spread. 
The Swiss would have nothing more to say. 
"But if they have long since been adapted to the habits of the Anglo-Saxons." 
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, which changed the UBS, its first high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution by the subprime jungle lost so much money as the Swiss bank. 
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was visible. 
"On that Wednesday, the ruling coalition in the small seven million-dollar country the biggest bailout in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "the UBS-Crash." 
Up to 68 billion francs, or about EUR 45 billion devoted to the politicians, in order to save the big bank standing before the bankruptcy. 
How did it happen? 
When you talk with Swiss bankers, they see the problem above all in the size of UBS. 
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss big banks, together with a huge corporation. 
It was a bank in the merger was too big for the small Swiss - and grew more and more. 
It helped that the two different banks, supplemented the UBS: a rich, but lazy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but more internationalisierte. 
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers were favourable to much money with which they were able to turn a huge wheel. 
There are two names with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, the CEO's of UBS, Marcel Ospel, who was then chairman of the board of directors. 
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says researcher Hans. 
"Wuffli, intellektuelle, modest, understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the hard man of the bank and has worked at the top." 
But Ospel had left at the end to Wuffli. 
Wuffli was at the end probably made a crucial mistake: "He thought that his models are the reality," he says. 
"This is a tragic case." 
The tragedy, perhaps. 
It is clear that excess came before the case. 
UBS staff clearly remember the meetings at which CEO's Wuffli repeated the same slogan: Goldman Sachs Dethrone. 
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world. 
She led the "League Tables" in the rankings, which documented the success of the banks of the time. 
This was going to UBS, according to the top. 
Some steps have already been achieved it. 
In the foreign exchange business and stock trading was very high. 
Business advisers, who have been charged, but stressed a weakness: in the international business interest in the bank "Fixed Income," there is a huge gap on the largest banks. 
The UBS have gaps in American mortgage products. 
In order to close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that they almost claimed the existence. 
Hungrig for growth, both invested, the bank itself, as well as a confirmation of hedge funds in the US subprime assets. 
It became a huge machine, the securities on American mortgage loans and verpackte - but also risks themselves. 
Even more than other banks have long sought the exit. 
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the US real estate market was in flames, UBS has bought there," says banking analyst. 
This great euphoria, so deep in the case. 
A manager after the other had to go and clean up the trials more difficult than expected. 
UBS has been the weapon and are still shaky. 
Anyone who now leads the Grand Bank, has an almost impossible job. 
He must find a strategy for a bank, all obvious business models are loss. 
Banking researcher has already an idea: stop the investment banking, concentrating on asset management, return to the Swiss roots. 
So far, the bank does not want to (yet). 
But the investment banking firm is expected to shrink, so much is already clear. 
On Thursday to the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti of the world about its future strategy. 
The 51 years old schweizer italo was only intended as an interim solution, as the bank surprisingly separated from predecessor Grübel. 
In the meantime he has asserted that he continued to lead the business of UBS, told the Zurich bank on Tuesday. 
Ermotti wants the investment bank in the state in the 1990s. 
3 500 posts he points out. 
But this will not be enough. 
The UBS needs a vision. 
Who is it? 
What they want to earn money? 
These are the questions that Axel Weber is safe now. 
Publicly he has so far only says he will begin an apartment with his wife in Zurich. 
Next year.

Smart Krähen in cities 
In many places, Saatkrähen are seen as "problem birds," but from the cities the highly intelligent animals no longer drive a long time ago, experts say. 
Some people, they may want to get rid of the other very quickly: Krähen for centuries are part of the city, but in many communities there are mounting anwohner complaints about dirt and noise of the animals. 
It is a means to combat the "birds" have not yet in sight. 
Saatkrähen are no longer out of the cities, said experts at the first krähe symposium in ostfriesisch Leer. 
They consulted experts on possible ways out of the entire federal territory. 
They are looking for alternatives in the towns. 
Conservationists led the problems in cities to the rural exodus of the most protected krähes seed: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly vernichte the traditional habitats. 
The hunt, increasingly building and the cases of typical trees breeding birds made life difficult. 
Krähen are under protection of nature. 
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding mate, among other things in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest, among other things, in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer. 
It was in 2005, a controversial project to the mass killing of Krähes in the district for negative publicity. 
Critics had the trapping of animals in wild birds and deployed with cudgels described as particularly brutal. 
"The normal displacement, the Vergrämen, brings nothing," the city and schaft county planner Werner Klöver from Leer said. 
Nestboxes are wegspritzen with water or trees, often have unintended consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred Emperor from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg. 
"The animals are made up of large colonies divide and spread to other areas." 
Vergrämung is only as an exception to hospitals, Altersheimen or schools. 
"We have to live with them, we will no longer be away from them." 
Without the surrounding area will not solve the problem in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang waiter from Leer. 
It could be a combination of Vergrämen the animals from sensitive residential areas and offered to resettle them in other places. 
"Information boards rather than chain saws," against the psychologist and Uta Maria Ethnologin Jürgens for an entirely different approach to the animals: "A Pickel in the face, we can best endure self-confident." 
Jürgens had in Schleswig-Holstein the ash Krähen-Lehrpfad, which notices information about the lives of the highly intelligent seed krähes. 
The project will now have already been adopted by tourists. 
In addition to the criticism of the noise of the birds had Jürgens own opinion: "There is plenty of communication that have a lot to say." 
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Saatkrähen not only use tools to come to a biscuit, but as a tool for its tool even itself. 
Researchers at the University of Cambridge testing recently at four Saatkrähen, how far the intelligence of the birds. 
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they must bring down with stones a structure so as to arrive at a motte larve. 
Without much training realized they determined the size and shape a stone platform to collapse. 
In a second attempt had the smart Krähes then solve a knifflig problem. 
In a hat, the researchers had placed a small eimer with a motte larve. 
The birds could not reach their prey. 
However, the researchers had them wire. 
This shaped all four animals a snag, with whose help they will be the eimer angelten at the top of the bag. 
Three of the four Saatkrähen were even at first.

Mass slaughter on a personal level 
Einfühlsam and generous begins Peter Englunds new book, "beauty and horror: a History of the First World War, told in nineteen Schicksalen" with a long list of protagonists to heart. 
Here is a tip, as you could do: cut off the side of caution and make it to your readers. 
They are the people in Englunds romanhafter narrative know each other very well, and these protagonists as your GPS function as a beacon in these few moments, in which you as Englunds men and women lost in the fog of war and are deprived of their illusions. 
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist. 
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for literature. 
He has written an unusual book that he was not incorrect as "a work of history." 
It contains only a few big names and big contracts or famous battles, and there are hardly any ambassadors, reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment. 
It is not so much a book about what happened, he says, but rather "a book about how it was." it is of "feelings, ideas, experiences and sentiments." 
"Beauty and horror" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less concealed men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and Botanikern to mountaineers, doctors, drivers and office workers. 
Some of these people are heroes. 
Some prisoners of war, lose limb will be crazy or die. 
Each of these lives flackert such as the Votivkerzen in a church, some, while others lapse. 
Englunds book differs from the usual history books. 
It also corrected the notion that the First World War had just been the devastating war on the West Front. 
"Beauty and horror" with experts on other war zones: the Alps, the Balkans, the Ostfront, Mesopotamia, East Africa. 
The soldiers are covered in this book baskets' celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsefliegen is an insoluble problem. 
This is almost from the beginning of a very moving book. 
The war flooded the lives of these people as a natural disaster like a hurricane Katrina, which smells like Kordit. 
Imagine that you are a woman who is home with their children, and cannon fire is heard in the distance, and I urge you, or you take the flight? 
Who is at all? 
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all. 
"There is a lack of facts," Englund says so, "guesswork, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories abound, dreams, aufgemöbelt Alpträumen and rumour." 
"Beauty and horror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard, a young German matrosen. 
Their stories were mainly memoirs, letters and other already published material. 
Your reports can be frightening or poignant, but they are very vivid in Englunds the details of verliere nden collection of small moments. 
Many of them act of omission and Behelfen. 
The story of a German schoolgirls told him: "Substitute, everywhere." 
"Kaffee, false aluminium, false gummi extremist groups, wooden buttons." 
He tells us more about the dinner in Germany. 
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and Hammelfett (and most recently was served with a false bones from wood), tobacco, which was made from dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes, which were besohlt with wood." 
There was, as he noted, "837 registered substitute foods that were allowed in the manufacture of sausages, 511 registered coffee." 
Some stories act of honor and bravery. 
An American acknowledges his own drive for ferocity and says about the war: "We feel that this is, after all, what was planned for men rather than to sit on the Lehnstuhl, with the evening newspaper or the bestselling book and a cigarette and a whisky in hand, and to do so, as a façade civilization and as if there were no barbarism behind its own strengthened and besch were brust hemd." 
Conversely, a British soldier acknowledges that he will probably die and no one notice or will look into this. 
"If the idea to sacrifice themselves, we would like to think that this is happening before an audience," he writes. 
Instead, it is so terrible as "a condemned man, who was hanged in secret." 
Other observations from the old Europe, which falls apart, and on new types of terror. 
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," Englund writes, "a war between the factories." 
He starts the arrival of what he called "a new species in the Bestiarium of the new century," says: "The word and ideologically convinced mass murderer in the suit, the poor, while he sits behind a desk." 
People behave in unexpected ways, and there are also appears behaviour such as Heroismus. 
Englund is discussing the soldiers who actively sought a prostitute being infected with a venereal disease, in order to escape the frontline service. 
"The grotesque expression of what can be found in trade with Gonokokken-Eiter, because soldiers bought and grease on their genitals, in the hope to come to the hospital," he writes. 
"Those who were really desperate, rieben him in the eyes, which meant that the rest of their lives were blind." 
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves Englunds poetry is sleek, but decent and fits perfectly with its human task. 
In dozens of small scenes he starts the way, as the war "in a unique way, entfesselte uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred." 
The people are beginning to ask themselves why their leaders fighting them. 
The best books on the First World War were often more distorted as Paul Fussells "Great War and Modern Gallery Memory" or Romane such as Erich Maria Remarques "is nothing new in the West" as a comprehensive history books. 
Englunds band is an unconventional black hall. 
His book is the most devastating of which I have ever read in a book. 
I admit that there is no longer. 
But it is, as he would have us with his book this side with the protagonists in the faces of weggeschnappt and lit with a match. 
After an early misstep, a meticulously planned assault 
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing T-shirts. 
They had chosen the night of Monday to Tuesday because very few people at this time in Zucotti Park. 
The operation was kept secret and only a few senior officials have been informed, and all the other initially believed to participate in an exercise. 
Police chief Raymond W. Kelly was in the middle of them, and his presence underscored the fact that the operation was fraught with challenges. 
The events of the last few weeks as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the Dezernat and the besetzers house was a huge increase in public sympathy, were no longer allowed to repeat itself. 
And so was the police action on the removal of the protesters from the Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training carried out. 
Officials had prepared for this by observing how seizures were handled in other cities. 
A Katastrophenübung, with a view to Zuccotti alls Iceland took place. 
Officials reinforced the so-called chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid Verlegen of a large number of police officers - in order to focus on lower Manhattan. 
The last training unit took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River. 
The orders to recover in the park was "at the last minute," said someone with the command is familiar, which for a declaration as an "exercise." 
"The few police officers who were involved in my knowledge, did not know that it was about the Zuccotti park," said someone who wants to remain anonymous. 
"The only one who knew that it went to the Zuccotti park were the senior officials of the department." 
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned. 
On 14 October, officials wanted to remove the park, but differed when hundreds of Protestlers came together after they had learned from these plans. 
Officials of various police units were involved in the operation on Tuesday, including Einsatzkommandos from the entire city - hundreds of mobile officials, normally used in high crime neighborhoods. 
Mr. Kelly said that in the course of the day many people in the park and, almost like commuters, so that 1 o'clock in the night is a good time to go. 
"It was appropriate to do so if the smallest number of people residing in the park," he said. 
Ambulances stood with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers before the departure of the Pike that becomes increasingly and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive in the vicinity of the Manhattan Bridge. 
The lights and the previously recorded messages from the dröhnten, many of them seemed to intimidate protesters. 
When public officials in their pale blue jackes broke into the park, many protesters simply rafften their belongings and left the place. 
The police said that up to 1:45 pm no tents would be tackled, in order to give the Protestlers time, their possessions together. 
Other teams have been seen by officials as they gathered in the vicinity to intervene, arrests should be necessary in the park. 
Reporters were forced to leave the park. 
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police chief, said that this had happened to their own security. 
But many journalists say that they wanted to stop them to monitor the police operations in the park, and they said that the management of civil servants would have been very violent. 
Mr. Browne said that in the Church Street, television trucks had been on the west side of the park photographs. 
When the police towards the West by the great jumble of personal items of the protesters, among other bags, plastic and Tüten clothes, followed by its employees of the cleaning of the city, which removed what was left behind. 
Some protesters, who refused to go were towed out. Pictures of this has been a short time later appeared on the Internet. 
One of the main leaders of Protestlers was in the vicinity of the kitchen area of the camp in the centre of the park position. 
Some erected barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests. 
Around 10 people in the epicenter of the camp on their hands. 
And two people would chain themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said. 
Civil protection officials were called to loszuschneiden them. 
As Mr. Kelly said, until around 3:30 no arrests were carried out in the park. 
The evacuation was completed after 75 minutes, according to the police. 
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park. 
Among the most arrests, as he said it was due to "ungebührlichen behavior and resistance to an arrest." 
It was the most prominent official in the field of Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed official in the department. 
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the police officers, was also there. 
Despite his presence ,"" Mr. Kelly, "the operation was not," as Mr. Browne said. 
In the event that they should use a second group of officials on the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street. 
In the Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and in the Pine Street, a block further south, Barrikaden were built. 
It could be observed, as these sites from the police around the Zuccotti park around as well. 
It has been observed at one place, as several officials, many of them with shields, people out there. 
Around 28 people were in the northern region. 
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park. 
5 o'clock jumped to the south of the Pine Street protesters on the roof of a police car and other demonstrators left the air from the tyres of a Polizeibus. 
At one point, the crowd is a bit of Sperrholz. 
In the end, a civil servant and a protesters came to the hospital. 
Union of carers will take legal action against the city because of layoffs 
The union, the hundreds of school managers, who last month lost their jobs, is planning to sue the city on Wednesday, as layoffs because of their disproportionate influence on the schools, which teach poor students, are not necessary and discriminatory. 
The lawsuit is probably the last chance the union, county council 37, in their efforts to reverse the layoffs, is still open. 
Six hundred seventy-two school workers, child care coordinators and other staff members with the lowest paid employees of the city and were on 7 October in a move had lost their jobs, the trade union leader and political revenge have described that last year the city access to a health care fund, the working groups, had refused, with which the budgetary gap should be closed. 
This accusation has been categorically rejected by the authorities. 
At a hearing of the council said Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, in the last month, the layoffs were part of the budget that was passed in June. 
A member of the council shot back and told him that spezifiziere had nothing in the budget that the school aid workers would be laid off. 
Officials from the City Council 37 said they had warned the Ministry of Education before a complaint, and on Wednesday there will be a press conference at which the submission of the case before the Supreme Court in Manhattan will be formally announced. 
The complaint is Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education listed the city as defendants and eight laid-off workers count as plaintiffs, all of whom are nonwhite or Latin American women, like most of the aid workers who have lost their jobs. 
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice of the city, said that the city was not the case, and therefore could not comment on their individual claims. 
According to a draft copy of the New York Times, the union has been on the number of redundancies at the schools concentrated in the slums of the city, in order to support a complaint about unequal treatment; they claim that poor schools have lost more workers, because they are chronically underfunded. 
It lays down that, while there are no layoffs on Staten Island, and only a few layoffs in the schools of the Upper East Side and TriBeCa, 17 school workers in District 23 in ville, Brooklyn, have lost and 46 workers in the districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx were dismissed. 
With the loss of five of the eight school workers in the public school in Harlem, 36, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, were employed, the complaint says: "This is not a neighborhood betuchter parents can organise the donations to offset budget cuts." 
P. S.: the budget of the 36th Distrikts this year was cut by 3,26 percent, but it also lost money when the city of its calculation method for the extra funding for any urban vine changed. 
The union also complained that the head of the high schools by the language in a memo were headed in the wrong approach, which authorized the release of the care coordinators. 
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the act, even if "excess" (German) in the United States usually the switch of a teacher from the payroll describes a school in a pool of available workers who are paid by the central office. 
"Sechsundsechzig care coordinators have been laid off," says the draft. 
The mission ended, Congress prepared to Libya 
Ultimately, it looks as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington have to agree on the riots in Libya. 
Everything which was necessary to do so was the success of the revolt, the arrest and assassination of the longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the cessation of American interference. 
On Thursday, the Committee on International Relations decides the Senate a resolution, which the chairman, John Kerry (Massachussetts), along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), with Libya for the successful rebellion and US troops for their "courage" praises. 
"This resolution is a tribute to the courageous people of Libya, who have started with the reconstruction of their country," said Kerry. 
"It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties." 
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the debate. 
This summer, lawmakers from both parties and the White House over the wording of a number of resolutions for approval or condemnation of the role of the US military in the Libyan mission of NATO. 
In June, Kerry and McCain, a resolution which restricted the use of military force authorized by the United States in Libya. 
The law has been in the Senate rejected by a broad fringe of both parties, and there was no vote. 
But on the same day, this bill in the Senate, the House also approved a decision to cut funding for US operations in Libya. 
As a result, the US-Mission got into a kind of legislative fege fire - with a Congress that may have been angry enough, Obama's approach to criticise, within the framework of the mission, but not angry enough to him once the rug from under our feet. 
Then there was the indecision of Congress overtaken by the events. 
Tripoli fell in August by the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October. 
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October. 
Now, the Senate may be ready to act. 
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulated the people of Libya for their enormous courage and their extraordinary perseverance in their self-liberation" and "praises the men and women of the US military and its coalition partners, who support military operations to protect the people in Libya, for their exceptional courage and professionalism." 
The resolution also reaffirmed "the national interests of the United States to a successful and irrevocable Libya's transition to democracy." 
Will the new measures the full support of the body responsible for foreign relations or they will divide the legislators, as did the Act of June? 
The latest version of the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (indiana), the spitzen republikaner of the committee. 
Lugars spokesman said on Monday that he has so far been the final version of the new law had not yet seen. 
According to Capitol Hill, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment, which calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congressional legislaturperiode of the Republicans and some Democrats. 
The measures under the leadership of the Republican Bob (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment of the budget or any other area in time to vote in the Senate or Congress. 
Other legislators have so far tried unsuccessfully to bring their amendments to the vote, although they tried often enough. 
Lattes amendment is only one of 68 constitutional amendments, which were presented to the Congress and include a whole range of issues. 
Some are double - the same law was also presented both the Congress and the Senate - while others differ only slightly. 
There are only in the Senate at least 15 versions of the haushaltsänderung compensation and a further dozen "federal spending under control." 
Some of the laws are identical, but they give their customers - particularly rookie with the Republicans, who want to burnish their CV - the opportunity to boast that they are such a measure "written." 
The Budgetary Control Act, which was adopted in August, requires that both the Senate and Congress will vote on an amendment to the budget adjustments. 
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution, which supports the idea of such a change. 
In addition to the budget, some members want to see the number of provisions that members of Congress can present limit, while the Republicans, José E. Serrano (New York), the limit of two terms of office of the president wants to lift. 
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments, which, among other things, the right to guarantee a good education and health care. 
One amendment, which prohibits a marriage of equal gender, as well as an amendment, which prohibits the burning of flags, a recurring presentation. 
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws, when two drittel of the states they reject. 
For example, how to propose the changes so much faster than in the past few years. 
In the 111th Congress, legislators 77 such changes, 110; Congress 66. 
The pace pales in comparison to that of the early 1990s, in which members regularly more than 150 amendments proposed every two years, according to the figures, which the Senate Library is available. 
But they were not much more successful than today. 
The last amendment added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to the Congress already in 1789. 
"Getroffen, but not defeated," Giffords in the first television interview after the attack 
Ten months after an armed man in the near distance during an election meeting in Tucson had shot at them, the republika woman was Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) Monday evening on national television, and they sang alone on the Broadway-Stück, "the Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than the return to the Congress. 
When they, along with Diane Sawyer in the ABC-Nachrichten "20/20," they struggled for words and needed help in walking. 
The programme showed the heavy slow recovery from the damage that the bullet that divided their Schädel, the left side of her brain drill and its head of crosses in front to the back, has done. 
Three months ago she unexpectedly returned to the Congress, triumphantly cast their vote on the debt cutbacks. 
In her first television interview after the attack in January in which six people were killed and 13 were injured, Gifford was smiling, laughed and sang - and described their recovery as "difficult." 
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford replied (41): "It is very good." 
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" Specials, shortly before the publication of the new book by the couple was recorded: "Gabby: a story about courage and hope." 
The Special pursued Giffords recovery since the attack on 8 January. 
In videos that Kelly had been recorded in the first few weeks, you can see it in the hospital bed, with bare lands shaved head and a long scarf on the cheek. 
It can only one or two fingers when her husband encouraged them. 
Months later, Giffords sits in a rolling chair, while therapists show how she carries out simple movements. 
A nodding in the head. 
A Zucken with the Germans. 
And then, her first words: "What." 
After a few days ago Giffords whispered another word: "Toast." you want to change their breakfast. 
Videos, which took place in the ABC-Show show that music is an important role in Giffords ' recovery: you can see how the members of Congress, along with the therapists to Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wanna have Fun" and Tom Pettys "free Fallin" singing. " 
In the interview with Sawyer said Giffords, who every day spent two hours with therapy, that she could not remember the day of the attack. 
Her husband said that Giffords on 12 March an article from a newspaper had read about the assassination when they interrupted him, and for the first time, asked about the six people who were killed during the attack. 
The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and forced medical treatment, while he was waiting for his trial. 
"Many people have died," Giffords told Sawyer. 
"Hart, tough, tough." 
In the course of the recovery of his wife, Kelly, told Sawyer, she said: "I was hit." 
"So, I would say: 'Gabby, you got to be defeated?'," said Kelly. 
You just got to be taken. 
And you will be, and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before. 
Troops feel more compassion than respect 
The event was a Wall Street gala, the millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City. 
Kid Rock sang a Ballade about helplessness, frustration and loss. 
In a word collected hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him. 
The amount in black Smoking stood up and applauded. 
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organised the donation campaign in the spring. 
A senior military officer at the gala, which, among other things, by the chief of staff and then chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen has been observed, saw the role of the troops in a different way. 
"They were introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an Email. 
I am sure that the organizers have good intentions. 
I know that. 
But there was no respect, not really, but it was compassion. 
The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public. 
The troops are to be commended for their victims. 
But the praise has its price, members say. 
The public is increasingly behaving as if their people in uniform suffering. 
"We were not victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan. 
"But apparently is the only way of supporting those who are to put ourselves in the unfortunate souls." 
The issue is extremely sensitive for military leaders, who are not ungrateful or in dispute with the public, which they want to appear. 
They also have recognized that the anger, the returning troops in the last few years of the Vietnam War, was far worse. 
As a result talks about compassion in silence and private between war veterans. 
After his two sons have returned from battles with the navy, warned Colonel ex-army Mark Cancian that people outside the military world their service could be seen from two different perspectives. 
Some people would consider with a sense of awe, as rebels were defeated and traveled to exotic places. 
Others would wonder whether an "angry, violent veteran beneath the surface," says Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and a senior government posts after his return to Washington. 
During his job search, he said he felt that some of the interviewer erfragten subtle, whether he was the same after his return from the struggle to cope with the pressure of a demanding job in Washington. 
"If you speak about your service, you must keep the negative impressions about it," says Cancian his sons. 
The lack of ease of the military is rooted partly in Americans' lack of interest in the war. 
Services on the battlefield of a country that has little experience with the military and little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, is rarely singled out as praise. 
"We as a nation do not appreciate military heroism more so, as it was absolutely normal in the Second World War," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded the US forces in Afghanistan. 
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely due to the suffering of a service member. 
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends who have lost them, or for the severity of their injuries. 
The military is growing pressure to crack down on rape 
This week, an important hearing is to decide whether 28 women and men for failing to intervene in a rape to be charged before the military court. 
If it does not happen, there are hundreds of prosecutor ready for the next hearing. 
Obergefreite Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11 weeks pregnant when she was raped by a colleague. 
It was in October 2008, and she has just returned to their barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from the dinner with a friend when she met with a male colleague, a 12er pile of beer. 
He asked them whether they should accompany a drink in her room. 
"My alarm bells went on," Lyman said. 
But the Texanerin wischte put aside their concerns. 
I thought: ' Oh, what he is 19. 
He is from Texas," she said. 
"I wish I would have listened to my gut feeling." 
A few minutes after they had gone to Lymans room, the man behind her, put her down and raped her, she said. 
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military officials fearful of a process with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether a complaint against the former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be allowed in court. 
The complaint alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld did not oppose the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers are tackled. 
In February of Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, DC, the complaint was initially comprised 17 plaintiffs, but in the next few months rose to 28:25 women and three men, who all claim that they are soldiers who have been raped or sexually abused, and that the military failed to identify, convict or a proper administration of justice after the alleged attack to make them available. 
Burke says she has the top military leadership, because the problem begins there. 
"The military is hierarchical," she says. 
"Who are the individuals who are in the position, the culture of retribution to eradicate the leadership." 
Burke also says that since February nearly 400 other survivors contacted, many of them part of future complaints could be. 
Their strategy: instead that all claimants will lay their eggs in one basket, if necessary, they file many more lawsuits, in order to maintain the pressure. 
The defence team for the Department of Defense, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has submitted a request to reject a complaint. 
The files of the court, the week before, detailed defence strategy, first and foremost, that the military is not current or former soldiers can be prosecuted for violations, which occurred in the armed forces. 
On the basis of a law by the Supreme Court in 1950, the so-called Feres-Doktrin, the government is not liable for injuries inflicted on active service soldiers. 
"The alleged damage caused during the military service of the plaintiff," the document says. 
The Ministry of Defence refused any comment on this story. 
Things have changed since the 1950s. 
If women are still not allowed to serve in the fight, the distinction lies in the name: modern wars have only rarely clear fronts. 
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, teams of soldiers are increasingly important roles, particularly in contact with indigenous women in the war zones. 
The result: between these two wars killed 150 soldiers, two thirds of them in hostilities. 
It is time that the armed forces will be modernised, says Burke. 
And it is in their fight not alone: three other lawsuits are pending. 
At the Yale Law School, is the veteran ' Legal Services Clinic a complaint against the four main military academies because of alleged promotion of a hostile atmosphere. 
Collects small independent non-profit Vietnam veteran of America's a complaint against the military, which focuses on the diagnosis of "personality disorder," which received rape victims to dismiss them out of the service - a standard approach, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group. 
In December the group filed a complaint against the veteran administration (management of the war veterans), in which their discriminatory practices in its dealings with entitlements for people who have been sexually abused at the service. 
Nine laws have been independent of each other by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties presented to the Congress, which will provide a series of clues. 
In 2010, according to the sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (Office for preventing and reporting sexual abuse) of the Ministry of Defense reported 3 158 sexual abuse. 
But most of the abuses are not reported at all, and after the Pentagon's own estimate takes into account the number of approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19 000 cases per year. 
The report, which was published in March, also examines the legal trends: in 2010, 20% of registered cases in the military court, only half as many as in civil law. 
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of trauma. 
In Lymans case, they reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack. 
On this night, she says, she was asked 11 times, the details of her rape of a whole series of police officers, doctors and Befehlshabern to tell. 
She had a Vergewaltigungsset and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed. 
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge during the hearing she was asked about the sex she had the assault with her friend. 
Six people said as a character in the name of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted. 
"I still remember the day when the verdict was read out," Lyman says. 
"I thought the labor would use. I ran screaming from the courtroom." 
"They brought me into the psychiatric department and I remember that when I came out again, I said to my commander: this was not his trial, and that was my trial." 
Lyman was invited to visit a military psychiater, in the end, a diagnostizierte personality disorder and declared them incompetent. 
In January 2010, she was sacked dishonourable, so that it receives no support. 
Whether or not the complaint, the Lyman and the other claimants have submitted is pure speculation, says John Turley, a professor of jurisprudence at the George Washington University Law School. 
Nevertheless, he notes: "I think they should move forward." 
As far as between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticized since, for the first time it has been called into question. 
I am a critic of the Feres-Doktrin. 
The military lags a decade later, because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence, which entails a liability. 
He adds: "The odds are against them... but it is important for them that they are trying to do." 
These things will only change if good people are ready to fight. 
If the hearing does not follow their path, Burke, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, with their hundreds of other plaintiffs start for future cases. 
"We will continue to fight the military in this regard, until it comes to reform," she says. 
Or until we die, whatever happens as the first. 
The walls have eyes: how do you watch researchers on Facebook 
Before he become the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe was Anders Behring Breivik only one of many boys, their anti-einwanderungs online programs. 
On Monday, Breivik, who has been on a killing spree in Norway in July, in which 77 people were killed, his first public hearing before the court. 
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has much time until his attack on its computers and with some of the millions of gechattet by nationalists, the far-right groups on behalf of social support networks. 
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out about these people. 
But how will they be? 
This is easy - you just need to log on Facebook. 
"We have found that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recently published report by the British think-tank DEMOS on the digital populism in Europe. 
Were books hiding place of personal data is so enzyklopädisch, Bartlett says that the researchers simply must use the promotional tool of their desired demographic data to determine exactly with scientific accuracy - as do retailers for years. 
Bartletts team found half a million supporters of extreme-right groups throughout Europe and then visierte them with Adds, but instead with a new band or a new dieting product Adds users invited to a survey in which, according to their level of education, their attitude towards violence and the assessment has been asked for their own future. 
Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to more than 10 000 supporters of 14 extremely right-wing parties to consult in 11 European countries - without that they had to leave their offices. 
"It is a fairly new research method," Bartlett says. 
Some of the results come as no surprise; online promoters of extreme-right groups are mostly young, male and resent immigration. 
But in a way surprising meanings are "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism more sensible, more democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens." 
DEMOs work is just one example, as Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists. 
Factories, medical researchers and political scientists use to study everything from health issues to social trends such as "Likes" texting and aktualisierungen status. 
With more than 800 million active users, on average three to add content per day, were books generated "data supernova explosion," a research boom, the number of scientific work with the name of this side of the title in the last five years to almost 800% increase. 
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you could study people from this side, which is usually not met with his Clipboard on the street. 
"If you had previously tried to consult the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them." 
"They first had to inform the party and they should never have been admitted," Bartlett says. 
"Facebook is all away - you go directly to them." 
Others say that the page offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems. 
A recent study by Dr Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their binge on Facebook, significantly more prone to drink than students who remained silent on this issue. 
Moreno suggests that same students, for example housing adviser, monitor and help a student if they postet too many aktualisierungen. 
"You cannot solve a problem if you have not seen it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko-Autor and head of the Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, the Washington Post. 
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children, who would not have been found in a different way." 
Facebook also constantly zapft the data of its own people. 
The data team has statistics on the status and Valentine's Day, turnout in the midterm elections in 2010 and a national happiness index (although data have been used primarily on the Facebook access only - champions digital freedom have known for a long time that their large data rich source for others should make available for research purposes. 
But users of Facebook know that they watched the side, whether or not they want it, with a friend, the thousands of miles away, Scrabble to play the part of the losses in their own personal data. 
But what if the users of Facebook, part of a survey of which they still do not even know anything? 
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines, such as their offline data collected online, everything is permitted. 
"I do not believe that many users have even thought about the fact that researchers could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge lab, a study from the year 2006, in which he looked side of students on Facebook. 
"As far as they are concerned, it was only about them and their friends." 
Then there is the question of the methodology. 
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research is absolutely honest. 
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the claims made in a user profile, and in speeches are true. 
"What you say on Facebook and what you make outside of Facebook, are two completely different things," Selwyn says. 
That is why Selwyn thinks, despite his years as technology researchers, that a Clipboard and a pen still are the best research tools, anyone can use. 
"There is no substitute for it to go into the real world and to speak with real people," he says. 
"Social research must be concerned about the social dimension - and plenty of social life is still offline." 
"Kalt and inhumane": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court 
Behring Breivik, the man who has been two Amokläufe this summer in Norway, 77 people were killed, even in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighters. 
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and Norway," he said before a courtroom with more than 500 people. 
"I object to the court, because you have received your mandate of organizations supporting hate ideology and because it is supported by the Multiculturalism." 
"I recognize the laws, but I am not guilty." 
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, because he "Breivik did not want to give the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views." 
For the same reason he refused to Breivik, a mitbrachte in advance written permission at the end of the hearing to appeal to the families of his victims. 
Nesheim also ordered that the police Breivik for 12 more weeks remains in custody, he four weeks has no access to the media, and he said that the authorities all visits and all correspondence will be closely monitored over eight weeks. 
Around 30 survivors and relatives of the victims took part in the hearing. 
Some came in the hope that Breivik will be able to see in the eyes, while others wanted the confirmation that he remains behind bars and bars. 
They all took part with the aim that everything boils down to a Wegschließen. 
"I thought he is cold and inhuman," a survivor told Utoya the Norwegian broadcaster NRK. 
"It was unpleasant, but for me it is a bit further, after I have seen and heard the suspects." 
Breivik was wearing a dark suit and a blue tie and looked calm and professional during the entire hearing; he looked journalists and survivors in the eyes when he entered the building and left again. 
Despite the Breiviks bizarre suggestion that he would be part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge came to the conclusion that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices. 
It may have fallen to some that the attacks of 22 July was apparently the work of an individual extremists and not a group radicals. 
But that automatically makes it easier for the pain and confusion that still feels a whole nation? 
"I wish he would look like a monster, but he does not do this," said the relatives of the victims. 
"It would be so much easier if he did." 
Seven lessons of the interview with the late Steve Jobs, which this week has been shown in a theatre 
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October compared some him with Henry Ford and the engineering wizard as a great modern inventor. 
What Apple fans, but perhaps the most telling in the recently discovered jobs interview in this week's special vorführungs film has been dusted off on the major markets, is how much of this creative business processes and workflows. 
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-appointed Hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer, the zealous Diagrams bastelte - a man who believed that many business leaders suffer from "a disease of the mind," "a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] there is an enormous amount of craft art between a great idea and a great product." 
In 1995, Bob Cringely, the TV series "triumph of the idiots" about the departure of staff Computers, and he served longer than an hour with jobs in which they are a rare, detailed discussions. 
At this stage than 10 years since Jobs had been forced out of Apple, and he has worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and looked forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet. 
While a small part of Cringleys interview was used in professional idiot, he says that the copy of the interview was missing in the delivery. 
It was only after jobs death, discovering a complete VHS-Kopie in the garage of the director. 
This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the 68 minutes film "Steve Jobs: the lost interview," this Wednesday and Thursday in the Landmark-Theater. 
For someone who is known for his extensive interviews, jobs here seems surprisingly eager to explain its technological philosophies and business strategies. 
And incredibly thoughtful. 
In the course of the interview is four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds, clearly weighing his ideas and is striving for accuracy. 
There are also moments in which jobs ' perfect day comes when he seemingly impatient responded to Cringelys questions and anschubst, faster on issues or adverse actions of greater importance. 
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone included the lost interview somehow seems eerily prescient when jobs evaluated what other companies his opinion is right or wrong, and his own vision for the future of the computer. 
It is one thing, posthumous awards for career jobs, but jobs are to be seen as the eager dreamers on the leap of grandeur, is something quite different, original and inspiring. 
He has a vision of how things could and should. 
Shortly after he had done everything he pulled off and made it. 
A quick look at seven noteworthy sequences of lost interviews: 
As he learned to run a business: 
"During the entire years in business, I always ask: 'Why do you go?' and the answer always is:" oh, it is made easy. " 
No one knows why he does what he does, but no one really thinks carefully about things. 
I have noticed that. 
Jobs will continue its efforts to streamline the accounting for Apple. 
Struck, as costs were recorded - usually began with "standard costs," which were estimated at a mere suspicion and then adapted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory, which ensured that the cost of business could be down to the smallest. 
As the Pope was veralbert: 
Jobs have been told of the "Blue Box," which he has built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which to creep into the telephone company and TV talks could result in vain. 
The device has already been written, but jobs enthusiasm, as the Blue Box as an act of Selbstbemächtigung is contagious. 
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a telephone to make a phone call and then from an AT & T-Netzwerk in another, while so many satellites as possible. 
"We sent half a dozen times around the globe, and if you grölte into the phone, it came a minute later on the telephone next door," kichernd told Jobs. 
"We were young and we learned that we can build ourselves something that trillions of dollars of infrastructure on the whole world can control." 
We both, we did not know much, but we have been able to build this small thing that can control a gigantic thing, it was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that without them Apple would be. 
Jobs have been told by a glorious stroke, Wozniak and he almost pulled out when they are in the middle of the night via the Blue Box ringing in the Vatican, and wanted to talk with the Pope, while they are so good they were Henry Kissinger. 
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two loslachen before the Pope himself came to the telephone. 
As he verliebte in technology (and called unprepared Bill Hewlett): 
In the age of 12 years ago, when he looked for spare parts to build a radio meters, he searched Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called on him. 
Shortly after her 20 minutes telephone call received jobs for the summer a Hewlett-Packard Teilzeitjob. 
"This has had a remarkable impact on me; it was the only company that I had seen in the old age, and it shaped my views about what a company was and how well it treated its staff." 
Later jobs was one of the HP-Mitarbeiter, the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he was "the first Desktop-Computer ever saw." 
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen and I verliebte myself in him. 
I would like to HP as a teenager climb and hang on to this machine and programmes to write for them. 
How innovation improves: 
On several occasions in the interview, Jobs speaks about how spontaneous to invent new products. 
Early in his career, when he einbaute a few Platinen, he was asked by a customer to assemble them the whole computer. 
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had both the assembly processes and the extradition of the finished equipment. 
Later, when Apple reminds him of the problems in the development of a computer mouse: 
"I remember resounding arguments... you screamed that it would take five years to build a mouse, which would cost 300 Dollar] and I went out and found a manufacturer." 
Ninety days later, we had a mouse, which we are building for 15. Dollar This was incredibly credible. 
More than large companies: 
Long before Apple revival, saw the jobs on which so many industrial giants came in with their visions and lost control of their shares. 
"Let us say that you are working for IBM or Xerox, so you make a better Kopierer or printer, and na?" 
They have the monopoly on stock, so the company is no longer successful. 
Sales and marketing make it successful, in other words, there are such people, which ultimately lead the companies and the product with which people are being squeezed out of the decisionmaking process. 
The production wizard, which has led to the monopoly enjoyed by the people who have no idea about good versus bad products, eradicated - handicraft art. 
This is what happened to Xerox... 
Xerox would have been able to have the entire computer industry. 
It would have been 10 times greater that Microsoft would be in the 1990s... 
They have caught the defeat of the victory. 
Innovation as an art form: 
"There is plenty of craft between a great idea and a great product... if you develop this great idea, they change and grow." 
You learn a lot about his skill. 
You need votes, certain things you can do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories. 
It has 5 000 objects to see these concepts, and bring them all together.... 
Ultimately, it boils down to the taste, it is tantamount to saying that an attempt is being made, with the best stuff that people have created, and then tried to put these things together, which makes it possible. 
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal. 
We have always been shameless in the theft of grand ideas. 
Part of what Macintosh was wonderful was that the people who work there, musicians, poets, artists, Zoologen, historians who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world. 
Would it not have been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas. 
Scalia and Thomas at opponents of health care legislation, as a court case 
On the day on which the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the political dividing question whether it is a challenge to the health care legislation will hear from President Obama, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, at a dinner, which was gesponsort by the law firm that represented the case before the court. 
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met at a meeting to discuss the petitions for review. 
One of the cases was a complaint, the 26 countries rose up against the far-reaching reform of the health care system, which last year were approved by Congress, a law in conservative activists across the United States on the slogan. 
The judges agreed to the hearing; in fact, in March a 5 1/2 hour basic discussion is expected, probably the result will probably boost the presidential campaign of 2012, the date on which the court ruling will be announced in full swing. 
The lawyer, who stand trial and will claim that the law is to overturn, Paul Clement will probably be, once Attorney General under the administration of George W. Bush. 
Clements services, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group devoted to the defense of conservative legal principles. 
Another company that the dinner has sponsored, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenge the law. 
Another sponsor, the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is a huge part in the outcome of the process. 
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had been discussing the case in a Washington hotel. 
Service, including Mitch McConnell, the head of the group of Republicans in the Senate and a declared opponent of health care reform 
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas. 
This is nothing new: the two judges visit for years, the federalist society events. 
And that does not violate moral rules. 
In fact, judges freed from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the federal judge. 
If they did, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the code, which states: "A judge can participate in benefiz events because local and other organizations taking part, although the judge is not a spokesman, honorary guest or a host of such events." 
Nonetheless, the extreme closeness of Scalia and Thomas, two of the case related firms, as well as a company with a massive financial interest in this in order to alert Moral-und-Regierungsaktivisten. 
"This startling break with morality and contrary to the code punishes the complaints of some judges lie, the court is of the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States. 
"The judges and won dinnierten during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with cases pending in court." 
Their appearance and their support for a donation campaign for this event to undermine any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable. 
Scalia and Thomas show little regard for critics who say that they would issue judicial easily with groups who are guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society. 
And Thomas ' Ginni wife is a well-known conservative activist. 
By contrast, the Conservatives claim that Judge Elena Kagan is a moral issue, not Scalia and Thomas. 
Kagan was chief prosecutor under the Obama administration, when the first legislative investigating appeals court came in the first instance. 
Their critics urged Kagan themselves from the hearing of the case to withdraw because of bias, because they are too much involved in the defence of the law was to be unbiased. 
Kagan does not need to do so. 
Boeing has a record of 18 trillion dollars in country 
Airline Emirates ordered 50 gängige aircraft from the Boeing 777 with an option for 20 more aircraft. 
In addition, Boeing sold six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a deal worth more than 1 trillion dollars. 
It is really a rare news that a company gets about 50 pieces of its products. 
But it is a big business, if the company of the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co., and the list price for these 50 aircraft as a whole with a record total of 18 trillion dollars. 
It is also unusual for the client of Boeing, the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders. 
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East in the next 20 years 2 520 aircraft worth 450 billion dollars are needed. 
Boeing announced at the weekend its biggest contract ever for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order: 50 gängige Boeing 777 Jets. 
The request came from the airline Emirates from Dubai. 
The airline also has Boeing announced 2011 at the Dubai Air Show, an option on the purchase of 20 more planes, the total list price of 26 trillion dollars. 
On Monday, then did, according to Boeing Oman Air, six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, fuel consumption and the comfort of passengers vastly improved. 
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than 1 trillion dollars. 
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, expert of morning star. 
"The quality of these special customers is very high." 
Many airlines in the Middle East are in possession of the oil producing countries. 
So they have not only the money to pay for the planes, but rather is a rise in oil prices, which usually hurts the airlines, because this is one of their biggest cost items, not so damaging, because the country is at a higher price. 
This is important, because they are less than other airlines tend to cancel or postpone aircraft orders, when oil prices rise, Dihora said. 
"You have a natural hedge," he said. 
The appointment of Sultanate reinforces Boeing's leading position in the market for large aircraft and helps the Airbus competitors SAS to keep in check the supremacy of the A350. 
Boeing's victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus has announced that it would postpone the launch of the biggest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER. 
It postponed the introduction, in order to gain more confidence, after customers asked for a higher burden and scope. 
Boeing shares rose by 1,5% to 67.94. 
Sister of the Mexican president apparently loses election in Michoacan 
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug traffickers, Fausto Vallejo opponents of the PRI have supported in the race for the governor's post. 
The sister of President Felipe Calderon has apparently made their bid for the office of the governor of Muchoacan lost during the violent state elections, and they claimed Monday that drug traffickers, the race could have been influenced in favour of their opponents. 
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI, the race to win the governorships in the western state. 
"The intervention of organized crime during the entire electoral process, and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday. 
"They threatened our candidates, our staff in the polls... you have polling booths occupied, road blockades built... and people in charge," [for] the PRI vote. " 
The PRI ruled for seven decades in Mexico, until they lost the presidency in 2000. 
But they are aiming for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts. 
The PRI is hoping for a victory in the presidential election in July. 
Vallejo Claderon appears to have beaten only narrowly led in the polls before the election day. 
Calderon, a candidate of the conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN her brother, refused to Vallejo recognised as the winner. 
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD, who is still acting governor, was ranked three, a heavy defeat for the divided and hapless leftist leaders for the 2012 presidential election. 
Aureoles refused to recognize the preliminary results. 
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital city of Morelia, denies links to drug traffickers, and urges the other candidates to accept the results. 
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels, which have specialised in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines. 
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he has Michoacan chosen in December 2006 to launch a military offensive against drug traffickers. 
The violence still continues. 
A PAN-Bürgermeister was a week before the election during an election meeting for Luisa Maria Calderon killed and many candidates have dropped out of fear from the local elections. 
For the PRI a victory will strengthen the party, no matter how repugnant the elections appear in Michoacan. 
The man, the PRI will probably represented in the race for the presidency, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated the Vallejo from Washington and said: "I think that this victory gives us the courage to look into the next year." 
ADB urges Asia to help in the rescue of the euro zone 
The Asian Development Bank (Asian Development Bank ADB) calls on India and China to save the euro zone to assist in its heavy debt crisis, in order to avoid a long-term downward trend, which will slow down the growth of the economy in Asia. 
Rajat Nag, managing director of the ADB headquarters in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world, "everything in your power" must do in order to ensure the recovery of the currency bloc, either by the International Monetary Fund or by directly to speed up mutual agreements. 
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), the "dispassionate" look at the problems in Europe, and said that the financial support of the European leadership and European resources through Asia to prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy helps. 
"We are all in the same boat." 
"Everyone is so helpful that Europe can help out of this crisis," he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai. 
"Asia may be protected to a certain extent, but it is not immune." 
"If China and India can help, then by all means." 
Europe's monetary union was in the past few months in a severe debt crisis. 
In the past few days Italy's interest costs rose to dangerous, and the Prime Minister, both from Italy and Greece have resigned. 
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe is fueling fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and led to calls, the leading emerging countries must unite to support the euro zone. 
Mr. Nag said that any support in Asia will be channelled through the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of bonds of the eu-rettung Fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - the European partners will offer greater bargaining power in Asia. 
Anand Sharma, the Indian trade minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the euro zone, as the domestic economy is suffering from falling exports and the drying up of foreign capital flows. 
"No one wants to see that the euro zone remains unstable and turbulent," he said. 
"We are facing great challenges, and we must maintain a high growth level." 
"It is not an option, it is a task, because where else do we find work for our millions of young men and women." 
Others argue that emerging economies such as India have no reason to help the rich Europeans, even if they are facing major economic challenges. 
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University, said that it would be politically very difficult, the 1.2 billion people in India to sell aid for Europe, of which more than 800 million out of $2 or less a day in their lives. 
"At some point they will find that the Greeks retire 50 and holidays are spent on the beach, and then you have a problem," he said. 
Lee Howell, executive director of the World Economic Forum, asked why India's reserves should be used in Greece, the numerous and well paid employees to keep in the public sector, with jobs in bad geleitetet losses einbringe nden institutions such as the railways. 
Mr. Nag said that the crises in the euro zone "significant knock-on effects" on the whole of Asia. 
The ADB forecast an economic growth of 7,5% in Asia for the years 2011/is now facing "the risk of division" because of the threat from Europe. 
He said that vulnerable emerging markets "contingency plans" should prepare themselves for a downward trend and a significant outflow of capital to protect their partnerships. 
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon about possible cuts in defence 
Defence Minister Leon Panetta fueled the Congress on Monday, when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken the national security unnoticed, so he set off a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon to the war zones in Afghanistan and the civilian conveyor belts. 
The Pentagon is already making cuts in excess of 450 trillion dollars over the next decade, but fears that further cuts to 600 billion dollars or more will be needed if the Congress can reach no conclusion in the spending. 
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina. 
He said that a failure of the Congress in reaching a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would result in 23% across-the-board cuts, as well as a halt numerous new projects. 
"Such a large cut, carried out in such a reckless way that would make most of our ship and construction projects unfeasible - you cannot three quarters of a ship or a building to buy - and other serious harm modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators. 
"We also would be forced to take involuntary to separate a large part of our civilian personnel and, given that the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have almost certainly kinds of civilians, in order to be able to achieve the goal." 
"These amendments would destroy the faith of those who maintain our armed forces and seriously damage our preparedness." 
The cuts were eventually hit the combat forces," Panetta said. 
"While the war quotas in the anti-terror campaign are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious interference would adversely affect the war effort in the budget," Panetta warned. 
"Recruitment has been cut, leading to delays in the recruitment and hiring supervision, support for the war." 
"The salaries of the staff would be cut, which will lead to late payments to dealers and the legal and political support would be disrupted." 
The two senators responded Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details about the potential impact of the automatic cuts to the Department of Defense. 
"The consequences of a seizure of the Ministry of Defence would be a rapid decline in the United States as the world's leading military power." 
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when she Panettas letter published. 
"This is a result that we cannot live with, and it is certainly not one that we should impose on us." 
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United hurry up and whose commitment should not be allowed." 
Whether Panettas letter and the new warnings from the senators will increase the pressure on a budget compromise or step up demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen. 
Panetta has become increasingly outspoken about the possible cuts, despite his many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he faces difficult choices. 
At a press conference in the last week, the defence minister, painting a bleak picture, which could face a military shell, but without heart. 
"It is a ship without sailors." 
"It is a brigade without ammunition." 
"It is a geschwader without adequately trained pilots." 
"It is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs without adequately trained soldiers who have the ability to carry out the mission," Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon. 
"It is a military force, there is a lack of morality and alert, and is not in a position to absorb it with potential enemies." 
"You can really be angry." 
In an annex to his letter to McCain and Graham, Panetta new details of how reductions "creates significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious limitations of our global commitment and response capacity, which creates an unacceptable risk in future military operations." 
Panetta said that some of the biggest projects the removal could fall victim, including those who have already been tested and are already in the early planning stage. 
This list also includes fighter planes F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new aircraft bomb, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new litt oral Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle, the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee. 
If the further development and testing of the F35 stop, it would in the next 10 years to save up to 80 Dollar billion, but its supporters say that it is an important next step in the build-up, so that possible threats posed by China and other opponents can be averted. 
As a lie revealed 
A glance at the current headlines shows how serious and widespread deception and lies in daily life. 
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is dealing with the allegations of sexual harassment by several women, both sides accuse each other of lying. 
The leadership of Penh State is accused of the President's, since it has allegedly withheld reports, according to which a retired football coach boy was sexually abused. 
In the past week has been heard about an open microphone, as the French President Nicolas Sarkozy and US President Barack Obama claimed that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar. 
Lies destroy careers and shaking countries. 
The New York congressman and Internetexhibitionist Anthony Weidner was kidding when he brought Verleugnungs into circulation, which were quickly refuted by incontrovertible evidence. 
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of violations in the campaign financing in connection with the cover-up of an extramarital affair. 
And then, of course, no one forgets that it has seen the media circus that President Bill Clinton has triggered when he during his second term in the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky lied. 
Stories about Schummeln in school and college tests are widespread. 
There have been incidents in which teachers have laid down their student testing, so that they themselves well in their performance reviews dastanden. 
Mentors, who should teach the opposite, send a message that lies and Schummeln. 
How much deception we see? 
As studies show that we are lying every day between 10 and 200 times. 
There are many, but these lies are lies. 
Another study shows that strangers each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting. 
To detect lies, or "lie detection" is a learning is important for every person, and that both personal and professional reasons. 
Far from being a social game such as, for example, in which it is the goal, "you!" is the Enttarnen of a deception, a serious knowledge based on scientific data over the past six decades have been collected at prestigious universities, which had carried out extensive research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology. 
As a result of the research is that most of the old myths about which lies were revealed. 
Look in the eyes. 
You stottern, stammeln, suffused with and not always zappeln. 
As a result, we should not conclude that these liars difficult to identify and treat. 
A Lügenenttarner can penetrate the truth by giving him something about the structure of the claim that the fine talk, learn about issues and timing. 
I have spent several years, the scientific findings of the comprehensive and steadily growing field of study in exposing, and it is clear that the Enttarnen of a deception is a modern ability, which is easy to learn and help us find in our complex world, especially if the closing or the questioning of persons or negotiations or administration belong to their own professional responsibilities. 
Good liars are very good to other people, to arouse their interest and to control their own emotions, and they intuitively sense how they are perceived by others. 
Thanks to the research, we know that extrovertiert people are more likely to lie than introverted men, that men are more often "driven" lying spin than women whose lies "to others" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people anlügen their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly "fat lies"). 
We also know that if a person has been exposed as a culprit, while others feel less guilty, this person to have lied. 
As you can see whether or not someone is lying? 
First, by watching the normal behaviour of this person. 
This is what is known as "Baselining," the starting position. 
It is a point of reference for the subsequent assessment of changes. 
Keep a close eye on the attitude, the smile, the quality of their participants. 
You should know better, when someone is normally standing trippelt with the foot, so that they do not unfairly when he trippelt during a meeting with the foot. 
Then you look at accumulations more startling verbal and nonverbaler behaviors. 
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells ring, not as proof of a in exposing. 
People who are cheating might freeze when they try to remind themselves of their history, and perhaps their feet toward the door, or they are towards outcome, change their position on significant way or show a "relaxation after the recruitment interview," this deep, diverting Ausatmen and the change in attitude, if they are all tough issues. 
Interrogator often mistakenly signal that a conversation has come to an end only after this relaxing to look for a job interview. 
You also pay attention to the language of your participants. 
The slip of Scott Peterson is famous, when he used the past tense when he claimed that his wife was still on life and triggered a national search for her. 
Täuschende people can also use a distanzierend language: "I have not had a sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you have a tricky question repeated in its entirety. 
The most frequent verbal signs are subtle. 
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer to a tricky question: "Well... in order to tell you the truth... as far as I know... to the best of our knowledge and understanding." 
This is the answer rather than factual, which often set the alarm bells ringing. 
There is no magic cure for the Enttarnen of lies, but they can learn skills, thanks to whom one in exposing is possible. 
With these skills, everyone can rarely be the victims of fraudsters, both in private and professional life. 
More controversial plan of an oil pipeline will be revised following threats by delayed US-Genehmigung 
A few days after the Obama administration has threatened the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to slow down in the Gulf of Mexico, which angered the unions and environmentalists, reassured that the pipeline based company is trying to plan the project new, so that we can return to normal. 
Canada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area is being diverted to the sand hills of Nebraska. 
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the parliament building in Nebraska. 
Alex Pourbax of canada said that the company was still confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different course. 
This came after an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the last week, after which a decision on a federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new possible course would be reviewed, the area of sand hills in Nebraska, as well as the Ogallala-Aquifer, a large water supply, meide. 
"This is a real step forward," said Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, on Fox News. 
The new environmental review, which the Foreign Office has ordered, may postpone a decision until 2013, after the elections in the coming year, even though officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision. 
Obama said last week in a written statement that the decision is a function of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and said his support. 
The 1700 mile pipeline in Canada was linked to the Gulf of Mexico. 
It would be 700 000 barrels of oil per day from the province of Alberta to pump the refineries in Texas. 
To this end, the pipeline would have to cross six states. 
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them, because they estimate that the pipeline will create 20 000 jobs. 
But the Nebraskas lawmakers, who oppose the plan, weigh up the laws, a departure from the region in the sand hills and the Ogallala-Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation, to enforce. 
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that the chief accountant of the ministry has requested a separate probe of the review process, which focuses on two issues. 
One is whether a lobbyist, who was recruited by canada, Paul Elliott, the 2008 adviser of Hillary Clinton was in a conflict of interest. 
The other is whether a company, which has been charged with carrying out the original study was an inappropriate choice because it is connected with canada. 
Patti LaBelle indicted because they are supposedly a toddler forced out of fear, erbrechen 
A New York family claims that the disco diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of the Manhattaner building would get a Tobsuchtanfall of her little daughter was so frightened that she has to be in fear. 
The tirade of the "Marmalade" singer Lady was 18 months old Genevieve Monk such fear that they "personality changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers" suffering, said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan. 
It was on 10 November last year, when the stagehands Kevin Monk, his wife Rose anna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve wanted to embark on a family trip. 
While Kevin Monk, the car was Rose anna Monk with the luggage and Genevieve on the arm in the lobby of her building on the River side Boulevard. 
Rose anna Monk said that she had stopped in the vicinity of the door and dropped her daughter for a moment. 
"Somebody was behind me and said: ' Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "yes," and went out to get them back on to the arm, " she said. 
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman angry. 
"She said in an aggressive tone:" you should not be your daughter in the vicinity of the door, " said Rose anna Monk. 
"I said to her:" I am not interested in what you say or think. " 
She was angry and began to shout - she used the F-Wort and the A-Wort and was very loud.... 
She had a bottle of water in the hand and began to dump water from the bottle. 
She said Genevieve would become hysterical. 
"I said to this woman:" you see what you have done with my daughter, " said the mother of the child. 
LaBelle fell on the mother, who still Genevieve was on the arm, and her companion had withheld and be drawn into a waiting car, said Rose anna Monk. 
The baby cried so much that it had to pass, they said. 
Later, the family asked LaBelle in writing for an apology, but received no response. 
LaBelles lawyer and representatives have not responded to telephone calls, which was asked for an opinion. 
The complaint is not going to some compensation, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he would not be a fee, and the family plan, the money they receive, the children's cancer aid donations. 
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for their behaviour," said Davis. 
"This kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially if a kindergarten teacher, an 18-month old baby bears on the arm." 
Climatic events bremsten the economy 
In the first year in which Mario Lopez took part in the government, unemployment rose in Sinaloa and the black economy, while the foreign investment fell and the economy stagnated. 
In 2011, the Sinaloas economic history remain in my memory, and it is the first year in which Mario Lopez Valdez, who described himself as the initiator of change and great hopes in terms of economic growth, fueled by the government, however, due to the climatic events cannot talk about growth, but on the contrary, the main economic indicators deteriorated. 
The low temperatures in February have not only caused losses of millions of dollars in agriculture, but also the growth of the national economy close borders and caused in the first quarter of a general decline in economic activity by 3,6% this is mainly on the historic dismantling of agricultural development at 31.16 percent, the deterrent impact on other economic sectors. 
According to a from the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (the Mexican Council for sustainable agricultural development) report on the impact of the frost, there were 582 000 hectares of agricultural land damaged, with 78.03 percent and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed, and it affected all of the vegetables, corn and kichererbsen crops. 
The decline in economic activity until November, in the Mexican state unemployment to rise steadily, and the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía were observed in the first quarter of a rapid rise in unemployment, from January to March had 55 053 Sinaloas inhabitants no employment, which is 4,53 percent of the working population; in the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5,28 percent from July to September to 6,19 percent, which is about 74 000 unemployed in Sinaloa to 18 969 people more than in the first quarter of the year. 
Less liquidity 
Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year goes back to several factors: the economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, dean of the School of Economic and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented on the policy of public institutions indirectly declare growing unemployment. 
"What we are seeing is a rise in unemployment, which has to do with several factors, among other things with the loss of liquidity in the market due to the budget cuts by legislation, which was adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who accumulate dollars verboten, it is not easy to work for them to invest or otherwise use anything," he said. 
Migration stopped 
López Cervantes pointed out that the increase in unemployment is also inherent in a demographic factor. 
"The number of people the country to seek work abroad, particularly in the United States, is declining. This is due to travel problems, on one hand, and on the other hand, because it is difficult to find work, and these people stay here and looking for work, unemployment will rise," he says. 
Undeclared work 
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious, if one takes into account the high proportion of undeclared work. This includes, according to INEGI 60.38 percent of the country's employees, who work without paying into the coffers of the social security system. 
With regard to unemployment and undeclared work the low wages, the lowest in Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Security Institution) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Intergovernmental Authority for work and social care in Mexico). 
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa until September amounted to 5352 pesos; that is very much less than the national average, which stands at 7375 pesos. 
Decline in FDI 
As well as the dismantling of economic activity and rising unemployment will be in 2011 the sharpest decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the last ten years, according to the Secretaría de Economía (state economic authority), FDI from January to June of 630 597 dollars, a loss of 87.74 percent compared to the 5,143,312 dollars in the same period in the previous year. 
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (governmental authority for economic development), for their part, recorded a total investment of 17,280,000 pesos in 2011, the company mainly comes from the tertiary sector. 
The debt 
In the face of the economic crisis, the provincial government requested in July at the National Assembly a loan in excess of 3 000,000 000 pesos to reactivate the economy in infrastructure projects should be invested in the 18 districts. The national congress approved a sum in excess of 200,600,000 pesos, but have until November no positive effects of debt on some of the economic sectors in the country. 
Reactions 
As for the representatives of the company schaft, the first year of government, Mario Lopez Valdés government default obvious. 
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (the state chamber of manufacturing in Mexico), argued that in 2011 is not an effort to harmonize the views of different sectors, including the national government, have been made. 
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor in this year, and it needs to be worked hard to regain lost ground in this year and in 2012 we must double our efforts and the efforts of all and in particular the progress of the already good government teams have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said. 
Economic development 
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year, the country's economic development and growth slowed. 
"The small business is the result of a number of events, including the frost, and one of the most important impact is a slowing economy, which is not enough to ignite an economic dynamism, a reasonable flow of processes, products and services could generate, and that is why we will be the year far below our expectations," he said. 
Redefine 
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexican Employers' Association) in Sinaloa, said the state should be to encourage more dynamic productive activities. 
"In general, we have seen that work has been done, and we believe that it is necessary for a long-term programme to redefine the economic appeal and to develop the country, because it is important that all material and human resources to activate Sinaloas," he said. 
There is much to be done 
The chairman of Coparmex stressed how important it is to develop a vision of the future, which draws the efforts of the government in a better direction. 
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas, but the economic development has come forward, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said. 
He stressed that the current government is making progress in the government. 
"There are areas in which we can say that the government has acted more fully, but what I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work before it," he said. 
Arrest over 8 kilograms of marijuana 
In addition to five years in prison and 100 daily records, a resident of Navolato was sentenced for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana. 
The prosecutor of the Republic announced that the small drug traffickers was Omar Alexis Valenzuela sand object for a crime against public health - to trade certain possession of marijuana - was punished.

Debt for construction 
The Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 Sozialbaus for migrants who are at risk because of a lack of resources not to be completed, or only with great delay, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda. 
The head of the municipal authority for social development, said that, although the Bauprogramms are already at an advanced stage, they are now in peril, because the government allotted funds for the three programmes 11 million peso has not paid. 
He said that the total investment in this plenary three programmes almost 50 million peso, which fell 25 per cent of the state, but until now had only the Federación and community funds contributed to the work, which is why a delay in the Baubeendigung was to be expected. 
"They have to contribute 12 million, and even though the year end, they have given us a penny, and that, even though they are already in July would have to pay a part of," he said. "In order not to be too late, we have already begun with the construction work, and they are already well advanced, but we need the money." 
He stressed that under the government of Jesus Aguilar Padilla of the state has not fulfilled its obligations, which is why the municipality at the beginning of a loan the government had to borrow in excess of 7 million, which would be equivalent to the amount the central government would have to pay. 
"That was already in the last parliamentary term, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources, the programmes were started and this year we have had to raise the funds, which had not been paid by the state to take part in these programmes," he led. 
Even if the state authorities are obliged to the disbursement of these funds, he commented that the minister for administration and finance, has been asked to speed up the administrative work and pay the outstanding amount as quickly as possible. 
"Almost 12 million must contribute to them, and even though the year end, they have given us a penny." 
The court approved for 2015 the transition to digital television in Mexico 
The conversion of analogue to digital signals is global in recent years, the most important changes. 
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN), the constitutional claims, which the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies were lodged against the presidential decree, and the switch from analogue to digital signals must be brought forward from 2021 to 2015, because of a lack of eight votes are needed for the anfechtung legislation. 
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, was of the opinion that the President Felipe Calderón has not exceeded his powers when he decree-law with the details of the switch to the terrestrial digital television. 
With this decision, the constitutional dispute brought into being by the Senate rejected, because he did not have the necessary qualified majority of eight votes, so that the court could decide the constitutionality or otherwise of verfassungsmäßigkeit, for example, the law remains in force. 
In the project for the complaint, which the Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero has been drawn up, it was suggested that the decree-law to declare unconstitutional because of the radio and television on regulations the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federale Commission for telecommunications in Mexico) is responsible, which is why the decree-law hierarchical principles and would contradict the law. 
In support of the project, only Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero himself. 
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies besch constitutional decree-law. After the adoption of the complaints, the Minister Sánchez Cordero decree-law no longer and asked all activities to set up the digital transmission. 
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without going into the debate on the project, for which the Minister Sánchez Cordero was responsible. 
In his speech, the Prime Minister did not agree with the arguments of the project, and in the sense that the national government is not with the general provisions of the measures, which should take the public administration must regulate. 
"I also believe that, if not, we would do that would undermine the independence of the regulator." you recalled that the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, the central government is responsible because it directs the state affairs. 
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes in the last few years has taken place in the world, and it will mean a better use of the elektrischen spectrum, a higher quality of the signal and more channels. 
The delay in the changeover, she said, was a postponement of the enjoyment of the digital age, which is a decision in the public interest is not just a technical point of view, "because they include economic, social, political and security aspects." 
These issues, she said, "were the actions of the entire system, in accordance with the principle of economic management by the state a group of characteristics, the Constitution in the hands of the central government." 
It reminded that many countries around the world have already carried out the digital conversion, and the government, even though they have highly specialised facilities at their disposal. 
It could not conclude that the government with the release of the disputed Gesetzesdekrets eingreife in the powers of the Congress, because of the legislative passed laws would be respected," he told them. 
The possibility that ballots in Michoacán individual auszuzählen will be considered 
According to the figures of PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor just 27%, with 879 votes from a total 6074 have not yet been counted. 
The possibility of a single count of the ballots in this year's elections in Michoacán a reality, because under the Programa de Resultados elect oral data spent Preliminares (PREP) is the difference between the first and second place at the governor's elections nearly 27 percent, with 879 votes from a total 6074 have not yet been counted. 
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, reminded us that just once in the last 9 November, the electoral body a set of rules on the harmonization of local legislation with the reforms of the federal states had adopted in electoral matters. 
It should be remembered that Michoacán neither his political constitution nor his electoral law nor its law on electoral justice had adapted to the reforms adopted by Congress, so that they in this round were in force, but the Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the Gazette within the timeframe stipulated by the argument that even objections. 
On 9 November, the Supreme Court ruled in Mexico (SCJN) on the constitutional complaint filed by the local legislature and assessment, the voice of the State Ombudsman on the constitutional reforms as "invalid and unlawful" because it does not have the right to "decide or a veto against it." 
María de los Ángeles Llanderal said in an interview about the possibility of a single count of the votes, thanks to the adoption of the directives by the Consejo General del IEM is now the possibility that the local election authority, the ballot papers partially or completely auszählen. 
Under the following conditions in one or more electoral packages contained votes will be counted partial results in the protocols do not agree; the protocol on the counting and calculation is not an excessive or it is not in possession of the chairman of the electoral commission or there are obvious errors or amendments in the protocols. 
In addition, the total count of the total ausgefüllten ballot papers will then be carried out if there is a difference between the presumed winner and the second place is the same or less than one per cent is provided at the beginning of the session is an explicit request from the Partei-bzw and coalition chairman, the second is the aforementioned candidates. 
The counting of votes can also be carried out in its entirety, if it is discovered after completion of the proper calculation that the difference between the presumed winner and the candidate on the second place equal to or less than one percent, provided that there is an explicit request from a representative of the party, whose candidate has become the second, and in this case, the electoral packages were subjected to a partial count has been ruled out. 
It is worth noting that the elections in the same situation in Morelia, where according to PREP the difference between the first and second place just 0,16%, even though the votes of 129 total 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.

On Wednesday the new Italian government 
The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, meets tomorrow with the president of Italy, to present the new government, the crisis that Italy has brought to the brink of economic bruchs. 
The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, meets tomorrow with the president of Italy, to present the new government, the crisis that Italy has brought to the brink of economic bruchs. 
A statement from the presidential palace announced that on Sunday appointed Monti on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, would meet to confirm the government building. 
It is expected that a majority of the cabinet made up of technocrats, although it is still not clear when the new prime minister will take up his post. 
Monti said he would give the president the results of the talks with the political parties to form the government. 
"I wish to express my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to cope with these difficult times," said the former Commissioner of the journalist. 
Monti has not explicitly confirmed the formation of the government, but his comments indicate that the obstacles are overcome. 
The "framework is now well established," he added. 
Monti has succeeded in less than three days to form a government, which is much less time than normal, and meanwhile, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis, the cost of debt has driven into an intolerable level. 
The new government led by the former European Commissioner Monti should adopt a tough austerity package, which was demanded by the eurozone politicians to regain the shattered trust in Italy. 
The pressure to rush to Monti, compounded by the volatile market situation, following which the Italian government bonds for 10 years were burdened with 7% interest. This is in line with the state, in which Greece and Ireland have been forced to apply for the European rescue package. 
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian employers' association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government on all sides." 
We believe that this government is the last chance, so that Italy can emerge from this emergency situation. 
The chances of success to Monti's have been through the support of the party PDL of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign because of the crisis on Saturday, increased substantially. 
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are designed to achieve good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party. 
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is essential, because until now, many of its members opposed to a majority government consisting of technocrats, particularly the Monti. 
Support from Parliament 
The new government of Monti needs a strong parliamentary support for the implementation of the likely unbeliebten austerity measures. 
Opposition to his efforts, or the delay of the reforms could again lead to a devastating attack on the financial markets. 
The Italian association of foreign banks, with his suggestion that a failure to Monti's was a disaster, is also under pressure. 
Monti began on Monday with his discussions with political parties, trade unions and employers' associations, as well as with youth and women's organizations. 
Tuesday evening, the round is supposed to be completed. 
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who, as a response to the crisis an extremely rapid change of government has set in motion. 
After a brief revival at the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, due to the uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister, the cost of the Italian government bonds reached critical limits. 
A rescue of Italy with a public debt of EUR 1.8 trillion, would be too much for the current eu-rettung screen. 
Monti said that his government had until the next elections, which is expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that the politicians give it time to implement the reforms will only be preferable to replace those elections. 
Monti said he would like to see politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this should only be made up of technicians, a reference to their concerns about the procedures imposed by the pressure of the financial markets. 
Political sources point out that the mutual suspicion and disagreements between the parties, the inclusion of people from the complicated political life. 
Spaniards have more opportunities than the Ticos 
Of the 22 players from Spain have ten more than 50 international matches. 
Costa Rica has only one of the 22 Einberufenen 50 games behind. 
A big difference for Costa Rica, when the 22 for the game, which is now at 15.05 taking place in the national stadium of San José, players from both countries will be compared with each other. 
While the world and European champion, the number one in the FIFA monthly ranking on a considerable number of class A selection matches can look back, the three coloured team only on the defensive player Michael Umaña as the only one with more than 50 international matches. 
This figure reached him on the last Friday of the game against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernandez. 
The Spanish players in the league de las Estrellas (star) and influential clubs in the Premier League of England play each year have the opportunity to participate in a number of home games (league and Cup-Meisterschaften), as well as senior Europacups such as the Champions League. 
In addition, the experience with the Spanish frenzy in complex elimination play in the Eurocup and the football World Cup. 
The Tico-Fußballer, however, have a few international meetings within the framework of the Concacaf, the bottom is on the rangliste of FIFA. 
We will see how the Spanish team will withdraw its last register: goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who on the last Saturday against England (0-1 defeat in London) with 126 foreign play an equal part with the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta. 
Casillas will play today against the three coloured team and Spain, a new record of 127 playing abroad. 
Xavi Hernandez, a player of the Barcelona football club, has 106. 
Casillas and Xavi were given last week even a recognition of the UEFA, along with other of the Iberian team, which reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the striker of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102. 
The number of hundreds of approaches Carles Puyol with 97 games. 
He is followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53. 
The Ticos and close to Michael Umaña are the left-wing striker Júnior Díaz, with 48 games and the striker Bryan Ruiz with 45. 
From here, there were only five to more than 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35. 
Those with the fewest games. 
Less than 30 games in the Spanish team, Gerard Pique (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31). 
The national team will come to less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23. 
The rest is not even in the 1920s. 
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two recorded in Costa Rica, Víctor Bolívar only one, and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson had its debut not yet. 
The historic Torhüter of Spain is David Villa with 50 Treffern, followed by Fernando Torres with 27. 
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz with nine scored the most goals, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and parks. 
The quintet was Costa Rica in its Tournee to celebrate his 20th anniversary 
"To play in Costa Rica is a dream come true." 
In an exclusive interview with Viva says the Bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam, the band is ready for the next Sunday in the national stadium to give one of their best concerts. 
More than 20 years they have been expected, but the band assured us that it is a dream come true for them when they play in Costa Rica. 
That assured the Bassist and Mitgründer of the group, Jeff Ament, the Viva Brazil last week gave an exclusive interview. 
The band is located in the South American part of their Tournee to celebrate their 20th anniversary, and on Sunday, 20, making its only stop in Central America. 
On this day they enter the national stadium from 7.30pm, along with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las robe rtas from Costa Rica. 
You read an excerpt from the interview, the full transcript to be found in the online edition of La Nación. 
For your Costa Rican fans realised a dream when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: ' You know what this means for your fans? 
To play in Costa Rica is a dream come true for us. 
This is just the second time that we in South and Central America, and until now it has been great. 
I am only once on holiday in Costa Rica, but it is a beautiful country, that we will stay a few days ago. 
It is exciting for us to get our music there. 
I ask you this, because the fans of the band are completely; you can see the days before the concert the closest possible. 
What do you say to your enthusiastic fans? 
Thank you, all these years to be on our side. 
We have spent nearly 21 years until we have come to Costa Rica, and I am grateful to have waited so long and we regret to have taken so long before we came here. 
Some people are even of the opinion that your concert will be the biggest show of the year. 
Übt not a bit of pressure from your visit? 
Some of the greatest shows that we have in the last 21 years, took place in the last two weeks. 
We have a couple of big shows played in Sao Paulo, and we hope that we are prepared for this concert have made in Costa Rica. 
Indeed, we have the desire to play there. 
We love this country, we like to surf and are enthusiastic about the jungle, and for that Costa Rica is among the best countries in the world. 
How did your Costa Rica and befriended the surfing its waves? 
Many of our friends are, and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable. 
My friends are always surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico are excellent places for surfing. In this way, people who love the surfing, we have learned from it. 
With a glance at the Tournee you have offered shows with many songs. 
What plans they have for the event in Costa Rica? 
Since we have never played, we have no borders. 
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs, and we want to see a few tunes created from each album and our fans offer a good and varied repertoire. 
Your your repertoire is never repeated. 
Why? 
I think this is partly because we have nine Platten and more than 120 songs can play, and everyone likes a different song, so that the decision, which we will play against each other, is not easy. 
If we have two or three Songs, which we have no longer have played into the repertoire, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us, because they remember the reasons why we have taken this Song's. They might otherwise be forgotten. 
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think for the audience. 
This Tournee is celebrating its two-decade history. 
If you look, it is hard to believe in your success? 
Yes, total. 
Firstly, I believe that none of us has imagined to play once in a great rock band, and more than 20 years, and it looks like a dream. 
We also continue to have this blessing and find it wonderful to be able to make music together. 
We love us and are thrilled to bring music. 
We are lucky to be able to go to the places in the world, which we have always wanted to visit again. 
Things could not be better. 
What does it mean for you, actively participated in the birth of the Grunge? 
It has always been an honour to join this group of large volumes. 
We are good with the people of sound garden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains friendly. 
It is surprising and very unusual, when a movement emerges from a group of friends. 
Every now and again a band emerges from a city, but it is unusual for five or ten groups at the same time come from the same city. 
We are proud and feel honoured to be part of the Seattle group. 
Sometimes we still play together. 
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney and we saw sound garden on their Tournee. We look forward to them all is still to be friendly and there is a credit to us, part of this is going to be Seattle sounds. 
It is also very unusual for a band like yours so long ago, together with the same musicians. 
Yes, four of us play for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) came to us from 13 years ago, and that alone is a lot more time than many bands survive. 
Firstly, I believe that we are all lucky to be still alive, and we also care about each other. 
We are all close friend and musical paths have opened each individual the freedom to experiment. 
One familiar with the other and its music, but it could not be better. 
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy, but on the other hand, konntet her thanks to your success always do what you wanted a Yugoslav. 
How is their balance? 
The way we have grown, it has become easier to find a balance. 
We are certainly not too often to be Tournee, because it is too easy, this game with huge numbers of people who love your music. 
As long as we keep in mind that people have come because of the music reminds you that you have the music and what they created, must be careful not to be a famous rock stars, and this has never been interested. 
What are the memories you have in your other project Mother Love Bone? 
I think we have very good Song's written and it was great at the beginning. 
We were three years of a gang which until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods) never had issued a record. 
We were disappointed to have taken so long, and we are still well with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore TD), the band returned with us, our friends, and when I hear a song or photographs can see, I think, what an incredible man Andy was and how he made me laugh, but it was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh together and about music and football and many other issues. 
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him. 
The domestic band Las robe rtas for the opening of the show in Costa Rica. 
Is it true that she is familiar with their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and the band have therefore chosen for the opening? 
Yes, the production sent us videos from various groups and the band did best, and that is why we are curious to see what robe rtas can offer live. This is exciting. 
Why does the text of Yellow Ledbetter always when you play live? 
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea. 
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing he thinks. 
Who you got to be affected as Bassist? 
So many + 
Among the first to include Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski... 
There are so many that I have the whole afternoon on the Bassists, which I could talk about. 
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the Grunge alive, even though it is no longer a fad? 
I think we all feel we are not very connected with the word Grunge. 
When I think about it, I think the tapes, which I mentioned earlier, for example, Mudhoney, sound garden, nirvana and all the others who were at the same time, if they are still important today, I find it wonderful, because it is worthwhile to hear this music and band like Mudhoney now make better music than ever before. 
Initially, their music was darker, it is now more positive. 
Why? 
This is interesting, because I believe there are a few tunes created on the new album, which might seem a bit frivolous, but there are also other songs such as The End or just Breathe, which are classified as very dark Song's, even though they have something positive. 
On both, I had the tears when I heard how Ed she played, and it is very dark Song's. 
I believe that if you are older, and something drastic has happened in your life - for example, if a family member or a friend loses - influenced your artistic creation and your music, and these two Song's embody the clear for me. 
But I am also of the opinion that we have to be a happy man and can still make dark music.

The former President Alberto Fujimori was on Tuesday in a public hospital, in order to investigate the loss of his legs, told his GP.

Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations 
An official delegation, led by the Uruguayan President Jose Mujica and consisting of several ministers and professional starting Tuesday their visit from Mexico to expand the trade between the two countries and to discuss political issues in the region. 
Mujica is on the next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, according to the Uruguayan president is the culmination of his full schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the group of Uruguayer living in Mexico. 
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara, "for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," the president of the South American country announced on his website. 
According to local media Mujica support Calderón's regarding the incident with France when the French leader Nicolas Sarkozy at the summit of the G20 in the French city of Cannes, the South American country on a list of tax havens. 
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to ensure that those countries which still act as tax havens, to be excluded from the international community, and this statement was rejected by Uruguay and prompted a question during his ambassador to the European country. 
Mexico has been in place since November, the Presidency of the G20, a group consisting of the world's most powerful emerging and developed countries, but since January of this year, there is an agreement on the exchange of tax information in order to avoid the duplication in excess of the South American country. 
The government of Uruguay has tried in recent years, the practical implementation of agreements to speed up the exchange of tax information from the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to be scrapped, and this is something that countries are not all international standards for cooperation in tax matters. 
At the business level, since 2004, a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay, with a growing exchange of goods between the two countries has contributed. 
The schnurrbärtig plumber is breaking with "Super Mario 3D country," the third dimension 
Super Mario has worked tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but until now never in three dimensions: "Super Mario 3D country," he fights for the love of the girl in Stereo-Technologie. 
The game, which this month all the world is coming to the shop counter, was the beginning of the characteristics of the portable Konsole Nintende 3DS three-dimensional played without a special lens. 
"Mario is the figure who must say how the Stereoskopie works without glasses," he told Omar Alvarez, who is responsible for the Nintendo specialised press in Spain during the presentation of the video game in Madrid. 
Álvarez said, "Super Mario 3D country" was "the first video game from Nintendo, which from the outset has been developed for this Konsole ', because until now have been success stories such as" Star Fox 64 3D "or" Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D " adaptations of existing titles. 
The spokesman for Nintendo stressed that, even though it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D" is an "affordable" video game, which will permit a quick, fluid game. 
Alvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D" two games in one: the first part is "easy" to obtain the less geschckten users. 
Then the experts on different levels, which are becoming more and more difficult, a "second round." 
It also allows users in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only the depth of the action. In order to overcome the obstacles, without falling victim to the "optical effects," however, must always be played three-dimensional. 
This excursion Super Marios in the three-dimensional world will also mean the return of the figure to a portable Konsole, which is no longer the case since 2005. 
In this video game Nintendo zwinkert fans of the saga, and repeated the recipe for success in the past: the schnurrbärtig plumber must overcome with dangers peppered platforms in order to liberate the Princess Peach. 
However, the players on news of the movements, the environment, the stepping and the enemies - and a "spielbar" Luigi.

Trinijove has 6 000 young people threatened by social exclusion helped

Besetztes House, in which big parties were held, was cleared 
The homeowners had 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on the street Balmes No 51 (Barcelona). 
The 12 besetzer left the building yesterday afternoon to have done without resistance. 
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbours of the house number 51 on the streets of Balmes have found an end. 
Twelve people were pulled out yesterday lunchtime voluntarily the building, which they illegally occupied and in which they organised huge festivals, the neighborhood had driven to despair, but the evacuation was carried out on a court order without police intervention. 
After the evacuation, the door has been replaced, in order to avoid a similar situation. 
"Now the access will be controlled," the house manager confirmed. 
The besetzer house, 11 of the 13 homes had occupied the building - the rest were inhabited - the entire electrical plant and part of the water supply, and they had angemalt the walls and all sorts of rubbish left behind, especially with alcoholic beverages. 
In the three lower floors were celebrated huge parties, which lasted up to two days, and the tenants to despair. 
In addition to the building, a disco, Balmes 51, which also bore the damage. 
Your holder Maria Pantinat Europe Press declared that their business since the beginning of the occupation would have fallen by 80%. 
The owner of the disco pointed out that the besetzer made their unfair competition because they were selling the drinks to three euros, while those in the disco cost 10 euros. 
In addition, the Freizeitlokals woman who had been reported from the neighbours because of disorder, while she said the noise was not derived from the visitors to the disco, but from the besetzers house, and in particular the guests of the festival, where they were organized, and according to the angry neighbours in the last few weeks have always been more and longer. 
The leaders of the disco, said that the harassment was so great that it came with the owner of the building, paying no rent for the last nine months. 
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in the last few weeks have received more complaints from the neighbours. 
The leader of the PP (Partido Popular (People's Party) in the City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had demanded last week to evacuate the building immediately, and the problems of civil coexistence, as well as the reduction of the districts to get to grips with. 
He said that before the summer just one floor of the building was occupied, but that the besetzer house in the last few months in all the floors of the building and were almost all homes. In some, it was even to thieves. 
In this sense, he added, that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and combat anti-social behaviour in the building." 
Yesterday there was another building in the Nou district Barris removed from the Catalonian police. 
At 3.30pm, the police approached Montral No 35 on the street after they received a call from a neighbour, who had watched as four people tried to penetrate into the building. 
The four were arrested immediately. 
Park or mountain? 
The architects are apart from the disputes over the fees agreed with the call for tenders. 
The urban tender on 16 windows opened the debate about the importance of Collserola in Barcelona. 
In the middle of the 1980s, at the height of the now lost Spanish Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the administration published its Schmähschrift on the promotion of Collserola. 
The brochure described the mountain as a vast park in Barcelona city. 
He was even in figures from the Central Park in New York. 
With the sinking of the CMB in 1987, the park in the eyes of many back to the upper limit of Barcelona, as the capital of Catalonia is among the few who are not spreading in North and South, but upwards (mountains) and down (sea). 
The Collserolas classification as a natural park is playing with this idea. 
When the Image is now no longer the Central Park, but yellow stone with wild boar in the role of the Yogibärs. 
So far, it was when the city in September, a giant, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access points to Collserola. 
No doubt it is a gateway to the concept of a park. 
Either that, or someone has to make windows in the country. 
The question is: Collserola, park or mountain? 
The tender is not only from the organizational perspective, but also in terms of a reflection on the city, the topic of discussion in the mouths of all architects from Barcelona. 
It is almost a rekurrentes issue on which two members of the old eingesessenen caste, who meet in the lift. 
And it is precisely this fact provides the substance for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona, and some university professors, who have applied to the project. 
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the tender is appropriate. 
For Roldán "it is necessary," after the attack on the coast on the "front of the mountains," as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, green apples, has not been resolved. 
"It should be based on the principle that is Barcelona's biggest park is the beach. 
Among other things, because it is accessible. 
Collserola is more complex, "the architect, for which the title" windows of Collserola "an" intellectual case ": it must not be" as access to a park, but as a delimitation of areas in which needs to be done. " 
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, viewed the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that "a number of risks." 
Dangers arising from the "uncertainty, the creation of a public space today" after the experience of the 1980s, in the area of the forum "swan song." 
The first fear is his own limits on what can be built. 
"Something always means to determine the next step," i.e. to exceed it. 
"We need to rethink urban planning instruments, because the present (with reference to the plan, General Metropolitano (PGM) ] can lead to a real disaster." 
Modol, who is closer to the question, says simplified, the side of Collserola, the valle sana direction, "can be understood as a park in Barcelona direction," and for purely topographical reasons. 
Modol reminds us that there is already a study from the Patronat de Collserola, which is not "fallen on deaf ears," even though the city council is grateful that his body has given the opportunity to participate in this project "from the very first moment." 
He also notes that the proximity of the mountains to the city, which allows the architects to participate in the debate, even though he "doubts" whether this technical profile created multidisciplinary teams ("exactly the right thing," he says), ' we architects should only be a tool. " 
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, because the bidding conditions lacks a global view of Collserola: "It has been put out to tender in cross-section of 16 competitions," he says, "on the axis gebirge, but there is no längs perspective, which considers the territory in its entirety." 
This has resulted in his case, at least, that he participated in the 16 competitions. 
Otherwise, the programme and the definition of a project for a gateway through which the architect of the clash. 
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its whole length as a soft transition between urban and green zones. 
Jonás Larrazábal, who is free 
After 72 days of silence freed the trustees of the casino Red the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the trial against him for alleged extortion.

This Monday asked the trustees of the casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez Judge José Luis Pecina, the brother of the mayor to cancel the penalty, which is why he will be set at liberty in the next few hours. 
During the court hearing asked Ramiro Arias, the official of the court ordered Ministerio Público, García Gómez, whether it was repaired the damage and what the owner of the competition, which pronounced his forgiveness. The lawyer, however, kept the name back.

After the hearing of the agent of the House against 3.50pm Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released. 
The justice secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to the urban prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to tell Jonás that he has been acquitted, and his case would be placed on the file.

He also said that the helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why he met all the conditions for the transportation of personnel. 
Moreover, he said that during the investigations in the area in which the aircraft was decrepit, no helicopter parts were found.

At the moment, it is a priority to get the results as soon as possible, but it could be several months, perhaps even take a year. 
Seinerseits assured Gilberto López Meyer, Director of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (secretariat for planes and auxiliary services in Mexico) that the helicopters from the Estado Mayor Presidencial flew to the surcharge to travel by air speed and the plane had fallen to a soft Abhang. 
"This information strengthens the assumption that at the time of the impact was a normal flight operation." 
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, six relevant points, which should be taken into account in the investigation. 
Flight: 
In accordance with the standards, it was a flight in accordance with the rules of the IMF, which means that the team sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground should have had. 
Weather conditions: 
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at the start, while continuing to fly in the direction of the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico state some low-hanging clouds. 
Elected air routes: 
It is possible that the team because of the clouds, a lower area with a better view of the Cuernavaca-Tal had been selected. 
Impact: 
The Aufprallkoordinaten and the last radar recording of helicopters agree; perhaps it has neither a loss of control over the plane has been a deviation from the flight route. 
Were scattered in the ruins of the aircraft in a limited area. 
Until now, this information suggests that the helicopter was aufgeprallt from and direction. 
The pattern of scattered aircraft residues suggest that the helicopter was aufgeprallt with its intact structure on the ground. 
There is no evidence of fire or explosion. 
The remnants of the plane at the scene of an accident either on fire or explosion. 
The latest findings point to a number of soil pollution. 
During the investigations on the ground, aircraft parts on a total of 9200 feet above sea level, and the terrain, slope and has a Schrägung of seven to thirty degrees. 
The photographs show the sequence in which the helicopter is likely to break down. 
Some reports indicate that the helicopter had several contacts. 
After a meticulously searching in an area that went beyond the cordoned off area at the scene of an accident, not scattered aircraft parts could be found, which reinforces the assumption that the intact aircraft structure on the ground. 
MSS has announced a research protocol to the discovery of the gene for obesity 
Mexico's Social Security Institution is leading a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity among children and adolescents, which will be supported by specialists of the IPN. 
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Security Institution of Mexico) announced that a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity among children and young people under the title "genetics of obesity in childhood and youth," with which the genetic markers associated with obesity are to be found. 
Miguel Cruz Lopez, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (department for medical research, focus on biochemistry) at the clinic, Hospital de Especialidades del Centro regions Médico Nacional Siglo XXI stated that a multidisciplinary team, consisting of doctors, pflegern health, nutrition specialists and social workers has been built. 
This team will be supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate studies at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Italian de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN). 
The public is invited to take part in the study, interested parties will be able to IMSS sports venues in the valley of Mexico, where every Saturday from 8am tests will be carried out with children and adolescents. 
He stressed that the investigation on the sports ground of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state México) and began since the 8th October at the sports venue of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the federal state México) will continue. 
If the goal of 500 to 600 individuals is achieved, the study on the sports ground of Independencia (in the south of the main urban bezirks) continued and Morelos (in the north of the main urban bezirks) concluded. 
He said that the aim of the study is the understanding of the factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and young people to the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases. 
On the occasion of the global day of diabetes, he said it would seek three thousand children and young people aged from six to 14 years with the consent and under the supervision of their parents should fill nutritional questionnaires. 
They are also questions about their physical activity and their family vorgeschichte disease risk factors, diabetes or kidney failure could have meant to control. 
He also led to the aforementioned Samstags investigative subjects measured (weight, size, taille size), controlled their blood pressure and blood values such as the glukose level, Triglyceride, Cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt the identification of genes associated with obesity in childhood). 
Cruz Lopez stressed that the investigation would take advantage of the health workers concerned about the alarming weight of young people. 
"The health surveys from the years 1999 and 2006 showed that in less than six years the percentage of obese boys to 77 per cent and the girls with obesity had increased by 47%, while obesity has risen dramatically," emphasized the specialist of the IMSS. 
He admitted that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of Mexico's population of the differences in other nations. 
He admitted that a (e) Mexicans (in) to 65% in the average indianisch American, to 30 per cent of European and African descent to 5 per cent, which is in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity, reflects. 
More generally, he said, the genetics of obesity, the inability of the surplus of energy (calories) burned, so this will be stored in a form of fat. 
The researchers said that the direct benefit to the research participants would be in a comprehensive study of the children, which would determine whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity. 
It would even the appearance of different skin faltes in the neck and on the Innenarm (Akanthosis) on the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes at the preliminary stage. 
All the information would be kept confidential and the parents notified in writing by the doctors, but the doctors tell the parents all measurements and propose changes to the lifestyle, which are appropriate for the prevention of diseases. 
Cruz Lopez said that there would be three basic factors for excess weight, obesity and other chronic diseases are responsible: physical inactivity, which means a lack of movement on a daily basis, the most time of the day to spend before the television and use of transport to go on foot rather than short routes. 
The high caloric intake, which means an increased consumption of gezuckert beverages and Kohlenhydraten (Tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.), along with a high fat and protein, as well as genetics, which is to be analysed in this research project. 
Asphalt prevents leaks from the UNAM 
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the School of Chemistry in the Mexican university UNAM developed with Polymeren modified Asphalte to mix more resilient to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations 
If the signs, which stem from the road surface, it would not be necessary, nearly 200 000 to repair the holes when the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (urban areas in the valley of Mexico) breaks out, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers at the School of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and gave assurances that if the laying and maintenance of the Asphaltbelags proper, significantly reduced the number of bumps, or even completely avoided. 
In his presentation, "the revenues from a technical perspective," he to mark the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory, for which he is responsible, with Polymeren modified Asphalte was developing, producing a similar mix the asphalt, but a larger mechanical resistance both high and low temperatures. 
Herrera Nájera said that this kind of modified Asphalte in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the road surface, thereby avoiding the appearance of bumps. 
He explained that the asphalt - the hardest part of oil - a hydrocarbon link is part of a high molecular weight - the so-called Asphaltene - and the other part a low - the so-called Malthene, and together they give the road surface his characteristic zähelastisches behavior. 
Zähelastisches behavior in the asphalt means that this high temperatures of nearly 180 °C behaves like a liquid, 120 degrees is very liquid and 50 °C almost solid, while he is fragile at very low temperatures. 
"This means that the resilience of the asphalt is not uniform on the streets, but on a day in accordance with the changing weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," led the chemical engineer. 
The researchers observed the FQ, the streets of Mexico City would have a majority of a flexible surface, which is composed of six layers of materials, of which the last three asphalt dissidents. 
Between the upper classes is a wear layer of asphalt from small asphalt and stones. 
Every single stone of this wear layer is in asphalt. 
If the vehicles to move and forces will be created, this section provides a good balance of power on the road surface. 
"If it is modified asphalt, the forces would be even better," said the chemical engineer. 
"The wear layer," he " is being interpreted in a recent class, the so-called Tragschicht, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. from sand, which was also in asphalt. 
As this layer in contact with the car tyres, they need a larger mechanical force than the wear layer and they must produce friction. 
The road surface receives the most power and distributed, the Tragschicht also needs an appropriate thickness and the material from which they must be maintained. 
The weather conditions, particularly humidity and temperature fluctuations, are more important to take into account factors, above all, the water, "he said," because it greatly affects the behaviour of the wear layer. 
If the site is wet, water seeps into the class and is difficult, and this is causing a dilution of all sections of the road surface and as a result, the incidence of bumps. 
If a hole is created, "he said," will initially cover layer worn out, while the wear layer only after that will be affected, but the damage is not immediately, but it is a process that the first signs of adequate maintenance programmes should be maintained. " 
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (Mexican national research system) said that the car of another important reason for the appearance of bumps, and it is therefore crucial that the thickness of each layer of the surface is always in relation to the vehicle and it must be ensured that the avoidance of frequent bumps will be complied with these rules. 
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research, for example, on Asphaltemulsionen, which in other countries are already on the market, and with which the bumps simply and without application of high temperatures could be repaired. 
What was missing from the candidate del Valle, the new Miss Colombia? 
Analysis of the factors that played that Melina Ramírez Serna was the crown of Miss Colombia. 
El Valle gets its 14th title. 
Once again, Valle del Cauca empty in the awarding of the crown for Miss Colombia. 
This time had to Melina Ramírez Serna content to stand on the podium, a silver head and the band, which they regard as the new Miss Colombia to flaunt. 
This night result in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico crown and the cedar, the Department is already at 14 and Melina is linked to the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, which the Crown had almost been kept in the hands, are among the proclaimed Misses: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008). 
The big question many are asking today is: what was missing? 
The result is in line with the decline of a great favorite in any exhibition had shown that they had anything new to be Miss Colombia, but it was not for nothing that the Queen of the police and the Mejor Rostro Jolie elected by Vogue, titles, including the königins beauty Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had received, and the crown of Miss Colombia took home. 
The first factor, which is regarded as crucial to the decision of the panel to appoint the first Miss, is that the answer to the question, "what book has most influenced you and why?" of Martín Murillo Gómez Carreta aria Leamos, had not convinced. 
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner: 
"I read a lot, I think pretty much of the literature, I think it is a way to be civilised, in the end, I believe that the book, which for most shaped my childhood, 'the little prince' is a very profound book. 
At the moment I read 'guilt and expiation within'; it is a book of universal culture, which we should all read, but I just read a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian girl, a beautiful book, which says 'passions'. 
One answer, which was met with little love, firstly because of the term 'civilised' and, secondly, because it had no concrete explanation of how each of her book had affected them. 
But after the ceremony, Melina said to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is, it happens, what must be done. 
And for all the people: please read a little bit of 'the little prince'; it is a great book. 
Among other things, it is said that the darling of El Valle is charred. 
A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that it was the special, all Beifälle einheimste and had all prices in the runup to Easter gastronomy competition, popular vote on the best handgeschneiderte Kostüm and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had made jealously guarding the Queen stresste, who could not shine on the stage." 
And it noted that in its first presentation wear swimsuits on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and its two elevators in the krönung ceremony. 
Although it appeared in both safe, but it lacked the strength and the momentum of Magdalena and Atlántico displayed. 
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme "as en casa" on the channel RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss, "shows that the candidate who wins the highest prices during the competition, but will not be queen." 
It also came to the end of the press - a mistake. 
Another hypothesis is that Valle Jurie about their interest in social work was not convincing, which is ultimately the essence of the national beauty contest. 
There is a reason that two days before the composition of the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who stood up for the social affairs of their country. 
"The beauty of a Miss Colombia alone is not enough; we must look beyond the physical and focus on the social perception that they participate in the competition had been involved in projects," she said. 
There is also speculation that Valle with their Derriere and fibrosis defects found her in the stomach area, has said that he had sinned, but this is contradictory, because the jury chose it as a candidate for "natural beauty" with a healthy body, good eating habits and good physical work. 
The coach of a Queen, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina was not the best body, that there would be better, "but the problem with the fibrosis in the belly, which for me to be honest, it was hard to say, put their numbers on the last day." 
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the Cromos magazine, the fault of the woman from Valle del Cauca were the surgery she had undergone. 
"The operations are lines, but Valle did not know how they do it right. 
Her body has never been her strong side, and she had to pay for this post." 
As a result of this prize, which is the first time will be awarded by the national beauty contest was conceived after the appearance in a grim prediction, which should be true in the night, and it was getuschelt that Raymundo Melina a consolation prize was given to them not to come into the enjoyment of the crown. 
No matter whether it is true or not, in fact, that Melina today assumes its domination of the year, not as Queen, but as a princess, a position that offers the possibility of the appointment of the Colombian national beauty contest in one of the international competitions. 
However, it is one of a Queen, which, despite its overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, the crown was lost in history. 
This was the work of the doctor, who identified the body of Alfonso Cano 
A Lophoskopist from Cali was the man who "Alfonso Cano" identified in the story. 
The work of these officials plays a key role. 
Last 4 November was a Lophoskopist of the investigative unit of the Public Prosecutor's Office (CTI) from Cali as the man of the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - revolutionary armed forces of Colombia), confirmed: "Alfonso Cano" by comparison of the fingerprints. 
Of the seven Lophoskopisten in the department of the CTI, this week had Eliazar González on-call, a man from Puerto Tejada for 21 years is cooperating in criminal investigations and proceedings. 
At the start of his career working in communities of Chocó, where he often five days had to go into the jungle to reach the place where the bodies were found, he should identify. 
2000 siedelte Valle and after the completion of the necessary courses he specialised in Lophoskopie, which is the study of the skin is exposed to the friction, i.e. the hand and foot. 
In the week of the campaign against the so-called Alfonso Cano Eliazar pointed out, clothes to put at least three days. 
Something big is expecting him. 
Friday night he flew in helicopters from Palmira to Cauca. 
He knew that he should identify two corpses, and that there was a suspicion that a man who had guided the oldest Guerrilla in the world, and that is why he should Guillermo León Zehnfinger-Abdruckblatt Sáenz (his real name). 
However, when he reached with the Untersuchungste the place where the body was, he could not identify because of his physical appearance, because it resembled the images he had seen in the mass media, not in the least. 
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, wore no glasses and was much thinner. 
But fingerprints do not lie. 
Bewaffnet with a magnifying glass, ink, a Pflanzkelle and a pocket lamp Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those on the abdruck page. 
He was right: it was "Alfonso Cano." 
The same night was this man coming from Puerto Tejada responsible for the defence minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, pointing out that it really was the leader of the FARC. 
On the track 
For a Daktyloskopen from the Sijín in Cali, the commemoration of President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar Gonzalez at a press conference on the use of "Cano" very important. 
Many people do not know our work. 
The Daktyloskopie is an exact science without error rate, which is a key factor in the dissolution of a crime. 
Lophoskopisten not only identify the bodies, they also support an investigation into murder and robbery cases and confirm the identity of the arrested persons. 
During their arrest, many criminals are false identity papers or they did not. 
We are taking fingerprints and searching for them in the database. 
The researchers told us that he was in a theft of a piece of the wall had to pull out of a house, because the thief had just aufgestützt with his hands at this point, as he is a safe filled with jewelry and money herauszog. 
"The walls are difficult, because their surface are unsuitable for fingerprinting, but in this case, we have been able to take the shot in the hand and the criminals, who had participated in several thefts, identify," he recalled. 
With the help of the fingerprints of murder suspects can also be discharged or contaminated. 
Recently, a dead was surrounded by crackpot bottles. 
During the investigation, it was suspected that a family member could be tatverdächtig and a fingerprint actually agreed on the bottle. 
Although it does not guarantee that the murderer, but he will be the place where the crime was committed. 
A Daktyloskopist of the CTI stated that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical Reagenzen would be taken away from the object." 
If they appear to be a Pflanzkelle or a band will be used for the carriage. 
After that, the prints are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or Personenstandamt. 
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without papers," said the expert from the CTI. 
He said that everything was not so much as it was portrayed in the TV series SCI. 
Just as it is not all gold that glitters is not everything it touches turns to a fingerprint. 
But he can still be used when carrying out an appropriate comparison. 
The "Empörten" call on the authorities in New York 
Hundreds of demonstrators huddling in tents on the zuccotti Square. 
A large proportion of the clearance order came after he changed his location in a nearby park. 
The members of the movement Ocupy Wall Street on Tuesday urged the authorities of New York when they tried again with a court warrant to enter the Manhatten-Platz after dawn had been removed from the room and had tried a different place in the Big Apple to fill. 
Hundreds of demonstrators huddling in the zuccotti Square, in which they are with a court warrant, the "Empörten" once again allowed tents at this point, to gain access to, meanwhile, had a different part of the movement of the clearance order and occupied a park further north in the city, where it came to nine arrests. 
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to campen on the place, we find ourselves in a different place, and the battle with legal means to return to the Zuccotti, with petitions and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the movement "Ocupy Wall Street." 
Bray was pointing out that the response of the "Empörten" on the evacuation of their tent camps, directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York had been ordered to court, where Judge Lucy Billings was an injunction banning the forced evacuation of the place and the protesters authorized the tents. 
It also occupied the "Empörten" a new park, which is at the crossroads of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue in the vicinity of the entrance to the holland Tunnel, the New York and New Jersey, and is the property of Trinity Church. 
They were able to place at least one hour, but then the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray can give no precise figures, but he assured the Efe news agency that he had seen several journalists in handcuffs. 
The organisation said it had hundreds of people joined at this stage, in which a delegation of religious leaders as a sign of their support of the members of the movement and had arrived with the police for mediation. 
In the meantime, the zuccotti (a site on private property) closed in anticipation of a court hearing is scheduled for this Tuesday, and in which the legality of the light grey held evacuation is to be analysed. 
Some of the demonstrators through the square wore photographic copies of these court orders and distributed them; they gave them even some police officers, the place where "some small clashes" as a result, Bray said, which indicated that some police officers, protesters were beaten. 
The court ordered the authorities to ban members of Occupy Wall Street to remove from the room, as well as the use of "laws, which were adopted after the occupation, and to prohibit the demonstrators with their tents and other things that they had already been used to return to the park." 
Mayor Bloomberg is clearly in front of the press, which as a result of this court orders the reopening of the place for the public transport and the demonstrators had been lifted, and the demonstrators, he pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to return to this place with tents and sleeping bags. 
The mayor defended himself in his grey conducted evacuation of the zuccotti grounds, in which nearly 200 people were arrested, and the decision was made because the demonstrators "contravened the law." 
Bloomberg said he would have given the order to the evacuation of the place, because it "was transformed into a place where the people were not protesting, but to break the law and, in some cases, in order to harm other people" because "threats have received some shops" and the surrounding community bangten "to her life." 
"The evacuation of the dawn was sickening and shows that Bloomberg is essentially on the protection of financial interests and not interested in protecting the interests of the North American workers," the spokesman added the movement of the anschuldigte mayor "does not respect the freedom of press." 
The leaders of "Occupy Wall Street" were informed that they thought about it, "significant actions" to be organised for Thursday, along with local organisations and trade unions in the two months, the protests have been ongoing since 17 September to commemorate. 
Pamela Anderson is in the TV-Weihnachtsshow of the Virgin Mary 
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities will be on 1 December in the TV-Programm 'it's a Russell Peters deserve' 
The Canadian citizen Pamela Anderson was Tim Allens assistant in "Home Improvement" rescue swimming in "Baywatch" rabbit in "Playboy," the wife of the rock musicians Tommy Lee and now the actress and model in a Christmas broadcast of Canadian television the Virgin Mary. 
The private television channel CTV today announced that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (aden sänger), Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities on 1 December in the TV-Programm ' it's a Russell Peters deserve " and a very special Virgin Mary to breathe life. 
CTV, there are pictures of the television programme, in which Anderson - the spread on the Internet of himself gedrehten Pornos, in which they, along with her former husband, the actor of "Mötley Crüe" Tommy Lee seems as Virgin Mary with a doll in the womb, Jesus is supposed to be. 
The scene seems Peters, a well-known Canadian comedians of the indigenous origin, who recently as moderator of the program "My Violent torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen, worked as a child of the earliest. 
The Christmas programme of CTV is not only on Anderson and Peters, also Canadian singer Bublé, at the end of March in Buenos Aires, the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato married, and this controversy is not far away. 
Recently, Bublé in one of his concerts in New York, the North American politician Kim Kardashian described as a "whore." 
Japan will be reborn after the earthquake 
The GDP is growing by 1,5% thanks to domestic consumption and put an end to the spiral of free fall from the beginning of March 
Since the last March was paralyzed the Japanese economy, which is still in the recovery after the devastating earthquake, the einmündete into a nuclear crisis and the worst catastrophe that Japan had lived through the Second World War. 
The initial estimates of the government in Tokyo evaluated the damage to 300 000 dollars, a blow that despite the difficult global economic situation, it seems to weaken. 
After three quarters were permanent nden case, the data on gross domestic product from July to September, finally to close this chapter: the GDP grew by 1,5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the average estimate for the year. 
The measured value in the second quarter - in Japan the year begins in March 2012 - is also the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010. 
The recovery can partly through the sale of machinery for the rebuilding of the earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated areas will be declared. 
In fact, the companies increased their investments by 1,1% compared with the decline of 0,9% for capital investments, which were recorded from January to March, the first decline in unaufhaltsamer increases after six months. 
Nevertheless, the real turnaround of the Japanese economy is not exclusively from Keynesian stimulus, using the crisis to build infrastructure or build new. 
Aufgewacht, Japan, in particular, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP. 
This variable rose by 1%, initiated by the growing spending on cars, travel and leisure activities. 
The stigma of the yen 
Tokyo has been entrusted to the domestic market after the yen - Japanese currency - in one of the "safe currencies" of investors, before the debt crisis in the euro zone and the gloomy forecasts for the SA to flee, a privilege as a gravestone rests on the accounts of export companies. 
With a stronger currency, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of the major technology producers. 
Toyota and Sony, for example, had its weak trading results from July to September on the listing of the yen. 
While the markets continue to besieged the peripheral countries, the government Yoshihiko Noda remains vigilant. 
"We must pay attention to the continuing risks, for example, to the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said yesterday the state secretary for economic policy, Motohisa Furukawa. 
The prospects are not really very aufheiternd. 
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that the majority of Member States in September, clearer signs of a slowdown in economic development. 
The indicator of the turning points of the global economy has brought to light, that would be drawn from the greatest economic potential for the brakes. 
It fell by four tenths up to 100,4 points compared to the 100,8 in August. 
The euro zone is even below the average of 100, after it fell by eight points to 99.13 points. 
Athens casts doubt again 
Papadimos says that the austerity measures would be adopted, but the Conservatives will sign a written agreement 
The risk premia in the level of the peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece strays even further in the maze that leads to the great European debt crisis. 
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more likely is a response to pressure from Brussels as a genuine belief that the political forces that is slowly backed by facts. 
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the 100 days have agreed on his appointment may be too short for their implementation, assured the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, that he supported the new austerity measures, and in any case, his call for new elections on the planned date, 19 February, will be back. 
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions that were made at the summit of 26 October," Papadimos assured yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government will reach its peak. 
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, the reform of the disciplinary code for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first steps. 
Nevertheless, Samaras acknowledges the doubts about his attitude is not enough: "We are committed to supporting the interim government, but otherwise nothing." 
The Conservative leader was a step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the body of the 8 000 million Athens urgently needed entsperren, and he made it clear that he did not pledge would approve of the implementation of the austerity measures. 
But the European Commission, because of the impact of the poker game with Papandreu referendum is still irritated, yesterday reaffirmed its demand was not changed: the economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties "a clear written agreement as soon as possible" to sign up. 
The spokesman of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, stated that the inspectors of the troika "very soon" would come to Athens to discuss with the new government, "as for the payment of the sixth paragraph" in excess of 8 000 million euros "is needed," although there is still no final date. 
The Greek tangle has yet for a while thread. 
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments of progress and hope" 
The Queen stressed the "dominant" position in Spain in relation to this type 
Spain "has a dominant position in the world in terms of the role of public financing." 
The Queen of Spain Sofía yesterday recalled that Spain is in the last two decades around the world for the second donor was developed for this tool for international cooperation, but its "essence" is based on an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for the whole of humanity on the basis of trust in the people." 
Yesterday the Queen weihte fifth world summit on micro-credit in Valladolid, she was convinced that there is "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely essential" to the United Nations by the year 2015 to achieve ambitious Millennium Goals and "especially the goal, the number of people with incomes of less than one dollar a day to live below the poverty line." 
Spain "will continue to work" on the expansion of the network beneficiaries "until the last corner of the world, and it does this task responsibly," said the Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions from the summit, which lasts until Thursday, will be based on "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women," as the main beneficiaries of these loans are guaranteed. 
"We have many successes recorded" and "face many challenges." 
The summit on micro-credit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform to push "of two fundamental goals." 
The Queen has said that it will achieve that by the end of the year 2015, 175 million poor families access to these financial services and that 10 million of these households will exceed the poverty line. 
The concept of micro-credit in Spain and the rest of the world Muhammad Yunus, "a few years ago initiated way back" to the Queen Sofia as an "act of justice and recognition." 
The father of this financial instrument described it as an "admirable idealist who is committed to the fight against poverty" and whose work they have known for 15 years ago, when the Queen visited Bangladesh to learn about the lending strategy on the ground. 
This experience was followed by a year later the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings on the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. In all, "we are witnessing a steady development," said the Queen, whose commitment to this project yesterday as "the head of the family" in Valladolid and as an "advocate of the poor." 
Finally, the Queen Sofia ended her speech by the people to participate in the debate and to search for solutions in the fight against poverty. 
"Ethical imperative" 
The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity "an ethical imperative" for the entire democratic state. 
In this sense, they said, it was a mistake to tie the development aid in times of economic boom, because it was a "lasting commitment." 
Jiménez was of the opinion that micro-credit is a "serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty," and that the governments of the industrialized countries are now "more than ever," would have to work for solidarity criteria, and should not allow the solidarity victim of the crisis. 
For Spain, microcredit is one of the "most important forms of development aid." 
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success," "disadvantaged" people, "which are always closed doors" to give "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, here was welcome in a city that "its doors, contaminated by the spirit of solidarity" is to be opened. 
The CDU proposes that the EU president to be elected by general vote 
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, 14 November was in Leipzig for Angela Merkel, chancellor and chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, with no real problems. 
The future of Europe was not originally foreseen in the programme, but has prevailed in the autumn, especially for those activists to make government policy regarding the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax. 
The resolution proposed by the Bureau of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously. 
1001 delegates had only nine voted against, 10 abstained. 
The several minutes of standing ovation on the basis of which Interventionserlässen at first, Angela Merkel, as well as a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, were left by the three European zugeneigten Finance Minister no doubt open. 
The main idea of the Chancellor, as well as the Antrage - the following slogan: "The response to the crisis is" not less but more Europe ." 
It is not simply because Europe is peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro." 
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe." 
This could be the control of the European Union, reinforcing the overhaul of the Lisbon Treaty on the budget policies of the countries in the euro zone, as well as it could, however, in the election of the President of the European Commission based on universal vote result "in order to give Europe a face." 
But in any case, this is one of the proposals approved by Congress, which clearly Wolfgang Schäuble. 
Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 quickly agree on this revolution: big britannien is opposed to the cause, and the flagship of the CDU think to know that Nicolas Sarkozy, of the same opinion. 
But the milestone has been laid. 
Similarly, the delegates in an overwhelming majority the proposal of the weighting of each country according to the Executive Board rejected the weighting of the individual economies, which is obviously a strong position in Germany. 
The calming effect on the climate within their party considered Chancellor has therefore references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl stepped up, but it has not tried to Congress on costs of the "small" or the European countries are in difficulty to win immediately criticize the arrogant Germany. 
As far as the resolution of the importance of the "Franco-German friendship" devoted a paragraph calling on Angela Merkel, France is not on the plan. 
At least not directly. 
Because it reminds us that Leipzig two centuries ago was at the centre of a bloody battle. 
In fact one of the zuhöchst the humiliating defeat of the Napoleonic army. 
What represents the fraud in health care coverage? 
After the family benefits UMP and government health reports. 
Nicolas Sarkozy will on Tuesday, 15 November arrive in Bordeaux to visit a family aid fund and a speech about it - has already been in place since 2007, the recurring theme of the fight against social fraud, as well as to raise economic dependence on the state. 
In order to accompany this attack, which comes from the desire to take the economy in an acid test, on the other hand, however, no less a harbinger of an axis of right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on employee health reports. 
The first haushaltswirtschaftlichem goal: the government is aimed at the introduction of a fourth Karenztag before taking a health care speech to workers in the private sector. 
In plain language this means that a sick worker without the approval of the specific company would lose the wages of four days, so at least 15% of his monthly income. 
One measure, which, according to the newspaper "Les Echos," sparking anger threatens, however, would help to bring 280 million euros. 
And with a different measure more symbolic nature: the state officials to grant a unvergüteten Karenztag in sickness (so far there is for them, in Gegensatze on the three days of waiting in the private sector, no waiting period). 
Meanwhile, these issues are in the discussion also cranked up the majority of new issues, and this time will be aimed at the abuses associated with working absenz. 
"Checks will be much more important, and they are also rückzuvergüten, if this is required," warned Javier Betrand on Sunday, 13 November before the microphone of the broadcaster RTL. 
As in other cases, the effects of this reporting about the reality of fraudulent activities in the field of health information is a little unproportioniert. 
This is, in fact, has already been the subject of permanent observation since 2002, as well as political offensive operations, which have borne the most fruit. 
The French are no longer more sick than people elsewhere in Europe. 
However, Verweilen first with the nationwide figures. 
According to the national health insurance fund CNAM, in 2006, more than EUR 237 million abfindungen paid. 
According to the research and Documentation Institute of the health care system, the daily abfindungen in 2008 with 11.3 billion euros 5% of health spending. 
This figure fell 46% on maternity leave, as well as accidents and 54% on holidays, which means EUR 6.2 billion. 
And, therefore, 2,5% of health spending. 
In 2010, the French compared with the 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma consultation group averaged just 14.5 days allowed. 
An average, masks some differences: a different monster in 2007, the website for career planning, has been published, showed that 75% of the 40 000 French workers claimed to have taken a single Krankentag. 
Another study covered by health insurance is clear that 37% of health coverage in 2010 of shorter duration than were 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11%. 
Compared with their European neighbours, the French workers tend not more than anywhere else on incapacity. 
One in 2010 by two researchers from the French national Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) conducted long-term study showed that between 1994 and 2001, the global absenz ratio (the reduction or otherwise justified) oszillierte, and in France between 10% and 11% to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom, or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands. 
The fraud in health coverage represents a very small proportion in terms of undeclared work. 
With regard to the fraud only a weak level will be achieved here. 
The legislation since 2002 is that there are systmatische controls on health coverage exceeding 45 days. 
In 2008, the CNAM (public universities for education and training of technicians and engineers) below 1.5 million inspections found that 13% of the 285 000 of the short-term health coverage, which means in 37 050 cases, "unjustified or too long." 
When it comes to the systematic monitoring of patients to speak "cases of more than 45 days duration was 11%, from 1.2 million in" unangepaßt or unjustified " cases, which means 132 000. 
Overall, therefore, makes this 169 000 'unjustified' cases to several millions of workers who have been in force. 
One paragraph, which is only a small scale compared with, for example, those who represented the black economy. 
According to the UMP-Abgeordneten Dominique Tian, author of a report published in July on this issue, it is between 9 and 15 billion euro tax cuts per year, i.e. more than the total cost of day-to-day expenses, and thus far more than the Defraudation in the latter. 
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan 
Greece has a new adjustment programme needed to absorb its economy. 
This has had on Monday, 14 November, the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos told the House of Anfügen the fact that his government from the European Union granted a hundred days were not enough to carry out this task. 
"In order to continue the efforts to achieve a strong economy, we need support of our European partners, as well as a new programme of fiscal adjustment," said the head of government in his first public speech at the Eröffung of the debate on the confidence of Parliament on Wednesday. 
The implementation of the occasion of the summit meeting on 27 October decisions was the "main task" of the new government, with the participation of the country within the euro zone "at stake," he added. 
Similarly, M. Papademos planned, the country's public deficit to 9% of the gross domestic product from now until the end of the year after this in 2010 fell from 10,6% and stood at 15,7% in 2009. 
The right to reject the new austerity measures 
Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had on Monday its consent to the previously approved measures in terms of the escape attempt from the debt crisis, but said that his party did not agree to an additional austerity measure would erkären. 
"We will not vote in favour of the new measures," he said during a parliamentary meeting of his party's new democracy. 
He had been with the requirements of the reduction of budget deficit and debt, as well as the fight against waste, however, has been hostile to any policy that would stop the economic recovery. 
Olli Rehn, EU-Kommisar charged with economic and monetary affairs, which had prevented the IMF and EU need loans over EUR 8 billion not without written guarantees from all parties on whose support of the planned measures, Antonio Samaras had replied that his word was enough and there is nothing he would sign under pressure from foreign policy. 
Euthanasia and Freitod must be legalised, a panel of experts 
The Canadians live in denial of death, as a report by the Royal Society of Canada 
The panel said that governments, institutions of health care and doctors about pain linder treatment were prepared for the best palliative means, and this is also about the cancer. 
The Canadian society is living in a state of denial about the death. 
Only 9% of Canadians are really with their doctor to talk about conditions under which they wish to die and make provisions for this purpose. 
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report from the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved in various disciplines, including ethics, law and medicine, are linked. 
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law so as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where this election is, and in patients who are considered to be in a position to make such a decision. 
As a start, the experts cite a recent survey by the independent EIU society, the quality of death in 40 countries compared to the Erdballes. 
Although Canada has placed on the 10th grade, the study noted that "the medical care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to broach the subject of death." 
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to painkillers, as reported by the Royal Society of Canada ordered experts. 
And despite the overwhelming majority of Canadians want to die at home, but ultimately die 68,6% of those in hospital. 
The whole country has seen the rate of 86% of deaths occurred in a hospital in Quebec, the highest. 
On the sensitive issue regarding euthanasia and etem suicide, the authors of the report with conclusions that the position of the federal government, which has already made no changes to the criminal law on euthanasia and accompanying etem want to carry out suicide. 
Now, however, there are, according to the experts who have inspected all those countries whose approach euthanasia and assisted suicide were legalized or drug, no evidence that such abuses in their application, which is the practical implementation of euthanasia or etem suicide of unkompetenten or not consenting individuals would entail. 
On the contrary, we meet considerably more cases of such violations, particularly in the countries where there is no legalized euthanasia and assisted suicide, such as Jocelyn Downie yesterday, a co-signatory of the report, confirmed in a teleconference. 
"Euthanasia is in Canada, where it is clearly illegal." 
"Suicide is practiced in Canada, even though this is clearly illegal," said Jocelyn Downie. 
Canadians support euthanasia 
Let us remind ourselves that according to a reid angus carried out by the year 2010 poll showed 85% of Canadians had spoken in favour of euthanasia, because they are of the opinion that it would allow these people at the end of their career to alleviate their suffering. 
And 66% believe that the issue of legalization of euthanasia was not meant to convey the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people had less value. 
As for the people who have already done an assisted suicide, the respondents represented 41% of the opinion that they should not be prosecuted. 
As for maintenance or suspension of the funds for patients is less clear, as the authors of the report. 
It also suggests that in its recommendation that the criminal law should be indicated that the dumping of funds, for which there was a valid rejection, not as a criminal should apply. 
The panel of experts calls for professionals in the health care system should be trained in the job, a possibility of making the funds at the end of life to be respected, and this without fear criminal prosecution. 
The panel said that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked on linder treatment, the best palliative to make money, and this is also about the cancer. 
Finally, the body is calling on the Canadian health care institutions far-reaching used funds for pain relief or final actions, at least to consider, because they just like euthanasia have served to reduce physical pain and bezögen on the same procedure. 
Reservations by other experts 
Some experts in the area of health care have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the experts' report put forward by the Royal Society of Canada. 
RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, has the attitude of reporting be signed experts among others described as "extreme" as the practice of euthanasia for patients in the final phase set no limits. 
"This opens the doors for a situation in which everyone tired and older than 18 years, another person to ask him to be involved in his suicide," RA Deschamps, who yesterday had seen a summary of the report. 
RA Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report was the responsibility of the individual over all other values, which are involved in social knitted of society. 
Now, he says, there would be "guidelines and commitments in a society." 
Margaret Somerville, expert on health law, also has "a strong resistance" against the conclusions of the report, which they regard as "Pro-Euthanasie-Manifest" titulieren. 
Margaret Somerville, itself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular, doubts the reporting details about the Nichtvorliegens of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide were legalised, such as in the Netherlands and in Oregon.

Damascus condemns a "plot" 
Syria is increasingly isolated 
The partisans Bashar al-Assad's have demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
The diplomatic pressure on Syria Bashar al-Assad's, thanks to the support of Russia and a "plot" directed against the country, yesterday stepped up.

"If Bashar is the interest of his country at heart, he would resign, but he should also have the necessary conditions to create a new era of political Syrian life," the King of Jordan, neighboring Syria, in an interview with the BBC. 
The Turkish diplomatic chief, Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, had complained that since the beginning of the year to the Syrian regime, türkis mediation efforts were not successful. 
"Those in the Middle East, which are not at peace with their people, and this may not be able to satisfy that need to go," he said in reference to Syria, the neighbouring country with which Turkey plays a steady increasingly unruly behaviour. 
For its part, the United States, the "intensification of the consensus against Assad, as well as the actions of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union welcomes. 
"The international community, the United States, EU, Arab League and countries such as Turkey, in the face of repression in Syria an ever sharper tone," observed Mark Toner, a spokesman for the state department. 
During this period, 16 civilians were killed and at least 19 members of the ruling power in the region of Deraa in the south of Syria came to death, then told the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH. 
Two other civilians were under this NGO "exchanges of fire and heavy explosions at Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs have died. 
At a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid Moallem still believes the country "heading towards the end of the crisis." 
He has, in fact, with emphasis on the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from his duties, which in his view, is a "dangerous step." 
Syria "will not give up," he added, with the assurance that "the mied plot against Syria would fail." 
After the decision on the suspension of Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wants to see the deployment of 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media, as well as military observers in the country. 
The French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also spoken out in favour of the deployment of UNO-Beobachters civilians against repression of the regime that he, in his einkapselt "paranoia," protective side.

The Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov made the decision of the Arab League yesterday classified as "incorrect" to support any sanctions against Damascus to be careful, even though China, Syria has already had warned on the implementation of the emergency exit plan. 
Italy 
Monti, calling for patience and Italy to sacrifice 
Mario Monti, the future Italian Prime Minister has called for a little more time to build up its staff and implement a program that abfordere "victim" during the last few months of the government of Berlusconi regain lost creditworthiness. 
The former European Commissioner, yesterday before the current clash of trade unions and employers' schaft held a negotiation with the political parties. 
It was his job to convene a cabinet to parliament, which is relatively strict from external technocrats. 
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," Francesco Nucara, Member of the numerous smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after he had met with the President-in-Office of the Council. 
Gianfranco Fini, president of the Chamber of Deputies, in turn, had to wait for Mario Monti Parliament until Friday a vote of confidence is to make sure that the new government lacks sufficient support. 
The arrangements will be made in the presentation made by Monti culminate a deletion list undoubtedly from a dozen of ministers to the Head of State Giorgio Napolitano will be enough. 
Monti commented that yesterday's nervousness about the stock market and obligation markets called for their time. 
In "a democracy, there is a certain time" to prepare a government, as well as a government programme, he said in the statement seie "sure that the markets will show gedulig and sensitively." 
His appointment by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but the unrest had increased, especially after an unexpected industrial production decline in the euro zone in September. 
The incumbent prime minister should be an existing team composed mainly of technocrats, even though he had stressed to include, "politicians." 
The new government should only until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated. 
According to Gianfranco Fini, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government until Friday should be given the confidence of Parliament. 
Monti has committed since the start of his role in all urgency to work in the spirit of the goal, Italy to the "new leader" in Europe.

The EU is convinced that the Rome meeting its goal of a balanced budget by the year 2013, despite the austerity plans picked up in these last few months will not be achieved, in particular, has applied for new strong-arm measures. 
Emma Marcegaglia, head of the head "of Italy, who will meet with Monti on Tuesday, is also on the need for the economy," as a country that has no growth record deficit figures cannot be respected. " 
Monti, for his expertise and his independence as a European Commissioner (1994 and 2004) is known for an "epochal change" in Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconismus"; the "Professor" symbolises the "challenge of trustworthiness" and an "other Italy," the article authors. 
The big unknown here is seie the longevity of his staff. 
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections because Italy from now until April 2012 for 200 billion euros of government bonds.

Statistically, France had an economic growth driven by the consumption of 0,4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0,3%. 
The statistical office INSEE had, however, the market downturn revised the figures for the second quarter, with a deficit of 0,1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation. 
In reality, it is the fourth quarter, which economists most worried. 
Germany, for its part, had over the same period recorded a growth of 0,5%. 
A first projection of the entire euro zone is expected at 11 o'clock, with the European Commission warns against the risk of a renewed recession. 
Energy policy: 
Facts should prevail over dogma 
Can an issue that is not based on short-term considerations or should be treated as a result of emotions, it is certainly the energy policy. 
Availability and cost of electricity in a direct impact on the purchasing power, as well as the competitiveness of enterprises. 
It is reasonable to hold an election for a reason, on this issue and think about the position of nuclear energy. 
The debate will only bear fruit if the whole economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are being explored. 
The French people should express their opinion on objective facts, make rational data. 
Although 7 billion people on this planet are driving up the demographic evolution a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, is not a huge proportion of the world's population to forgo a vital element. 
At the same time, we must alleviate the scarcity of fossil resources to continue to produce steady electricity without the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue disappeared from the environmental debate, to forget, in order to fight against climatic anomalies. 
The accident of Fukushima changed any of these parameters. 
That is why blebt Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power. 
This is not the case in Belgium, which raises its decision on the need to find a replacement strings as an alternative source, in Switzerland, which intends to build the latest generation of nuclear power plants. 
Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few countries, are pursuing their projects against it will continue with determination. 
For its part, the United States have decided after Fukushima, their park another unit, making the plant shut down after the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island are again in operation. 
Even if the renewable energy sources, German model is sometimes portrayed as a model, but contradicts the reality the discourse. 
The election in Berlin will be an increase in the price of electricity prices, the increased use of Importgas increased energy dependence on Russia, in particular, an increase in carbon dioxide emissions caused by gas and coal-fired power plants. 
The entirety of these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months ago. 
The case of Denmark is a cause for reflection. 
Denmark is one European leader in wind power, from which it derives 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the biggest users of coal and gas, alternating with wind energy; so there are his CO2-Ausstösse, as well as its electricity price by 65% and 50% higher than the European average. 
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, pay our neighbours in contrast to our French households by 40% higher electricity bills. 
As the price of energy in the globalised economy a key element of competitiveness, as well as a measure of stability in the industry on national soil, the French companies have an advantage because of the cheapest electricity in Europe. 
Any significant reduction in respect of nuclear power would be a sharp increase in the price of energy, which the noble statements about the reindustrialisation of our country and defending the purchasing power of illusion. 
Polls showed that a price that the vast majority of French people, and neither is willing to pay, as opposition to the principle of this energy source. 
Let us remind ourselves that the energy policy of our country has made it an industry with 125.00 directly and create 410 000 jobs. 
Due to its strong export nature it brings a host of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises on the international markets and makes these creators of countless jobs. 
If France decision to get out of nuclear power, it would be a large part of these SMEs fall victim, and the annual 6 billion euros of capital goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more. 
What electricians would be an EPR designed to operate at 60 years if the demise of its producers is inevitable? 
In order to solve the energy equation, we must acknowledge that just a little bit like a devil is a panacea for the production of electricity. 
The company Areva developed low-carbon solutions to the use of nuclear power and renewable energy from the complementarity of energy sources. 
The highest possible safety standards to maintain nuclear power is an absolute imperative. 
In France, we have a safety authority, uncompromising and transparent controls in existing plants such as, for example, is carrying out the construction in Flamanville. 
Their teams, who have made a name for their professionalism, are the security obsessed. 
In the space of 50 years, the three nuclear industry has experienced serious accidents. 
Only a single, and Three Mile Island, has been under normal operating conditions; it did so without any consequences for humans and the environment. 
Chernobyl was the drama of reactor construction, as well as unendschuldbares, human error. 
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters have caused an unprecedented scale, the deaths of several tens of thousands of people. 
The nuclear industry will learn its lessons from this accident, as well as after the two previous had done. 
As a result of this approach, as well as a cooperation between the security forces of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power stations, the EPR is a draft of its resilience in the face of such phenomena possible. 
Since the electric technikers is deemed desirable to build a nuclear power plant, it would be a freeze in Flamanville a fabulous gift to the competition from Areva and EDF, giving them free rein, could be the leading position in the inevitable nuclear power development. 
It is absolutely necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to dominate a debate emotions, dogmas and Parteimanöber, as well as economic, social and financial situation of our country determined. 
Immigration is a burden or an opportunity for the economy? 
The immigration policy conducted under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from many corners - overload of police, judicial and administrative bodies on the basis of the figures derived from politics, the compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights," as France had calls itself. 
More recently, the harassment directed against foreign students was marked by the authorities' side, the weekly schaus, the interior minister had in passing (see liberation from 23 May) announced that France "no talent, Maurer or waiters from abroad." 
But this policy was only rarely from the economic point of view. 
Over this issue, there is a broad consensus between right and left. 
From the right side, the tone of Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900 people, including more than 2 million immigrierte workers, will pose no problem for a country," from left side by Michel Rocard, who had set out in 1990, France "could not accept the overall poverty in the world." 
The only difference is the level of generosity 
The fear of invasion of national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers, in 2005, both from the right and the left. 
From both sides, the immigrants as a burden on the economy and the French society. 
The only difference is the degree of generosity towards the immigrants who are willing to admit. 
Francois Hollande is restricted in his programme to cliché, partnership development, it will allow us to solve "migratory problems." 
This notion of immigration as a burden, as a problem, can possibly have an impact on the elections, but it is economically costly. 
As the economists Ian Goldin and Mr. Cameron in a recent note, which summarises the latest evidence regarding the immigration (Exceptional People: How migration Shaped World and Will Define Future May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.) that exists among the specialists a broad consensus about the positive impact of the flood of immigrants on economic growth, wages and jobs in the countries of immigration. 
The restrictions on immigration would weaken the growth and damage the labour market situation. 
The fears about the influence of the migrants are based on the idea that they are threatening the indigenous workers, especially the less qualified to replace by pressure exerted on their wages. 
However, experience shows that immigrants are in fact essential complementary than the local wage workers, because they focus on the jobs in sectors that are unausgelastet the job. 
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors, local wage workers poking little talented among immigrants working in dynamic sectors in which the training is not aligned with labour supply. 
We pay 
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of Anästhesists, this complementarity between locals and migrants have a positive effect of Einwandererzuzugs on wages and domestic labour market situation. 
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way, that a 1% increase in the flow of immigrants is a miteinbezogene, long-term increase in real wages between 0,6% and 0,9%. 
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas put forward by the immigrants, as well as the economic growth is conducive to (a high proportion of eingebürgerter immigrants under American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants). 
The migrants also contribute net to the social systems in European countries on average, for example, in an amount of 1% of the total budget. 
The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that at the age of 30 years after Germany immigrating the public budget on average a net contribution of his life (revenue minus expenses) of 150 000 euros. 
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to start his mandate, the lack of intersection "with teeth." 
These teeth, which were intended to deter the immigrants, but achieved exactly the opposite effect. 
Europe has invented the democracy now remains to rethink the European democracy 
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a sensitive commodity. 
The European continent should remind themselves, who after their invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, the entire 20th century about the tragedies of the First World War, of totalitarianism, of Holocaustes, of the Gulag, but also of Franco in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the colonels in Greece. 
Some believed that it will be enough to exercise the voting rights, and direktest possible way for democracy for all time to win over their enemies. 
You know since Napoleon "small," that was a feature of the spirit. 
The general election law, the necessary condition of democracy is not sufficient condition and may well be "repression," as it was then the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said. 
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation, separation and control of forces, training, education, economic and social community spirit, a jurisdiction. 
The crisis in Europe, in which we find ourselves is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and, above all, politics and democratic crisis. 
The change of heart of the Greek Wahr-Falsch-Referendums could have been doubly interesting character in this respect: the need for a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also those of the unsettling feeling of the impossibility of their Unangebrachtheit. 
This ambivalence should be seen as outdated. 
Truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now shifted, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer in the right direction. 
We have nothing to gain, in order to push for the success of the national referendum, which, in accordance with the requirements and has been organised in a perverse sequence. 
A free ticket for the European single ruler or a leap into the void of the nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the citizen. 
No, we want hacke lit, but a collective task, from right, clear and steady, an election and democracy, this time at the European level. 
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you know, in fact, no longer where to put an end to the list - because there is only one crisis, and this is in Europe. 
It is all over Europe, which is bowing to the dictates of the markets and the credit rating agencies, which is suffering under his powerlessness and his lack of solidarity. 
It is all over Europe, which is humiliated at international level. 
It is concerned about sovereign transfers towards Europe - it is all Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and so that every single one of its affiliated nations. 
The urgency is that the national sovereignty of the leadership of the European project. 
Because it is situated on the whole, whether the Europeans will reduce the burden of their debts, free from the markets and can introduce a future through investment. 
The exit from the crisis has made decisions at European level to the condition, which cannot be taken without a complete democratic legitimacy, without us quite sure to lead to destruction. 
After this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists for a long time, it was about fighting, and now everyone is pushing the European economic governance. 
I agree. 
But this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as they have in mind - that would be a renewed foolishness and another impasse. 
We need a new stage of European construction. 
In order to create the Republic in France, it took the Republicans to "create." 
The revolution of interests alone was not enough here. 
This instruction remains valid. 
We need to have an economic level better integrated Europe. 
This can only be achieved by a political, democratic Europe, to create a truly European national sovereignty. 
We need Europeans to build Europe. 
"Contact" smart cards will be introduced 
The World Fair opens for smart cards on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude to their doors. 
The year 2011 is smart with an 11% increase in global sales of phenomena microchips (EC-Karten, SIM-Karten-Telefon), with more than 6 billion sold units. 
The tragendste segment is the contact persons technology, payments on public transport or settling of purchases made by simply keeping the card to a reading device. 
Compared with a year earlier sold 320 million this year, 460 million contact smart cards will be sold worldwide. 
Its market share in 2012 should continue to grow (580 million expected units) and more than 10% of the global smart card market (6 925 million tickets). 
Europe wins in terms of contactless payment to land after a long time in the Asia Pacific region is behind hergehinkt. 
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75 000 payment terminals accept them. 
In France, the beginnings are modest: only 400 000 Contact Visa cards have been distributed. 
However, the consumer markets make steam. 
Carrefour has therefore this year 2.5 million contact passport cards issued. 
In order to move to higher speed, it is now necessary for the banks to provide their customers with these cards. 
"Two major French financial institutions have committed themselves to their customers in future to systematically distribute bank cards, which are drawn up with kontaktlosem chip," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director General of France. 
Banks test payment via mobile phone 
This is only a first step on the road to the medium of the future: the mobile phone. 
A tiny percentage of equipment is so far with the implementation of these transactions necessary NFC-Technologie (Near Field Communication). 
"You are in default." 
"But they should at least know what next year is a real upward trend." 
"We expect in 2012 with the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide," said Marc Bertin, chairman of the smart. 
But the banks take initiative. 
The Crédit yesterday announced the launch of a Testlaufes delivery, which will take place from December until next June. 
The iPhones of some 200 customers and staff are to be fitted with a contact. 
The BPCE is conducting a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille. 
And the Société Générale had testified yesterday to prepare for the roll-out of an offer to their customers who pay by mobile phone possible. 
Terrorist front, from the Sahara to Nigeria 
Paris is about the relationship between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect worried. 
It has long been under suspicion of links between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to confirm that. 
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Foreign Secretary Mr. cadres Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers is now "certainty." 
"The way in which both organizations, as well as the relations of the secret services point to a clear cooperation," he said without further detail. 
Paris seems to make a similar analysis. 
The investigation into the kidnapping took place last January, two French citizens in Niger have interfaces. 
In a restaurant in Niamey by supporters of the Aqmi gekidnappten Antoine de léo Betancour and Vincent Delory are on the following day at the same time as several of their abductors during an operation carried out by the French special forces have been getöten. 
French and Nigerian investigators want to see the ruins at a site several phone chips have found belonged to the terrorists. 
Terrorist axis 
The analysis of the telephone call leads to several interlocutors in Mali, Niger and Nigeria are stationed. 
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: a number leads to a Nigerian, for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram had stopped; the other leads to a man who, as the Aqmi and the sect is close. 
"This is a step forward, but there is no doubt that we will have to wait for clearer evidence before an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem." 
"It is conceivable." 
"You know for years that the sect financial and intellectual support of foreign policy concerns, and that this is increasingly active," the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo. 
In these last few months this "assistance" in its course has become ever more obvious, as well as the speeches, as well as the operational modes of Boko Harem, which is now on the drag of suicide bombers, as well as the use of evidence always complex explosives, which bear the same hallmarks as those which have been used by Aqmi. 
The international community, to begin in Washington, has been in place since that time pressure on Abuja to be there for the problems caused by Boko Haram. 
The Nigerian authorities have for a long time the grouping, in fact, regarded as a community of Illuminats, no special attention should be paid. 
Faster success 
In 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school, as well as the fundamentalist Imam Mohammed Yusuf founded Boko Haram - which in Haoussa means "Western education is a disgrace" following the establishment of an Islamic Sultanate in Nigeria's Muslim north. 
In this poor region, the merger of rapid success. 
It is politicised and strict observance of Sharia law, while its affiliated activists in the fight against the godless central government. 
The activists have first churches, bars and public authorities in their sights. 
In 2009, the Boko Haram militants stepped up attacks against police stations are particularly active. 
The reaction from Abuja is, however, as ordinary indifferenziert. 
The army surrounded the city, it is one of 800 people dead. 
The prisoner Mohammed Yusuf was killed in prison. 
As a result, the sect is quickly becoming more radical, and they leave their strongholds in the north. 
Last Christmas she confessed to an attack in Jos, which claimed 80 lives, then another in Abuja. 
In June, Boko Haram is blamed for a Selbstmordattentates at the police headquarters in Abuja, the first of its kind. 
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations to focus international targets. 
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, from Mauritania to Nigeria and Somalia, which has alarmed all security experts. 
While the Aqmi Mali and Niger has occupied the Somalis operate from al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the centre of the continent. 
Last week hatta Alain Juppé during a meeting with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, warned against Boko Harem and showed itself willing to "tell all the evidence." 
The world according to the Republican presidential candidate 
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry, disturbed by simplification and ignorance about China, Iraq, as well as the provision of aid to Israel. 
Can a krisengeschwächtes America is a complex world with simple, not to say: stupid ideas? 
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidate, the voters could almost get that impression. 
Over the past few days Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry, and their supporters in their thundering declarations and statements on foreign policy, traditionally Republican priorities, said repeatedly. 
China, Iran and the Israeli aid - often backed up in any way - slogans. 
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party" at the top of the course Mitt Romney threatened to cite the Chinese before the WTO and the "currency manipulation" - the leading issue in an America that the migration of industries to Asia strongly prefer not to blame. 
Stupid, if this is to imply the introduction of a trade war, he said. 
Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador to China, under Obama, and the only candidate to have a mature vision of foreign policy, it seems the emotions almost about his schmeichelnden behavior strangled. 
He had a firm, but constructive exchange of views with Beijing (also the current stance of the Obama). 
But Huntsman will not be heard, because he is stagnating in the depths of public opinion polls. 
Reagan 
Romney had also vowed military strikes against Iran if sanctions fail to talking about halting the nuclear programme. 
"If I am elected, I zones in Iran," he was on hearing. 
"If Obama is re-elected, they will get the bomb." 
In addition, Israel has stepped up military aid promised and Obama accused his partners on commitments to be guilty. 
The businessman Herman Cain, the second most plazierter candidate, in turn, has a shameful unkenntnis display. 
Recently, he called on the Chinese military threat against him, because Beijing is "trying to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to be the fact that China has already been in place since 1964 in possession of military nuclear weapons. 
The Texas Governor Rick Perry, backed by Israel and calls for military action against Iran, for its part, is to be prepared to do so, the American army in Mexico to combat drug cartels in service. 
The Obama 2009 prohibits the use of torture against suspected terrorists was also of Cain, Perry, as well as the Kandidation Michele Bachmann advocates. 
It is a far cry from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a foreign policy heavyweight. 
The current kontrahenten president, Reagan also had simple ideas, and despite all that won the Cold War. 
They recall that Obama is an amateur and had to pay water in his wine, which was the subject anti-terrorist. 
You rightly insist on the failure of his naive Zwiegespräches with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which he also has the reputation of the weakness. 
However, this Anfeindung is not quite so straightforward. 
The population is more positive assessment of the national security under Obama, Bin Laden has switched off. 
Since Iraq they asserted against military intervention, which lead to clog up. 
And Obama surprised more by arguing that America needs to be rebuilt in order to give its leadership to new life. 
Nord Stream, a new gateway for Russian gas in Europe 
The gas pipeline Nord Stream, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and the Western Europe directly links with Russia, has been put into operation. 
It is gas for the equivalent of 30 million households. 
The Russian Gasriese Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with pomp and ceremony. 
More than 500 invited guests, including four Heads of State and Government, last Tuesday on the Baltic coast of Orchesterbeschallung and feinschmecker buffet attended the inauguration of the new gas pipeline Nord Stream, Russia and Germany under the sea links directly with each other. 
The German Chancellor, Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, the French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his counterpart Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolic joint turned the steering wheel of the channel, which the Russian gas transported into the Western European network. 
With the new gas pipeline to 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year through a pipeline from 1 224 kilometers in length, the region St. Petersburg links with Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, will be delivered to Western Europe. 
A second pipeline, which has a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of France's total consumption - is to be completed by the end of 2012. 
And it is already the possibility of the construction of a third route. 
For Gazprom, the timely and accurate completion of this vast edifice as a victory. 
The project was in Poland and the Baltic states strongly disputed. 
The Nord Stream pipeline will provide a direct gas to Germany, avoiding any Trassenverlaufs with third countries (Poland and Ukraine) on the land. 
For this reason, these two countries are losing a little of its power: it is now more difficult for them to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close down access to Western European markets. 
Warsaw, most closely involved in the debate, has not shied away from the North Stream pipeline with a "new deutsch-sowietischen pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939. 
This means that the issue is politically very sensitive. 
Western Europe has the backing of the Russian project won an even greater energy security. 
This, however, cost of starvation of European energy, because the project has caused a rift between Western and Eastern Europeans. 
Russia has managed in barely five years ago, his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries, which have strong Gasverbrauche and whose gas reserves are becoming exhausted. 
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us together in organic way," said François Fillon at the opening of the gas pipeline by pointing out to what extent the big Gasverträge are also important for political and economic side. 
All of this explains the broad smile of the Lubmin many represented Gazprom managers in terms of Gaszuleitung. 
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a prominent technology. 
The underwater pipeline consists of steel and concrete casing, which is intended to protect them from ships berth. 
It rests on the seabed around 200 metres deep. 
Its construction had evaded previous minefields from the Second World War. 
"Some hundreds of mines have had to be removed or destroyed for safety's sake," Jens Müller, spokesman for the company Nord Stream. 
We also had to step up measures taken to protect the fauna and flora. 
The leadership is a long queue of metal, hard as 242 Eiffel towers over the entire length is interrupted by nothing: neither outlets or maintenance stations. 
A monitoring platform was laid off the coast of Sweden, but the project developers have backed away from it, as the Swedes were not eager to a Russian civil society in a permanent way to settle their coasts. 
"In the event of an accident, we are Gasdurchlass in less than a minute," Mr. Müller clarified. 
In the case of a leak, the hole in the gas pipeline gas in the air. 
This case comes from the designers, however, seen as unlikely as the approaches to the consistency of a leak was estimated per 100 000 years. 
The state control of the gas pipeline will be both guaranteed by a Unterwasser-Roboter of external purposes is controlled by a Seeschiff, as well as by a device that circulates in the interior of the pipeline. 
It has the form of a cigar, attaches a metre in diameter, will be introduced into the interior of the pipeline and might move. 
After three full days of the movement by the leadership at a speed of three meters per second, provides the device in his arrival the most accurate information about possible Deformations of the metal. 
The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years, without even the slightest repair. 
The Gaszirkulation is quite simply guaranteed by pressure. 
This is more than 200 cash for access to 100 cash at the exit point. 
Five companies have combined their efforts to implement this project. 
The administration, however, remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares. 
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF affiliated (15,5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French company GDF Suez (9%). 
These five companies have formed a business community that Nord Stream, which is charged with the construction and operation of the pipeline. 
It has its headquarters in train in Switzerland, where the tax system is particularly favourable. 
Gazprom then this society has rented the entire capacity of its Gastransportes and renewable 20 year contract. 
"Gazprom will pay for the overall capacity, no matter how large the real volume may be transported," clarified Mr. Müller. 
The financing of the baus gas pipeline was 30% of shareholders, as well as 70% backed by bank loans. 
The total labour costs should be 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines. 
For GDF Suez, the total investment, for example, 240 million. 
However, the minority shareholders are likely to recoup their expenses, since Gazprom alone bears the liability risk. 
The gas pipeline is a gritty, Kiefers forested coastal strip in Lubmin from the Baltic Sea. 
The 4.5 metres high values are the Gasaustrittspforte. 
Sensors to measure pressure, temperature and other indicators of the arriving gas before it is forwarded to the German gas pipelines. 
Since last Tuesday, this terminal with one million cubic metres of Russian gas supplies per hour. 
This would be in full capacity of 3 million cubic metres per hour, as well as 6 million in 2012. 
Moleskine, a notiz marker. 
From an Italian company about 15 years ago created Moleskine would now back a new style to the letter. 
It has a flair for adventure, candlelight with the letter came hours. 
The notiz book of Moleskine is easily recognizable, with his black square cover, his elastic, eierschalfarbenen sides, such as aged over time. 
The Moleskine notiz book, as it is known today, however, has been created in 1997. 
The Italian company Modo Modo, which has its headquarters in Milan, decided at that time, a distinguiert designer notiz book on the market. 
Maria Sebregondi, then special adviser to the company, is charged with the roll-out of the new product. 
The notiz book was a traditional production technology, called the Mole inspired (mole skin) start, which describes a Baumwollack, for example, will be used for a salary of Polsterbänken. 
This kind of notiz book was among writers and travellers. 
"Moleskine has an old and almost forgotten subject to revive until the twentieth century avantgardistischer artist was regarded as a legend," explained Maria Sebregondi, now a brand coordinator at Modo Modo. 
The success is one. 
Between 2006 and 2010, sales will increase by 26% and establish itself with a paragraph of 12.7 million piece. 
This is a far cry from the usual production in the first few years, in which only 3 000 notiz books were conceived. 
Moleskine is the Italian border and will be carried out in 70 countries, from France to the United States. 
It is difficult to prepare a phantom image of the buyer, as the notiz book as well as businesspeople as well as students and professionals. 
Moleskine is the image more cosmopolitan, cultured and intellectual customers. 
The small Italian company, which in its early days was among 12 workers, now employs more than 100 employees and has been in place since 2008 on two offices; one in Milan, the other in New York. 
The company sells its notebooks in bookstores and on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small Boutiques of city centres and to impose its identity. 
"We have the spirit and followed his new desk needs, despite the recovery of the e-mails," said Maria Sebregondi. 
This cultural trait which is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: recently, the brand exposure called "Detour (route) ," in which architects and artists their own notebooks. 
In August, the company at the Locarno Film Festival is also a cover with leopard models on the market. 
Moleskine benefited from his success and the cultural Zeitgeist and common sense to diversify its products: bags, diary, pen, computer... the brand, the whole range of articles. 
A success, there are some begrudgers brings to the plan: in the autumn of 2006, Modo was Modo from the investment fund SG Capital Europe, bought the current Syntegra Capital, and suggested that a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskine. 
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers at such a high level? 
Roughly 19% of disabled people are searching for a job. 
Today begins the 15th week of work for the disabled." 
In spite of an ambitious public policy, which was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people has always been twice as high as the average value: 19% Arbeitlosigkeit 9% of the total population. 
Entmutigend? 
"No, said Éric Blanchet, director-general of the Association of Adapt" week of work for the disabled. " 
"The fifteen years of progress are substantial." 
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times as high." 
"Nevertheless, a great deal still remains to be done." 
It must be said, however, that many obstacles remain for disabled people remain before they get a job. 
More often, it affects the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average). 
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have a baccalaureate, and there are only 10 000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students in higher education. 
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% of the disabled people, compared with 38% of the total average. 
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult for a new job, and the "heart of the problem," Christian Grapin, director-general of Tremplin, an association in 1992 founded the company helps recruit disabled workers. 
So much for the factual checks. 
If the underlying implication, mentalities, certainly, but slowly develop. 
In April, from the Association of IMS-Entreprendre for the magazine La cite survey, which polled managers have "a weak level of knowledge about the disabled," the "overrepresented" was "of people in rolling chairs, mental or intellectual bemittelten." 
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which was enshrined in an Act of 1987. 
The latter, from the 2008 figures point to a ratio of 2,6%. 
"We are now at about 3%," said Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the organisation, which is tasked with recovering contributions from companies that flout the law. 
The proof is that the number of "charges" plants, as well as the amount of paid sums between 2007 and 2011 has been reduced, and numbers from 59 000 to 46 000 (and 606 to 480 million euros). 
"The Act of 2005, which provides for tax increases, has created a strong pressure on the company, said Pierre Blanc." 
"But this improvement is also a real awareness, especially among the large corporate groups." 
According to the ministry for work only 59% of sites between 20 and 49 employees disabled workers, companies with 100 to 199 employees against 82%. 
Hazard: "What a happiness" 
Even before the " Blauen Dienstagabenden (20:45), Eden hazard and Georges Leekens fun, friendship, not hidden. 
It would be too far to say that there have been a secret agreement between them, but the picture is symbolic ties. 
Side by side on the podium of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden hazard would have been good and happy to be able to make peace. 
Five months after the boisterous gesture of his Angriffsspielers against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had nothing but praise on his person. 
"I am very satisfied with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian." 
"I would like to look forward," he assures the native Liller. 
As far as the contrast between his presentation at the club and Nationalelf "it is an entity that justifies everything." 
"In Lille, I am over the whole year, which is not the case in Belgium." 
"It is time for me to go to the start." 
Hazard will come to St denis on Friday night against Romania in the match against France, in order to shine at last '." 
Without the note of the "Vergnügens." 
The French national team he fires since the age of 7 years, led his victorious campaigns thus between 1998 and 2000. 
"I have always supported," he confirmed. 
This inevitably contributes to the "unique" nature of the meeting to increase even more. 
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil Rami) will be in the process," he said. 
"We have just gone on the road." 
"Playing against them can mean a great deal of luck!" 
Leekens, with "pride" goodwill. 
"The pride," a gala game. 
"Pride" - in his capacity as "neighbours" - to confirm that France "once a team is at a very high level," and little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna. 
"Laurent Blanc has damned good job," he said enthusiastically. 
Although Belgium is missing in the next European Cup, the technician looks very much the plane with the Blaues (the French Nationalelf) share... and Brazil in 2014. 
"We small Belgians come out great," he said. 
"We are planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they are hungry." 
"You will note that in the upcoming Olympic Games." the game against France. 
Portugal is very confident 
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward with great optimism about the return game against Bosnia (22:00) Tuesday in Lisbon. 
The Hinspiel had two teams lacked the objectivity. 
"At the end of this 90 minutes, we will have a happy team and, above all, be a happy country." 
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine. 
For him, there is not the slightest hint of doubt that "La Selecçao," his Nationalelf, for which he is responsible for September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship. 
For Portugal, which means only 90 minutes in the Beatitudes. 
But there is a match to play, and a abzuservieren opponent, and Bosnia. 
In view of the Hinspiel (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems clear that the die has not yet been taken. 
Portugal dominated for more than an hour clear the game, but the team was not able to cause the important mark, which would have taken the pressure off her. 
"This is a good result, but there is a certain amount of risk, because we have made no Auswärtstor." 
Back home, however, in her bright erstrahlend Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced, before an audience, which also is likely to be hot in the game, even though the game, of course, was announced as a "very tight," said the optimistic, but lucid Bento. 
"We expect a very close match, but we are fully convinced, to be able to gain the upper hand," said the 42 year-old Portuguese coach. 
"We continue to have a 50% chance in the Euro 2012 to be" watered down, however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz. 
The draw on Friday in Bosnia is forcing the Portuguese to reach a goal and win. 
A draw is the Bosnians, who is also a gateway, has already been enough. 
"This is a good result, but there is a certain amount of risk, because we have made no Auswärtstor," Bento regrets. 
"We will be able to compete against a team which has great technical qualities and possesses players with many individual qualities," he added. 
As has already been in Zenica, the Portuguese have already started to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians, "they have no time for reflection." 
A good idea, under the condition that it will be implemented this time.
